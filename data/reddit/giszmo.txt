I'd like to add that some sort of rendez-vous point is always needed but it doesn't mean that this rendez-vous point needs to learn anything. It could just be a register of tor hidden services that are willing to shuffle. From that point on, participants can talk to each other in an anonymous way.

Not too fast.
* Mycelium's coinshuffle is not a product yet. It only achieved a major milestone on the way to a product.
* Joinmarket might use coin shuffle at some point, allowing you to dictate the output value of a round, in exchange for some fees to makers. This would be highly desirable, as the current version of Joinmarket holds no strong mixing assumptions for the makers at all, assuming the taker might be an attacker.
* At Mycelium we currently imagine a product where coins get prepared through shuffling rounds rather than doing actual payments with shuffling. Joinmarket allows the latter.

In the Mycelium team talks go in the direction of having privacy-aware accounts, where the mixing of the coins is known to and guaranteed by the wallet. We agree that in order to pay your $23 item you would have to incentivize others to join your $23 shuffle now.
We might offer that, too but maybe not as some yield generator but rather as some "free background shuffling" where the one who wants to shuffle exact amounts now pays the mining fees for all. But it's still a long way to get to these details. And hopefully we can combine our liquidity with JoinMarket.

You do realize that companies have deals with Chainalysis and they probably can follow accounts through some things like shapeshift.
I imagine contracts with Chainalysis like this:
* get money for reporting addresses you can put a name on
* get money for reporting addresses that are seamingly unrelated. Alt coins bought with bitcoin for example, but also gambling payouts won after depositing coins.
* pay for legal risk analysis (per address)
* pay for insights, maybe processing fees and only with a court order
\ would certainly be a way for shapeshift to both get some minor revenue but also to repel people who want to abuse it for mixing.

Thanks but we are not there yet. We are designing first modules these days and will publish an API within weeks or maybe months. With that, it will be possible to outsource module development in the sense that we can very comfortably say which module can and can't do sensitive stuff which opens the door to integrate modules from less trusted sources as the module could either not do anything anyway or the potential harm would be limited to users that explicitly trust that module.
We currently don't have payment channels on our radar but if [streamium]( for example wanted to integrate with us, we would be able to do that with minimal effort on our side and they support payment channels.

Oh, I'm tempted to paste the article here, with a dozen links to back the claims but for a start, the very first sentence "There’s been no official statements as of yet – but it looks like the Mycelium Wallet will be getting built-in peer-to-peer bitcoin mixing/tumbling later this year." [is not well researched]( In general, when news-outlets ask us, we share our plans. Just ask or mail us at info Interviews are possible. Proof-reading is definitely very likely to be done on rather short notice.
Anyway. Mycelium funded the implementation of [Coinshuffle]( and is actively working on it. It's open source and called [Shufflepuff](
I'm skeptical we will have it integrated in our wallet this year. It's not impossible and if you guys help with Shufflepuff, it's certainly going faster but we are busy with a major re-work of the wallet without Coinshuffle integration already. And as you can see on [the road-map]( it's not the first thing we hope to deliver.
@_date: 2016-08-22 15:52:03
Transactions are currently pretty much traceable but we can hope to change that. Apart from that, it's possible with Bitcoin to get plausible deniability through coinjoin, which makes it hard for outside bullies to force you to give up coins you can claim to not have. Also, a bully knowing you have them might be enough to take them if they were in the form of cash in your car or in some poorly documented bank account. With Bitcoin the bully has to convince you to give up your keys and you have a million ways to not comply. Decoy wallets that open on the wrong password? Forgetting the password over all that stress? Deadman switch where the wallet empties before you can enter the password? Try that with banks or cash.

I'm surprised so many in here call for government to fix this. Isn't it much more interesting to analyze how Onecoin achieved this remarkable followship? For all those people in that room that probably paid hundreds of $$ each to get enlightened, Onecoin is no different than Bitcoin and they will follow it blindfolded to the bitter end.
This is magic to me. We sit here and laugh how stupid they are and certainly there is a very similar subset of people on both sides, laughing at the other side for being so stupid to trust in some highly volatile/blockchainless shitcoin, believing they are on the right side but not having the tools to judge for themselves. And if I tell I studied math and work in Bitcoin, this subset will still just nod and feel reassured that bitcoin is the right thing like Onecoiners who trust "Dr Ruja".
Now one could hope for some scam artists to come to the bright side and take money for educating masses on Bitcoin but the threat is that a much bigger demographic that would fall for Onecoin (just as easily as for Bitcoin) will call for governments to step in against those scams and then the tide is against us as much as against Onecoin.
Therefore, please help your friends and relatives defend against the Onecoin scam but please stop calling for government to arrest Onecoin promoters. This can seriously backfire.

If Bitfinex advertises to be protected by BitGo and BitGo claims that their system worked as designed then Bitfinex' advertisement was at least misleading and "protected by BitGo" should count as no protection at all. Not sure if BitGo wants to be recognized that way or maybe refuse to give their name to clients that opt out of all the security that they certainly can provide.

Problem with mixing is that if only the really problematic funds enter the mixing pool, exchanges and merchants can argue well to block anything out of mixing and coin-join is very obvious mixing. I heard that exchanges already block funds from mixing and if mixing is not the default, black-listing will be the default at some point. We can't know if we are still able to turn the tide but with shuffling being an advanced feature the user has to confirm three disclaimers to actually use, we will not get the volume to plausibly claim that "dirty" coins are a small minority. I very much lean towards a model where shuffling is opt-out or with the update to present our users with a pop-up that reads something like

It is **not** about the really good news of a certain demographic that we all agree would be most in need to adopt bitcoin. It's about the totally out of context exaggeration implied in the headline.
For starters, the graph looks much better in VEF than in BTC and to add to that, if you adjust for global adoption of localbitcoins, you get no significant event in Venezuela at all. To name a **country**  as an entity that **flocks** to Bitcoin **!** is just totally overblown. If any country flocks to Bitcoin!, you will get new ATHs.
Why not a headline "Bitcoin seams to gain traction in Venezuela"?

It's more a natural thing to make the wallet modular. If it's modular, each module can provide a special layer of protection from what's happening in the rest of the app. And while we are at it, opening up to alts is a safe option.

Sure the 3kBTC make a dent in LBS' 40kBTC volume.
@_date: 2016-08-30 12:48:21
On many occasions I urged LB to not take a %% cut of transactions where they are not needed for fraud prevention. They may charge a fee for showing the ads when it comes to face-to-face or no fee at all as it's just such a small part of the platform and without fees they could at least get a better picture of the actual volume.
And there is good reasons already to not go through LB. I assume they work with Chainalysis to break Bitcoin's fungibility and only undocumented trades can help restore it a bit. Without fungibility, Bitcoin is a failed experiment.
On my first trade with people they usually have no clue about bitcoin and suggesting to close the deal off-LB is awkward but every single time I did significant volume with one of them later on, it did not go through LB and I barely see a reason to go through them even if there was no fee. And on the first trade I strictly limit the volume to &lt;$300 to not get mugged.

Sorry but I would strongly urge people not to use software that was compiled by some anonymous dude, even if that dude was SN himself. The beauty of Bitcoin Core is that it is open source and can be distributed by people that put their name on it by signing it even though they are not the original author. Same would go with darkwallet: Don't install the binary if nobody vouches for it. If it's open source, maybe somebody wants to vouch for it regardless of not being the original author.

Interesting. When I read the headline I thought "Wow. Brilliant! So they use the public key of the address the victim has to pay to to derive the key that encrypts the device?" But the first sentence of the article:


Sounds more like `OP_RETURN`. How boring. Is that because of address re-use?
Using my first guess would stick out less on the blockchain. As a ransom taker you don't want all your coins be branded as coming from ransom ware but if address re-use is inevitable, it's probably more flexible this way.

I would agree that multisig is more secure than cold storage if done right but then again there is nothing inherently bad about combining both. If Bitfinex has some 80% of their funds that they usually don't touch in months, with only bank-run like situations making touching it necessary, then they could have these funds in multisig cold storage, too. Something where actual real people have to move physical items out of steel boxes to fuel the hot wallet.

Ok, so to recap, your "send all funds" transaction would have cost you £20+, you didn't do it at the time but later you did, again with "send all" and it was a lower fee. You did determine the exact size based on the second transaction.

Again, we will not implement the plugin but we will allow it and integrate with it.

While at Mycelium we are planning to provide a fully symmetric version where the participants get helped to find each other for free and each pays their share of the mining fee, there is nothing inherently blocking people from offering a different approach where users have to pay to find others or where people have to pay to be allowed to dictate certain aspects of the shuffle round. For example it would be desirable to use shuffling for payment transactions but as long as there are no five others that want to pay 3.54654mBTC right now, I'm out of luck or pay them to shuffle exactly this amount exactly now.

I agree with you but in order to keep those locked into total obedience at bay, we have to be a bit careful in how we spin the story.

permissioned ledger. no mining. if they agree to issue a trillion more, it's a done deal. if you run the official client, you will also be able to verify they issued the new trillion with good signatures by the participating banks.
Edit: I'm as much a bitcoin-purist as one can be but 50 banks that don't trust each-other's book keeping could solve some problems by running a permissioned ledger like this. It would prevent banks from scamming each-other but they would still scam us in a way we hope to prevent with Bitcoin.

Hm, payment channels are around since years and there is approximately 2.5 applications that use them.

With the paper proposed here (I only read the first lines) you could have that standardized and use a channel-aware wallet for different server applications, right?

No solid info but on each corridor there is a preferred direction. Bitcoins are much cheaper in China than in Chile, which is why sending value from China to Chile can actually cost you minus 5% or "be free" when using bitcoin but in the other direction it will be at least 10%.
I assume the Brazil-Hongkong corridor is equally balanced, with cheaper bitcoins in Hongkong than in Brazil, so better skip using Bitcoin if your margins are low. You also don't do the Bitcoin communities a great service by shoving coins upstream.

Without looking into that one, any filtering is doomed to fail. If you are interested in **only** 50% of all addresses, regardless of how you communicate your filter, the other party can follow your wallet's transactions but to make filtering worthwhile you would want to filter out 99.9%.
For privacy, you will have to avoid filtering and the best way to do so is to talk to a trusted node. We will have to provide this option of a configurable full node anyway.

Daniel checked our fee estimation history and indeed found some isolated spikes across all our servers that do nothing but ask the standard bitcoind for its fee estimations.

Alternatively we might add some alert pop-up if the fee is high. Suggestions welcome.

On a mobile client, downloading the full blockchain is not an option. Well, maybe somebody builds a module for that, so you can opt in but I doubt that we will put effort into full blockchain downloads. A trusted proxy (your RPi/server/our server/coinbase's server/...) is probably more realistic.
Also I personally would rather have privacy than full transaction history on my mobile client. If I could query the UTXO set (signed off by miners/with miner commitment) I would be happy. After all, if I keep track of UTXOs and when I spend them, I should have all the history anyway.
Edit: We want to use meta storage, where all meta data is stored in the cloud (storJ/maidsafe/whatever) so you can replicate such history data across devices..

Also have a question: Why on earth should browsers be allowed to scan localhost at all, when on an external website. Sure, some products work as a website on localhost:port and those should have access but wouldn't it make sense to by default not allow cors in this way? It's also a privacy issue. I wouldn't want random websites to know that I'm running mldonkey or whatever else that works like this.

You are celebrating the fact that Donald Trump is warming up the printing press, in retaliation for other countries having done so before because you measure your Bitcoins and your success in USD.
For me, success would be if the world would take notice of Bitcoin's value proposition of non-inflationary money and countries would try to compete with Bitcoin's stability.
Seeing your enemy crash and burn might be satisfying but the world around you is not ready to be unplugged yet (or was it Bitcoin that's not ready to plug them all in at once?). For the world to run on bitcoin, the best that could possibly happen would be if central banks would buy bitcoins (and other commodities) until the money supply in their currency is worth about their holdings and they declare a backing in these commodities, so regular people would keep using national currency for a transitional phase.
(Yes, if you are resentful and want central bankers to go bankrupt instead of getting to administer huge portfolios of national currency backings, you might disagree but for the good of society I don't see why all countries playing the Zimbabwe/Venezuela card would be good for anybody. Economy is not a zero sum game.)

Dead man switch is a technical term for something that requires a sign of life to prevent an automatism. Trains have these. If the red light goes on on the driver's panel, the driver has to press the button to confirm he's still in control. If he fails to do so, he's "dead" as a driver and the train stops. He might not actually be dead. Maybe he just fell asleep. It's still a dead man switch.

Nope. I would anticipate on-chain fees to get worse, not better really quickly. While we now have a 300k transactions per day limit, with lightning we will have a 300k new users per day limit - if we all switch to lightning and stop using on-chain transactions else. If not, it's probably more a 100k new users per day limit.
We want to on-board 7 billion people and their fridges. Depending on hype cycles, we might get much higher demand than 300k/day. Just check out how [Android had 1.3 million activations per day in 2012]( Those are physical objects that need to be produced and shipped to all corners of the world. Thanks to this mobile revolution, we now have the breeding grounds to get new apps to tens of millions of users per day and for most end users, Bitcoin is just that: an app.

The MS open source license. It doesn't give you all the freedoms that OSI would want to call it FOSS.
You can build your own and run it with our servers or you can roll your own electrumx for different privacy though. When it comes to security, Mycelium is as open source as it should be. With verifiable builds, which to my knowledge no other big Android wallet is providing and I'm baffled as to how little users care about that detail: if xWallet has a repo and some open source code there under a permissive (OSI) license, it is **not** more secure than Mycelium if you cannot verify that the apk you get from the play store matches the code on github.

Story writing doesn't work that way, so I don't expect much to come from it. That said, I don't think it's necessary a failed project. It just needs the incentives right.
So people love telling stories but usually are not very good at it. The first sentence as an anchor that gets people hooked to help develop a story line is too little and people tend to rather start their own stories than to be second place in somebody else's story-start.
So how about letting people tell actual full stories? Many pages long stories? So once we have kind of nice stories established, let others enjoy reading them and make modifications if necessary. Voting could now happen on those stories and modifications. Nothing round-based. Forget about people being in the same place at fixed time intervals. Charge per letter of original story or story change submissions and use votes to decide which line to present to the reader as the story.

I'm pretty sure the begging for upvotes instead of stating a meaningful topic is against rules in this sub but so be it. It's front page news.
Apparently Copay users are given the same insane tools that we gave our users at Mycelium to totally underpay on your transaction and now some are surprised by the consequences. So you paid "0.0002 sat/byte"? This is clearly not going to work whenever mempools are evicting transactions as that is for all intents and purposes a zero fee transaction. Full nodes by default do not relay transactions that pay less than 1sat/B and at Mycelium we robbed our users of the possibility to go below 3sat/B for exactly that reason. I say "robbed" as of course users were complaining and had examples of transactions that went through with 1 sat/B and often do I hear of people that think they are experts just because they used a wallet for years but sorry, if you paid "0.0002 sat/byte" or 2sat/B, it is no surprise it disappears from the network if it doesn't get stuck on its way to the recipient to begin with.
So I'm with and the BitPay support team on this. Don't over-blow the issue. Either there was a transaction or there wasn't between you and your brother. Unless the transaction didn't go to some third address neither of you controls, there is nothing to get people panicked about their copay wallets.
Copay is probably one of the safest wallets out there if you use the multi signature feature and BitPay for years was providing top notch open source code in their bitcoin library for JS bitcore. I used to present their wallet along with Mycelium and others to newbies that I introduced to Bitcoin and only stopped recommending Copay for their support of SegWit2x. (I show other wallets than Mycelium to make a point of Bitcoin not being a product by "my company" but usually end up having people install Mycelium as it allows to get ready to receive coins within seconds.)
Edit: Had confused OP with CoPay support guy.

Sorry if I offended you. My assumption was that an RV lot is only half the solution, as you would still need an RV to benefit from it, so without an RV you would still not be able to do much with the RV lot other than OP's purpose of using the included mail box. No idea if cheap RV lots come with any sanitary facilities at all but most certainly they don't come with any storage capacity or physical protection to property on your lot if you have no RV.
Sure, if you have an RV or the means to get one, things look differently and I totally support the approach of not leaving vacant the RV lot for only having a private address, while others could derive much more value from it, at no cost to the renter.

* if possible, start small. an amount you are comfortable to lose to gain trust. then get bigger. $500, %1200, $5000 and then the rest
* show the cash, let them count some bills at a time but don't hand them all over yet. give them your bitcoin address.
* wait for one confirmation (not more, as others suggested. one is good unless you are buying at least more than a block reward worth of bitcoin ($80k) or hundreds of bitcoins if you are not that paranoid
* don't go alone. you hand over cash and want somebody to see what went on.
* don't carry the private key to the bitcoin address with you. check with some block explorer or watch-only account if there was a transaction confirmed. this way you can get out of there without worrying about somebody stealing your bitcoins after the transaction.
* make sure to not get robbed on the way to the meeting. the guy knows you are walking around with 25k on you, so he better not know how you look before you are inside the bank.
* if the deal turns bad, don't walk out with 25k on you. deposit the money in the bank right away. making deals turn bad can easily be a maneuver to get you walk into a trap.

With OZcoin, ZeroCash, Confidential Transactions and Monero, most mention altcoins or side chains. Yes, these can provide financial privacy for bitcoin users by going through them. Once sidechains work, this can even happen without third party risk. Also some of these solutions have some remote chance of making their way into Bitcoin but for the here and now they solve little. Especially they don't provide fungibility.
Every user on his own can achieve some degree of financial privacy by using these or mixers (and join market for example provides quite strong privacy, while not putting coins at risk) but that is not the same as fungibility. As long as only some 1% of all people care about their privacy, the other 99% can start to accept that coins that can't be tracked are illegal/shady/worth less and that's where fungibility is broken.
If people distinguish Satoshi-coins from Silkroad-coins from US-Marshals'-coins then we have a huge problem. This is what fungibility is about and this is why mixing (or other fungibility solutions) should not be an option but a desired feature used by everybody.

Yes, I see a problem with that, too. A Merkle root is not an invertable Bloom filter. You can't derive anything from the Merkle root unless you know the branch leading to the transaction. In Bitcoin the Merkle root works as follows:
* take all odd transactions and their even neighbors and dhash their IDs. `sha256(sha256(tx[2*i].id+tx[2*i+1].id))` for example.
* If the last transaction is odd, take dhash of IDn+IDn
* repeat the process with now half as many entries until you have just one hash. This is your Merkle root.
Still, as a recipient, seeing any double-spend regardless of it being in a block or not can trigger me to hold my horses until a block confirms the transaction. And as the peers can't invent transactions spending other people's money, I should be able to trust this warning.

That is misunderstanding the proposal though. suggests to allow spending all fees + block reward in the coinbase transaction as always but with a requirement to pay a progressive amount into a new pool.
Then the pool could be spent from 1% at a time in the coinbase transaction, too.
This pool could preserve all unspent fees and rewards, too. This pool could also shave off fees beyond a certain value or as you might have suggested, all fees flat but that's not subject of this proposal.

So much this. Just because most people would currently fail at owning bitcoins doesn't turn "not owning bitcoins" into "owning bitcoins".

The initial funding transaction is certainly a usability issue. How to explain to a user that he should lock up $100 if he wants to buy a $0.04 phone call? How to guess how much he should lock up? In that aspect they will certainly differ.
Some might give you some TOS and an automatic credit at a low rate to open a channel to them as the entry node when you first receive coins, while others will ask you to set things up manually, allowing you to configure your own server as entry node.
After that, assuming you have a channel open, things will be pretty much as they are now but payments will go over something like the payment protocol and not over addresses starting with a "1" or "3". Transactions will be instant, with confirmations being a thing of the past.

@_date: 2015-06-04 00:38:09
Without artificial restrictions, fees should approach to what it costs to store a transaction massively redundantly for all future. I doubt we have a good concept of that and thus miners "selflessly" put said burden on future miners by accepting free transactions to drive adoption of bitcoin. Also because the fee being grabbed only by the one who adds it to the chain does not reflect the long-term burden that he accepts for future miners.
I guess this early sin should be limited and I believe in some years it will be considered ridiculous to have free transactions on the main blockchain … or the blockchain will be run by otherwise subsidized institutions that rob the money it costs to do so with guns (nation states and their business banksters).

You could even turn this into a product where people pay for the initial free month, too. People may subscribe with what they need and you offer them some kickstarter-style application. They explain what kind of server they need, maybe from a list of your offers. ("We need a cluster of 12 single CPU machines … in the same subnet for a 3 months experiment …") maybe with same charts and drawings. Now others can tip towards those projects, with a return address. If the cost of your server is met or if you feel lucky and accept the lower price, you start their server. If you ultimately decide to not run this (shady?) project, people get their money back.
Projects running out, get the option to apply for an extension kickstarter style, with the server getting shut down if no follow-up funding is provided.

The polygons you draw on mouse over confused me, as they intersected for neighboring clusters.
While it was educational to me to learn that clusters are not exclusive, it still confused me and I though of how to better draw it to be less confusing and my idea would be to draw the map's borders once zoomed in on that cluster, so it would always be rectangles.
That would also solve another issue with the current approach: multiple nodes in almost the same spot don't span.

OPs informal chat would definitely count as part of a legal agreement at least in Germany. Here in Chile people are a bit crazy about signing the slightest of a contract at the office of a notary, with 12 signatures and 15 finger prints, so I guess it's different here. But in Germany if it can be established that in fact A told B that XY is the truth and now B enters a commitment then that is a binding contract and if XY is a lie then A scammed B into its commitment regardless of a written contract existing or not. Enforceability depends on it somehow being written or recorded but even if it's just two guys on a phone it's a binding contract.

Which is great to keep up the illusion that unconfirmed transactions were safe but it doesn't cover all cases.

The consensus is so hard because the simple solution to just increase the block size is so logical to all the non-devs.
So at 20MB and 100MB and 1000MB we will still not be able to fuel the internet of things with billions of transactions per second. There is never enough but at some point you will have only one entity that will keep the ledger for us and that was not Satoshi's vision or what we signed up for. People want to know where is the limit as there has to be a limit and people are not agreeing on where that limit should be.

@_date: 2015-06-10 04:31:22
Agreed. But the current 20MB totally ignores what will come next. If it was 20MB for all time, I would say hell no! We need bigger blocks eventually. If it's 20MB next year and 40MB the year after, then I will regret to have fought so little against 20MB.
This is why I want a longer perspective. Some growth to 100MB or 200MB blocks over the next 20 years but with exponential growth starting with an initial increase to 2MB, not 20MB.
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:42:58
So how exactly is 20mb less dumb than 1mb if dossing just costs $100 instead of $4? Or do you suggest to allow unlimited block sizes?

Ok, so the headers with the Merkle roots are on (my two) pruning nodes but how can the node know if the transaction is in the Merkle root and not spent in a later one? A Merkle root is the dhash of a dhash … of many transaction IDs. I can't pin it without having all the blocks with all the transactions.

I agree with their analysis but doubt the results. People run tor nodes without compensation and on the long run, miners will never make money from mining. Mining will be done by people and organizations with stake in bitcoin and they will do it at a loss. And that's ok.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:42:27
Yes, this sounds sooo weird to me, too. I often suggested to avoid uneven behavior and don't like the reward halfening but timestamp in the way as it was suggested by the the BIP bears the risk that miners exploit the maximum allowed timestamp to squeeze in just one more transaction and then you will have a run-away timestamp with the timestamp loosing it's property of being one - and maybe the maximum block size coming faster than expected.
Sure, at first, individual nodes would not recognize these futuristic blocks but miners would still refuse to go back in time and with the time constantly being off, nodes would relax the requirement for the timestamp – real time connection.

The blocksize debate is about picking winners and losers in a multi billion dollar ecosystem. No surprise it's heated.
Those with the biggest stakes in the game are those who provide solutions to the scalability problem, most prominently straw-pay (they were never vocal at all) and blockstream (they in turn are very vocal and with half the core dev team also quite strong).
I guess it is without question that scaling the blockchain will not fuel the internet of things billions of transactions per second and neither the morning-coffee billions of transactions per day, so these scalability solutions are needed either way. They are just not here yet, so we need to bridge the gap that's approaching and some start playing dirty.
Blockstream's solution would also solve the unconfirmed-transactions-are-not-secure problem and Peter Todd just shared on twitter how 21% of the miners now support double-spending if only the fee is slightly higher.
Well, I could go on forever and doubt anybody can do justice to the topic in a simple infographic.

In Bitcoin, the only reliable time you have is the block time. If I want to replace transaction A1 with A2, I will double-swear I had it laying around an hour and you couldn't proof otherwise.
Also RBF is not only about stuck transactions. It's about avoiding transaction chaining, too, where an exchange for example wants to pay out to many people with one transaction per block.

LN does require a recipient to actively receive but this can safely be delegated I think.

WTH? This chart doesn't mean what you think it does.
Yes, bitcoin achieved scaling improvements, mainly thanks to segwit but also due to increased transaction batching. So if we were to draw a chart of the maximum transaction capacity based on the percentage of segwit and batching of the respective days, the chart would go from x tx_per_day in November last year to maybe 1.4 x tx_per_day now.
Your chart above would increase for every day the demand was above that line and decrease if it was below but it doesn't tell you how far below, once your chart hits zero, thus you cannot read from this chart that there was any growth in transaction demand.
You can speculate that demand was driven to lightning, which it wasn't: lightning is very tiny still, when it comes to supporting economic activity. (Yes, down-vote me for saying so but please consider that I love lighting and even run [my own lapp]( You can discuss the spiking demand's spammy nature (which I totally agree, based on long chains of sending coins back and forth) but the picture you shared by itself could also mean that nobody does bitcoin anymore and those tiny fluctuations were bag holders sending coins back and forth in a desperate attempt to fake volume. After all it's almost free to do so these days.

When I was in Panama in February I couldn't find a person to trade bitcoins. Not at the "bitcoin embassy", not on Mycelium Local Trader and not on localbitcoins. I managed to eat expensive burgers though.
Sharing this as some people make you believe that Panama is Bitcoinlandia which it isn't. Also, Argentina is not Bitcoinlandia. At least it wasn't when I was in Mendoza and 4 of the 5 locations on coinmap didn't accept bitcoin. Therefore, a call-out to the local communities to be more after keeping things up to date.
Else, hope to hear from happy clients that get their local fiat. How's the exchange rate?

I read that one but don't understand it. What does "not have any coins which can be rebroadcast" mean? On every re-org, the miner would refresh his transaction pool and clearly, transactions in the orphaned chain would be the first transactions to enter the pool and checked against the new main chain. Usually most transactions would be in the main chain with the coinbase transactions never being there. So what? What would make these so special compared to any other transaction that might not have been mined by the other miners?
@_date: 2018-08-02 03:41:57
it would be a wild swing. first price would go towards infinity, with the buyer luring more bitcoiners into selling but as soon as one entity had 90% of all coins and that made news, maybe more liquidity would come to the market and drive the price down, in a trend where actually nobody would remain willing to buy at a high price. if now mr. mega whale tried to cash out any significant amount of bitcoin, things would go to zero and bitcoin would be history.

Gnah. Exchanges and pools are those who send the most transactions and thus have the most explaining to do when the recipient doesn't receive as much as expected. I doubt the constant nagging of armchair revolutionaries is what made them adopt batching and SegWit. Also: There was a huge political campaign for SegWit and in comparison almost no noise about batching, yet batching makes much more a difference for actors that send more than one transaction per 10 minutes than SegWit has and thus usually was implemented first despite being more complicated to implement.

I will forward your request to the management.
My personal opinion: I am a Bitcoin maximalist, so the past and future alt-coin ambitions add no value for me, neither. Still many in the community want to claim their "air-drops" from fork coins and many others are less maximalist. With the modularization we've been working on for two years, alt-coins will be added with almost no changes to the core app, which makes it very secure for people that don't bother installing those extensions. My take on SegWit you find on the other comments here. Had we not been working on modularization, I probably would have voted for these features: batching with rbf by default (this has way more potential in reducing fees and doesn't require touching our custom backend code), SegWit, Lightning.

Ok, I see how it is most likely not much different than my model security and one wallet simpler. You win. :)
So my model: Pretty dirty W1 has an allowance of x per day that it signs for the dirty frontend server's many transactions, granted by a pretty secure W2 that has an allowance manually granted by a human from a very secure W3.
Your model: Pretty dirty frontend server gets many transactions granted by a pretty secure W2 that has an allowance manually granted by a human from a very secure W3.

As I don't get your full argument, allow me to go step by step:
A multi-full-node tool could have check-boxes for all the chains. Greedy miners are greedy and will know which coins they eventually can sell at some point and which they don't want to run a full node for. In any case a 100-coins-node would make it way more likely to get people into mining even the last coin of these merge-minable coins in a non-evil way. (The checkboxes could subsequently trigger additional downloads and everything needed to run the respective full node.)
The next part I don't get: 


Attacked for free? Can you elaborate? As I understand merged mining, mining for Bitcoin suddenly is proof of work in the alt chain. To 51%-attack Namecoin which is merge-mined by 70%(?) of all bitcoin miners, you would essentially have to throw 36% of the hashing power of bitcoin into an attack to succeed. With a multi-full-node, chances become high that all alt-coins that have modest demands for full nodes would get their checkbox checked and therefore instantly get huge mining support. How are they "attacked for free"?
Edit: Your criticism is about the two-way-peg. Minute 37 explains that, right? Not convinced yet.


Ok, Zerocoin is no fun to run a full node of as long as they don't get the performance issues straight. So lets assume they choose merged mining and still don't get the support to secure the coin. How would opting against merged mining increase the security of Zerocoin?


With Multi-full-nodes every miner can decide on his personal block-size tolerance and which features of bitcoin to support and which not, as a "block" would suddenly consist of 100 alt coins. I like this idea.

1. Invent bitcoin
2. Make sure you hold 20% of it
3. Make policies such that the inflow to bitcoin doesn't exceed x10 per year.
4. Once your fiat currency reserves value reached parity with your bitcoin reserves, declare your fiat to be backed by bitcoin.
This last 2 steps are important to avoid chaos among all that hold you fiat money. Just declaring fiat worthless would probably bring about lethal disruption.

I checked our install statistics for Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet. Install events for today were dominated by USA, Colombia, **Nigeria**, Brazil, Germany, Canada and Argentina, with Argentina at 1.7% of all new installs today. Sample size is &gt;1k.
[OP's app]( has less than that in total installs (500-1k). Not sure which time span the presented stats encompass. 46.88% is 4688/10000 is 293/625, so I would assume this is all-time stats with a sample size of 625. With other numbers in the sub-1k range it's hard to come up with 46.88%.
At least with this account and on reddit, OP did not pitch it to Venezuela in particular, so I wonder if they did a good adaptation for Spanish speakers or if there was some fan on a bitcoin meetup there ... who knows.
Colombia was not that high in our list 2 years ago neither and spiked at some point and my guess is that some dominant news outlet or exchange recommended to use our wallet.

I guess it is worthwhile to mention that the orphaned block problem highly depends on your connectivity. If block speed was once per week, you could mine on mars with only 1% orphaned blocks (assuming that there is a relay station for when mars and earth are on opposite sides of the sun and assuming that the maximum distance is 22 light minutes). With block speed 1 minute you basically can't mine without loosing 50% of your blocks if you sit in Tibet for example (we had clients in Tibet that were not happy about our 1 minute timeouts as that was basically the average ping for them).

bitcoin operations went out of business since the beginning in 2009. Satoshi's miner went out of business after a year or so. So what? My miner was running off and on for a year, too. (Actually my first miner was running for 3h and I stopped it as it didn't drop 50BTC. Damn.) That's life. In the beginning, you think if it's worth to invest in that hardware. In the end you don't think of the initial investment anymore but keep it running as long as it pays the electricity bill.

While clicking yes does wipe the clipboard, all apps that monitor the clipboard just as Samourai already got the private key. This dialog is there to scare you, as browsing your web wallet and copying your private key may trigger Samourai opening up with this dialog. The idea is to show you how insecure the Android clipboard is, so you only ever once put anything sensitive there. If you want to ignore the warning and actually use the private key from the clipboard, you can press "no" but the harm is done already.
I implemented this feature for Mycelium and the pull request is open since five months. My main concern is that people will kill the messenger for spying on their clipboard but I was also thinking to make this part of the code so generic that it can be added easily to all Bitcoin wallets and be extended by more sensitive data. My code detects Mnemonic sentences, private keys and extended private keys. Not sure about Samourai.

No. Scenario:
Evil (the evil pool®): 100GH (Galactohashes per second) makes 10% profit by paying out 90% of mined block rewards to its miners (ignoring operational costs, merged mining etc).
Good (the good pool®): 20GH makes 10% profit, too.
Now Evil diverts 2GH to Good, finding only shares but no blocks. Good now has 22GH and shares 90% of the rewards found by 20GH (2GH don't contribute) by 22. This means that either miners get 10% less or the pool gets 10% less. Both way Good will not be happy loosing all its profit.
But how does it look from Evil's perspective?
Evil now has 98GH but the 2GH that are mining at Good either earn them 90% (Good takes the 10% losses to keep miners) or 81% (Good keeps its profit at the cost of loosing miners).
Evil thus gets full mining from 98GH and 80% out of the remaining 2GH. It effectively remains at 98GH + 0.8*2GH = 99.6GH or in other words while Good lost its 10% edge, Evil only invested 0.4% to make that happen.
But how would that look like if Good and Evil were both at 100GH?
To cost Good the 10% edge, Evil would have to divert 10GH. Evil would get it compensated for with 81% again. Evil would thus mine with 90GH + 0.8*10GH = 98GH. They would still remain profitable if they had a +2% edge before. Changing the 10% profitability for a 1% profitability would yield similar results.
(Yeah, getwork is evil and this scheme only works with getwork. Unfortunately Good can not protect itself by not using getwork as Evil could use getwork to have his miners work for Good's money, so miners, please don't use getwork. Getwork means signing stuff that you only know the hash of.)

The F2F feature begs for a remote-control feature. Something that allows me not to carry my workstation around. LB already has a release-code feature, where the buyer can come to the trade with only a 6 digit release code that the seller will only see once he released the funds. By revealing the correct code to the buyer he can know the seller must have released the funds, so at least one of the parties is released of the burden to come connected to the trade.

Ok then please enlighten me. How do micropayment channels work? If my coin is not locked by the nlock time condition then how can this scheme be secure?
I spend to a multisig, nlocktime script hash. Now the coins can be spent only if the conditions are met and the scrip is provided but they are in the sh for good if the script and its conditions are never resolved.
with only one sig involved the max priority could overrule the nlocktime? Then fine, lets use an oracle that never provides the second sig after forging the 1 year payout.

He/They implemented it. It's a network rule now. The 1 Satoshi tx from Satoshi Dice were considered spam. Bitcoin took a turn there that I don't support by saying other values associated with transactions are not welcome. Not the messaging in SD, not the stocks in colored coins. Colored coins worked around this but it showed how you better don't build on bitcoin anything but bitcoin. This is why I hope for strong sidechain support should it require any potentially drastic changes. The funny stuff could then happen there.

If ChangeTip used it, they could maintain channels to all their users and I would feel much better about it. Right now they can run with the money at any moment but with channels, they could not. A problem with current style channels is that the receiving side has to be active to receive something, so a server can receive, a client normally not. Also if ChangeTip is the broker here and you tip me $100, you might not want to even trust ChangeTip with $100, so you could send me one $ at a time and send the next, when I confirm having received the last via my channel with ChangeTip (or if I trust them enough, I might go without channel but the point is, you can use protection).

Imbalance in the top pools that each have to have the power to considerably outrun the competing non-selfish miners supporting whatever longest chain they see.
Handing on a part of the loot via the coinbase transaction output is one suggested solution that requires to change the protocol but I guess it should be possible to find alternatives where some big pools cooperate and compensate each other out of bands if ever such an issue would arise.
(Unfortunately taking a transaction that does not depend on the coinbase transaction where the high fee was received to reward a follow-up miner for mining ones block does not work, as this transaction could be included in the competing chain, too.)

Thanks for an actual answer instead of just down-voting like others did.
I think rationality has little relevance in the efficient market hypothesis. Take this criticism from wikipedia:


How does this not directly confirm the theory? As long as there are last mentioned investors who "reason correctly" to profit, they do and move the price contrary to what others think. If nobody "reasons correctly", then the price still represents the best we know about the value of the asset.
Ok, maybe you might bet on falling prices short term even if you see a higher value long term according to the old saying "*Markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you and I can remain solvent.*" but then again, how is the falling price any different than the value? The actor anticipates a falling price because he anticipates that others will value it less in the short term future.
If you ask me what I think the right USD value of BTC is, I would say "infinite" as I think Bitcoin will survive the USD. The current price reflects the probability of this actually happening and it's short- and long term probability of materializing. The current price is the best bet and unless I employ very smart people and figure out even better predictors than other speculators, the current price is the best proxy for the current value. Not for the future value. For the value of now and the very immediate future.

SegWit is a requirement for LN, that is right. An LN module therefore would also use SegWit but just as OP_RETURN being used as a requirement for our coloredcoins support doesn't mean we provide a feature for users to add their custom OP_RETURNS, an LN feature wouldn't mean necessarily that we support receiving to SegWit addresses outside of the LN module. SegWit is a tool for a purpose and the big feature of SegWit is *not* that it uses less space on the base block.

Ok, so why exactly should we add SegWit? Why exactly should we put 4 man months into the required changes in our custom backend and libraries that we plan to deprecate anyway? We are working hard on improvements and features and for the last two years most progress happened behind closed doors but with this current release we hopefully freed up resources for other improvements, including a migration to a faster backend and more functional wallet.
SegWit is a tool for very special purposes and the reduced base block requirement is almost an accident in the whole picture of SegWit, yet all that users get hung up about is the reduced fees. Why else would you want SegWit? We will provide Lightning Network which requires SegWit as a building block but SegWit alone is totally overrated. Fees are low now and hopefully we provide SegWit before they rise again but as a Bitcoin enthusiast I find it very annoying that SegWit support alone is such a big selling point to many in the community.

I personally see SegWit most urgently for our hardware wallet support and otherwise see much more pressing improvements. By my estimate, we will probably have a lightning module before we have SegWit in the core app, which would probably rather come in form of a Bitcoin module (integrated into the core app) at which point we could remove a lot of legacy code. Also the hardware wallet integration might move into a module with SegWit support.
In the immediate future I see these things being worked on:
* performance of the modularized app.
* fixing bugs
* remove module-specific stuff from the core app, making it easier to integrate new modules. The Dash team contributed a lot in that aspect and so far I had far too little time to merge their PRs, as we were pushing for our initial modularization release.
* the next 3 modules are already under development. Dash was already announced. The other two I think are not yet announced.

Gnah, please, off-chain transactions is more than just "banks" like changetip and coinbase. I feel like explaining bitcoin to hairdressers when preaching [micropayment channels]( to bitcoiners and over and over again the answer is insults and ignorance.
Micropayment channels if used by changetip could allow you to keep the money out of chantetips control for most of the time. Tipping would mean updating a channel with changetip and changetip updating one with the recipient if the recipient uses micropayment channels, too. It does not yet exist. Not even the one to one version where you pay a subscription in increments but it is totally doable and will be done if the incentives are right. This is why I am against an increase in block size.

If the biggest pool can successfully drive all competition out of the market, it can change bitcoin on its own terms. Any pool (that has no effective defense against that type of attack) would be doomed to pay shares to the big pool.
Imagine Evil has 100% market share and convinced miners to be happy with only 80% of the profits. Evil would have the war chest full for any new pool and having a monopoly it would even be able to dictate a margin of 90%/miner profit of 10% as it could reduce the profit of any competing pool miner to 1%.
Who would want to mine for such an evil pool? Nobody? Well, if there are 20 pools to choose from, you wouldn't even know that they are all the same cartel, each one of them complaining about the evil cartel formed by the others, that is stealing them 99% of their profit.

ok, so now that we are almost on the same page, … :)


So is bitcoin. Your wallet luckily shields you of all those technicalities, so you don't have to know about double sha256 and ripemd. Wallets could use existing implementations of channels, like via. bitcoinj.


Could you elaborate a) why it's not trustless and b) why you think that anything manual could not be automated in the process?


They are real as far as the sender can't reverse them. Granted, in the 2-player-scenario, the recipient can't spend them right away but extended to a mesh network, he could. The problem is that the recipient has to be active to publish the last transaction which makes it predestined for servers, not for occasionally online clients but this could be tackled with always online machines that you trust (your laptop for example).
This same paragraph applies to your total dismissal in your final statement. Just have something solid to receive the money. Making sure your best finalizing transaction is published, can also be done via anonymous redundant relays. Just instruct 100 servers worldwide to publish your transaction at exactly that hour and reward them with $0.0001. It's all just not yet implemented and increasing the block size will lower the incentive to implement it.

Sidechains have gigantic potential. You could have them for micro transactions (I see them as a direct threat to products that use federated micro payment channels for that but they would also fit the bill).
I see much more potential in other products such as ZeroCoin. Put it on a sidechain and you get fungibility for Bitcoin. If ZeroCoin crashes and disappears, if blocks take hours or days, Bitcoin is mostly unaffected. Building ZeroCoin into Bitcoin would as of now be the only alternative to have true fungibility but at a much higher risk than via a sidechain. … ok, now that I think of it, I have my doubts about ZeroCoin actually being suitable for a sidechain. [This thread]( claims both "yes" (quote by , 23 points) and "no" (quote by , -7 points) with really shallow arguments all over, so I would love to see a more convincing pointer.

Yesterday we released our first modularized version of Mycelium to our Beta Testers. For all who want to sell their bcash, this is the first feature we are releasing as a module and we would appreciate a lot if more experienced Bitcoiners/Mycelium users could join our beta test program.
To the best of our knowledge, using these pre-release beta test versions will not put your money at risk but the app might crash or some feature might be broken, that you normally use, depending on your phone and android version. When releasing new versions, these are the steps we take to make it secure:
* multiple internal code reviews
* release candidate (RC) gets tested internally on testnet and prodnet
* code gets pushed to our public repositories
* RC gets released to testnet
* RC gets released to beta testers
* RC goes to general rollout (0.5% of all users for example)
* RC rollout gets increased in steps to 100%
Depending on the release's urgency vs. risk profile
* urgency might come from a bug we found
* risk usually depends on the parts of the app that were changed. Adding a translation is low risk. 950 commits touching every aspect of the app is high risk
we might skip testnet and beta release and proceed faster in the rollout.
As for all other users, too, we assume that our beta testers **made all backups and still have them accessible**.

Micro payment channels don't rely on third parties and still allow off-chain transactions. In their simplest form, they work for just one client-merchant relationship but this can be extended to a network structure where you might rely on middle-men but without having to trust them.

Yeah, OP, sorry to burst your bubble but by this standard, DO is considering it since long and they very prominently stated they would not implement it. They heard us and said no for now.
I was running a uservoice for a community project, too and most likely in the bitcoin uservoice, people would flock to feature requests like "make mining easier" and nobody would ever go and implement it no matter how close to the "range of other suggestions that are marked as "Planned"".

For a BMM the step from 50% mining power to 51% means a difficulty drop by 50% on the next retarget if they don't instantly win many minors, meaning twice the profit for their minors.
Now with the only pool in existence under their control, they can even further their profits by raising fees. A pool under attack certainly has some need for fees :)

Not really. If it's super easy to mine and every wallet does it by default, the FBI would stand against roughly 21million other coins, many of which haven't moved in a year neither.
So if the FBI acquired some 2million coins, things start to become a bit different but then again, if the "attack" involves having to buy the coin, I would consider it pretty save against attacks as the victims of the attack that sold their coins to the attacker got compensated royally.

Most important use case is transaction channels. Too bad not many care yet but my bet is that in 3 years more than 99% of all transactions will be through transaction channels. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 21:05:18
The current fees make up a small percentage of the mining rewards and the current blockchain has a limit of 7 transactions per second. Microtransactions include transactions &lt;&lt; 5ct. and starting a miner already takes days when you start from zero.
No way the blockchain is efficient to do microtransactions on the blockchain, verified and stored by thousands of miners for all eternity not even for 5ct.
If you allow updating of transactions, so you don't need to store intermediary states (transaction channels) you get a long way towards true micro transactions.

That's where I enjoyed that I'm not the only one who doesn't get bit cause seriously some use it for µɃ, others for satoshis and Andreas uses it for 0.00001Ƀ. Great :)

@_date: 2014-08-30 03:48:57
ok, I moved in to my new appartment, took photos of all, zipped them, hashed the zip file, sent 1mɃ to the brainwallet of that hash and had peace of mind that now nobody could ever claim I made the photos later than the block the transaction was in was mined.
I didn't want to upload the 1.2GB zip file and probably wouldn't want to upload paperwork to this service neither but what would I gain from doing so?
I understand that by building a hash tree of all documents that are to be timestamped, a company can timstamp arbitrarily many documents with just one transaction but what's with the signing part? Again that can be done by hand easily. I can add a signed message containing the zip hash, zip the zip with the txt, hash again and add that to the blockchain. timestamped and signed.
My point is basically that the operations for signing and timestamping are pretty straight forward for those who know about it and are "probably snake-oil" to laymen, so as long as no document like this was ever challenged in a court of law within a my jurisdiction, I would probably not trust it if I weren't able to run sha256 and bitcoin (and maybe pgp) by myself.
@_date: 2014-08-31 13:48:35
If you want to sign and timestamp 30 documents of yours you turn them into one using zip.
If you are talking about the service timestamping only once for 30 clients then they would probably mail you a document containing yours and 29 other hashes that were hashed again for timestamping.

If you want sidechains to happen you should be against an increase of block size. ... if you know it is even possible.

I totally disagree and I'm shocked this gets 86% approval.
The amount is totally irrelevant. If you run a chewing gum vending machine, people will scam you over $0.1 cause they can under certain circumstances. If you sell a house for millions, people will not scam you cause they can't as the successful payment is subject of your contract.
Anything beyond one confirmation can't be reverted without owning half the network. If you own half the network, you can revert one confirmation just as you can revert ten. The only thing why two confirmations is better than one is the occasional orphaning of a single block. An attacker could double-spend all the time, hoping to run into this naturally occurring orphaning with conflicting payments in those branches but that would require buying a highly durable asset (crypto coins/gold/…) that is on sale being shipped with one confirmation instantly.
Basically if your payer shows you his ID, you can always accept zero confirmation as long as you can document that he owes you bitcoins.
Much more a concern than the rules mentioned should be that you should only trust your own hardware. Don't buy bitcoins in the street without having your own internet. Your trading partner could have faked the public wifi or lend you his access point to show you one transaction while showing another to the network.
… ultimately, try to not be paranoid. Educate yourself. Know what's possible and be reasonable with people who try to be nice with you, cause 99.99% of all people I did bitcoin business with were nice and honest. Some of them even had me setup their computer to receive their first bitcoins and almost without exception, I could have scammed all of them but I'm not into having them call the police on me.

Currently, the coinbase transaction (where the miner can spend the fees and the block reward) can only be spent after 100 blocks. This is a hard limit, so miners will refuse it being spent earlier.
With it being spendable instantly, you can take the huge fee and immediately do a transaction with it, that pays a huge though smaller fee again, dragging some of your competition onto your chain. If this transaction can only be mined in the far future, this doesn't work. Even 6 blocks maturity would mean that competing miners might hang on to their selfish mining for 5 blocks before considering taking this smaller reward.

If I want to give shares of my company, I do a legally binding contract that anybody who controls any of the 10000 colored coins colored as "Giszmo Inc.", gets his share of the dividends sent to his colored coin address.
Now my 50% partner can send his 5k shares to his granny or whatnot and I don't need to know cause I can just send the dividends to these final receiving addresses.
Also, if we ever have a vote on something, I could publish a bitmessage address to send the votes to and now every vote signed with one of those colored coins counts. My partner who sent all to his granny now has to convince granny to vote or else my votes are the majority.
This all should(!) be legally enforceable but of course making somebody pay dividends or honor a vote doesn't magically happen just because we have a block chain.

I smell sarcasm. Do you know what transaction channels are? Check out [Mike Hearn's post]( to learn more.
[Visa can handle up to 20,000 transactions per second. Bitcoin can handle 7. Not 7,000. 7.]( How exactly do you think we should resolve that? If you want to have the full ledger on every full node, you will have to increase the blockchain size. A transaction is on average 500B. Storing 20k transactions per second would mean 10MB/s growth of the blockchain. I want decentralization. Here in Chile people wouldn't be able to keep up with that blockchain and initial download would consist of buying a set of disks and a high and computer even in the US.
So what exactly is your concern about transaction channels?
Third party risk? There is close to none. If you send from bankerfrombtc to me at giszmo there would be a tiny third party risk as you would update your channel, granting bitpay money meant to be sent to giszmo. Bitpay would update its existing channel to mycelium and mycelium would update its channel with giszmo.
Now if you want to send $100 and fear to loose it on the way, there is virtually no additional cost to sending it in 100 iterations. My wallet would talk to your wallet and notify it of every $1 it receives, making your wallet send out the next $. Now if there is foul play in the chain, all you lost is $1 and as soon as the foul player is found out, the other services will stop doing business with it. As settlement is supposed to happen in split seconds, the foul player could only run a bunch of clients sending money at this exact time before being locked out of the network. As these channels only work with switched on providers and clients, a payment route would have to be confirmed before sending out money, so if mycelium wouldn't forward the money, bitpay could instantly halt this route until the issue is resolved.
Privacy? There is none if done right. Sure, if we all use bitpay, we don't need complicated routing as in the previous example but ideally these proxies run on open source software that you could install on any machine, so you would probably send bankerfrombtc to giszmo

If she knows this code is worth $200 and that she will walk away from the meeting with $200 in local fiat in hands she will know if that is something she can handle or not. There are people that meet in banks to exchange coins for bills and directly hand on the bills to their bank to have them on their accounts.

Your concerns are about right. AML and KYC make this all a bit tricky as we can see with the various coinbase complaints of people not getting "their" money.
So if BitPay would proxy for its customers and the customers would use this proxy, it would work great because they all registered with BitPay and did all the AML paperwork.
With random strangers sending through BitPay this would get BitPay into trouble, so they wouldn't do it and basically nobody else would do it neither as micro payments are not worth asking for IDs.
If you don't want to ask for IDs, you would basically have to avoid the state and somebody who avoids the state is basically quite likely to run with any customer money. So either this DarkPay proxy has a lot of trust for whatever reason and people still use it without knowing who runs it and without knowing if they will get paid when the threshold is reached, or DarkPay would have to go full trust free and fund an outgoing channel, too, which in turn binds a lot of money.
Ok, the incentives are huge to offer this service as people would certainly pay 1% for micro payments but who's going to step up and do it?

Damn, now that I read your general inquiry … wouldn't it be cool and rather easy to do to have some tipping-bot like admin bot extension for sauer? Not sure if you play this game and I only remotely know it from playing from time to time but the bots used in sauer are often aimed at democratic consensus. You can `/suggest some_map` or `/suggest kicking some_player` which then allows other players to vote `1 – for` or `2 – against`.
A bitcoin integration could look very similar. Players could buy in to play the next round in clan wars but players could also vote on penalties for players expressed in $$. Now the bad player could either pay or get kicked. Sure, some servers could charge to play.
Possibilities are endless and technically it's most likely easy to implement using the JSON apis available for bitcoin and the existing bots as a framework.
Edit: The most intriguing aspect is that it's something the players are already very used to and many know how to code and alter these bots so there would naturally be much competition for the best bots without having to invent a new game with new alt-coin altogether like [some did](

shorting is a signal people should take serious. signals are fabricated and people "short squeeze" just to make a profit in the wrong direction, causing high volatility to get some up tick that is not sustainable.
We see all this now. Some short, others want them to fail, not because they want bitcoin to succeed but to win the other side of the short bet. Just stay out of this gamble when you don't understand it and allow people to hedge against falling bitcoin value or gamble against bitcoin if they want. Each such bet has a taker.

There is only so much you can do to get more core developers. Write good pull requests and you, too end up being one. It is a huge responsibility and burden but it isn't a closed system. Ultimately the miners decide if a change is acceptable or not. The core devs have no power at all to push unpopular things like breaking the 21.000.000 limit.

Bitundo takes a fee only for successful undos, so even one solo-miner using it can skew the percentage Mycelium reports. As I understand Bitundo, it is designed to secretly mine a conflicting transaction to a transaction that nodes would claim to have in their transaction pools. This way, the user might get scammed even if Mycelium found 100% propagation of the good transaction. Even in non-secrecy mode, Mycelium would have to constantly re-query nodes to see if they changed their mind due to Bitundo.
If there were no such thing as secret undo, at least the percentage reported could be an honest and correct estimate. With this open attack on the non-confirmed transactions by Bitundo, you can only hope and pray or wait for the next block and have a coffee. I actually like that part about the personal trader experience anyway ;)

so instead of downloading the full block, miners would based on a small merkle root guesstimate the block and the inluded/excluded transactions and only maybe have to ask to fill the gaps where some transaction didn't make it to them yet (for the coinbase transaction for example, that generally would not be public)?
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:59:52
Problem is that 13kusd per 10 minutes is a hefty price tag for potential attackers and you really want to keep the price that high.
Look into Peter Todd's suggested tree chains. They distribute the blockchain so you can compete to verify tiny fractions of a block, bringing difficulty and reward down.

I would love to code it but I'm primarily searching for a job (in the bitcoin space) and see many other things to implement there, too. One aspect though is that by solving the issue in your preferred way, you take the basis of "my business plan" of charging people 0.01ct per transaction but maybe worse, your solution keeps all transaction data in the blockchain where it is vulnerable to analysis.

The transaction fees are one of the arguments to find an alternative. If storing and serving a transaction for all future redundantly on 10000 disks costs 5ct. then there is little you can do about this and on-chain micro payment will never come. At least no 5ct. micro payment. Also does increasing the block size not solve the instant confirmation problem that payment channels would.

It's irrelevant for Amazon. What is there to gain? 10 million dollars? Not worth it for them. Bitcoin (still) needs Amazon more than the other way round. Also, whenever that is about to change, there is no big hassle jumping on the train at any point. The first-mover advantage is much bigger for "Honest Ember" or "Bee Brothers" that I would never have discovered without bitcoin than for Amazon.
Also, do you know which were the first companies to have websites? It doesn't matter to be the first. Let the competition find out how best to use this fringe new system and if they start taking a cut of Amazon's cake, Amazon will follow.

Hey! Sure! :) I saw shop owners remove the "bitcoins accepted here" sign because they spent 3h per week explaining bitcoin to strangers with no sales and all my bitcoin transactions take &gt;20minutes on average for the exact same reason. One third of my first time buyers on localbitcoins come totally unprepared and I have to set them up for using bitcoin and that's ok with me. I understand though that shop owners don't want to evangelize bitcoin in order to sell an extra two coffees per week, loosing other customers waiting in line for the other 20 interested but unprepared customers that just chat about bitcoin but don't use it.
In that sense, the actual process of paying in bitcoin with mycelium installed and ready takes 10s give or take. Regarding that here in Chile more than 50% of all customers spell their national ID to the clerk in addition to handling banking cards and have to answer whether or not they want to donate the sub 10 pesos change to the store-picked charity, that's nothing.

I was totally thrilled when the SC paper was announced and was sure this was the best thing to happen in crypto coins, getting rid of all the 1200 alts.
Now the criticism sounds a bit harsh to me.
**undoing the sidechains later**
All of us who have a stake in Bitcoin should see things coming if the situation gets bad and there is always a way to react. Adding SC now is not a thing we couldn't undo ever. If Bitcoin was threatened by StateCoin with miners abandoning Bitcoin to the point where State may crush the remaining Bitcoin network in the near future and with a bunch of others having their bitcoins moved to LibertarianCoin and BlackMarketCoin, …, Bitcoin could still announce to get back to the roots and remove SC again.
This could crush some small SCs as people might rush back home to Bitcoin but some (maybe also StateCoin) might continue to thrive on their own merits.
**decreasing the incentive to keep bitcoins in sidechains**
Bitcoin could even implement SC with a fee/an extra reward for miners: Using SCs costs a fee. Lending bitcoins to a SC costs x% per block. This way the users would have an incentive to keep using bitcoins as a store of value and mining Bitcoin would gain an extra stream of revenue.
The miner would have to keep track of the total amount of bitcoins in all SPV-locked outputs and would get that * x% as an extra mining reward. The sidechain in turn would have to take into account that with each main-chain block their units of account loose in value compared to bitcoin.
(Sure, "x%" could get nasty when it computes to fractions of Satoshis but we could find a formula easily. Also "x%" could be anything. I was thinking 0.1 – 1%/year but why not 10%/year if that's what it takes to have SC happening at all?)

From an academic standpoint this is exciting news for the thousands of readers. From a practical standpoint only hot wallet providers should care and for them the TL;DR: is "Don't use virtual servers where you share the same metal with other customers." and the bigger picture is that even if you run your hot wallet on digital ocean or amazon it is highly unlikely that an attacker will get on the same physical machine easily. You can't just ask digitalocean to be hosted on the same machine as bitstamp.
… but then I wonder is it more likely that some random customer will get his hands on the hot wallet or would it rather be an insider of a data center? I would be super paranoid and most likely keep the hot wallet on a machine with no physical access for third parties whatsoever. The server asks for signatures and gets them from my PC under my control. Most likely it would go like that:
* Any excess funds (anything exceeding what I can comfortably afford to loose more than once) from the hot wallet on the server is sent to cold storage, an air-gapped wallet.
* Any time the hot wallet runs low on funds, it requests a prop-up from semi-cold storage, a machine under my control that is connected to the internet. That machine requires no human interaction for funds I can afford to loose but it needs confirmation for anything more than that. It also sends excess funds to cold storage as anything connected to the internet might get hacked eventually.
* The cold storage would have only a QR-Code interface to scan the transaction from and to a net-connected machine (or maybe some other low-bandwidth, easy to audit interface). (For the bigger company scenario, multisig with several employees having to sign would be the logical next step.)(Any way, customers having to wait for big withdraws would not worry me at all for the one man show scenario. If I need 12h of sleep, you would have to wait 12h for your million dollars. Sorry. At least it's safe.)

How do you define speculator? For me, a speculator is somebody who buys low and sells high and by doing this, provides a service. If there were no speculators, all would buy high and sell low like us mere mortals ;D.
A speculator speculates on a shorter term than an investor. He might speculate on tomorrow's value or even on the value of the next second. A whale dumps, the speculator immediately buys if some offers follow the dump cause he expects the price to recover the next second. This forward-thinking is a service that is paid for by the panic sellers or buyers and also by the perma-bulls that buy at any price.
I try to distinguish the speculator from the manipulator who uses his money and manipulative influence to induce swings that he can make a profit off. I'm still trying to believe that not all speculators naturally gravitate towards manipulating the market once they hold so much money that they can't make the same profits as before because now they move the market themselves.

I doubt that most coins get sold immediately as they are being minted. Most, if not all mining operations cash out in bitcoins and the number of individuals receiving those fresh coins is huge! By far not all of them would directly sell, especially after the price nose-dived that much.

Hmm, I am hesitant to get Chilean artisanias on Overstock. I mean, if I can earn a cut, that's great and most likely well worth my time but to me it looks like it's directed towards the producer directly, so reselling to Overstock could be a problem. They want to know where and in which quantity and at which price the product already sells, which gives them direct access to my supply chain aka the producer.
If there is something in it for me, I would probably get many people in to provide more products and with me as the middle man, paying in bitcoin "to the producer" wouldn't be a problem neither.
Anybody here has any smart suggestions on how to handle this?

If those techies work in the wrong direction, expect it to be expensive to pay other techies to work in the right direction. It is not for free to enter this market and simply never will be when proof of work is involved. Proof of Stake can work differently but I highly dislike the PoS currencies that are instamined and 100% PoS but introducing a currency will either be instamining or a competitive market of who introduces (as PoW). I see no solution yet but would favor to see Bitcoin migrate to PoS over some years, allowing everybody to secure it and its spirit. Mining is the wrong term at that point and it should not be about profit but about protecting your stake against fraudulent activities. No rewards necessary for the owners of 30% of all bitcoins having some thousands of low power PCs running and policing the network.

You raise a valuable point there. I studied math, read it and assumed that I understood it. I'm 100% sure I knowhow current bitcoin works (not down to iimplementation details like hash doubling when building the Merkel tree or how exactly sha256 works, but assuming these things work I know why bitcoin should work.) Is understanding Satoshi's vision beyond that valuable? Probably. Ultimately he has no authority so it's of mere academic relevance.

If you want to pump the price, get some real data to the table.

Gavin has a point there, still this is because we pay a reward to miners. If we would stop that, people with lots of coins at stake would still mine in order to prevent us from the end of bitcoin. Most likely they would even mine if they wouldn't just not get the 25Ƀ but neither the transaction fees. Damn, I would connect a node mining with my stake. Why not?

Micropayment channels are off chain and not at all like paypal. More like email.You could route money through several servers and you could even hide the sender and recipient from the servers. You could pay $1000 $1 at a time and thus never trust the server chain with more than $1. As a transaction should go through in 100ms, the 1000 transactions would go through in 100s. If you trust the servers with more, it would be faster. PayPal would hold the $1000 weeks before and after the transaction. Much more risk.

Ok, it makes sense to treat coinbase transactions differently but just as merchants have policies about requiring 6 confirmations while the protocol allows to spend outputs with zero confirmations, merchants could require other rules for coinbase transactions and let miners "pay each other with unconfirmed coinbase transactions". Some wallets completely missed the coinbase transactions (Bitcoin Spinner, when set as target for St.Eligius had that problem). In any case, 100 on a network level is probably exaggerated.
Anyway, thank you for your answer.

I didn't read it and most likely we are not the target audience if we are living outside of NY anyway. Nobody has an obligation to use Bitcoin and if the people from NY don't want to participate, that's fine with me.
Oh, and if you just got angry because you live under some oppressive government that happens to have a say on who you do business with, yeah, I guess we all have that problem in a way and some hope bitcoin will do away with that. But that only works if we close out those who try to add rules on bitcoin transactions so that bitcoin stays governed by math only. Any company that complies with bit license is a threat to bitcoin itself. **Any such company that does not do what Xapo just did is poison**.

compromised? In the sense of backdoor, allowing somebody to mine at arbitrary speed on a regular laptop? That would be a pretty severe event and if it was completely broken to the degree that sha256 was reversible, essentially any bitcoin address that was spent from before, could be swept. All others would still be protected by ripemd160.
If something was found that could lead to such an event within the next years, bitcoin could switch to another hashing algorithm, declare a date until bitcoins have to be moved to a new, secure address and forbid transactions involving SHA256 after that date for addresses that were used to send before. Bitcoin could also refuse to include payments to those legacy addresses in the blockchain.
Anyway, fundamentalists would scream that invalidating bitcoins is against the holy Satoshi and it would be a huge mess, but a $10B industry would not just stand by and see how Bitcoin vanishes.

That said, if you are willing to provide that in Pucon, I guess Pucon would still be lower priority but with donations flowing in, I would see no problem in expanding this to Pucon. Most likely Santiago is the more logical next step though as there is a small community and a bar accepting bitcoins already in Santiago.

Gavin said it but basically I assume it works just like with most open source projects:
The maintainer is tired of having to pull the great work of some ultra reliable peer and promotes him by giving him write access. Now this peer is less of a burden and can help more. The incentives to promote are clear and the dangers, too, so reviewing commits does't stop when somebody has write access, especially in a project like bitcoin.

If you honestly worry about getting on no-fly lists for following this link, consider this:
If any kid that clicked this link got their household onto some no-fly list, these lists should be quite long and the airlines would lobby against them heavily, so there is most likely some second filter and no automatism. For example it might matter if you got there via a bookmark or via a link discussing the ethics of the site.
In this sense it might be more relevant if you copied the link into your anonymous browsing tab as now you will be  considered coming from a bookmark.
Using your TOR proxy would give you an ever higher score if the list-maintainer can figure out who "you" are. I used TOR to visit it. Will let you know if I have trouble travelling ;)
Edit: To conclude, it is probably safest to just hit the link here in reddit instead of using some half-baked TOR solution in a TOR-using tab while being logged in to 12 social networks. Looking at the code of the site, it looks though as if they might not report to google and facebook but that's what I can tell after looking at the loaded documents for a minute, so a second opinion would be appreciated.

Bitcoin Stickers!
Hi, so here where I am, stickers stick forever. The craziest example was this:
I put it there in June and it is still there. Right in the city center of Vina del Mar, Chile at the entry of a bank. Many others of the 500 stickers also survived and almost none were removed. I'm out of stickers and bitmit.net and my supplier are gone. He sent me 500 stickers to Chile for $40 which by my current investigations on prices to print here in Chile also might be subsidized.
My suggestion is to use part of the funds to boost sticker production and distribution. I suggest the fund covers the shipping costs and part of the stickers' value. Charge people $40 for 500 stickers no matter where in the world and they will do the hard work of getting the word out to the people.

Oh I'm so glad to hear that BitPay is at it :) You don't need a mathematician/programmer/bitcoiner to work on that by any chance? I'd love to contribute to a one hop solution with bitpay being the trust-free mediator so the user doesn't need to spend 2 transaction fees for one purchase. Imagine me pays to pump and 2 channels get updated – mine and the pump's one. The channels don't have nlock of an hour but of a year and both me and the pump (and, well, bitpay) know there was a payment but not the blockchain until the year is over. My client would talk with pump's client to see if bitpay forwarded my payments and thus it would be as trust-free as a direct channel. Just a bit more complex. Are you already working on that? I bet this is a field of huge profits starting in a year from now.
But regarding the Diesel pump: A channel requires the pump to talk to the wallet during the process. It removes trust issues from the process and indeed would be a perfect use case for channels but users with a such wallet are an ultra niche within a niche, so it should allow the user to trust the pump (and educate him to not send from addresses he doesn't own! Payment protocol fixes that return issue but again that also is still niche but very likely to be bitcoin-mainstream very soon)

I assume you make fun of noobs asking stupid questions? Real people answering simple questions is just more engaging than to go RTFM. To me ["What if somebody buys all the bitcoins?"]( is one of these example questions that come up over and over again and people have the patience to discuss this at great length but if you point to the ever repeating occurrence of this question, you are considered rood. So why bother? Provide a link to the discussion but don't complain. I stopped down-voting something like that when I see it got 80% up-vote in rBitcoin. It's helpless. I've lost rBitcoin. rBitcoin has lost me. I want a replacement.

The point is basicalle that the cover story should not be total bullshit. It should be a plausible story. You snoop around long enough and when you find evidence that you could have gotten on another way, too, you take the means necessary to obtain proof in that alternative way that you would never have found if you had used only legal methods. In that sense, the Ross case is not one of parallel construction as they did not construct a parallel way of getting the evidence as that parallel way never existed, unless they themselves with their inside access broke the captcha to reveal what they already knew, which would also be a way of actual parallel construction. In that latter case, demanding evidence would be futile as they would be able to provide it and there are little means of proofing that they and not Ross himself misconfigured his server.

On the short term mining and price are not coupled because mining has huge up-front efforts. Buying a miner takes weeks if not months if you are new to the business. Producing them takes months and once produced they have to get crunching numbers asap because it takes weeks to loose 20% profitability as you just see here. As there is competition in the mining chip producer space, price should be a free market price and producers try to sell as much as they can as 4 weeks later their hardware is either obsolete or only worth &lt;50%.
Once a miner is installed, switching it off or on is a decision based on electricity prices and – for those with winter and miners in their living environment – weather as you can heat your room crunching numbers if you already have the equipment. And it's winter in the south, just in case you think it's summer. Ok, most likely 95% of all miners are in the north.

Yes, Gavin has something that is bitcoin days destroyed based, forcing the miner to include at least some real transactions but if some 5% of all transactions never confirm because the attacker takes the hash modulo 20 to decide these tx never confirm just to mess with the system, then what?

I'd like to question the organization we are collecting for. As I'm basically talking to myself here and miraculously 8 people donated, I'm not sure if that makes sense but I don't like the red cross and here in Valparaíso people are busy organizing help with actual stuff that you drop at the various collection points. Anything from milk, toothbrushes, pampers, blankets, shovels etc. is in high demand. Sure, it's not as clean and easy to report back the success but I feel like giving to the red cross is way less of a service to the people in need than these collections.
Opinions? Definitely donations to the address mentioned will go to the red cross but if I'm not alone with that concern, I would definitely come up with a new address for a new cause but we should define it well so there are no hard feelings if the shovels are green instead of red.

"Wallstreet" is not a big entity as such.
On Wallstreet, people trade all kind of securities and if some of them start trading in bitcoin, it will start small. With the bitcoin reaching $10000, many will want to cash out, to not hodl again through the next 70% drop. If $10k doesn't inspire the hodlers to see the next drop, maybe $20k does the trick. If you don't sell at any price ever, you are a fool but how to know what is the right price? Some will sell too early and never buy back in. Others will sell too late when the bubble popped.

Ok so what's the alternative? You can't forbid margin trading in bitcoin. You could only drive it underground.
As long as some kid can say "hey dad, please buy me some bitcoin. They are going up 5% next week. It's a sure thing." and the dad - if only to make a point - sais "Bitcoin is crashing. That's a stupid idea but ... ok but if at any point during that week it drops 15% you will have to sell as obviously your funny money is not as good as you thought." you have margin trading. Dad is taking son's short position and being a soft dad, will accept a told-you-so-lesson in place of putting his son in debt but with an older son he woul immediately resolve to put a monetary value to the deal and have the full instrument.
So yeah you can dislike it but it's inevitable because humans are gamblers and margin calls happen when more is at stake than the gambler can afford to lose. Shorts unfortunately have no loss limit if you don't pull out so ther will always be stop loss orders and people able to abuse those.

Well the current consensus is that pure pos would be prone to attacks and pos+pow would lead to centralization. I hope we sort it out so we can shift at least some of the mining weight to pos. To counter the argument that rich get richer this way, I would also exclude pos mining from block rewards. "Mining" should be "protecting the network" and those wigh high stakes in bitcoin would do it for free. To fulfill the other aspect of mining, bootstrap a currency, pow is just perfect.

I saw in the API of bitcoinj that it's one way but please explain me, why is that so? My understanding would be that
1. the "client" puts xɃ into a channel with tx1.
2. client shares his initial unsigned tx1 with "server".
3. server sends client a signed tx2, returning all the money from tx1 (initial return tx).
4. client signs tx1.
5. client or server "suggests" a tx2² with higher priority than tx2.
6. the other part signs tx2² off.
Now I guessed, as the receiving part is assumed to be a server that is always online and the client might be a user that is not online when nlock time approaches, the client might have little chance to broadcast the last tx2' that is maybe more opportune than some prior tx2'' that the server might try to broadcast but that would not be a reason to exclude it from the API but rather for a warning in JavaDoc.

Author of BitBox Chrome Extension here:
I couldn't agree more. I love running my extension as it shows me balances of random bitcoin addresses but even I don't run the version I uploaded myself to the Chrome store but the version from source code.
Unfortunately the same is true with any bitcoin software and ultimately with every software compiled after 2008. Don't use proprietary software. Don't trust open source that you didn't compile yourself after getting it from a reliable source. Don't trust a binary unless you checked the checksum and know it was compiled in a binary reproducible way (bitcoin-core does that).
Be paranoid. If you already are paranoid, be more paranoid ;)
Edit: I don't write this to later blame all who fell for my thief extension. I stand with my name for its non-malicious code.

[Movember]( also works but with less casualties and more persistence.
Still for me it is about the allocation dilemma: Why is ALS an issue that deserves more attention than prostate cancer? Or Aids? Or land mines? Or street dogs? Yeah, people dedicate their lives to street dogs while children are dying of leukemia. Education could solve more problems per dollar maybe? Fact is, all these issues need to be addressed and it's not so much about how much one campaign can raise but for me it's more about how can we get to a society that cares less about stuff and more about people and I doubt ice-bucket challenges can help with that.
We as a community can change the financial system. We can allocate money towards making payment friction-less and we can liberate $50billion per year that currently is spent on remittance fees alone. Think of what that can change in the world!

Selling with a return policy that refunds the bitcoin would be kind of idiotic. If they did that, with 3 weeks shipping, they would almost certainly lose 50% of their sales in any period the bitcoin goes up significantly during a 3 weeks span which is a very common scenario. Not being able to convert earnings to IRR on the spot exposes the merchant to the currency risk.
They have their prices expressed in USD so I would guess they see BTC as the protocol not the currency and thus would not refund BTC but USD equivalents.

Arbitrage upon a manipulated exchange only makes the local volatility ripple out to other markets but it also makes it harder to short squeeze for example. If a margin call cascade would be triggered at a 10% increase on one exchange, arbitragers help make it very expensive to achieve this 10% increase as they will do their thing starting at a 1% margin nation wide and at 5% globally, pouring coins onto that exchange, counter-acting the manipulation. The manipulators need more money thanks to arbitrage. Arbitrage becomes more profitable thanks to manipulation. The manipulators might get beaten up if the short positions can't get squeezed as easily as they thought as now they, too can be fooled.
But to get back to your question: All this are mechanisms to find a price and nobody knows what bitcoin is worth next year and even if you knew it and bought/sold all you could to act accordingly, the price would not get there much faster unless you are so rich that you could single-handedly move the price there but then if you couldn't show that report from the future (yeah, the movement would over-shoot and we would be back at finding the price. Now if you already sold all your bitcoins and still know they are valuated much too high, how can you put your money where your mouth is? By short-selling. There really is no other way.

That sounds a bit sick. The HIF is not measuring the quality of life of one person differently than the one of another person based on any factor like income, gender or nationality. [QALYs]( are quality adjusted life years and mean nothing else than if your life feels worth living half as much as before the disease but the disease doesn't kill you earlier than normal (lost a leg and an arm), a cure would count as 0.5 * life_expectancy points. Same if a disease causes your life expectancy to drop by 50% and a treatment that drops your quality of living by 50% is applied (life in the hospital?) that otherwise makes sure you will not die early, that treatment would gain you 50% or your life expectancy but loose 50% of your quality, so it would not count any points in the sense of HIF.
The problem with the HIF is that the financial interests to interpret results the one way or the other are just huge. Patients would be bribed to report 100% quality of living (in that hospital) and people dying early would never die because of the treatment but always because of external factors if you don't have some incorruptible team of scientists measuring success. 
Else I love the idea and would happily contribute to such a fund as it gets health support perfectly aligned with the need of the people. I'd much rather pay towards that than towards my public health insurance as I would assume that it would put my living quality and longevity in the center of research and not the profit per patient. But same as with health insurances as we have today, the amount of money disappearing in that middle man is also a huge problem.

I saw 20 of those videos and no explanation where it came from or a link to the background. I assume it is to raise awareness for ALS but I can also understand people go like "WTF what a pointless thing to do? Probably more meme-followers die of shock than of ALS ever!" and down vote this.
I don't up or down vote this as really for me it's a meme and hardly changes the world for the better. Even if many people allocate funds to ALS, these funds would have gone towards whatever other cause somebody made up a meme for else, wouldn't it? Yeah, in the bitcoin community ALS is most likely better known than in other communities that don't have some potential Satoshi Nakamoto with ALS but the global health impact of publicly shock freezing my head is probably not positive at all, so I regret not more people talk about the issue rather than to focus on nominating the next people.

Why do people care so much about the hardware he ran and nobody asked the question, why he has this plan?
If this was my project with a somewhat arbitrary chance of success, I would probably run one dedicated machine to keep the heart beating and on my dev machine I would eventually switch mining off and on at arbitrary times to test stuff, most likely on testnet.
Most likely I would switch off the machine on the main chain once my machine was doing only some 1% of the overall hashing as mining wouldn't be my business and switching it off now wouldn't harm the network.
Satoshi's meddling with the hash rate looks like he cared more about keeping the hash rate smooth but I have one question about the initial hashrate: 4.3Mh/s sounds a lot to me. I had thought somehow that the initial miners ran slower on standard hardware? What setup would have gotten me that hashrate in 2009? (Naive mining in the browser today is at about 1-10kh/s I would say.)

If you think you can stop them renting a million more such servers by annoying abuse into taking down this one server, you must be dreaming. The correct course of action is criminal investigations so that hopefully the business plan looks more like this: 1800BTC scammed out of people - 2 years in jail - reputation gone forever - 1500BTC "they" manage to confiscate in return for letting me out after 2 years.

My strategy: be the market maker on localbitcoins and don't pull out on high volatility. The likelihood of others panic-selling/buying and doing it wrong is high, it provides liquidity and I can take a 5% fee. But be careful to put the right formula in, as relying on just one exchange will most likely get you to have to honor deals that are definitely bad. For example I take the 24h high of stamp, gox and btcchina into account before applying a fee.

it only prevents fraud (double spends) or denial of service attacks (dust without fees), so sure, it's not agnostic about everything but it allows everything the recipient could possibly want (apart from some secondary use cases that would make it desirable to have dust transactions to transfer information beyond the public ledger of value that bitcoin was designed for)

M.soft would need much more reserves to establish channels to the recipients. In fact, by the middle of the week, the monies I funneled into my channel are debts of M.soft to whoever I paid. Having the money in channels to them would require a huge amount of upfront bitcoin reserves, not only because M.soft wouldn't have the money before the end of the week but also because they might want to establish bigger channels with the recipients, too.

Ever noticed that in a big mall, you have armored vehicles come to pick up cash from the businesses and others to put cash into ATMs. Wouldn't it make sense to have businesses feed the ATMs? Don't businesses offer you to cash out at the counter already? What would happen if I specialized to fill the other end in OP's idea? Would I come with my armored vehicle to pick up all the cash you give me? Or would you rather expect to have hundreds come picking up smaller chunks? Handling that fiat isn't for free, neither if it's not hundreds but thousands, so you should introduce a handling fee in addition to the selling incentive.

I had suggested that years ago on the bitcoin forum and it was not well received. People were bitching that an insurance is there to take over all the inconveniences of an incident and with a DAC, the DAC would have to hire humans to judge on claims and the whole claims process would be a target of fraud.
My example was not health insurance but fire, because it's much simpler. You take your ID and proof of ownership of a house, maybe a photo of the signed DAC contract, zip it, hash it and send that hash to the DAC. The DAC gives you an address that you have to pay monthly to. Now when your house burns, the DAC randomly picks an arbiter who gets paid for preventing fraud. You have to send your zip to the arbiter and any additional information on the burned house, but through the DAC to prevent you from paying the arbiter to collude against the DAC.
The DAC can inspect any granted payouts with further arbiters.
You can inspect a non-granted payout with further arbiters, too, which you would have to pay for though.
You stay completely anonymous until you actually want a payout.

A side-chain with a two-way-peg is a block chain that that you can transfer your bitcoins to, by sending them dormant on the bitcoin network, with a way to transfer them back to the bitcoin network.
The idea is that you can have alt coins where the users don't have to buy into a new get-rich-quick-coin. You could use the benefits of the alt, without having to buy in, as you can get out at zero costs.
Naturally those alts would have no own mining reward beyond the transaction fees, as these rewards would not be transferable to bitcoin. In this way, you could use these alts, without diluting bitcoin, which alts are often accused of.
(A one-way peg exists. Alts that have proof of burn attribute bitcoin value to bitcoins that were provably destroyed, though without the two-way peg, the lack of redeemability makes the associated value questionable.)

I assume, most that come here, heard about the fire in the news already. In German news it was covered yesterday and today, despite being at the other end of the world. Still I'd like to give some background:
The hills that were affected, were mainly covered with houses that often had no water or electricity, where the people gained property of the land by using it. These "tomas" are usually extremely poorly constructed and fire eats through them at incredible speed. In Chilean news there is a lot of finger pointing now and of course a call for better administration by the state that should never have allowed them to build crazily like that etc. but maybe Andres can explain that in more detail.

For AIDS many claim that finding a cure would essentially mean having to distribute it for free as it would be immoral holding it back from all the poor affected third world patients as AIDS is mainly a third world problem.
I care more about global health impact than about Hal Finney. If with the same amount of money you can save twice as many lives if attributed differently, then please attribute it differently and don't distract people with minor issues (yeah, I said minor issue. If the global health impact is bigger for fixing A, not B, then I am for fixing A and B is the minor of both issues. Sure, you can't go all in on the biggest problem at all time as development takes time so I guess problems should receive funding proportional to their global impact. If by that metric ALS still is under-funded, well then I am for awareness.)
Do you know about the [Health Impact Fund]( It tries to address just this. It's not perfect and one could argue that there still remains an incentive of not fixing issues once and for all as one wouldn't get money the next year but in order to align efforts with global quality adjusted life years I guess there is no better way than just rewarding exactly that.

A feature of one client can and should be against the spirit of bitcoin in order to drive innovation of the protocol. If controversial features are kept to closed source miners in large pools the debate we have now never happens but the controversial mining behavior is not avoided.
in this spirit adding feature x that the big pools use anyway to bitcoin core and adding an x-blocker to the protocol next should be a very possible thing and get the support of the community.

To add some historical context, think of the first wallet. It had a checkbox that read "generate coins". For the first year, mining was about optimizing software, not hardware. Not for speed but for stability. Then speed. Only then came the first actual miners that bought the best equipment that was available on the market to mine. Then came the GPU miners. It was all about getting the ATI not NVIDIA. Then came FPGA. Up to here, it was all commodity hardware, so optimization was all about software.
Now we are in the time of ASICs and these are much harder to make or improve, so the production cycles are longer but still every new generation drives an old generation out of the market. It's always been like this but it will stop as soon as the innovation comes down to commodity hardware cycles of x2 in 18 months instead of x2 in 1.8 months as it is now.

As I stated, we are further away from the cereal-box-mining but think about the Wallmart products: You can buy an electrical stove of 1kW for $10.
Mining costs are equipment + electricity for device and cooling + internet. Stripping electricity for device and cooling from the bill gives you a considerable edge but only if you can market it as a cheaper stove or otherwise desirable product.
Right now, even in the bitcoin community barely anybody would want to have it, mainly because it would be obsolete before it was at your door. Yeah, I want a mining rig. If I could beam one into my room I would most likely long have one but the crazy difficulty increase makes anything but cloud mining unfeasible.
Now think about a future where people use bitcoin as money. Miners are as cheap as other electronics and mining costs boil down to electricity costs as electricity is also expected to become more expensive. In this future, mining will not be done by huge farms but by people who want the heat and would otherwise use an electrical heater, preferably in application that are mostly on and low temperature (swimming pool heating) and not hot but mostly off (toaster).
The more bitcoin and its centralization becomes a topic and the more the block reward goes down, I would also expect people to see hashing as "policing the network" and not so much as "mining".

Absolutely, for bitcoin projects this is the thing. A replacement for the bitcoin foundation what the price was for. For anything outside bitcoin you would still be x100 better off, to go with kickstarter. I hate it but the network effect will get kickstarter for a long time a huge competitive edge over any other platform that is not totally niche like lighthouse for bitcoin projects.
Still, to get people chip in their money you would need a simplified interface. No Tim Draper will drag and drop key files around. He wants some trusted body that takes his money and handles it for him and that's what hosted wallets can do for you. Blockchain.info can totally integrate lighthouse into their product and allow you to support projects with one click.

Ok, I meant above median.
Average is this:
    current block hight: 316655
    current difficulty:  23844670039
    retarget:            every 2016 blocks.
    retargets so far:    316655 / 2016 = 157
    initial difficulty:  1
    conclusion:          (1 + increase)^157 = 23844670039
                         increase = 23844670039^(1/157) - 1 = 16%
ok, so 20% is above average but good to know that the average is 16% ;)

I am following bitcoin since almost 4 years. I'm happy about every piece of media coverage and new hair dresser in Timbuktu accepting bitcoin but I can't be the last to learn about issues with the latest BIP, a new library for JS emerging or a cool tool to bake and broadcast your transactions manually. These things are what matters to me and there is no sub for it. Here they drown in news from Timbuktu and funny chart analysis. I don't want to be negative about funny chart analysis. I also laugh at them. "Hey, China … do something funny"-posts make me laugh but I miss more relevant stuff over it. The forum and mailing lists have more of that but those have no voting mechanism. This is why I had hoped for some support to drag more technical stuff to reddit.

To quote you and return the question: "What's wrong with you?" I specifically addressed how to deal with all your concerns. If mining is done mainly for alt-coins, then Bitcoin could increase the SC-tax, adopt what made that SC cool or otherwise adjust incentives at any time. If the SC is genuinely better, then nothing is wrong with all bitcoins migrating over to that SC for good.

People here are not worried about blockstream having it sorted out for *them*. They are worried that blockstream would destroy bitcoin out of their own interests. Alt-Coins never took off because moving money over to them always went with the risk of having ones money on some pump-and-dump scheme right when the final dump was about to come. With SC you could keep bitcoins within the SC, using the SC's benefits but that also means that people could be lured more easily into moving all value over to EvilCoin and, with a threat to Bitcoin that would not affect EvilCoin, a final exodus could leave the bitcoin believers with a broken chain while EvilCoin thrives.

It's not either-or. I don't mind increasing the block size 50% per year from now on but the article reads as if Gavin suggested to increase it now by x2000 and then by 50% per year and that would be suicide for any small full node. Here in Chile I can't get an internet connection to continuously download 2GB blocks every 10 minutes and Chile is top here in South America.
I just think that a more heterogeneous landscape with people using micro payment channels in a peer-to-peer fashion would solve many problems without putting more minable data into the public domain.
* instant payment (established micro payment channels allow instant updates to the channel)
* increased anonymity (my broker doesn't need to know what I'm paying as this could be sent in a tor-fashion only readable to the broker of the recipient and if required, the payment could run through more than 2 brokers. In the end, I paid x to one and y to another broker while some other people received money from their brokers)
* cheap (each broker would make a profit if charging $1 for being involved in 1million transactions (kind of. payment channels bind some capital on the outbound side))

Good write up but unfortunately it doesn't get us 1000tps for free at all. Transactions still need to be transmitted and stored, so a new node still has to catch up with the data starting at the genesis block. x140 tx/s means also x140 need of bandwidth and storage and that is killer for most of the world's infrastructure.
Still I love the proposal for our 1MB blocks. I'm curious though how the incentives align for providing all the transactions needed to assemble the block. Miners would basically keep mining on the old block until they have the new block assembled? Or would they trust the merkle root and go full speed for the next block including only transactions that can't be in the prior block or no transactions at all to be save until they have the prior block assembled? These consequences are not clear to me yet.

Not sure if you read my contribution but you might read this:

2. create a transaction  that spends  to another of your addresses.
3. publish both  and  at the same time
Bots will get  and try to spend it, too, within half a second but they will probably get it half a second after you already sent  *and*  so chances are high your  will make it into many transaction pools, blocking the attacker's  from getting there.

The inverse bloom filter would allow us to have constant size block headers to communicate mostly the whole block regardless of its size as the other miners already know all transactions but that doesn't mean we could get to 250tx/s for free.
This block header could be added without a hard fork even, if it were sent in addition with the current protocol to those miners that support it, which they should to save bandwidth. 
250tx/s (on the blockchain) would still mean that miners have to download a blockchain that is 50 times bigger per year than what we have with today's rules and it would definitely require a hard fork.

Oh, great. I have a Freicoin-specific question:

I would love to see a Freicoin that doesn't spend a small percentage to miners but more like what the Wörgel did but to "people" as a basic income thing but know this is not possible without a central authority. How could a Sidechained Freicoin redistribute demurrage? Any plans on that?

If you have a sufficiently privileged virus targeted at Mycelium wallets on your phone, you will lose your coins. Always.
If you use *any* closed source on your phone, you will get such a virus at some point. Either from a sneaky modification to whatever market app you have installed or from an OTA update directly from google that some intern managed to get through. The incentives for this to happen are just too huge to not see that happen at some point.

* **Me**: Uhm, seriously, I mean BITCOIN. (Here I feel awkward cause I kind of have to either show them that I already knew the answer to the first question or I should keep pretending they accepted bitcoin and pull out my bitcoin wallet.)
* **Them**: sure, we accept red compra.
* **Me**: Bitcoin is not red compra.
* **Them**: Then no we don't accept it.
At this point some 5% ask about bitcoin and I readily explain it to them with a charged paper wallet.

Well, the added complexity would put money in sidechains at risk, not the money that doesn't choose to go into such instruments.
Sure, we would all be affected if substantial amounts flowed into a sidechain that had such a fundamental flaw that some attacker managed to get control over all its coins, bringing them all back at once and into his pockets. Much drama but not really much on the side of pure bitcoin users. If such drama was too much a strain on the bitcoin network, the above mentioned tax could be increased such that less money flows into poorly managed alt coins.
My point is that allowing SCs now is hardly a final decision. It can be gradually disincentivized (taxed) or it can be revoked, forcing SCs to stand by themselves.

Ok, cold spending was special because that's where I last noticed it as per my story ;)
Generally, if I charge my fresh Mycelium wallet, meet some guys and want to show them how cool bitcoin is, so I would want to send each of my friends 1mɃ. With the rules as is, this would fail, as the second friend would depend on the first transaction to confirm first. In the worst case I could only do one transaction every 10 minutes.
Now as I can't remember having run into this issue, how is a transaction that I did not sign off any different? At least, Mycelium should use its transaction confidence feature to allow chaining transactions at a certain threshold and not only after a confirmation that might take hours.

Not true. In countries with very high inflation, which is common in Africa, those few individuals that actually are interested in Bitcoin can soak up a lot of bitcoins at a high premium, so instead of paying a fee for getting money from US to Africa converts into a premium the recipient can get for selling his bitcoins to these individuals. I don't live in a 3rd world country but in Chile it is already easy to sell bitcoins at a 5% premium. I know in Argentina you get a higher premium easily. This alone is a high incentive to try it out.
For your other concern that you can't trade it for goods and services, well that's a hen and egg problem you can get around for now buy converting to fiat winning a premium but in underbanked societies there still is the hope that bitcoin will thrive as a way to hold money without carrying around cash.

I have a question: Why is it increasePayment only? I found some 2 way channel but I'm more thinking of reimbursement. So a 1btc channel might be used to pay up to 1btc but half way through it should effectively be a 2 way channel of 0.5btc shouldn't it? Sure the client would suddenly become responsible to publish the last tx but I would expect some allowBothWay() with some warnings on JavaDoc but else, why not?
sorry I'm travelling so investigating the api on my small phone is not optimal. 
The other thing that strikes me is the hard coded day. Is that soon to be changed or is there any reason for picking a day?

Sorry, I'm not missing that at all. I know a thing or two both about bitcoin and about Mike's work and I find it great from an academic standpoint. I'm just saying that in order to reach masses, you need to pick the users up where they are. People use blockchain.info which is supposed to be a very safe wallet thanks to the private keys never leaving my pc. If they now added lighthouse to their product, you could, again without your keys leaving your client, create and support lighthouse projects right "there on blockchain.info". If you already trust your money to coinbase, you could, if they would link to the same network like blockchain.info, create and support projects on that projects with a click of a button. If you already trusted paypal with your moneies, paypal could buy bitcoin on your behalf to allow you to participate again in such projects. Paypal could and would charge for being that gateway. blockchain.info would charge less but they would also charge in the one way or the other. The crowdfunding projects would not be advertised on lighthouse.com but on facebook, twitter, or any other social network but the ways to contribute could be various, including installing some lighthouse.exe/deb/apk.

Because complexity.
I gave them the 3x3 paper wallets and said they should put them into at least 2 different places and if in ten years from now they know what a bitcoin is, they hopefully find one of the places again. Sure, 3 years from now multisig will hopefully be as easy as anything else and most likely qr codes will be still supported legacy tech but today, if they want to use it, a simple private key is complicated enough.

Going for the domain will do more harm to him than going for the server as apparently he has control to change the ip quickly, so he already plans to server-hop when his first server is down. Both services might have his home IP (probably not but only asking to suspend his account would be too easy. There is a way to communicate with him and of course there is a slight chance to get him if you talk him into leaking information for some technicality)

Because it allows a downwards price signal without being invested before.
Experts that know why bitcoin will fail want to profit from that knowledge and can't if there is no margin trading. By margin trading they put their money where their mouth is and by doing this on a public trading book, others get a strong signal.
Short squeezing is what produces extra volatility but if all traders know what they are doing and know the market, they don't get short squeezed and as soon as the market works well enough with enough independent traders, none of them can short-squeeze anymore and the volatility goes down, not up thanks to margin trading.

If SecondMarket only pooled offers of small-time investors, it makes sense that their bid was close enough to market value, so if the auction did not sell at a discount this is no surprise. All these buyers could have covered their individual needs without moving the market each by himself.
If SecondMarket catered mainly to huge off-shore investors, things look a bit different. Then the bids might be actually at a premium for larger chunks and still not winning even one, it's interesting.

Please understand that standing at the point of sales, there is no difference between a statistical average of 1 minute or 5 minutes until my payment gets its first confirmation. This is a problem that will be addressed by other changes that basically don't require protocol changes.
Please read about transaction channels. They allow to update your balance with somebody (think: your telephone provider/supermarket/whatever) free of third party risk, fee-free, in increments of one Satoshi, instant, off the block chain (that is why it is cheap). This can be extended to peer to peer networks (think: email. You have your channel as pogeymanz and I have giszmo\ Now you pay me by granting mtgox the payment provided they proof they hand it on to bitstamp which in turn has to proof handing it on to me prior to you signing your transaction.) My guess is that Mike Hearn was hired by Circle for exactly such a solution with only one hop. With the server being opensource, you could send to Giszmo which would provide more privacy than having all on the blockchain.

Tomorrow my local meetup group will learn some things about Bitcoin mining. I did not really choose this topic and most likely it will be far over the top for most of the guests but I will try to keep it under 10 minutes.
The idea was to interactively show how most of bitcoin mining works, so they know what a block chain is, what a hash is, how the fees work and lastly that mining is not really free money.
I thought that this simplification of the mining process might be helpful for others out there, even if you don't speak Spanish. (I don't neither, so if native speakers want to correct me, please go ahead ;) )

Bitcoin (the store of value) can handle any amount. Bitcoin (the network) currently can't. There is ways around this without increasing the block size, one of which is micropayment channels. These are trust-less (technically if you use them via multiple hops, you would trust nodes for fractions of a second and could alert the world if one misbehaved, so they would never be trusted with anywhere close to what changetip now is trusted with), anonymous (technically, the provider you chose wouldn't need to know where you send money to handle your payment. It could be onion routed. The recipient could receive an end-to-end encrypted message so only he knows where the payment came from. The bitcoin blockchain as a whole would only know how much one address spend over the course of a year and how much another 1000 received but it would not see the millions of transactions that went on meanwhile.)

That's why your average server runs at about 95% load, right?

Sounds like a greedy miner could jump to 20mb blocks ahead of time, with the next jumping back to self-imposed 1mb blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:11:30
~~The suggestion would require the private key and some public data. That data could be provided for money by a service provider while normal full nodes pruned that data.~~
Striking it because the requirements would also be needed for a rescan of the blockchain, so the burden would not go away even if the miner gets the UTXO delivered at time of payment.

How is an interest group talking to its representatives in parliament illegal in any jurisdiction? How is making this process more convenient by having a guy near the politicians illegal? How is making the conversation environment as comfortable as possible for the politician illegal? How is giving friendly reminder of the conversation illegal? How is it illegal to sponsor political parties?
I guess, financial contributions to parties and politicians are limited or at least have to comply with transparency rules in most western "democracies" and I'm against lobbying behind closed doors in non-work ambiances such as one week luxury trip to Hawaii to discuss half an hour but lobbyists are exactly what you turn into as soon as you approach a politician to talk about your favorite toy bitcoin. If politicians approach the bitcoin foundation (yeah, they do), the bitcoin foundation is a lobbyist organization and better be prepared to use all its manipulative powers to get maximum effect with minimum risk of harming bitcoin. Staying within the law and making sure not to contribute to anything where a politician leaves the law in the process should be a priority and so they should know the lobbying laws.
Sure, many here hope to get rid of politicians but on the short run we have to deal with them and better know the rules.

Well, yes, their business is transparent except for the part where they can run away with 14000Ƀ with no risk at all.
Today I was sorting my hundreds of Bitcoin links and came accross BitBet and was shocked to see how some anonymous(?) milk is holding 14kɃ. Are the users actually that stupid?
BitBet is one of the places that should definitely use multisig in order to make scamming harder. They could still totally take all loosing sides, making customers bet on the winning side and then resolve dishonestly but they couldn't steal all their customers money that way unless they had infinitely more funds than the customers.
They could also pay somebody well known and trusted to confirm their judging, making it 3/4sig instead of 2/3sig and thus fixing that issue without much work to that trusted third party. That person would only serve to prevent all high-roller bets to get resolved unfairly at once and not to actually judge on single bets. A throttling mechanism if you so will.

Well, ChangeTip runs at aggressively low rates (zero?) to grow its user base. This is absolutely reasonable regarding their assumed low operational costs and the high assumed value once bitcoin takes off.
As I would though target a broader audience accepting paypal, national wire, prepaid cards and the other 500 ways to top up your balance. They are already considerable above the radar to avoid attention by regulators (Money Transfer Service anybody?) and not serving non-bitcoiners is kind of a weird strategy.
(I mentioned changetip and "ways" is certainly some moniker? But if I mention "0$", it should pick the lower value if interpreting this as a tipping intent? Complicated :) )

If they see any suspicious surge in whatever unwanted activity, they will quickly announce a cut-off date.
If it was my project, I guess I would reward loyalty and karma. Those who were loyal to reddit the longest and also were most welcome by the rest of the community are the biggest assets that deserve to get bigger shares. If Bitcoin were used, the smallest unit for a colored coin would be a Satoshi and issuing 100million of those for the 10% share would provide very good granularity to give all that were active at least 20 times a share and still give 100 shares to the most appreciated members.
I would think though, they might just not want to reward karma addicts with some x100 reward and go for a simpler model where all above a certain threshold in an array of metrics get just one share straight.

Thus if we reached saturation of the network by any means, people would fire up servers as now it would become profitable to do so.
Sure, we are not at a point where we need this, as the requirement to pay for syncing the blockchain would probably piss off new users and lead to less people pulling a full copy of all transactions, not more.

That was your reply to all such posts but what's the cost of not throwing away almost valuable mining hardware? If you are hesitant to buy in now and miss an x 10 increase, your miner would give you a way to join the ride.
on the other hand I bet there are many miners on hold now, that did not throw away, so difficulty could be in for dramatic increase if price goes north.

Cause it's a bullshit argument? Right now, bitcoin is much more energy efficient than producing, moving and securing the 5 million tons of coins and bills that are out there. This will get a little worse if the value run-up is too fast but eventually it will get better through block reward halfing.
(My personal opinion – and I know many are against that – is that we will eventually turn to proof of stake over the environmental issue. It might take a while to sort out how to do that and it might take a lot of work to convince people of its benefits but I doubt that 12 years from now bitcoin will still be POW only.)

They should reflect the actual server costs to not get spam, aka make it a flat fee.
I suggested this to gox many times and I don't know if MtChina has similar issues but Gox had a queue of an hour at times and that is certainly unfunnier than having some weird fee structure like:
* adding/removing orders: 10ct.
* order-days: 10ct.
Such a structure would incentivize people to place reasonable orders in order to not pay for years for the "I buy them all for 0.1ct" orders and would charge for what costs the matching engine. You could even add:
* receive 1ct. per order you remove from the book.
This would reward people for buying into the order book of many tiny orders.
But on the other hand I understand that server costs are not all, so exchanges have an incentive to provide an incentive to provide depth, so they tend to reward adding liquidity and punish taking liquidity.
… it all has it's pros and cons.
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:11:52
I doubt it will. Pools have to cooperate. Or in other words, if 5% of the hashing power cooperates with bitundo, you have a 5% chance of undoing a transaction or in other words you will be able to undo 5% of your transactions for the given fee. This will clearly make seemingly clean transactions disappear, so merchants now know they have to apply tools that they have to apply anyway and also this innovation will drive other innovations like my beloved (or 's) micro payment channels aka transaction channels. These provide instant payment without fees with increased anonymity, so I welcome everything that pushes development in that area as I consider it essential by next year, given the increase of block size.
@_date: 2015-05-06 04:27:52
The blocksize limit increase is a hot topic right now and Gavin gets some heat from various people that for the purpose of the joke may be called buttcoiners but generally, as I am part of that group, I hope there is more understanding of the implications than just saying it's people that want to hurt Bitcoin.

The interview?  Has bitcoins? 
@_date: 2014-12-02 17:44:43
Mining puts resources into machines and electricity equal to the amount of fees + block rewards.
In the beginning running on cheap machines and absent of fees, this meant that block rewards went into electricity bills.
With ASICS a significant amount goes into hardware, too. Mining is still financed by block rewards and fees are minimal.
If bitcoins value goes up x100 now, mining will increase x100. If not, mining will go x0.5 in 2016 first. And if bitcoin goes x100 only after 2020, rewards went down another x0.5 so mining would only go to x25 of today's level.

I don't hate alt coins in general. It's just that 99% of them are pump-and-dump scams. You tell me with a straight face that [over 1000 coins]( where most of them hold no technical innovation whatsoever (I include here all that use one different hashing algorithm, faster block times or faster retargets) are anything else than get-rich-quick schemes?
There are exceptions and while I don't hold any of those myself, I see some as nice test runs for how to do things better but in order to replace bitcoin, they would have to have:
* no pre-mine
* a fair and transparent distribution function (proof of work is at no time really predictably profitable. This is why I consider it very fair.)
* no centralization
* no steep distribution formula (weekly block reward halfing is essentially a pre-mine as only those involved would go all in on the mining.)
* no "we avoid asics with other POW algorithm" bullshit. If it's POW, let miners professionalize. Once the arms race hits the limits, it will result in Wall-Mart selling miners with your morning cereals.
* preferably no POW on the long run (waste of resource. if we can get the POS thing right, it would really be nicer and cheaper for all)
* preferably no block reward on the long run (inflation?)
* **high market acceptance** (yeah, sorry, you would have to invent a coin that's ten times better from a theoretical standpoint than bitcoin to beat the network effect)

As the more public posts about micropayment channels mostly explain the "I incrementally pay my phone bill" case, I give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you really did not see that last step after actually knowing about payment channels. Please assume now that you lock up money with reddit. It's still yours as you only put it into a payment channel. Reddit not having a channel with my servre at giszmo.com could have a channel with gmail and gmail giszmo.com (I don't own that url). Now for you (Pixmasterz to send me (admin money, your wallet would update its channel with reddit, reddit would update its with google, google would update its with giszmo.com and giszmo.com would update its with my wallet and my wallet would report to your wallet that the money was received.
The routing could happen based on fees that the intermediate servers configured and of course on white lists as you wouldn't want some new unknown rookies steal your money all the time.
Now, reddit wouldn't ever have to see "admin as this part is only relevant for giszmo.com etc (onion routing) and you could send in increments if you don't want to trust the system with the full amount, so the receiving wallet would talk to the sending wallet via an encrypted back channel and only if the reception was confirmed, the next increment would get sent. The costs would be slightly higher than email (yeah, slightly higher than almost zero).

In case you are not comfortable following links, this is a company announcing **they lost 15Ƀ**.
**Important Security Announcement**
In the early hours of Sunday 5th October, CryptoThrift was subject to a well-planned and clinically executed security breach. Our hot wallet was compromised and our attackers managed to steal a little over 15 BTC of funds that were held in escrow. The nature of the attack was such that it was not immediately clear that anything had happened, which is why it has taken us until today to take action.
Fortunately the majority of users funds being held in escrow were safe in offline storage, so the impact of this attack was lessened. Please be assured that any users that have payments or refunds due will be contacted over the next few days and your money will be paid. The owners of CryptoThrift are absorbing the cost of this.
Whilst we have not yet completed our investigation, we have identified the attack vector as a vulnerability in a third party plugin. This was used to inject SQL queries into our database and manipulate the amounts on transactions being released from escrow. What we have not made public until now is that we have seen sustained and almost-daily attack attempts on the site for many months. We have been in contact with the Australian Federal Police regarding this, and will be sharing with them all data that we have on this attack as well as all previous attempts.
This attack has prompted us to reflect on our security measures, and we have concluded that we need to make some significant changes to our escrow process, our storage of customers funds, and have a third-party conduct a full security audit. Until this is complete, we feel we have no choice but temporarily suspend our escrow service for our users, as we simply cannot risk holding users funds. Effective immediately, buyers will no longer be able to choose to use escrow when purchasing items. All existing transactions that are in escrow will be honored until they are released or refunded.
CryptoThrift is owned and operated by two guys, both with families and full-time jobs, who run this site in their evenings and weekends to try and create something new for the crypto community. We have made every effort to provide good customer service and have put 100% of all profits back into development, advertising, and marketing. A such, the cost of this theft is being covered by us personally. If our attackers wish to do the right thing and return our funds to us, they can do so by sending it back to 19bBwiFrAaCLxZZoS4grTDoFFVszxzvPMo. If any of our users wish to help, we would gratefully receive donations of support to the same address.
We must sincerely apologize to our loyal users for this breach and our decision to temporarily remove our escrow service. It is heartbreaking for us to see our hard work destroyed by cold-hearted, thoughtless, hackers.
Thanks for all your support, and we hope that you continue to use our site. If you have any comments, please feel free to share them on our blog post

How is it arbitrary?

In Chile we have 1 CLP coins. That's 1/600th of a dollar. I plan to not carry them around and neither return them to a bank until they get decommissioned. They are a pure annoyance. By returning them, I would be asking to give them into circulation. I guess I can live with a kg of fiat in my house.

Almost no false positives is clearly not desirable. Almost nothing filtered out, is also not desirable. If I understand you right, your problem is with bitcoinJ, not with bloom filters in general. So bitcoinJ should filter for a larger set of addresses? Doesn't sound like a hard thing to do. After all, it's just about setting some more bits in the filter.
That said, your post made me aware of a problem in bitcoinJ that I wasn't aware of, so thank you for that.

I don't know how one can move the price in the desired direction by only buying and selling smartly with lots of money at hands. People claim it is done and sure, if I want a lot of coins without slippage, I should not buy them at once on a market without liquidity but this slippage would not influence a major trend in any direction. It would only reward some traders that provide the liquidity quickly.
If I had the small change to buy that many bitcoins, I would definitely have my orders in at bitstamp near my auction bid. If both get filled, I am guaranteed that I can sell at a profit. If neither is filled, I would have my money at the exchange to do the according trade.
Maybe that is what was nailing the exchange rate to $380 all that time.

Empty blocks are no problem. At least not compared to artificial transactions to self. In the event of miners refusing to mine a majority of "real" transactions, it was suggested to require a minimum of bitcoin days destroyed to be a valid block.

Not really. This is a full node distribution and not a client distribution as the title suggests. Heartbleed only affects you if you use the payment protocol introduced in 0.9 or if you allow inbound rpc-connections using ssl.
Edit: I'd much rather conclude from these stats that people are not eager to upgrade to the weird 0.9x versions precisely because of this mess. Earlier versions made it onto full nodes much faster.
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:01:28
I fully agree. I just don't agree with the approach that now because we maybe reach full full blocks we need to make 20 times more room ASAP. I just want to have the current block size to be considered quite a load, too, so we can maybe not remove all pressure to care about block size for another 5 years. I want to get to 200MB blocks eventually over the next 15 years but my formula would be to do so gradually, so the pressure to find alternatives at least doesn't get less by 95% with an implied promise to do the same again in 5 years.
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:49:48
dust limits are to prevent spam and keep the system going. I find them quite arbitrary, too and would love to see bitcoin run at a constant 1MB/block, maybe with the suggested x% increase per year but otherwise I'd prefer to leave it to the market what transactions are valuable and what not. I guess we will overcome this artificial limitation as soon as blocks fill up.

Not exactly true. If you get paid per MB that you serve, you couldn't increase your profits by just serving your same content via a bunch of new IP addresses. At least not linearly.
If you only get paid part of what it costs to get the MB to my door, you wouldn't even make money doing so but it would reduce the costs for nodes.
Edit: Ok, the following is actually easy to sybil attack: ~~I could imagine a scheme where the address you paid to serves as proof of service and for things that make a big node favorable, you could pick one that had a lot of recent payments, which would be hard to achieve in a sybil attack.~~

Tell me if I'm wrong but to my knowledge, onecoin "is not a scam" because they sell high hopes in form of education for money. You can get onecoins only together with some indoctrination class and after having gone through enough of these, you qualify to also charge others for the same shit.
Nobody can send onecoins. The price is not a market price but the onecoin foundation publishes the value of a onecoin at will.
So yes, it might be a scam after all but the official line is certainly to not promise profits, so the individual promoters are the scammers but not onecoin as a whole. Something along these lines.

What? Gavin? Please review your blog!
As others stated, the mempool is currently in RAM why the UTXO is in a DB. Makes sense, as somebody might pull the plug and you wouldn't want to go through all the chain, especially not after pruning the chain. The mempool gets refreshed from other nodes quickly.
For full nodes it makes sense though, to have the UTXO also in RAM for fast lookup and transaction verification and therefore the UTXO is a very real concern. It is not prunable, so exponential growth outpacing Moore's law is a real problem, so yeah, I'm still with Gavin here.
The problem: Bigger blocks don't necessarily mean faster growth of UTXO. Transactions can both grow or shrink the UTXO depending on whether they (un-un-)spend many transaction outputs without generating new ones or not.
Limiting the block size does exactly nothing to prevent the growth of UTXO. To limit it, we would need an incentive to do so.
Approach one: Big transactions that consolidate UTXO should be high priority even without fees. People could then include their Satoshis from Satoshi Dice.
Approach two: We could expire UTXOs after lets say five years.

so if you have your coins spread out over many paper wallets that were all generated in a safe way, you might be fine but a rooted phone that you use to swipe your private keys might swipe the coins faster than you intend as a second "app" also reads the cam input.

Complexity might justify for some miners to not look further beyond a zero fee tx. A higher reward down the road might justify to search further.
Anyway, as x2 or x3 does not apply anyway, cause the incoming tx might already be huge and the merchant may be able to group 10 that paid at the same moment, the mark-up should be &lt;x2 in most cases. More like fee + minFee.

I doubt that. Mining rewards miners with 25Ƀ every 10 minutes or 1296000Ƀ per year. After the next split, that's half of that etc. For 1296000Ƀ, 1296000Ƀ/2, 1296000Ƀ/4, etc. to be nothing, Ƀ has to converge towards nothing. In recent years we have seen a valuation increase of Ƀ that vastly outperformed any reward splitting and I would assume that to continue for several more years.
We are at about 30% network load. Bitcoin can not handle 10x the transaction volume. Some transactions will go off chain and others will carry a bigger fee and in ten years from now, the block reward might well be smaller than the fees paid for transactions.

I see a problem with economics here. If I pay 0.1% annual interest for freezing coins, people will consider this, as long as it's constructed with no risk to them. If I pay my interest upfront and the coin owner signs those messages for me, it's a 100% safe investment.
So instead of a $1 proof of burn, your temporary proof of freeze costs me only $0.001 on the dollar. To achieve the same as the proof of burn, you would have to freeze $1000 for a year but then I could just as well burn $1 instead of paying another market participant for some pointless service.

21 million was an arbitrary number but the moment a value was attributed to a 21 millionth of all the bitcoins, bitcoin got a market cap and people trusted to own a share of that. Dilluting it now would break that social contract.
People sometimes thought that mining with their laptops was part of the social contract but that could not be kept up.
Likewise with the block size, perceived social contracts collide, with free transactions on the one and be your own bank on the other extreme.
We cannot have both but giving up on the latter will not give us the former later. The reverse might work though.

No surprise in that. Using my 10 years old keyboard gives me some trust though, that it might not be backdoored and I know it can't be targeting specifically bitcoin.
In general, I would prefer to have more control over what happens with USB devices. My system should explicitly ask me permission to interpret the connected device as a keyboard and only as a keyboard. A keyboard could still shoot commands as soon as it knows the system but a random pendrive could not act as a keyboard for example.
Or more generically, it should maybe be linked to a driver as the exclusive counterpart to a device. The driver being the only counterpart in my machine that the device can talk to and the driver being open source, would give me trust, assuming there was a way a device could be blocked from mimicking another device. Definitely a complex issue.

"The market disagrees" is a true statement in that the market at bitstamp/btce/coinbase/… is in the minus after that first trade having happened. I guess, letting this sink in a bit and waiting for the real action starting on OTC, with the spread becoming reasonable, things will lighten up a bit.

Factom is advertised with securing Project Gutenberg for example. To verify this claim, you need a way to reproduce the hash that was put into the blockchain.
For the land titles, if the audit is only an internal thing, it's better than nothing but you need to be able to get the state that hashes to the past version in order to verify historic entries. If somebody claims he owns my land and points to the Factom-verified database, that's not enough. I need to have a way of putting the version where I own it, next to it, so I can ask how it now ended up being his land. Else any admin can again declare that my land was unclaimed land, now owned by the admin.
Auditability is maybe the better word than public oversight. If my land title contains itself a hash and the hash tree is public, then I can proof how my title was part of the proofs until it was changed in block XY without my title having to be public itself, but this data, the hash tree, or at least the branch that leads to my title, has to be public.

If these devices pay each-other with bitcoin payment channels and collect fees from the cellphone users, then this can be pretty self-configuring.
Imagine it comes pre-charged with $2. If it doesn't collect cellphone fees and has to pay its neighbors more than it's generating by providing to other neighbors, it could go into partial down-times where it could still mine to be able to come back online. The person running it and paying the electricity bill could either sponsor it and configure it to be available when he decides it makes sense. He might also decide to not take his share of the mining rewards. Also as the device might have come to his house free of charge, he might not even see it as a scam that 21 makes 75% of the mining rewards.

It's so annoying. I tell you in Chile nobody knows his own postal code and it doesn't matter for delivery. Utility companies don't put it on the bills neither.
Sure, it has almost nothing to do with bitcoin but as people were excited about yet another bitcoin company I wanted to report back how their customer service deals with issues.
I understand that probably the rest of the world doesn't understand that a postal delivery can function without postal codes but Chile is proof of that. Automation is great but things work different in different countries and just as postal codes can be annoying, it can be annoying that here in Chile everybody expects you to have two family names to the point that you have to invent one as it's a mandatory input. Things work differently in different parts of the world and not sending a package to Chile for lack of a number that is (almost) meaningless here, is annoying.

Hardly sensational. The next difficulty increase can be guessed all the time and only the certainty narrows in on the actual increase the closer the event gets and as mentioned elsewhere, 20% is nothing (Look at the [all time logarithmic chart]( where the current difficulty increase is nothing compared to some really huge spikes earlier.). [THIS IS BITCOIN!]( (Sparta style)
Hash rate was flatting out recently as the profitability stalled/decreased but profitability is a function of your own costs, difficulty and $ per Ƀ, so with $ per Ƀ going up, people who switched off now, will switch back on again. There is certainly equipment that is not profitable now but will be profitable once we reach 1200$ again. I doubt though that we will reach 1200$ before we reach x2 difficulty.

There are many ways they might have left traces, so even having stolen the coins is not totally free of risk. The trickier part is spending them. Here, many exchanges and certainly bitstamp will jump at any clue they can get about the coins circulating. I wish bitcoins were fungible as I trade them only on localbitcoins, often even without going through their wallet, so if you have stolen coins, I will happily buy them from you without a clue but if the plot thickens that one of my suppliers actually has only stolen coins on sale, I will send LE their way to get myself out of the line of fire.
So, in my best interest, LE cares as little as possible about stolen coins. I want them to be un-stolen for the sake of bitcoins fungibility.

Working for Mycelium support I saw issues. One user paid "normal" fee but he was spending from a super low fee unconfirmed transaction that was 70kB big, so he had to wait two days for confirmation. We are thinking now if we can consider all upstream unconfirmed transactions when estimating the fee. Naturally this user would have seen a high high fee even for the normal option but if normal is a kind of 3-blocks-to-confirm guarantee, then that's what he would have had to pay for express confirmation. But it's tricky.
But overall no big drama. If anything, people might stop using the economy option when they really want next block confirmation now.

This sounds like an exciting voting mechanism and should be the norm for other features.
The Block header should contain a bit mask with one bit per BIP. If between two re-targets 95% of the blocks had a bit of a certain new BIP set, the others have until the next re-target to switch.
As also tighter decisions deserve to be rolled out without a complete mess, this could be extended to
* 2 re-targets with 85%
* 3 re-targets with 75%
* 4 re-targets with 65%
* 5 re-targets with 55%
So any change could be rolled out within a month if people consider it a no-brainer and a 45% minority would also see their loss coming with great anticipation.

I'm not sure if you don't understand sidechains or I don't understand you post, so bare with me:
Sidechains allow you to temporarly disable a bitcoin to create an amount of altcoins (proof of burn did this one-way, which is stupid) with the possibility to enable the bitcoin in the main net again, by proofing the destruction of the alt-coin amount.
You could have some ShibeCoin that come into existence by disabling bitcoins 100,000,000 to one and for each ShibeCoin destroyed, you could reclaim a Satoshi. This way, nobody would speculate on the value of ShibeCoins because they could freely move between the Bitcoin network (as Satoshis) and the ShibeCoin network (as ShibeCoins). With the two-way-peg, nobody needs to promise to buy them back for the "original value". It would merely be a split of coin and network, where the other network would allow using the same coins.
At least this is the advertised property of sidechains. In how far some bug might result in weakly implemented ShibeCoins coming back to Bitcoin all at once or weakly implemented Bitcoin result in all sidechained coins flowing back at once, I don't know. The former event would most likely kill the alt chain. The latter would cause much drama in bitcoin as many would probably advocate to save side chains with a hard fork (if the bug can be resolved at all).

The inverse bloom filter does not only help to find out if a transaction is in a block but also tells, where, so you can forge the block without having to transfer all the transactions. You will have to transfer the header and the inverse bloom filter itself and you will have to shuffle around transactions to solve the puzzle and that is most likely linear in the count of transactions but neglectable compared to downloading the whole block. So while indeed orphaning will increase with block size, it will first of all decrease massively with inverse bloom filtering.

I suggested that in [its own reply]( But as I said there, the hacker will not come forward if bitstamp doesn't make such an offer. If he says, "for 5% I will bring it back", he's an extortionist. If they say, "we will not ask questions if somebody brings back part of the bounty and whoever it is, may keep x% of it", the hacker can legally keep the money and be the white hat like johoe. And I mean it. No matter what deal bitstamp comes up with, we should leave it at this and see the half-honest finder in a positive light. We win transparency and part of the bounty back.
Ok, what about an inside job? If the admin confesses? Well, then again, bitstamp did a poor job at controlling their staff. Maybe a hot wallet has to be multisig, too, with 3 admin boxes having to confirm any cash out. These 3 admins would have very high incentives to maybe even hide security measures from each other, to catch a corrupt colleague.

Well, we would have to account those faster blocks as fractions of confirmations or else the users would have to get used to new notions of "6 confirmations".
(I'm a strong advocate against this 6 confirmations bullshit, where I can't buy a coke without 6 confirmations but that's another topic. With the faster blocks, I would still consider the first block that includes the transaction as millions of times more likely of a transaction being final than an unconfirmed transaction.)

I appreciate the work Gavin is putting into this but I would highly recommend agains increasing the block size together with the introduction of reverse bloom filters. Not all the world has fast internet. Just as an example, in Iran running a full node already works at the limit of university grade internet connections, so catching up on bitcoins history would be done with DVDs.
I totally agree with 50% per year increases but please don't go for this insane x20 now that we finally hit the limit occasionally which is necessary to have mining fees play a role at all.
Also it is irrelevant if we can handle 3tps or 60tps when we want to replace a 200.000tps industry. For this upscale we need other technology like transaction channels. Strawpay and others working on that will loose years if the bitcoin community stays ignorant towards the need to invent new tools rather than increase the limits in old tools.

In Mycelium, spending unconfirmed UTXOs goes without warning if it's your own change output. Due to malleability, this is already a bit critical but the alternative, to use RBF would be even scarier, especially given the controversy that it still sparks all over the place.
If you try to spend money you haven't actually received yet, results in a warning but I stand behind the possibility to ignore that. CPFP to increase the incentives to actually get this money is just one argument there.

**Edit:** Pulled up into its own post [here](
**Review of the paper**
The authors suggest to use transaction channels as described on bitcoin.org under [micropayment channel]( They explain these, too.
A payment channel is a 2 out of 2 time locked script, where the two parties agree on how to distribute the coins in the address, initially provided by one of the parties, among them. The paper calls the parties A (the funder of the the channel) and B, the recipient.
Then they go on and suggest to add one or several parties D to the output of the channel. A and B agree to attribute part of the funds to party D (D1, D2, etc.). Here is, where there lays a huge problem for D. If A and B collude to take the funds from D, they can at any time prior to closing the channel.
The authors continue, fixing this issue by closing the channel immediately with the attribution of funds to party D (giving it max priority). (Not mentioned in the paper but D could receive the closing transaction and thus would not be susceptible to A or B disappearing. Still, A+B could collude against D and try to double-spend the closing transaction, rendering the benefits of a trust-less system trust-based. D has to trust B or A. Still better than having to trust A.)
Finally, the authors introduce the missing C, which is a fund provider to open channels. I guess the point is to bridge the gap between channels or something.
My conclusion is that this merely is better than greenaddress, as it requires D to trust B (assuming D doesn't generally trust A).
**My suggestion for a truly safe transaction channel infrastructure**
As suggested many times before although never in completeness, I again suggest to standardize payment hubs as follows:
* Lets call the payers A1, A2, ...
* Lets call the payment hubs B1, B2, ...
* Lets call the liquidity providers C1, C2, ...
* Lets call the recipient D1, D2, ...
Each A maintains a channel with one or many B.
Each D either trusts one or many B to pay them at any interval or pays them an amount to open a channel towards them for a given time. Standard credit rates apply. (Actually this credit should be much cheaper as a default is not an option.) For the sake of argument, lets assume D pays B $10/month to open a $1000 channel. More on that rate down below.
A keeps a channel to his respective B open at all time. Basically he could have all his funds in that channel, locked up for a year if bitcoin migrated to use this scheme globally.
To make a payment A1 to D2
* A1 would update his channel with his B3 assuming B3 is A1's hub
* B3 would update its channel with B4 assuming B4 is D2's hub
* B4 would update its channel with D2
* D2 would confirm having received the funds to A1
some properties:
* If A1 doesn't trust the chain too much, it could pay in tiny increments. $1 at a time. It should be possible to send at least 10 transactions per second, so you could still funnel through big amounts quickly if you go in 1% increments.
* Funds being lost by a player would be identifiable, thus making it easy to proof to others that a certain player is not to be trusted.
* A has to only trust his B and should demand proof that the fund got lost down the line from there in order to not blame B in case of lost funds. This way, players would be incentivized to use channels but if they trust each other, they could even settle their balances differently. D2 could trust "his bank" to owe him the funds instead of funding a payment channel to his wallet.
**Bi-directional channels**
The scenario above requires the recipient to be connected, so that the reception of incremental payments can be confirmed. If the reception doesn't need to be confirmed, D being online is no requirement. B4 could forward funds later. (trust required!)
Assuming though that the recipient is online in the moment of payment, which would be the case in 100% of POS situations, the receiving channel could be updated but the recipient would still be susceptible to the wrong final transaction being published if it misses the time slot to publish its most favorable transaction. This problem led to the notion that the receiving end of a channel has to be a server and the sending end may be an occasionally connected client.
It is trivial to solve this issue by paying servers to publish the most favorable transaction at the favored time. Any receiving wallet could require 3 versions of that receiving transaction, each with another further recipient out of 3 servers that offer to broadcast transactions. The recipient could now share these 3 transactions with the 3 services and now these services would compete to broadcast the transaction at just the right time in order to get the reward. The recipient could for a fraction of a cent be sure that his channel gets closed with his transaction being considered. Should the sender try to publish the prior version where the payment was not made, miners would pick up the version from the 3 servers due to higher priority. **(turns out, the way these servers could get paid is not that trivial. Assuming the broadcast of a transaction is worth less than dust levels, the payment would have to be done via channels, too, so there would be no need to forge 3 transactions unless the fingerprint of those transactions was used to determine which of the 3 servers actually delivered based on which transaction ended in the blockchain. Anyway, such a service is would have only minor privacy issues.)**
Now this in turn would allow to use channels bi-directionally. D having received funds could update its channel to send those funds back to his B, making the situation symmetric.
**Further considerations**
Parties could incentivize their respective other ends of channels to close those channels to free funds.
C could offer their funds anonymously (I can elaborate on that in another post), resulting in fair prices for their customers and way to invest bitcoins without risk.
C might even offer negative commissions as C would essentially launder funds. I'd delegate this issue to the ethics commission.

You can be a total Satoshi evangelist and annoy everybody (less those businesses but more your peers when you do the bitcoin thing again, like asking something just to get a question about bitcoin in return) or you can support bitcoin businesses and take some extra pain doing so.
I did the former and I do continue doing it from time to time and I did the latter just before yesterday when I booked a flight for 4, which was by far the highest price I ever paid online. CheapAir.com got my business and Lan.com. Lan would have been cheaper but the price was four times my credit card limit, so I basically had little choice.
Know where you can spend your money in bitcoin. Don't hesitate doing so cause you know how to buy in again. And don't pay 20% extra cause why the hell would we through good money at businesses just to advertise it? I did pay mark ups but I refuse to top up my mobile at those few sites that offer the service if they charge me 20% more. Once, ok, to send out a message but not regularly. I am not Satoshi.

You can take the cash out of the cash counter into your paper bag and now the full paper bag has the value of the cash.
Before, it might have had the value of the cash and the cash counter but nobody – I double-swear nobody – has a problem pricing the cash in the cash counter or the paper bag.

My first thought was that a proof of not having been spent would be impossible but your suggestion would be to maybe have the Merkel root of the UTXOs in the block header and update it accordingly, so spending an old coin would still be possible if I provide the full history of that coin back ... back to what? I pruned it all. How would that proof look more in detail?

I'll counter this with a very far comparison:
If you can transport gold using the logistics company Gold Express Inc and Shib Express Inc., where is the problem in valuing Gold, Gold Express Inc. or Shib Express Inc.? These are three entities, one being a commodity and two being logistics providers. With bitcoins via Bitcoin Network or Shib Network you have the same situation. You might not feel save sending your coins using Shib and yeah, the Shib trucks might fall over and somebody from Bitcoin might come by and pick them up but that's a logistics issue, not a commodity issue.

I'm evaluating options. If people line up for soap, they might consider bitcoin as an option. This can help the people there get something of more value than soap and it can help me get some nice time at a beach. If bitcoin allows me to buy stuff at the actual rate and $$ users run into controls you can circumvent with bitcoin, then maybe this helps bitcoin in getting adoption, me in getting a cheap holiday on the [beach]( and some Venezuelans in getting something of value for their business.
The very harsh reaction from you and make me fear for my security though, putting into perspective the saving potential I see.

I understand bitcoin and micropayment channels (as Mike Hearn calls them) or transaction channels (as I prefer to call them more generally. 
The need for instant confirmation and increased anonymity is omnipresent and not limited to "paying a stream in increments". With both ends being equals, you can use a channel in both directions. The weak point as mentioned above is the recipient having to be online not only when receiving money but also to close the channel in a timely manner. For closing the channel, no sensitive Information is required, so it can be delegated to a hub for example. This would allow me to use 1year channels for most my needs most of the time. Symmetry would also allow to pay back a payment if the shop wants to.
Hubs should settle their mutual debt and could do that even without channels if they trust each other just like the recipient might trust his hub. Outgoing channels bind resources so there is an incentive for trust over channels.
Hubs can steal any money relayed via them. I suppose, the network would quickly learn about corrupt hubs. Users can decrease their risk though by sending only small increments. Sending $1000 $1 at a time would still be faster and cheaper than an on chain transaction but would limit the risk to $1, provided hubs are with some solid reputation (proof of burn based id...).
Now promissory notes is what exactly? Does it render pointless any of the assumptions I made?

@_date: 2016-03-05 14:56:26
There is legitimate use cases for chains.
The other day at Mycelium we had a customer who spent for days, ignoring that his transactions didn't confirm. It all was due to an incoming low fee 90kB transaction that he was spending from. CPFP would have required to further extend that chain, so miners wanting the fee attatched to the tenth transaction would have had to confirm the whole chain in one block.
Some services still chain transactions when paying their users, although some switch to RBF like localbitcoins.com.

Could you elaborate?
As I didn't bother to elaborate myself:
**Why not micro?**
The 2-of-2 timelocked script allows to handle any quantity of bitcoins and calling it micro implies that it would be less secure (don't trust it with much) or otherwise inferior for non-micro payments.
**Why not payment?**
The script links two keys to agree on what to do with it. This may be any transaction (which is the term used in the whitepaper) and is not limited to paying anything.
**Then why channel?**
Well, it's between two, so I like the channel analogy and transaction channel is sufficiently distinct to not be confused with anything else when googling it.

Mycelium already has xpub export on the account level. Sure it should be automated to give new ones along a nick name. Guess they fear the increase of addresses to be watched. 20 look ahead per account.
guess at some point we should standardize to forget old addresses. Reuse should not be expected after a month of receiving money to an address higher in the account.
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:58:57
Ok, orphaning happens. We know that since the white paper. Still there is some expected amount of orphaning that we should monitor. Nobody does monitor this systematically? I scrolled through some pages now and some cases raise my interest, where there is double-forking happening, with one of the forks even being expanded on once. These cases lool to me like could it be that the main chain is result of a deliberate race against honest, non-cooperating other miners? With just one such case in months, it doesn't look like an attack and if it wasn't pure randomness, it was probably just a test but we should be on the watch for these metrics.

As others stated, it is added now. Andreas' point was for a very long time that there is no security in a short password and there is no way people will use strong passwords on a mobile device.
Ok, I'm spoiled. I just wanted to try out the Schildbach wallet (yeah, that's another issue: Andreas insists in it being called "Bitcoin Wallet" which I refuse to call it and due to lack of a better name, I give him honor via calling it Schildbach wallet. Kind of a silly struggle.) and saw there is no BIP39 support.

And that's exactly the point why centralized markets never had predictive power. Either they allowed arbitrary statements or they had liquidity.

Sorry Mike, I'll try to not misrepresent your usage of words in the future. It's just that I would love to see "micro" to be left behind as a historic, too narrow description of the technology. It hinders broader adoption to see it "only" solve micro payments. ("Transaction" vs. "payment" tries to further broaden the scope but that is maybe silly cosmetic.)

When you ask for convenience, you obviously talk about convenience for those that have to live with your fiat-allergy, so how is this:
Assuming your relative is available every day near his office to give cash to somebody during lunch time, you could find a bitcoiner on loclabitcoins to receive that money at one of the days. Then when you arranged the deal, you tell your relative the time he has to be at the place you agreed on and tell your relative the confirmation code. Have him show the money to the stranger, ask for the confirmation code and once he tells him the confirmation code, hand over the money. For your relative it's really that simple. Now you have to find the most reliable of all traders in the area so your relative doesn't loose patience waiting for him but I see this pretty convenient.
* Be at the Flowers Café with the money at 1pm. Frank from localbitcoins will be there, too.
* Show him the money and ask to release the payment
* If he can't tell you the release code y45th, don't give him cash. if he can, give him cash. Under no circumstances show him the code prior to him releasing the bitcoins. In doubt, skype me.

It can be taken from them. They might go to jail over it. Bitcoin is not at all fungible as we like it to be.
Also what does Bitstamp gain if they go to jail, as it is true that the bitcoins can possibly not be taken from them even if they get caught.
So you suggest stealing bitcoins is completely without risk? I doubt that. I bet there is a %% Bitstamp could offer to get them partly back. 60%? 90%? 99%? No matter what, I would prefer it over all the bitcoins being lost, with "dirty" bitcoins floating around and people bringing the black-listing of them up again. I want IT security to be more important than legal obligations. I want a company to fix things on a technical level, not by jailing people with all the legal costs involved. In Germany it is illegal to sniff unencrypted traffic, so ICQ and many many other services didn't use encryption. Sniffing on them only to show how blatantly open they send stuff around is illegal. It shouldn't. And neither should it be illegal to grab a wallet that lays around on some server without protection. Sure, sniffing ones neighbors ICQ traffic is a moral issue. I did it for some minutes once just to see for myself but I was under the threat of punishment if I had shared proof of my sniffing. That is stupid and doesn't advance technology.

You might think that the [Factom Blog]( could have something on that.
(Also, where does the data ultimately get stored? Proof of existence with a hash in the bitcoin blockchain is the easy part but where would all the land titles and documentation ultimately be stored? Would that only be an addition to timestamp the existing land title database to prevent those land grabs by admins? Or would they allow third parties to pull the whole thing for reference, so that the historic hashes can be audited? If not the latter, a hack would only result in an unnoticable change in the new hashes and upon audit, you would have no chance of finding which entry actually was messed with.
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:10:30
Right now, the blockchain runs at 30% capacity. If 7 billion people had channels and channels were the only mean to transact, the channels would need to stay open as long as it takes for 7 billion people to open and close a channel (2 transactions of the 3tps kind). 7B * 2t / (3t/s) = 150a. So my napkin says that if we all jump at transaction channels now with Bitcoin as is, channels should be open 150 years which is more than a life span, so no, we can't accommodate all the people, even if we gave them life long channels.
With Gavin's x20 change, we are down to 7 years. Much better.
Assuming gradual adoption (doubling every year) and 50% block increase per year, we would migrate to channels eventually but that would be another napkin.

@_date: 2015-05-28 00:30:05
I support this form of trolling as it shows how pointless an x20 increase is. Transactions in Bitcoin are not free, were never meant to be free and will have a very real price very soon and we should better make a transaction count. With lightning or any other hub and spoke network or even with centralized services like changetip as an interim we can still use the underlying asset but not store for all eternity that today we played luckybit wagering 12ct.
Should we kick the can? Yeah, maybe a bit but not x20 in one go. We should have a longer vision for 10 years maybe. Lets get to xWhatever in 10 years, starting with x2 in some months, but without having to negotiate the next steps later. Bitcoin's promise is that it's ruled by math, not men, so we should mess with the rules in really large intervals, not at a whim every now and then. If we do x20 now, then it should be clear for how long 20MB is the rule, as it will not be enough for the worlds demand even with hub and spoke if we assume a yearly settling.
@_date: 2015-05-09 04:14:39
First, it's not arbitrary and second, we are changing the social contract all the time. Providing a working system is just as much a promise, so you can't hold all the promises without ever bothering the users.

With these arguments we would have to remove all limits. I say instead we have to consider how to actually enforce a limit. Any limit.
I slowly join Gavin's camp regarding the specific limit, as even a lightning network would need more than 1mb block size. The goal of growing every time we hit the limit, I explicitly don't share. Fees are accepted by the miner but the transaction is a burden to all future miners. Therefore we should find ways to reduce the burden for future miners. Also hub and spoke can add extra anonymity that could be superior to on chain transactions.

The re-org rate will go up with larger blocks with all other things constant. Reverse bloom filtering will bring it down though and the benefit of reverse bloom filters should be almost constant block propagation speed, no matter the size. Also a re-org with inverse bloom filters is dirt cheap. But yeah, all in all it's one more argument to implement inverse bloom filters first and then increase the block size ( 50% per year as I would prefer, 2000% now + 50% per year as Gaving prefers).

WTH am I looking at? Ok, I'm a Bitcoin fanatic so as long as my security judgement allows me, I install any app and give it a try but this has at least two blocker issues:
1. coinbase or blockchain? Seriously? Why not Mycelium? You're not going to get access to my coinbase or blockchain credentials anyway, so why limit it to one of these services. You can ask me for a dedicated receiving address and how I sign off on transactions should not be any of your business. If your service costs money, ask for money and I will pay you but not in a pull fashion.
1. The market place shows me stuff from New York. Hey, there is something called "world". Look it up in a dictionary. It's really big and amazing. For what it's worth I'm in Chile and any guitars from the USA are of no use to me. I can't see where I can sort by distance.
@_date: 2015-05-11 06:22:58
It's not the same even with constant block propagation. If you live in a geography with higher ping, 1/10th block time puts you at a huger disadvantage than you had anyway.
If sending your share takes 3s as opposed to 300ms, your stale rat increases from 0.5% to 5% as opposed to 0.05% to 0.5%. The one looses 0.45% profit, the other 4.5%.

Updated my comment. Sorry for spreading false information albeit with a disclaimer.
So a 24h jump is just a block like any other but others are encouraged to reject it if it's ahead of their system's time? Or in other word, if such a block would surface and I wanted to build on top of it, I would maybe have to tweak my timestamp, as jumping backwards is limited?

SPV mode is something for the new wallet. Problem is that SPV is not at all a privacy feature. By being interested in 100 addresses but not in the rest, you link those 100 and that's basically what SPV wallets do with random nodes, one node at a time but the same set of addresses with many nodes over time, while the Mycelium wallet does it with just one "node". Using TOR helps to not link an IP address to the set of bitcoin addresses but the bitcoin address linking is a huge and mostly overlooked issue.
This address linking can be prevented by either downloading one address at a time (users expecting to see incoming transactions on all their hundreds of addresses all the time will not like that) or by downloading significantly more addresses. How significantly? Well, best you download all addresses because if you are interested in one chain of change addresses but else, only in unconnected addresses, this chain will be the top candidate of "your addresses". Your filter better catches all addresses, including future addresses of other people's change chains. That is bad, so anything short of downloading almost all transactions can't protect you from snoopy SPV nodes.
Alternatively you totally prevent address reuse and only query one address at a time and store the result, so you never have to query it again. Doing this, over TOR gets close to full node privacy. Or you trust some node to not store the relationship between addresses, which is what you have to do if you use Mycelium.

Hi you are definitely one of those guys that have the necessary understanding to comment on my proposal.
I guess I covered the pitfalls. You don't elaborate on details but let me comment on each of them:
* In my scheme, the possibility of entities trying to publish transactions that are not of the highest priority is addressed in the last part. Publishing those high priority transactions to servers that will broadcast them at the right time should not bring much negative implications with it. One thing is that the channel provides privacy in that all the tiny transactions that are not published would provide privacy that gets lost if you suddenly share them with many servers again but that's optional and you could run your own server for that.
* Please elaborate. My scheme assumes that the recipient also does use payment channels and that the recipient is online but it also covers where you just pay to the bank of the recipient. I could live with google holding my coins while I'm offline, as long as I can get them instantly and out of google's control when I come online.
* The constraints you are talking about is the hardest selling point for channels. People would have to lock up funds without the intention to send them now. This would drive people to believe that those funds would be out of their control but I guess that is a subject for education. The fact that the intermediary would independently also need huge funds, is addressed in the OP via the lenders (C).
* see the prior point.

It's because the miners don't take any responsibility for the money transacted. Banks do, so they have a good excuse to charge more for bigger transactions. For miners, a transaction is "big" if it spends many outputs or pays to many addresses and that is the measure they charge by.
Free, high priority transactions are just a result of spam protection. The minimum fee exists such that nobody can spam the blockchain for free.

It is and always was 51%. If Core says x%, then what they really say is that if x% is not reached, they will do all they can to rescue the loosing branch. Of course, if option B reached 51% support you will always find somebody to suggest to lower the threshold arbitrarily, as that would result in them winning. And precisely this option assures me that even if Core turned evil, it wouldn't mean that we would need 95% rescue Bitcoin.

No. With my proposal, any player along the line (and that typically contains one or two Bs) could trick him/her out of the one partial payment being processed at that point. They don't need to work together to do that.
The workings of a one-to-one channel are clear and secure. The workings of a multi-hop depend on a recipient to send the money on. My model though closes the loop in that the wallets talk to each other either end-to-end encrypted via the route or via a side channel and the wallets can work in increments, so that never more money is at risk than the processors are trusted with. Those processors do have a reputation and can charge for their service. A new processor would get high scrutiny. Maybe no client would want to trust it, as spawning millions of "free" hubs could be the next scam model, where the hubs all pull the plug all at once and the money in limbo is gone but with the right incentives, this is very unlikely to happen. Companies like bitpay and coinbase would certainly run hubs for their customers and would be trusted by them but also anonymous hubs could easily exist. They could do a proof of burn over $100 in order to get trusted for 100ms over $0.1. Boom, a new hub is born. It takes 0.1% for its service and if it would hold $100 at some point, then either some person trusted it with way too much money, or it was processing more than 1000 transactions in parallel (not necessarily 1000 transaction per millisecond, as it could grab the first increments of all transactions until word has gotten arround that the gateway is corrupt, but still, with people risking $0.1 at a time, even with 10000 clients being scammed, running the server and the proof of burn and stuff would be worth more than that.). On the up-side the service that manages to have 1000 transactions per … lets say hour, could already see a profit, as it should be free of maintenance. Sure, server security would be an issue, as the outgoing channels would be holding a lot of money but that would be the hub's money and not the money of people using the hub.


If I understand that right, you agree with me on the double-spending issue in the impulse.is proposal.
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:33:23
5 months later I'm not sure what my insights were about me forcing you to lock up funds but in general channels have an opportunity cost of funds getting locked up that has to be accounted for. If you want me to put $100 in a channel because you indicate you will make me owe you this amount over the year in a million increments, using on chain transactions is no alternative and with a channel I would lock up an average of $50 over that year, that could earn me interests. So in absence of relative lock time I would have to charge at least the expected interest to not be susceptible to a DOS attack. You put $2 in, so I put in $100, with me getting the $2 if you disappear (compensating me for 2% of lost interest) for the full year but with the promise to account for the lost interest rate depending on how funds move. If you turn out to receive money quickly, you reduce this collateral quickly.
@_date: 2015-05-09 16:04:24
~~It could be a pure fee thing. The miner could have a hash to protect against DOS attacks but otherwise not bother digging up the UTXO from RAM, HDD, Google if the fee is too low. Putting the burden on the spender by requiring him to send the UTXO would require all wallets to be updated while with the potentially higher fee, it would be mined eventually, even if some miners wouldn't bother to dig it up.~~
Edit: I feel bad about sharing unfinished thoughts :( As it wouldn't be enough to have the first miner somehow get the information but all the full nodes, there would not really be a way around providing it along with the transaction that mines an old UTXO if we decide that the UTXO pool had to be refreshed after a certain time. Else it breaks re-validation.

Bitcoind does accounting for you if you so wish but you can always move coins out without mentioning an account which leaves the balances unbalanced. This is for cold storage for example. The user would get an error. You would send funds back to the wallet and the user could withdraw again.
I have no idea how many projects actually rely on the built in accounting of bitcoind or if it is advisable but this is a feature and not a bug.
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:29:24
Payment channels are like shared accounts. You put in $100 and only if the other party signs to return the full $100, you actually sign your part to charge the account, as now all that's missing to get the money back is your signature.
Next you work with priorities. The first transaction that gives you back all the money has priority 1.
Now the other party might say: Lets split the money $99/$1 with priority 2 (signed by other party). If you sign that, too, you would only get back $99 and the other party would get $1.
The whole shared account would have a life time during which you wouldn't be able to actually spend the money but holding the contract signed by the other is as good as owning the money as in case of both publishing their version of the contract, the higher priority would win.
This scheme can be chained. It can be executed very quickly. These are the building blocks of the OP.

Sadly, coinshuffle is just an [idea]( so far, with the most advanced implementation being [Shufflepuff]( by (uhm, that name changed since I last checked before my vacations :) )
Current [joinmarket]( has as a simplification that the takers pay for mixing, giving them full transparency of the matching between inputs and outputs, while coinshuffle in theory would not give any participant this extra insight. The implication of this is profound I find: The benefit of doing A coinjoin depends on others knowing where my coins went, so with one person knowing the matching, it renders the whole coinjoin pointless for all the others. Assuming a 10 participants coinjoin with one learning the matching vs. nobody learning the matching, the former only benefits one, at the cost of 10 on-chain transactions, while the other benefits 10 at the cost of just one on-chain transaction per benefiting participant.
Also the coinshuffle paper talks about 50 participants while I doubt there ever was a +15 participant joinmarket transaction but that's more esoteric as long as there are no established competing products to compare. After all, joinmarket is looking into coinshuffle as well, although I can't find an issue to back that claim. On IRC they sounded open to that, if somebody would do the heavy lifting.

Thank you for trying to help but I guess the suggested feature is not the solution. I closed your issue with a reason given. Please feel free to comment.
Basically it boils down to the suggested change not catching what most likely happened here (I bet spent change from the first tx in the second tx), with the history being wrong but the UTXOs being right. I also tried to derive some feature that might protect users but that would have to go into a new issue.

Ok, so a user gets his first coins into a fresh account and immediately wants to pay ... two bets on a betting website like bitbets.com for example, where there are no repercussions if a transaction doesn't confirm. Does he have to wait maybe several blocks for the incoming TX to confirm, do a bet with high fees to get it confirmed quickly so he can spend the change output on the second bet?
At Mycelium we had some trouble with malleability but not being able to spend one's change UTXOs would be a very annoying thing and if we introduced RBF as a sender (we detect it when receiving), would kill us. Randomly increasing the UTXO count would not work for above example, would bloat the block chain, increase the fees and not fix the problem, so what's the options?

We are now limited to 3tps or 30tps thanks to bitcoin banks (what you call offchain services really are bitcoin banks, as offchain services would also cover sidechains and payment channel solutions like lightning). With 3MB, that would still only be 90tps. Compare that with Visa's 45000tps.
I don't think that we will compete with Visa in the next two years but I think that we will have the technology in place to play in the same league and that will not be due to 1500MB blocks but due to sidechains, payment channels or other solutions that don't involve full nodes storing all transactions for all eternity.

Maybe Bitcoin Core is mostly unaffected.
I work for Mycelium. If Mycelium gets sued, the Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet will be affected as it could lose its paid developers.
Now if a DAC picked up from there, it could hire anonymous developers leaving nobody to sue. Sure, a DAC would not easily publish through iTunes and play store but that's another story.
Now you bring up trust and probably I don't understand your point here but many wallets that are advertised as being open source, almost everybody only uses the compiled binaries.
If there are no deterministic builds in place, it boils down to trusting whoever built that binary. In that respect I don't see how a DAC is worse than a company. After all a DAC could provide deterministic builds, maybe paying users for discovering discrepancies.

Call me paranoid but I just don't feel safe with this. Too complicated. Too non-transparent from a user perspective.
I bet the ledger team has best intentions and I will eventually buy some of those nanos to get more involved and give more educated opinions but for a start, any USB device could perfectly claim to be a keyboard, mouse and disk and go amok and do whatever on my machine. I assume you can seed it somehow with your own key but also I assume that the default operation is to use what it comes with, which is kind of tricky to trust.
Again, the ledger is most likely more secure than my setup but it highly relies on trust, as we can't decompile everything that's on the chip.
I guess a device that I trust would have to communicate via low bandwidth channels where I can send it a transaction for signing, have a display and a button on the device to actually sign, and have the signature come back low bandwidth again.

I share a bit opinion from [this post]( but I also understand very well why will not promise bigger blocks, as described in the [criticized post]( due to the risk that a too easy hard forking would bring. I don't fear an ossification of the protocol. If all agree that we need bigger blocks, we will get bigger blocks but having only 80% agree with fierce opposition from the other 20% – to the point that these, including the core devs, continue their fork with only 20% scares me much more than a few months with even absurdly high fees. If transactions cost $100, yes, most people that are now buying [gadgets]( or [cellphone minutes]( will stop doing so but we will fix it and not declare dead a technology that people are willing to pay $100 to use, 3 times per second. Better a pause with these things than putting at risk the decentralization and thus censorship resistance.

Edit: As points out below, the following statement is completely unrelated. I wish I could wrap it in easy words to explain why but thinking about it, I am convinced he is right. A try: The pull request in question suggests to allow a miner to create a block with fake timestamp of now+24:01 and other miners would build on top of it without checking any signatures in the prior block at all. With segWit miners would always verify signatures of new blocks and probably of months worth of blocks.
With segWit the idea is that you can speed up full block sync by skipping the signature check **and** download. I would be surprised if a full node defaulted to do something like that any soon. Either way, if skipping is added, it should be optional with either opt-in or opt-out.

The market is also asking for free transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:49:56
Big companies that do many transactions per block currently depend on chaining these. If some malleability attack changes the first transaction, all others become invalid. This results in delays and confusion. With rbf they can reduce the transaction chaining and avoid these malleability issues.
Standard users should really not default to using rbf. I work at Mycelium and we will definitely deal with the receiving side long before providing rbf on the sending side.

Thin clients are the predominant species in the wallet space. A thin client can connect to a known full node, which is what all Mycelium users do, although through yet another proxy. You can also connect to several fullnodes, which is what the Schildbach wallet does.
@_date: 2016-03-16 02:33:34
When talking to the Mycelium servers you can use TOR and if not, you are at least using https to talk to a small collection of servers under the control of a single entity.
If you trust Mycelium somewhat (maybe because they are from a jurisdiction you like from your personal perspective) then this might be a good thing compared to sharing your wallet's address SPV mode with different random full nodes every time you start your SPV wallet.

What are the payment requests in more detail? Can they be re-used? Does the recipient get some "lightning network ID" of who paid it? If not, can the payer proof the payment?
Is the following possible: gambling site has 5 options with 5 different payment requests that are static and can be bookmarked. Gamblers can put their wagers. In case they win, they can proof cryptographically that they were the rightful recipient of the payout. If they loose, the gambling site doesn't learn who lost in terms of on-chain bitcoin address? As off-chain there is no timestamping I assume the gambling site would have to create new payment requests every round or can it mark the round in the way it accepts the payment request? Can a payment be rejected? I suppose so as it's an interactive protocol.

The concept to start with, is a multisig construct, where you have to trust a bunch of companies that they will not collude and steal the coins.
Concept: You send 5BTC to address X, which the sidechain automatically detects and it creates 5 RSK coins based on (one of) the same private key you used to authorize the 5BTC transaction. You create 5 RSK by sending 5BTC to a special address.
As soon as you send 2 RSK to another special address, whoever controls address X will send you 2 BTC to a bitcoin address that is again controlled by your private key from RSK.
In an updated version, "address X" will work autonomous. Currently the best we have is "trust these 5 guys".
The problems:
* The 5 guys could decide to spend the bitcoins for whatever reason. To not get shot, imprisoned or otherwise harmed for example.
* The 5 guys could get forced to do AML/KYC at any point in time in both directions.
* The 5 guys would be required to keep their systems secure, yet online 24/7.

If you get the proof of location right, which I highly doubt is possible at all, then this can grow huge.
Unfortunately I assume you resort to limiting wallets' traveling speed and individual bitcoin hunters' cash outs rather than having real proof of location.
It would probably make sense, especially as it's meant to pull clients to businesses, to allow businesses to put some ~~android~~ iPhone screen facing outwards with your app running, so the bitcoin hunter would have to scan the current TAN to claim the coin or something like that. Alternatively you could maybe rely on cell tower location rather than GPS but that's as spoofable as GPS.

Luke wants smaller blocks to promote people to run a full node, totally ignoring that right now even with much smaller blocks most people wouldn't run a full node. Custodial wallets will stick around and light wallets, too, for a long long time. Yes, shifting all to full nodes would be ideal but people want to use bitcoins on the go, people have little resources in bitcoin not justifying to run a full node or buy a hardware wallets ... needs are various. Luke's opinion is clearly a Nirvana Fallacy.
Full nodes &gt; light wallets &gt; custodial "bitcoin banks".

Forbidding to sell a huge chunk of assets is like confiscating or destroying them. Sure, the current owners lost those stocks or at least a huge part of it and can't swap them for bitcoins. It's like burning bitcoins. The one who lost his keys loses but all others win, while in China the gov borrowed the keys to eventually give them back or not. The rest of the coins stay more valuable or not. Only the gov knows.
Now others that want to buy cheap stocks can't do so directly, so they might look into bitcoin. But who knows ...

Nice list.
By what did you sort it? Rating count? Why not rating? Ok, I work for Mycelium which would profit from such a change but I guess I'm not the only one that is raising an eye brow to see the coinbase "wallet" on top :)
Another feature might be avoidance of stock/third party keyboard apps. On some wallets it's very scary when the keyboard knows what you are about to type, just because you typed your 12 words before. Same with the QR-Code scanner.
SPV mode is great but also has its down side. Apps that share the entirety of addresses they are interested in, with random SPV servers are also bad, just like with Mycelium it's bad that they share it with the Mycelium server. To my knowledge, no mobile wallet uses Bloom filters configured to download significantly more than the wallet is interested in, resulting in basically no privacy over telling the server the list of addresses in "uncompressed" form.
NFC is also something many users might care about, but not all wallets support it.
Sweep vs. cold wallet spending: Can the wallet handle private keys (paper wallets for example) and if yes, how?
Supported fiat currencies? Some only have USD or no fiat at all.

There is several ways to get bitcoins:
* buy them (fiat or other crypto)
* work for them
* mine them
* steal them
People obtain bitcoins for various reasons and selling them might be one of those reasons but with mining becoming less attractive as a source of bitcoins, the other sources of bitcoins become more attractive. I guess it is undeniable that some miners don't intend to sell. I was a miner and didn't sell the coins right away. I did speculate and I bet most do speculate.

HF are incompatible consensus rules and can be done with less than 51% if that is desired. That would require some rule that made the legacy chain invalid (block xy has to have more than 1MB) under the new rules or strongly disfavored (strongest chain considers hashing "strength" multiplied with block size, resulting in a 5MB block to count like 5 1MB blocks). Only with more than 50% of the hashing power it can be done without such a protection and the legacy chain would be protected as per the incompatibility of the consensus rules.
Now chain splits happen all the time when two blocks are found at the same time but those are not long lasting and get resolved by the longest-chain rule. A net split where for example Chine cut all lines to the west would also result in a chain split. Other than that? Not sure if there is more relevant splits.

Yeah, well, kind of. SPV has massively degraded security and none of the libraries provides what Satoshi already described in [his whitepaper]( page 5:


vulnerable   if   the   network   is   overpowered   by   an   attacker.     While   network   nodes   can   verify
transactions   for   themselves,   the   simplified   method   can   be   fooled   by   an   attacker's   fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.   One strategy to
protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid
block,   prompting   the   user's   software   to   download   the   full   block   and   alerted   transactions   to
confirm the inconsistency.  Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.
And now we do have this case of an attacker intending to overpower the network.

You always get empty blocks when the next is found immediately or from miners not bothering to add transactions. The peak also varies a bit due to randomness.

If Shib Coin is inherently insecure, those who get their bitcoins delivered hold bitcoins. It's bitcoins, not Shib Coins. Granted, some might lose their bitcoins if Shib goes out of business, switching off their transport. I am not sufficiently educated about what would happen to the bitcoins in transport. They might lay around for grab by Bitcoiners or they might be lost but they are still just dormant bitcoins, worth their face value if the sidechain works. So using Shib may carry risk and with commodities that you use to speculate, pricing that risk is by paying less for that commodity. With other things like logistics, you would typically price it with insurances. Where is the problem with that? It's not like we couldn't give a value to DHL or UPS just because they transport other stuff besides DHL Coin and UPS Coin.

While we understand and acknowledge the users' distrust towards "registered companies", we also see huge issues with the random-full-node approach even before thinking of hard-fork threats. Half of all full nodes are a sibyl attack against bitcoin's anonymity and given that most wallets that use random nodes, are not sticky with just very few (one only, at best) full nodes, they share their complete inventory of addresses with those spying companies eventually.
We try to educate but still want to provide optional use of this mode over the trusted-company mode, ideally with a fix for the privacy issues. If only we had more people to work on all this.

By my understanding "The Fee Event" in Bitcoin refers to the moment where blocks are full ever after aka profit maximizing miners would fill blocks to the limit given the backlog of unconfirmed transactions.
This will inevitably happen if the minimum fee is ever lower than the value of storing bytes on the blockchain but last week was just a remote idea of that.
If that minimum fee was zero, demand for spamming the blockchain would be infinite and we would long have had that kind of fee event. Somebody would make sure to bump the costs of running nodes if it was for almost free.

You are mixing things up. SideChains are not needed for LN.


Ok, at this point I just assume you mean "node provider" when you say "sidechain": Onion routing will be possible with LN, so while maybe my employer knows who they pay to, they don't have any way of knowing who I pay my money to, even if I use them as my LN entry node. I assume this will be the most common configuration, where the employer pays you by opening a LN channel that you can charge in the opposite direction, requesting your employer to pay your bills but in an anonymized way.

Also RBF is not an option if you want to get the goods now and not wait for confirmation.

I'm more concerned about those anonymous low profile accounts that spam us to switch camps. There is a very public list of segWit supporters and many of us put their name and face to the cause and get entertained by faceless big blockers that sometimes have very carefully crafted replies to strike your ego, just as you said. Therefore my advice: Ask who they are and just ignore them if there is a possibility it's an elisa bot or otherwise non-legit real person that is sucking your energy to do meaningful work.

No. The algorithm is (should be) smarter than that. I would consider percentiles, not average for a start but not sure what Gavin did exactly in bitcoind, where Mycelium pulls its estimates from. It's not the first time somebody fat-fingered a funny fee.

Furthermore it's not true that miners would not get anything from the LN fees. On the contrary I would expect LN transactions to have virtually no marginal cost and in parts even a negative fee, while this huge utility would warrant people to pay much higher on-chain fees than people are currently willing to pay. LN users would out-bid legacy on-chain users.

I find it fair to bash them, if their stance is "longest chain wins, Nakamoto consensu, there is nothing we can or want to do about it", peddling the BU narrative that conveniently drops the "valid" in "longest valid chain wins". Bitcoin will not go down without a fight and making thousands of Breadwallet users loose their Bitcoins like that is irresponsible.

I met a BCN member who was quite successful recruiting people. Explained to her what a scam this must be but as she's actually quite successful selling the product, she's doing fine. She changes her name on Facebook from time to time, obviously she unfriended me the day I answered to one of her scammy invitations with some innocent hint to just buy bitcoin as it's actually not that hard.
I gained the impression that BCN is not a scam because they are transparent about all the details, so while the prospect invites you to get rich, the fine print on how you get rich is actually hard to pull off except for the best of con artists.

What? Roger Ver is convinced that the most pressing issue in bitcoin is moderated away on the most popular forum r/bitcoin so he pays reddit to show very relevant ads to a narrow target audience. How is this different from any other manager who is convinced a certain target audience should hear about his product and running ads to them? They see it as spam, the manager as an information campaign and companies make money on delivering messages that the target audience widely perceives as annoying spam.
I believe RV is misguided with his struggle against your company and against this sub but this is just how spam works. Should reddit have an ethics commission to approve of every ad? If people here get confused about what is the best approach to solve a technical issue, how would reddit judge on that?

Upvoted because it's an important yet old issue. UTXO taint is as old as Bitcoin. The only good this list can do is to raise awareness for the importance of fungibility and thus privacy features.

Maybe you missed that my post was tongue in cheek? The serious "me" would always say that bitcoin is worth exactly what people pay for it right now, as that is the absolute best bet on its value. If anybody would know better (know, not believe), the price would converge quickly to that, as huge amounts of money could be made with such an information.

Try again, quoting the very next word from where you arbitrarily decided to cut the quote. ��
Edit: Ok, I assume you are trolling but just in case you really believe what you are saying: If you run a full node (that is not mining and that your light wallet is exclusively connected to) then this full node does all the same verification that the mining nodes are supposed to do, too. If the longest chain happens to not align with what you consider valid bitcoin, then your node will not follow the longest chain. If miners decide to mess with the timestamps, thus dropping the difficulty to mine much faster than what you deem to be right, your node will reject that chain although in retrospect you will not be able to tell what is the difference between these chains as you were not around when the blocks were mined to tell the true time. You don't need to mine to stay true to the version of bitcoin you deem valid.

Ok, I'm sorry for my knee jerk reaction to your kneejerky comment. I mostly share your criticism of the original analysis but it has some merits to it and can't just be ignored when somebody is clearly asking about that "nonce thing".
So we agree on op probably referring to some article back then having revealed links between freshly mined coins amounting to about a million BTC between a small, maybe even unitary number of miners while you see room for the nonce sequences being a result other than originating from same miners (per slope. between slopes the link is even weaker.)

Aaron did of course not put all the considerations in and I finally came to peace over Core not wanting to promise bigger blocks, as it's the wrong thing to commit to. We don't want bigger blocks.

I hate BU with all my heart and get no work done due to the constant state of alert they put me in but Bitcoin was put out to be anti fragile and indestructible thanks to math, not thanks to asking your opponents to peacefully coexist.
That said, [Peter Rizun's **Level 3 Anti-split protection**]( is the most revealing evidence they are not now and not ever trying to reach any kind of consensus.
On another note: With [deals like this]( where proponents of both sides load up with split coins, war chests might get fueled. If whales dump one side of the split in favor of the other, they will have galactic incentives to at least protect their side of the bet, so if BU has a $100 million war chest to destroy Core, I have to assume there is a $1 billion chest to protect it. And if we go to war, both sides will lose and I can only assume one of them is a proxy of our real enemy.

In fact CT is like the activating agent for big scale use of opportunistic coinjoin. Currently if you would put all the transactions of a block into one transaction, you could still track most of the coins just like now by doing some sudoku based on the values of inputs and outputs. With those unknown,any set of transactions can be mixed to increase the privacy set.
Of course CT would already kill most blockchain forensics.

Thank the one who sent you a RBF transaction. If Mycelium decided to pay me using RBF, I would be totally fine with it. If my next anonymous localbitcoins seller did in a hurry, I would be totally unfine with it.
At Mycelium we are very well aware that transaction confidence is more than RBF-yes/no. We need warnings for long chains of unconfirmed and dust fee transactions, too, and this will be the start of it. Or did already add other metrics? I know that children of unconfirmed RBF transactions that themselves are not RBF, are getting the warning, while spending unconfirmed transactions doesn't necessarily get a warning. In light of malleability, maybe all spends from unconfirmed outputs should get a warning? All not trivial but RBF (or Peter Todd personally) are not to blame for making things complicated here.

In a way, yes. Somebody who does 10000 transactions on LN is willing to pay $100 for that privilege easily. Somebody who does only 20-ish transactions probably not. With full blocks, people will not open LN channels if they don't intend to use them for at least X transactions cause it's not worth paying Y in transaction fees for that.

Technically bitcoin addresses are not public keys. They are generated using hashes of your single public key.
Glad you could confirm everything is there.
I'm a bit split between fixing this bug and calling it a feature. Sure, if you check your balance using the P2PKH address, only, you are in for some scary time but if you use paper wallets a lot, which in the past people were doing with Mycelium, you might want to use the benefits of segwit.

If we keep growing at the rate since bitcoin pizza ... 10000BTC = 25USD, 1BTC = 0.0025USD on May 22, 2010 ... allow me to round. That's 7 years, right? So we are up 1280/0.0025 = 512000. That's an average growth rate of  6.54 or 654%. So to grow another 500000/1280=391 fold it should take ... 38 months give or take a month. June 2020 should be a safe bet ;)

If a company currently wants to pay 100 users in one block, it would most naively pick its million $$ "address", pay user 1 $5 and send the change to address2. Then send from address2 to user2 and address3 ... then to user100 and change address100. With rbf you wouldn't write change address 2 to 99 on the blockchain.
Also this chaining of unconfirmed transactions leads to malleability issues. If the 3rd of these transaction gets a different transaction id, all subsequent transactions become invalid.

Open source means nothing if it doesn't provide deterministic builds. Else you have no way of knowing if the wallet in PlayStore or iTunes is what you find on github.
Even then you rely on somebody actually reviewing the code. CoPay for example quite recently updated a library to the latest version which was tweaked to steel CoPay wallets.
I would generally not trust the latest newcomer but even veterans can screw up, so ... good luck ;)
@_date: 2019-03-11 13:38:48
It would not be a consensus fork. This fork would put a burden on the fork's maintainer only but would also increase the number of people running nodes with potentially lower security standards if deterministic builds are not handled like in core.

Not sure what you are trying to achieve but I assume people trading know what they are doing and while you seam to try to scare away people, you still suggest that BIT is actually bitcoin, while BIT is more like shares in a company that as only asset happens to have bitcoins.

It also is tradable for people who have no clue about bitcoin, which is bad.

As an idealist I agree with the article but as the one who will have to explain it to users, I agree with RBF being optional for now and don't vote to add it at all to Mycelium for some time. We have detection when receiving though.
Bitcoin has some gentleman agreements that will all go away over time but it's nice for as long as we have them
* free transactions: Wasn't it beautiful when the Marshal Service auctioned off bitcoins and sent them without fees?
* first seen safe: Instant payments. Right there.
* on-chain transactions for morning-coffees: Yes, also this will go away
The situation with low fee or chained transactions is horrible and with things as they are now, I doubt that any big chain will start accepting Bitcoin as a chain-wide policy at their POS but for all brick and mortar shops I use bitcoins at, they work perfectly cause I wouldn't scam them out of a coffee worth of bitcoin. Do I demand those transactions to be for free? No, but I wouldn't want it to be such that the transaction was completely disregarded up to the point where it gets confirmed – a mode that will be reality in maybe a year or two.
Will I not be able to pay my morning coffee with bitcoins in a year or two? Of course I will but it will have to be some layer two solution. Only that this solution will be more anonymous, instant, for free and with the full security of a bitcoin transaction.
To get from A to B we might have to deal with less than optimal circumstances in between and some people got promised stuff that might not be available at some points along the way.

It's explained in continuation of my post. Miners are paid via a much lower price sensibility for on-chain transactions if those pay for a thousand coffee's fees.


The negative fee would be very rare but there are fungibility-related desires to be a node that affect the need for getting paid a transaction fee in favor of zero or even negative fees.
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:00:52
What's the point? Light wallets do use a full node to accept payments. In some light wallets you can even configure the full node it should talk to and that could be your own full node.
You know I work for Mycelium and here the wallet talks to ElectrumX servers and you can patch our open software to talk to your ElectrumX server (and I think we will expose this configuration at some point to the user in our builds, too). Same works for the Schildbach client but the Schildbach client like many others derived from it gossip out their wallet to random and new random nodes every time you start them and the wallet relies on those random nodes (although here you can configure your own full node) but still, bip157 would make the client much better. The client could keep the index files in case you want to rescan with new addresses etc.

So breadwallet connect to random full nodes? Cause Mycelium wallet connects to Mycelium servers that currently only run Core.
I currently don't see urgency to put dozens of hours into this, but if we get to the point where BU announces a fork, I will (if management agrees) add fork detection and make our transaction broadcast block any attempt at sending transactions that would be replayable if not marked as fork-aware. This is to protect legacy users that don't update. Those who do update would get a notification to split their coins and a wizard to do so.

That's like saying that every person in the world should be a fire fighter so we have no houses burn down. Yes, if everybody in the world was a trained fire fighter well educated in prevention, too, we would have a world without ever seeing a house burn down but the costs of it would far outweigh an occasional house lost. The same goes with Bitcoin. As long as there is a huge number of full nodes checking on light wallet servers (light wallet users can check all transactions on full nodes. Either on their own or on about 100 public block explorers), nobody gets away with shenanigans. Yes, you will have to fight fires and yes, occasionally a user will get burnt or lose it all but fortunately prudent users can opt to be fire fighters themselves at a relatively low cost or they can pay a fire department to cover their back. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.
I wish the costs of running your own full node were as low as running a light wallet but they are not and as long as that is the case, the cost difference will make it logical for some (or most) users to use light wallets. In addition if you use Mycelium backed by your own electrumx (running on TOR) with a hardware wallet for your private keys you are better off in any sense than if you would use just standard bitcoincore or Mycelium or a hardware wallet with its standard frontend.

This makes no sense at all. Bitcoin mining runs on highly specialized hardware that turns obsolete quickly. You want to get it mining as quickly and as uninterrupted as possible at the lowest price possible. Therefore it is not suited for solar or wind excess but much rather to stable base load power like nuclear. A similar issue arises with heating which might not be required in summer.
If you have cheap energy in a remote area, great. There it makes sense. Scandinavian countries that need heating all year out, sure, use mining. The rest of the points I'm afraid are not spot on.

Yes, you have to trust us but I'm pretty sure you would notice if we did and then you could react and your funds would not be at risk at any point. I never said that light clients were superior to full nodes. On the contrary I said full nodes are superior to light clients but for almost all users almost all of the time light clients serve them better than full nodes. Full nodes are enormously important to verify but for that we don't need 8 billion full nodes. Half a million full nodes should be way more than needed to ensure nobody does stuff without it being noticed.

We are working on that and I would love to work on that in the open. I can do that already on testnet and it consists in installing an spv-module.apk and a modified mycelium.apk that detects the presence of the module and uses the module to connect to the bitcoin network. If the module is not configured, it talks to random 5 nodes but you can tell it which node to use, too. It kind of works but has many glitches still.

This opendime is so flawed, it's literally worse than a paper wallet. Not having a screen, you can't verify anything and at the time of spending, the private keys get exposed to all apps on the host.
I get it, it tries to be a physical Bitcoin but how am I supposed to trust a token somebody else hands me when he could just send me a transaction to an address that I know only I have the keys for?
Giving to no-coiners you say? Well for tips and donations, paper wallets are better in every sense. The sender can (but doesn't have to) keep a copy to sweep funds in case recipient didn't use them in 10 years ... or help the recipient who lost the token. Redeeming works through QR code scanning which has better isolation than USB drive reading or clipboard.

As the minimal precaution, use multiple accounts. I always receive bitcoins into new accounts and try to empty accounts. Instead of selling $500 of BTC, I would sell $470 if I have $473.58 in one of my accounts, just to empty it. I'd rather lose the extra $3.58 than carry it over to keep linking transactions. Or I donate the $3.58 to a good cause if I don't want to tip them to the BTC buyer.
@_date: 2019-03-12 02:07:23
Sure, if you do it wrong, you end up wrong but you don't need a miner to do it right. You just need to connect to an honest full node. Yours, the one Mycelium is running, whatever other of your choice. BitcoinJ does it wrong but that doesn't mean that light wallets are a failed concept. I would never use the Schildbach wallet as is, for many reasons (mainly because it gossips out my addresses to random nodes and thus to Chainalysis and other pests of Bitcoin) but also for the reason you mentioned. With my own node backing it, I would still not use it as it's a pain to resync with the blockchain when restoring a wallet but that doesn't invalidate thin clients as a class of tools.
@_date: 2019-03-15 12:59:17

Edit: too much guesstimation ahead. There is limits but as block height is the closest of a proof of time there is, miners have quite some freedom in picking their time in the future or past, within some limits.
~~No. If no block is found for 4h, miners have to artificially cap their next time stamp to oldBlock.time+4h. Conversely there is no need to wait, as you can just put any valid time stamp (+-4h if I remember right) into the block header.~~

(Issues with the above: If Twitter is custodian, they have to do strict AML/KYC for all the tips that get cashed out or forwarded.

The smart property only works, if all changes of possession of a good also are reflected on the blockchain. This can be enforced if [the item itself understands the blockchain]( and requires the transfer to work.
For diamonds you might get the information across that the buyer may lose his diamonds if he can't proof ownership of the recipient address on the blockchain.
For organic fruit and veg, the goods get consumed, so you could leave the customer out of having to deal with the knitty gritty by provably "destroying" each unit at the point of sales. You could print the certificate on the receipt in a way a cryptographer could verify that a 500g of the 500t the company registered on the blockchain this month was "destroyed" the moment you paid for it. So the whole process would work like this:
1. Strawberry.com registers 2.7t of strawberries with each truck leaving their fields with the raw product. They issue 2.7 million tokens for that.
1. A certifying entity approves that they actually produced that much.
1. A processing plant only accepts strawberries with strawberry.com tokens. They pay better for strawberries with the token than without. They sort the strawberries and put them into packages. Ugly ones for yogurt (we all know that) and the nice ones for immediate sales.
1. They sell their sorted strawberries and the buyers would again demand tokens to be transferred along with the fruits, as again they want to sell at a higher price. They would pay X for fresh-fruit-salad (FFS) grade and Y for yogurt grade. (Now here, the plant might actually divert certificates, not selling Y grade with the token-markup, trying to mix in some FFS-grade strawberries from other sources. This is why it would work better with actual commodities.)
 1. The supermarket bought the FFS-grade fruits and guarantees to the clients that they are organic, with 500 tokens per 500g of fruit.
 1. They also bought organic fruit yogurt, with 1 token per 500g of yogurt which they can guarantee to stem from strawberries.com
 1. Some of the supermarket's organic strawberries turned bad over the weekend. They might try packaging cheap strawberries into the expensive organic boxes but the tokens also carry an issuing date, so this can't be done indefinitely.
1. After paying, the receipt also shows a QR-code getting the customer to a block explorer showing the destruction of 500 tokens for the box of fresh berries and 1 for the yogurt. He can see here how many times the fruit changed hands and when it was registered.
While this is not perfect, it's certainly better than what exists today.

Your effort is appreciated but don't expect too much. Native speakers curate native resources but I doubt you will get some overarching project where Chinese, Arab, English and German speakers collaborate. It's on each of these groups to grow their resources and I feel a bit bad for being stuck with English most of the time, while my mother tung is German and I'm fluent in Spanish, too. I should share my knowledge with my more direct peers (Germans and Chileans) in their language but it's just not as much fun to participate on German or Spanish platforms for me, while all the action is in English. For me it's easiest to explain Bitcoin in English, as I can copy all the slang from what I read all the time and it's even easier in Spanish now than in German, as I talk to way more Spanish speakers than Germans about Bitcoin. I guess this experience is not unique to me, so the only ones really dedicating most of their time to curating and producing non-English content are those who are not very fluent in English themselves.

21 million BTC / 7 billion person = 0.003BTC / person = 3mBTC / person.
With 3mBTC you will be guaranteed to have more bitcoins than half of the rest of the world and most likely more than 90% of the rest of the world. Only problem is that people who can afford to put $2 aside now, usually feel like not being ready to risk loosing $2000 once it comes to it. I gave a nice guy $20 in BTC some time ago. Three days ago he asked me how he can cash it out. I tried to explain to him that it already went up to $30 and how I could buy it back from him for that but that that was not the point of the exercise. He explained to me how his next insulin costs $30 and he simply doesn't have it right now. But that's the reality for most people in the world.

I guess it's safe to say that fees will outweigh block rewards very soon. We only recently found a fee market and prices are still way way lower than would be justified if two on-chain transactions were good for a thousand payments.
In fact the halfing ahead is the last one where I am worried about a mining trap, where people would just not see a benefit in leaving the miners on, even if the fees doubled.
Total fees per block are now 1BTC. Reward 25BTC. With segwit, chances are good to double the fees without making transactions more expensive but on-chain is worth more than that, so with lightning network and an adoption hike, fees will easily double. That would get the fees to 4BTC, with 12.5BTC reward. Reward would then drop from 12.5+4=16.5 to 6.25+4=10.5. To counter this, paying 2.5 times the fee would give miners the same payouts. Sounds not unfeasible.
Unfortunately, with increasing value, fees will also drop, so we might not achieve 4BTC in fees per block, if a BTC is worth thousands fo USD but the fee-reward-gap is closing over the next halfing, not the next hundreds of halfings.

The segwit version is still under development and hasn't gone into heavy testing yet. Also a full code review is still not done and it's thousands of lines of code changed. We don't want people to lose money, so the responsible approach is to release it to testnet first, while we finish up testing and then roll it out slowly and cancel rollout if there are issues.
Luckily it's not easy to screw up in a way where funds get destroyed permanently but we don't want to release a version where sending doesn't work under some very special conditions.

Arguably if you live paycheck to paycheck, store of value is not a big consideration. Therefore to me it's no surprise so many, especially with a lower income are "not getting it". I gifted bitcoin to a night guard. He asked me what he can do with it and we ended up with me buying back my gift on the spot, so he can buy his insulin. Store of value is a tough sell if people don't know how to buy their insulin.

Hi. Apologies for a little server down time today. Devops were hard at work. With bitcoin wallets you should generally not panic unless you find a transaction that sends all your funds to some address that is not yours without your confirmation. Bitcoins don't move if they are not being sent and a balance showing zero with all transactions gone is no indication of funds having moved.

There is many opinions on how to solve it and equally many opinions on how urgently changes are needed or have to be prevented. Any long time bitcoiner who hasn't been living under a rock the last year can tell you that.
There is wide consensus that 1MB will not be enough for global adoption and that at some upper size, geographical mining centralization would be inevitable. Others argue that at a lower size, centralization would also be the outcome. Centralization in who can spend $1000 in transaction fees.
I guess it's important to see it long term. Preventing capture is paramount and if we can safely say a certain size will not lead to centralization, then that should be the hard limit. A lower, dynamic limit would be almost irrelevant as systems would have to be designed to deal with the peak volume anyway.
So yes, people are working to resolve the current unfortunate situation but extremely high fees would not lead to rush to solutions that would put bitcoin's value proposition as a censorship resistant global currency at risk. There are speculators that would rather see their funny paypal clone coins be worth a million tomorrow than to give it a year or two more, to ripen to somethin new and revolutionary.

But … you already have that. Coinbase already does KYC/AML when they sell you bitcoins. Unless you pay to addresses you randomly find on the blockchain, you are the payer because only you know the address. Now if they don't ask your ID upfront but the payment request does, then give them a fake one. If that doesn't work, screw them and give others your business.
And yeah, if your wallet throws your identity around like there was no tomorrow, screw your wallet, too. At Mycelium we will certainly leave you in control over that. If they want just any identity, we will figure out how to provide new fake identities with every payment.

The experiment is nice but also generally quite pointless in gaining a feel for how long it might take for others.
The bitcoin network is oblivious, so there is no time guarantee. A transaction that didn't get confirmed in one block has exactly the same chance of getting confirmed in the next if it was broadcast a second after the last block. The fee estimates are based on recent historic data but can not reflect a current surge. If you submit a high fee transaction now and then a burst of higher fee transactions happens, that fills the next three blocks, then you still get slow confirmation. If you do a low fee transaction and miners get lucky, finding 5 blocks in 12 minutes, then your transaction might get confirmed in 12 minutes.
This is all very unfortunate in that there are no guarantees but time and time again people report to get express confirmation if they pay a high fee. Still I prefer to pay the Mycelium low fee as much as possible, to not feed a race to high fees.

The HD path should be known as it depends on the wallet you use and it's probably BIP44.
Which public key are you referring to? It's certainly helpful to know the first receiving address so you don't have to check the transaction history of every address you find but I'm pretty sure he has that.

Any updates?
@_date: 2016-06-29 16:45:41
Help me, is that a thing already?
If not, I guess you mean to have the master seed which is encoded in the passphrase, so lets get a second pass phrase from deeper in the BIP44 hierarchy?
That has two issues: 
* The seed derivation from the passphrase involves expensive hashing. 2000 rounds of [don't remember which expensive] hashing. So you can't derive a passphrase from a seed.
* You can't make it rolling. Having Account 12's seed doesn't allow you derive Account 13.
I guess BIP44 is fundamentally incompatible with the recursive key creation as proposed in OP.

While both of these work on top of the Bitcoin base layer, they are very very different:
Lightning Network
* In order to use LN you send an anchor transaction to the bitcoin network, putting funds under the control of you and a peer.
* At some point in the future a settling transaction sending the final balances to both you and your peer, signed by that peer and you is sent to the bitcoin network by you and/or your peer.
* Between anchoring and settling you and your peer keep updating the settling transaction without broadcasting it.
* Using onion routing you can pay not only your peer but also peers of your peer and their peers' peers, which is quite private.
* Fancy cryptography enables you and your peer to punish the other by grabbing all the funds if the other side tries to publish any but the very last settling transaction. This part requires vigilance but can be outsourced in a very anonymous way.
* As updates between peers don't hit the blockchain, there is no limit to how many such transactions can be performed globally.
Liquid Sidechain
* In order to use liquid you send bitcoins to an address controlled by multisig (8 of 15 or so), putting it under the control of the majority of a consortium of 15.
* Said consortium promises to keep track of your funds again using a blockchain.
* The liquid blockchain has a high degree of privacy, using confidential transactions that hide the balances being transferred.
* Said consortium promises to execute bitcoin transactions upon special liquid transactions. You destroy x BTC on the liquid chain in a special way indicating address Y -&gt; they will send bitcoins to address Y.
* The consortium could at any point by majority decision send all funds to wherever they agree to send them.
* The liquid blockchain is again a blockchain, so all transactions need to get stored indefinitely again. Thanks to fancy cryptography in the liquid blockchain, very efficient pruning will be possible, bringing down the blockchain to a fraction of that needed by Bitcoin.
* Mining is not necessary. The consortium is maintaining the blockchain.
* Blocksize is independent of Bitcoin rules, so the consortium can do what they want, although they promised to keep it small.

I talked with a huge cloud miner and political mining was a topic. He was convinced that offering political mining wasn't worth it, as the margins would remain minuscule, due to the majority of non-political miners. In other words, if you could mine option A or B, there might be political miners that mine A even at a loss but that would just drive out all opportunistic miners that were mining A before, to mine B now, so you wouldn't really be able to move the scale. I believe he is wrong and that mining is inherently political and will be done almost exclusively at a loss in the future but for now maybe he's right.

First things first: [BIP75](
This BIP is an extension to the payment protocol and as such in no way a modification to the bitcoin protocol. It's 100% optional.
Of course, optional things get less optional, if you want to pay your flight and the only way of paying it is using the payment protocol. But the payee is not forced to use this or any other payment protocol BIP. As a payer I'm very happy to know that my high price item (flight) is being paid to a well defined entity (bitpay.com). The only reservation I have is that this information gets stored forever in my wallet but that's totally up to wallets to do or not.
Edit: Reading more about the concerns of users I see the risk of wallets doing static ID by default for every coffee you buy but you and I do care to buy our coffees elsewhere. I see the risk of governments forcing coffee shops to id and a standard for that would be convenient. I just don't think that deleting this bip would make governments less evil or that it would stop them from demanding anything worse. National id with every electronic payment? Certainly no new idea.

While I was brabbling the "spam attack" theory those recent days until I read 's comment above, the chart you present does not easily proof it was a "spam attack". The bigger transactions could also have been a *reaction* to the 16% slower blocks and subsequently much slower confirmations. Companies that do aggregate transactions RBF-style would pack onto their unconfirmed transactions until they finally confirm wouldn't they?
~~So, could you zoom in please~~ (I did that. see below.), and put to the same scale the block rate. If transaction size followed the block rate decrease, I would side with u/Matthew-Davey .
Edit: The retarget was substantially before the problems began and before the transaction size increased. Even when zoomed in, the transaction size increase was very sudden and coincided with the situation getting really worse. Another moment in between could be considered where the mem-pool actually achieved a state of not getting freed, which might have been the opportunity an attacker waited for, which might have been caused by the slower block creation after the retarget.

Opening channels would not be the issue. Closing would. If for example some huge LN node stopped serving users, users would try to unilaterally close their channels. This could lead to situations where people would maybe not even have the tools to retaliate against better organized node operators trying to scam people out of their money by publishing the wrong chain state on channels that have not much potential to retaliate anyway. The latter depends on whether most of the money in the channel is on the node's side anyway (high risk to scam) or on the other end.

Well, ... if addresses are not being reused, then the public key of addresses with money is never really public. The address is just its hash.

I agree with your analysis but not with your resolution. As you say, Bitcoin is freedom, fiat is slavery but the transition can be quick or slow and people will fight to stay slaves cause NIRPs are the least of their problems and if talking heads tell them that it's Bitcoin's fault they won't get food stamps, they will believe it. Your bet is on a very very quick transition. Mine is on a more subtle, slower transition, also because bitcoin is not ready yet.
With your approach I would wait at least until lightning network is ready and functional in all relevant wallets and has gone through a major crisis. From there on, bitcoin will be ready for micro transactions again, with instant confirmation which is infinitely important to get merchants on board. Confirmation anxiety is not relevant for you and me but it very much is for a store owner that never heard about Bitcoin until you stumbled into his shop.

Provided you actually wanted to proof them any funds you have, which I find highly dubious already, sign a message with a key that holds funds. The message should be very specific to not get abused later. "I, username own at least 12BTC as of today, 2018-10-24" -- signed with a private key of an address that holds 12.somewhat BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-27 04:24:14
keepkey, trezor, ledger, other hardware wallets, mycelium, blockchain.info, many other wallets follow the standards [BIP39 and BIP44]( Thus with only your 12/15/18/21/24 words you can recover all your BIP44 accounts in any of those.

Removing exchange rates was a bold move by Samourai and I still try to understand what they were thinking. Exchange rates are a pain to deal with and we constantly add and remove sources and the conversion might not always be 100% accurate but how would I ever pay a thing confident to not pay a 15% premium if I don't have exchange rates integrated in my wallet? I go to the merchant, pick my stuff I want to buy. $12 it reads. Checkout with CC or Bitcoin? Bitcoin -&gt; QR-code -&gt; I scan it ... and my wallet says $15. This happened a lot and yes, I am ready to pay a premium to drive Bitcoin adoption but I want to be in control. Without exchange rate I would not be in control.

Yes, and it was the first time I heard about (quote ) "organic fruit and veg." on the blockchain.
The  'certifying entity' with a database has the problem/benefit that you could trade that company's fruits only as a registered trader, while with publicly recognized tokens, anybody could trade those fruits. But the benefit there is more clear when you talk about long lived items like diamonds, where you don't want an institution to grow tracking who has how many diamonds at all time, with all the privacy implications.

Edit: Before some wizard corrects me, I'll just leave here that I assume the relevant number is probably not the full spectrum of confirmed transactions but above all, the cheapest transaction(s), so padding the block with some fake transactions might not affect the fee estimation at all.

Again we see how much it is worth to trap users in recurring payment schemes.

You had me scared for your money a bit but I think you should be fine. The problem is that paper wallets feature two codes. One is "your bitcoin address" and the other is your private key. Since SegWit, there is at least 3 addresses you can derive from a private key and the private key doesn't give away which one it is, so it has to check all 3 for a balance. I assume that you will have no issues to use Mycelium to spend again from that private key and all your funds should be at your command.
What scared me was that until 2.12.0.23 we had a bug where we would indiscriminately generate 3 addresses from all private keys but very old private keys used uncompressed public keys, which are incompatible with segwit but as far as I can see, your key is compressed.

I was tempted to say "2/3D" but really, those 3D tools are hard to use for arguing about features. As soon as you wanted to argue about a feature, you would reduce it to 2D again.

light wallets rely on secondary infrastructure but not necessarily miners. At Mycelium you rely on the Mycelium-run ElectrumX servers a bit and the client does a ton of verification too. At the Schildbach client you rely on a random set of full nodes which typically are not miners, neither. Others take other trade-offs.

Taking your own options away is probably a bad idea, although I see the desire. I myself gave bitcoins as gift for new-born kids and had to witness them being sold after some years on behalf of the toddlers but locking the coins away even for the case where we have to rush to some *actually* quantum-safe addresses is not a good idea neither. Maybe you see Bitcoin being doomed while it still has value. You would regret having to wait a year to actually sell.

It should be fixed now. Sorry for the inconvenience.
We rolled out version 3.2.* since last week and yesterday we rolled out 3.2.0.11 but to our knowledge, it's not the latter which caused the issue.
3.2 brings a new feature, media-flow, a blog in the wallet kind of thing. Part of the feature is notifications of new blog posts (which you can opt out from) and as the 3.2 rollout has reached most users by now, a new notification yesterday triggered too many people at once to open their wallets (and probably to hit refresh when they noticed that the wallet doesn't update). The load on our servers went up almost instantly to "100%" with that notification and only slowly degraded after that. Our devops team has spun up new servers since then and we will figure out how to throttle notifications or prevent clients hitting the bitcoin servers when not actually checking the balance. One detail is that the client connects to many servers to speed up the check and I was working on a change that connects to only one server at almost the same performance.

Yes, as we said again and again, we are working on a segwit release (under the lead of Sergey Lappo) and I just got permission to share some insights what our main road blocks are.
We support many account types and Mycelium has many features none of our current devs ever used for any real world purpose. We currently also lack Trezor Model T and Ledger Nano S to test with (we will shortly get those). How does SegWit play together with our local trader platform? How about [Shamir's Secret Sharing]( (yes, Mycelium supports that. I don't know exactly how but I guess we should make sure not to break it in case any user has his fortune in this) or BitId (we know that for bech32, message signing is not well defined).
So, for the simplest of cases of creating a new HD wallet, SegWit works. I could record a demo or show your the transactions we created with our tests.
With Trezor One we ran into a UI issue that is quite interesting: Our approach is a mixed mode account. That means your receiving address will change from legacy to segwit compatibility with optional segwit native. (Terminology is another topic. Power users would maybe want to see bech32, BIP84/49/44, P2SH segwit, P2WKH_P2SH or something like that.) So when in a payment situation you can present your bech32 address to the payer and if his wallet doesn't recognize it, you can switch to p2sh with a simple click, without having to switch to a different account. Also when you pay a bech32 address, your change will go to a bech32 address to get more privacy. (If change should go to a legacy address when paying a legacy address is still up to debate. I think the current state is that it would go to p2sh instead.) Anyway, account mixing raises compatibility and standardization concerns. Trezor for example handles your bech32 account as a completely separate account from your legacy account. I can spend in mixed mode or from trezor's perspective from several accounts at a time but it gets confused about the change output and that has some scary consequences for Trezor users: If you spend from one account and the change goes into another of your accounts, the trezor will ask the user to confirm **sending** the change. It does indicate that the change would get sent to the trezor again but when paying $12 with my Trezor I get scared when I have to confirm sending $12000 to another address that I have never seen before even if it says "Trezor  below the address. So ... we have to see if Trezor has a good solution for that, how keepkey and Ledger deal with this, if we should reduce privacy on hardware wallets to keep support manageable, if we provide mixed mode as an opt-in for the more techy users etc.
So yes, we are working on it and we probably could release it shortly but to avoid scary moments for certain users we would probably have to polish the release a bit. We still have to test all features with the release candidate. And then there is code reviewing. It's +8500-5300 lines of code to review.

The moment people care about the number, people will fake it. Same with transaction volume with all those not really free stress tests.

yes, thank you, this is a great chart. If you now would limit it to OP's range of 900-1000kB, it would look like a strong correlation but over the full range is rather surprising there is a relation at all.
Note here that the chart is not UTXO created - destroyed but created / destroyed, so 0.5 is the zero-delta level.
Edit: How are coinbase transactions treated? As they can have many outpoints I assume they are not ignored but rather accounted for the UTXO creation side, which is fair but this might dominate the very small blocks. StEligius paid out to [hundreds of miners]( using the coinbase transaction.

Looks like a very weak and subjective index. Who curates it? What are "news items"?
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:59:19
Ok, so ... this was proposed before but we don't know if it's happening. So another way of helping would be to create a web page that lists donations to coinbase addresses (and maybe some suggestions how to do that. Pools can pay out to miners via the coinbase transaction or collect it and distribute block reward, fees and donations at will.)
Edit: While tipping coinbase addresses would still result in tipping segwit supporters if it was a pool that pays out rewards via the coinbase transaction, not all coinbase transactions pay out to miners or pools. There are schemes out there where users buy "virgin" coins or a pool operator might decide to pay his bills with the coinbase transactions (although the 100 confirmations waiting time might confuse recipients).
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:34:42
bc1 addresses will be part of the initial segwit release. your default receiving address will switch from legacy to p2sh and you can switch it manually to bech32.

Merchants will keep using bitpay and similar services and not care about how bitcoin works.
If they choose to actually receive Bitcoins, they might use LN in the background though. Like all other users of LN, they would have to balance on-chain transaction fees and LN channel maintenance fees. The latter is basically the interest on a very very secure loan that the node gives you over the amount of money in your channel on the node's side.
So assume you on-board with bitpay. Bitpay might ask what your expected turn-over might be, before actually spending your bitcoins. You say $10000. Bitpay puts $10000 into your channel and charges you 1% per year on that. After a week you actually received $9k and your interest payment now is only due for the remaining $1k. To restore your LN receiving capacity, you "buy" an on-chain payment or a USD wire from bitpay by shifting $9k back to them.
You might as well send your LN bitcoins to an exchange over some onion route nodes to sell them. bitpay would not learn where you spent them.

A library dev that gets a wallet stealer into the next update of Java. A malicious compiler that puts the wallet stealer in at compile time.
If paranoid, you better get some hardware from before 2009 and do the math with standard tools.

Dangerous proposition.
1. 9ct. per transaction is more than people used to pay, so they will always whine.
1. 9ct. per transaction is more than "the other 6 billion" are willing to pay.
1. 9ct. can turn into $9 over night.
For me, it's ok the other 6 billion can't use it now. It's ok if a drastic fee event prices out all of its current users. For two reasons:
1. People paying $9 for the privilege of doing a bitcoin transaction means wild success.
1. I see how we will get to actually low fee (range of $0.000001), instant (&lt;1s) and anonymous (onion routed)  transactions eventually. Hasting to get there might spoil it all.
Don't get anxious about key parameters not being where they should be now.

Currently you have to trust us to keep the wallet safe. Just like every other Android wallet I know of. We have security measures in place. I personally wouldn't be able to do it for example but it's not optimal.
To get more security you would need deterministic builds and a verification process that works with signed APKs. I should be working on that and would love to but it's not exactly a blockbuster feature everybody was waiting for. I wish it was but it isn't.

You might want to refine your question. All BIPs have been implemented at least for the purpose of getting bip status. Some are final but not implemented by bitcoin core.

The world is not a zero-sum-game. Sure, holding bitcoin you might get ahead of people who were economically ahead of you in fiat but the friction introduced by fascist states makes the world as a whole worse off.

The chart draws the block size to the right and the change to the UTXO set size upwards or downwards if negative.
First of all it shows how there are some preferred block sizes. Those "vertical lines" at the different block sizes. Then the OP implies that at the 1MB block size there was a particular tendency towards UTXO creation over UTXO reduction but I wouldn't share this interpretation as the chart doesn't show well the density. For each block size interval, an average delta UTXO size could be plotted for that.
What I find interesting is that there is a horizontal cluster at about 18000 UTXOs which seams to be independent from the block size. What would produce that?

Kind of a roundrobin "centralization" where you can be the master for 10 minutes by minging a block. As you need the majority of the last 100 block signers, you can't do what you like, neither. All quite complicated coordination between those miners.
It's supposed to get the user rather solid confirmation between blocks.
The way they propose it, it would be a pretty drastic hard fork for Bitcoin but it would improve the confirmation situation.

It's always a trade-off. If I want out of the contract against the node's will, I would want to wait as little as possible and so would the other side, too. If I fear a mass closing, I want as much time as possible.
I expect to pay "interest on loans" for channels towards me and I expect that in order for you as my node to open a $100 channel towards me, you would want it to be initialized paying interest for the closing time, just in case I actually never use the funds but only locking up your $100. Similarly I expect to have to keep paying interest in order to maintain the channel. Interest applies only to the amount it is locking up your funds, so if it's 100% on my side, no interest would apply.

Mining is meant to be at an over-capacity but with vanishing block rewards and fees not catching up, we might find out the level at which the bitcoin network becomes too weak to resist an attack and trust me you don't want to find out which level that is.

If you have maximum privacy in mind, you should consider using bitcoin core or another full node and never tie any of your addresses to a meat space identity. That includes not to buy/sell on exchanges that do AML/KYC but rather buy with cash through localbitcoins or similar services.
You also might end up juggling several wallets if you ever feel the need to use your bitcoins on things that ask your ID/address like buy stuff on fasttech or cheapair.
If you do the paperwallet thing but then tie your addresses to your IP on blockchain.info, you lost a lot of privacy and I'm not sure what you want to do with blockchain anyway. Sounds like a danger to your money, too.

Pixel price not shown is issue  and we will address it next ;)
We wanted to have dynamic pricing. Making contested pixels more expensive than others was my initial idea but that's too hard for the user to follow, although I haven't abandoned that idea yet. Making it more expensive, when the server load rises was another idea, so we never have a collapsing server. Also complicated for the user to "just play". With the current emergency-launch, price is as said here on reddit: 0.9sat/pixel or 9 credits per pixel. We might change that to a model that goes as low as 1 credit per pixel put probably a price that is shown dynamically and valid for all pixels on all the canvas.
Re: Friction of account creation.
Yes, we decided to go with accounts for now. On satoshis.place I paid for a change, the payment was pending for more than 10 minutes what the valididty of the invoice supposedly was, I created a new invoice and paid that, too ... in the end both payments went through. With an account I would have a positive balance now or some way to communicate with their support.
Accounts make players care about what they put there, which usually leads to more cooperation and less penises. also there is bragging rights associated with accounts. We plan to do stuff with how many pixels an account painted, how many of his pixels survived to the end of the round, ... teams, credit pooling, ...

While you are ultimately right, lets hope it won't come to this.

No merchant needs to use LN but LN works this way. The 1% figure is something I made up. Maybe bitpay charges a flat fee or whatever but as bitpay's funds are locked up in the channel until they are your funds, it would make sense to charge a fee depending on how much of bitpay's funds were locked up in the channel.

I guess you know what a majority thinks. Question is what is possible. OP can most likely be happy with pruning although he doesn't sound convinced yet.
I was wondering if you wizards are considering a mode where a pruning node would be able to query the balance of a wallet without its history, just matching the UTXO set against the wallet's addresses. Of course, without knowing how many accounts or addresses of a BIP44 account for example have been used, many addresses would have to be scanned but it's probably cheaper to consider many addresses, maybe using bloom filters, than to download the full chain again.
Edit: For the record, I would urgently hope to get segwit forward as it is proposed now. If miners want to see a 2MB block proposal being worked on as precondition to approve segwit, I would also not assume it fatal to work out the details of how to move to 2MB blocks, with a comfortable delay to get other improvements in the meantime. The risk is that miners will jump at 2MB signalling easily and I would hope to see how segwit pans out before block size increase even enters voting. I see support for smaller blocks or smaller witness data at probably less than 1% or maybe 1 without %.
@_date: 2016-12-01 01:35:33
Once the block rewards vanish, we need a replacement to ensure the safety of the Bitcoin network.
Currently 4% of all coins in circulation are spent on securing the network per year. Current fee levels only account for 0.4%. If you wanted the same security today without block reward, you would need fees at least x10 higher. Or x10 more transactions of the same fee level.
So if we want 4% of all coins in circulation to be spent on securing the network per year, without block rewards, we would need for example current 3000 tx / block at 5mBTC / tx = 15BTC / block. That's $3.70. But for a bitcoin worth $7500 that would be $37 etc.
Sure, $37 per on chain transaction or $74 to open and close a LN channel would not be "banking for the other 6 billion" but we don't know if we need 4%/year or how far we can reduce fee pressure with LN and bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:15:06

* Litecoin? this has out-lived its purpose. forget it. if it ever had a purpose in the first place.
* Monero? Yeah, Monero is seeing some adoption on dark markets but seriously, it's 1% of Bitcoin's market cap and lags far behind with features. If anything we will see how they are doing with their much bigger transactions, basically bitcoin unlimited block size and I heard no pruning?
I'll cut my list here. ZCash challenges Monero but has its own (toxic waste and scaling) problems. What else is there to be taken seriously? I mean what else that will not be possible to be replicated into a sidechain to orderly funnel over all bitcoins onto the new cool feature set it provides? I'm not scared of competition.

Whut?? I highly doubt that but for bitcoins, not people, we could get an exact metric of coins that were moved on the BCH side. I highly doubt that the Satoshi coins moved for example.
Anyway, I feel for the loss of those who buy into the wrong side of the fork but would anticipate that BCH reaches $1000 before dying due to the mining dynamics. BCH mining happens at a loss still, compared to BTC mining but once that flips (and it will. that's just the nature of difficulty adjustments), BCH could enter a boom cycle of BTC blocks getting slower, fees getting higher, BCH shills pumping the benefits of BCH, noobs buying into "the new Bitcoin", boom shifting mining profitability more towards BCH, etc.
Hard to call the top as maybe even some deep pockets are at the table trying to devide and conquer Bitcoin but my BCH are for sale.
@_date: 2016-12-03 05:58:41
That depends.
* If you are a miner with short term profits in mind, any fee paying to do some recalculation of the Merkel tree might float your boat. Zero fee would be spam to you.
* If you run an archival node to fight for a better world, you might be a bit more critical. Transactions that represent actual economic activity are no spam. You put your server there to promote your magic internet money. Transactions that provably only fill blocks (like a chain of 100 transactions always spending the full amount into the next address, all in one block). This is independent of the fee paid.
* If you are an SPV user, zero fee filler transactions might not be considered spam as they would not cause you any inconvenience. But the same chain of transactions filling the blocks but at fees higher than what you just paid when your software still thought that would get you next block confirmation, with more paying filler transactions getting pumped on the network for days, delaying your transaction for days might count as spam.
* (If you are a religious geek with deep knowledge of Bitcoin, spam might even be transactions spent towards gambling websites ;) )
@_date: 2016-12-03 03:32:21
"Spam mail" is "unsolicited mail". It is not "mail without a stamp". Back in the day when spam mail was still a thing with paper and stuff, spammers did pay (more) for that. Sure, they got a discount for buying bulk delivery but they did pay. But the same bulk fees applied for very much solicited mail.
You can't distinguish spam from non-spam depending on how much is paid for it. If Wall Mart pays 2ct. per flyer sent to your door step, it's still spam. If Novartis sales people leave "free samples" of their product at your physician's, for some minutes of his time, Novartis pays a fortune for product and dispatch and still some doctors will not want that and rightfully call it spam.
If big-block proponents cough up the fees to fill blocks in coordinated spike activities to disrupt the network, they pay for your attention like Wal Mart and Novartis. They show you what they think you have to see to buy their product.
I actually can't know if this is what's going on but as long as there are very distinctive features to clusters of transactions that appear in bulk, I assume this is what's happening.

What's it with the negativity lately? I meet bitcoiners a lot at bitcoin meetups and the bad vibe I see here is totally not the same I get when talking to them or when talking to no-coiners about bitcoin.
Yes, I don't mind letting the conversation go in that direction and spark real interest a lot, too. More so when bitcoin is at an ATH than these days but no-coiners usually have heard about it now, which is a great step forward compared to 5 years ago and they have outdated ideas of its price but usually don't know how easy it is to use.
Sure, I might have bored the one or the other Uber driver who politely didn't show me his disinterest and I won't bother confusing the retired taxi driver who was explaining me all his petty close-minded issues for the past 20 minutes but when meeting a techy/anarchist/digital nomad/... I usually get to mention bitcoin quite quickly and mostly get positive experiences from that.

I don't know what breadwallet did but this is how I did it in the past with Mycelium, too.
Problem is, and I would love to hear how breadwallet does it, CPFP would have to consider more than just the direct parent. Imagine some payout to 200 people that paid too low a fee. Now you get a transaction with sufficient fees but the big one is stuck. Whoever paid you, already "bumped" the fee but not enough to pay for 200 under-paid outputs. To really pay for this parent, you would have to consider all the chain of unconfirmed transactions and all their children that might also bump the fee already.
In that sense I had suggested to, by default if spending from unconfirmed inputs, put that whole cluster to the desired fee level. If the cluster – in Mycelium terms – pays normal fees and you want to pay economic fees, you would have to pay these for your transaction only. If you want to get priority treatment, you would have to pay for the whole cluster though, to make your transaction actually "priority". In this sense, the cluster would not include leafs that pay less than priority, as the miners might mine your juicy tx and leave some of the other children of the big stuck tx unconfirmed.

@_date: 2016-11-29 05:13:56
Miners have costs and profits. Big blocks are also bigger costs. Without fee pressure, blocks could be bigger with less fees, resulting in losses instead of profits rising.
With LN on the other hand, chances are that people will not care much if on-chain fees go into the double-digit dollar range cause it's a small price to pay for hundreds of thousands of instant, arbitrarily small and onion-routed transactions.
Not saying that I want those high fees and at some point we will need bigger blocks, too, in order to on-board 7 billion people and their fridges but all current users of bitcoin would be fine with a fraction of the transactions they are doing now.

Others said so. Try it! And there is more accessible ways of getting your hands dirty than bitcoin core coding which is mostly C. If you are in Firefox (and chances are good, other browsers aren't that different), hit F12 and type `alert("hello world")` and hit enter. Congratulations, you now did code something!
You might have noticed that while typing, the browser even helped you find what you wanted to type. This feature of an integrated development environment (IDE) you did not see much in the video but it helps a ton to not have to learn all the thousands of commands by heart.
For beginners I would recommend learning either java script (above example. it can't be easier to get started) or Java/Kotlin-Android (it's just so rewarding to develop one's first own app.).

Slow there. As per [our commitment]( u/daniel_at was working on segwit integration for the **old aka current wallet**. This also led to [some standard suggestions](
The **new wallet** will be modular and the only module we (me) are working on is a [bitcoinJ based spv module](
This spv module we will also make available for the old wallet as an optional feature. Segwit therefore depends on bitcoinJ but we would probably bite the bullet and help with according changes to bitcoinJ if bitcoinJ was not ready by the time we are.
This spv module is also something Dash is helping to develop. Dash would be the first alt coin supported in Mycelium. The idea is that once it works for Bitcoin (and Dash), adding alts will be rather trivial with no risk for your keys or distraction from all the alts. One wallet for all your financial needs by just installing the modules you want.

Yes, please run your own lightning node but it's like TOR: The exit nodes will be the hot nodes where LE will keep pestering admins with KYC and AML bullshit. And for routing to work, you need to network with others.
Edit: With exit nodes I refer to the points where the unregulated bitcoin world interfaces with regulated businesses. LN consists of bidirectional channels between nodes and as soon as you try to buy something where your name is required (KYC), questions might get asked where you have your money from (AML) and this might produce a ripple effect of you wanting to know these things about whoever setup a channel your way. If your bank account is filled with money from anonymous "donors", you will have issues and if your wallet is filled with bills from a bank robbery, you will, too. Same applies with bitcoin. Bit with LN we have the chance of baking fungibility into the protocol if we do it right.

If they run 1k nodes with 1BTC each, it hardly shows in their budget and neither will this "investment" make us rich as proposed by u/mustbemoney.
If those nodes charge no fee or even a negative fee, clients will jump at them.
In general, extracting value from routing information is a competitive edge over those who run their nodes for profit without selling/valuing that data.
I assume there will be others though, that have an incentive to run big nodes: laundering operations will probably also have an incentive beyond the transaction fees, to route your money for free or negative transaction fees.
Unfortunately the NSA is in both these lines of business.

You don't have to code, compile or review a wallet software but only if it's possible to review and deterministically build the wallet, can it be trusted.

He contradicts himself a bit. He says smart money is in Bitcoin and the rest are poor gamblers but in his conclusion he doesn't distinguish between Bitcoin and the rest.
In fact I find his point intriguing but people won't stop speculating in a recession. So if the poor gamblers start dumping their tokens, many will dump theirs, too to cut their losses but they will not exit to fiat. They will exit to bitcoin. Likewise if stocks fall because companies work half shifts during a recession, some might exit their stocks to fiat but others will exit to gold and bitcoin but probably not some fringe token.

Miners' investment is labor, electricity and mining rigs. The former two can't appreciate and the rigs have basically a negative shelf life from the start.
Mining is only ever lucrative if you get into it at the perfect time and get out as soon as your operation turns negative. The right time is when price goes up like crazy,  or at a significant fee event but you can't predict those and you need time to ramp up your mining capacity. Those are "right times" because the price of mining a bitcoin doesn't react as fast to an increase in demand as speculators that might sell them directly to you at any price the market moves to.

Now if Walmart doesn't want a lightning channel, the arrangement regarding locked-up funds would also be different. bitpay would have all kind of options to turn the convoluted lighting details into an attractive 0.5% fee per transaction and get rich from it, while it's still cheap for Walmart.

Please stop whining! To demonetized fiat currencies, we don' have to instantly switch to bitcoin. In fact most of us can't. In a 100km radius of my house there is one food place, three hostals and maybe 3 less relevant businesses that would accept bitcoin and if all that have the option to cover their daily needs would switch to bitcoin, 3tps would not be enough neither.
I distinguish strongly between the store of value and the transaction network and am pretty sure that the key to demonetize fiat lays in the first aspect, not the second. Be all-in but hold enough fiat to not have liquidity issues in your day-to-day life. This is more of a commitment than 90% of the people in r/bitcoin take but it's 99% the way to get rid of fiat. If we reduce fiat to a payment network, at least until bitcoin can do more than 3tps, we are on a very good track away from fiat for good.

When reviewing a big PR (which is my main job), I appreciate if there is not much to be said about the PR but the whole point of doing the review is to fix issues before it gets merged to master, so it's natural that there are more commits after the review started. But as soon as the author starts rewriting history, he also messes with my review process and it certainly does not facilitate the reviewing.
I wonder if you could elaborate a bit on the review process and take on history rewriting on an open PR.

If my hair dryer doesn't blow strong enough, I might find on the internet that this pesky useless resistor on the right can be shorted to make it run at 200% its speed and engineers might differ on the matter if that's a good idea and if it fails it might not kill me but if this is the only hair dryer I will get in my whole life, I might be very very cautious in trying that out. I might actually lean towards listening to those that suggest getting me a stronger resistor to reduce it to 80%.

Why not? It's not like all the world would switch to bitcoin the second that Wallmart started accepting it. LN can bundle millions of transactions. So assume coinbase users keep channels to coinbase and so on. Now there would probably form a rather busy channel between Coinbase and Bitpay and as Bitpay is more a merchant payment provider and Coinbase more a user "wallet" provider, coins would mainly flow from Coinbase to Bitpay but lets asume on-chain transactions cost $1 and the average LN transaction done is also worth around $1. Now with $1M in the channel, Coinbase could do a million transactions to Bitpay and Bitpay charges its merchants 1%. Lets assume that is the weekly volume and Coinbase sends Bitpay $1M on chain to reset the channel.
The $1million loan would on average be a $500k loan and that would yield a $1000 weekly interest at 10% per year, which would be high for a bitcoin loan.
1 million transactions done on chain would cost $1million.
Bitpay could charge 1% for those micro payments easily. That's $10k.
So … the users would have to pay $1M in fees to do 1M $1 transactions on chain (currently the network can in total process only 3 million transactions per week, so if between Coinbase and Bitpay alone there are 1million transactions, $1/tx is no high figure I guess.)
With lightning they would pay $10k in fees (or the merchants eat those).
Bitpay would earn these $10k in fees and pay $1k to Coinbase for the channel "loan".
Now you might say that $1 payments are not realistic but it would not really change much in the overall picture if instead of one channel re-balancing they would have to do 10 per week. Or 100. Not unless on-chain transactions cost significantly more than $100.


Above I explained how things can get dumbed down for business and business will consider this as it's way cheaper than credit cards. The other thing is how to explain to users how LN works. I assume most users will basically get their paycheck into a lightning channel that they can then use to do LN payments via their employer (or whichever payment processor he uses).

* If these numbers were accurate and you sum up all those absolute numbers, you get to 330 million Bitcoin users as per their definition (used or owned crypto currencies).
* Almost 100% of all crypto users used Bitcoin, if only to get into their coin of choice.
* "used or owned" implies at least one transaction
* total number of all Bitcoin transactions recorded on the blockchain: 446 million
So that leaves 1.35 transactions ever for actual Bitcoin users? That sounds highly unlikely to me, even before asking what about the other half of the world not in this list.
For OP, here's the math:
Country	| population [millions] |	Bitcoin users [%] |	Bitcoin users [millions]

The article is not about Russia dumping USD in the sense of the central bank dumping foreign currency reserves but about Rosneft, the government controlled main Russian oil producer to switch from USD to EUR.
Why do gigantic companies like this not offer more than one option? Why not offer to sell for USD and EUR and TRY? The price may vary and those with TRY might still find it cheaper to get EUR first than to accept the TRY/barrel price quoted by the company.
Any small shop in frontier regions in the world accepts more than one currency for souvenirs and the rate might appear to favor one or the other currency but that's how markets work, isn't it?

As u/pb1x already said, trading in itself never is successful manipulation but trading. Period.
What leads to strange patterns if you are not aware of it are gurus that get a herd of sheeplies to follow their investment advice on closed mailing lists. Guru informs the first ring of followers of future price action, after he already took according action, followers tell their followers after jumping on the train, guru does the oposite and tells followers that the trend will reverse, the followers tell their followers while hurrying to front-run them. Those are pump-and-dumps and usually just burn those down the line or others that try to jump on trains that are not based on substantial trends. Just ignore this. Bitcoin is volatile and some of its volatility might be due to those gamblers.
Another group of gamblers bets with leverage on price action. Leverage means you can't just keep your position indefinitely. You might get forced into liquidating your position which usually has an effect oposite to what you were betting on. Say you bet $10 on rising value but with a x10 leverage. Now if value falls 10%, your bet fell 100%. If value falls more, you owe the broker more money, which brokers tend to dislike. They actually like a comfy threshold to your balance turning negative, so they "margin call" you if you get close to negative terrain or force liquidate your position if it gets really negative, in which case you end up with nothing, while selling an asset that you thought would get bought, which increases the down-trend. This is why speculators might try to drive others into mass forced liquidation of their positions. But if speculators with deeper pockets can hold the position, those speculators trying to act against the trend in an attempt to buy low or sell high might get burnt.
Now where it gets criminal is if the manipulation is an exchange selling coins it doesn't actually have. With central banks that's called cash generation, with business banks this is called fractional reserve banking and is also mostly legal but with bitcoin there is normally a promise to not go fractional and trying to recover from doing this is as futile as it is for the business banks but these can ask the central banks to print more money which is not possible in bitcoin, so yeah, here we would definitely talk about criminal activity.

Nope. This trend must not continue. At least not for very long or Bitcoin is doomed.
Bitcoin is currently a multi billion dollar economy, protected by sub-billion dollar policing operations (mining). It is not clear that a multi trillion dollar Bitcoin economy would be safe with only a sub-billion dollar policing industry.
Currently the industry is protected at a cost of 4% of its market cap per year. Reducing this to 0.004% might be devastating.
Some suggest (and I'm less convinced now than I was that this actually works) that shifting a big part of the burden to proof of stake would protect Bitcoin more efficiently. After all if an attacker would need to buy some +20% of all bitcoins in order to destroy Bitcoin, it would make all prior bitcoin holders incredibly solvent for creating the next and better Bitcoin.

Luke\-jr is exaggerating a lot here. Bitmain improved sha256 computation on their chips by a factor of 1.2 or so, for the very specific case of needing a special hash out of millions of tries. This optimization is known and a bit unfortunate to exist, for the very special use case of POW mining but sha256 is hardly broken.
The problem is not that pre\-images can be found for arbitrary hashes, which would be "broken". This still takes millions of years.

That's a waste of resources that only increases your attack surface.
Use 2 of 2 multisig and you are secure against either of these wallets having a backdoor.
asked for elaboration:
If you have 2 hardware wallets and you put the same seed into both, your chance of loss is "chance wallet 1 is weak against attacks or has a back door" + "chance wallet 2 is weak against attacks or has a back door".
If you have 2 hardware wallets and you put a different seed into both for a 2of2 setup, your chance of loss is "chance wallet 1 and wallet 2 is weak against attacks or has a back door"
In other words, with 2of2 you are still save even if it is trivial to hack one of your wallets. It's even save if both wallet 1 and wallet 2 have backdoors to their random number generators as long as they do not collude and even if they colluded, it would be very hard to find the private keys of 2of2 wallets if all you had was the blockchain and a head start on finding random numbers for both wallets. Interestingly if you make this 3of3 with some virus infested windows machine, you still improve your security, as the virus controller would then also have to collude with the 2 wallet backdoor holders.
To be fair, multisignature can also increase your chance of losing your funds if you lose one of the wallets. Usually people check their backups only after they lose a wallet and most bitcoins are not lost to theft but to poor key management.
TLDR: Multi Signature will be the big thing for security going forward.

So for me the non-custodial part is a bit suspicious, too. If a user buys bitcoins in Abra, does Abra send coins to the actual real bitcoin wallet on the client side, including the transaction fee?
Another question about "synthetic stocks": Abra does own the stocks but Abra's users only speculate on their value? So if Abra users collectively own 1000.63 Apple stocks, Abra the company tries to get 1001 Apple stocks in a timely manner? So if Abra users collectively ditch Apple, Abra sells Apple? If so, then KYC for securities fraud investigations should be very much on the table. Else, insider trading through anonymous Abra accounts would be trivial, wouldn't it?

"proven track record" means nothing.

I didn't do this reply to plug our wallet. Do your own research. There are so many options now and all have their pros and cons depending on what your priorities are. If you asked me though, our wallet is Mycelium and its main features for me are:
1. Ready to go in one minute. As we do not force the user to create a backup first thing when he installs the app, you can install it, click "create new wallet" and you can receive coins. This is why I was using this wallet before I worked for them. It makes quite an impression if you have somebody setup with a bitcoin wallet in a minute, including sending him a dollar.
2. Privacy is one of our main focuses. We don't store who talks to our servers and while querying your wallet transactions from our server requires trusting us to not store this, it is more private than other wallets that are supposedly more bitcoiny by talking to random full nodes for the same task, gossiping out all your addresses to random strangers.
3. Many features you will not find in other wallets like BitId, BIP70 (this one is controversial, too but my favorite merchants use BIP70, so for convenience I don't mind that my wallet supports it), CPFP, many fee options, full segwit support, multiple accounts, watch-only accounts
4. Hardware wallet support!
5. We have published our code and you can check our app through deterministic builds
6. I compile it myself. This one is tricky but currently nobody outside the company checks our deterministic builds, so should I ever not be the release manager, I would still have to build it myself to check on my successor as release manager until it becomes an industry norm that people check on the wallets to not release modified versions.
Mycelium is not for everyone. Features we provide that you should also check for with whatever wallet you pick though, are
* published or open source code for accountability and probably
* SegWit support

It was fixed in the repository "silently" but when the update was announced to be ready, the description was pretty much like "yeah, you could update" but no word on how urgently no Ledger should be used at all before updating.

Mycelium cannot send bitcoins without syncing the account and finding transactions. If you have no transactions, you are either dealing with an empty wallet or failed to sync, which is likely if the wallet wasn't updated in two years.
Else, please share if you are talking about Android or iPhone and which version of the wallet you have installed.

95% is way too optimistic. We at Mycelium will never ask for any private key material but apparently have some "spies" on our Telegram groups and the scammers cold-contact new users with issues using an account impersonating channel admins.  was the latest, using my avatar and claiming to be me.
Again, to my knowledge in all the company's history we did not once ask a user to share private key material with us. Private key material is the 12 words backup, the private key of an address or the extended private key of an account (xpriv).
Neither do I know of any company charging money for support.
Another type of scammer are those "hot girls" starting with some innocent "hello" to then tell you about some investment opportunity. If you contact me, state your cause in your initial message or get blocked and marked as spammer.

Humans are terrible at coming up with and remembering good passwords. BIP39 mnemonics are much saver and you can use the BIP32 HD keys to also encrypt metadata. The wallet itself then would be stored according to BIP32 or BIP44, 49 and 84.

This is what my reply to my comment was about. This is where we disagree. Gavin claiming to want what we all agree on, as an argument against somebody who wants to achieve it by other means is a fallacy.
And no, I had not subscribed to bitcoin if it weren't about decentralization and I am sure we can develop it into a decentralized system with instant, low cost  micro payments. And I'm willing to delay that by months rather than give up decentralization and I'm ok with a small block increase now, with a schedule to further increase some 40% per year to bridge to getting the tech done to achieve it but I guess that's already where I disagree with you.

"Lost" could also mean "destroyed".

And I doubt devs would hesitate to add some bits to the granularity if a satoshi reached parity with the USD for example.

I was kind of convinced that the friction of switching coins is higher than I originally thought by another argument: As soon as there is volatility in the multi hop link, nodes get an incentive to delay cooperation and not stick to their commitment if price moves in the wrong direction. Good arguments there but I think alt-coin bag-holders will be fine with a little friction and push for merchants to buy into their "superior" coins. Ultimately I agree that the network effect plays in Bitcoins favor.




You would be surprised :D There are many people arguing in favor of inflation. Freicoin's argument is that it increases spending over hoarding (I strongly disagree with this position! Still it's a feature in some people's mind.), grin's argument is to have a fair emission schedule that doesn't favor the early miners (I kind of agree that very aggressive halvings are akin to insta- and pre-mine scams but halfing every 4 years ... come on, that's fair) and then there is the security issue: With a perpetual 1% inflation you would not have to rely on the fees to increase and stay high for the coin to be secure. This is the most convincing argument for me and I also just now heard it from Peter Todd in [this]( interview.


Yes, I agree but as Peter Todd argued in above interview, too, more efficient algorithms in terms of scaling necessarily end up being more private and if we could get that to the base layer, it would still be even better. Grin's claim is that with the same transactions that bitcoin has, grin would have a fully verifiable 3GB block chain now, not the hundreds that bitcoin has.
Again, being better is not sufficient to replace what's already there but with lightning and sidechains, you also produce bridging technology that can be a pathway to join features of coins. This can make it less painful to go in and out of alts and help transition if a real competitor to bitcoin would emerge.

The other thing I read on your page is that the server is very slow right now! So if it only does 0.5tps, funneling through $100, $1 at a time is actually quite slow. Still faster than using vanilla bitcoin if you are alone on that hub but still, ... this has to be in the 1000tps for a cheap server.
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:32:35
Still pathetic. If you lose money because you sold based on Satoshi presumably cashing out just because some of his coins moved, then you deserved it.

@_date: 2015-08-21 03:09:47
There would be some quite substantial differences. If you start out without bitcoin and receive your first millis via lightning, then you will need to motivate a hub to open a channel your way over potentially more than those few millis. On that difference you might in addition to a one-time network fee pay (very low) interest over the amount and time you keep it open. Or, if you buy the bitcoin without lightning, you would have to pay the network fee to open a channel to a hub which again might cost tiny amounts of money.
That was the annoying part that will be hard to explain to the user. From there on, you would be able to do bitcoin payments most likely without any limits or fees at all that would clear within one second.
Sidechains are a completely different beast. Here everything that can work with bitcoin will also be possible in two-way-pegged alt-coins. Those alts have certain limitations. For example there is no block reward possible in these and they have to have a certain compatibility with bitcoin but then they will have a lot of freedoms and you will be able to atomically buy in and out of these alts at a fixed exchange rate.

While I agree with this being an incentive to be first to implement bitcoin hub and spoke, I don't agree with it being a problem as long as it's open to everybody. Today you have to cough up about $100 millions if you seriously want to start a bank. With LN you can anonymously provide liquidity to an anonymous LN node with as little as $10. So while it is true that you can only earn fees if you have money laying around, it happens at a far lower level and by this is subject to a free market that will drive profits down to almost nothing, providing almost free micro payments to everybody.
Compare that to on chain transactions where miners charge very real fees and don't even get to keep them. A miner pays on average 95% of his investment to mining hardware companies and utility companies.
The LN node provider will do so, too but it will be at a much lower level and the barrier to entry will be much much lower. I live in Chile and didn't buy mining hardware as buying from China usually takes 2-3 months (sample size 3 packages with gadgets from fasttech.com).

Funny how the halving is such a topic still. The first halving was a huge experiment. Nobody knew if mining would continue but it was kind of smoothed by the advent of ASIC mining. The second halving was exiting again, as there was no huge leap in mining tech and preparations were taken for all eventualities but it went by smoothly. Now we had blocks that had almost as much fees as the mining reward, the drop in mining reward is already down 75% from its inital levels and we know that we can double compensate for the drop in reward with fees after the next halving. Why do people expect the same or even stronger effects from future halvings even though they are halving in size and they lost their magic as we had two already?

Regarding the "hardened keys" question, here is a simple demonstration:
        $ node # run node, with the bitcore library installed
        &gt; var HDPublicKey = require('bitcore/lib/hdpublickey')
        &gt; var HDPrivateKey = require('bitcore/lib/hdprivatekey')
        &gt; var xprivKey = HDPrivateKey()
        &gt; var xpubKey = xprivKey.hdPublicKey
so here, we have an extended private key and its extended public key. We can derive them and get to the same extended public keys:
        &gt; xprivKey.derive(5).xpubkey
        'xpub68RxTHwab4VhKaZMaKQnWfgSoZcwXGSgpV4GEJeBW7BBHimo5KWq16N3dsR4ztVa2g4meVLaFqbrGd8hKR2ASpgiZtAUg5nooSHSUGW2baU'
        &gt; xpubKey.derive(5).xpubkey
        'xpub68RxTHwab4VhKaZMaKQnWfgSoZcwXGSgpV4GEJeBW7BBHimo5KWq16N3dsR4ztVa2g4meVLaFqbrGd8hKR2ASpgiZtAUg5nooSHSUGW2baU'
        &gt; xprivKey.derive(5).xpubkey === xpubKey.derive(5).xpubkey
        true
yes, they are the same.
(Of course there is no such thing as `xpubKey.xprivkey`. Trying to code using this, will quickly give you an error. I say that, because something else does not give you an error but rather gives you plausible looking objects ;) )
Now, what does hardening do? I find the bitcore library very sneaky in this respect, as it [simply ignores the second parameter for extended public keys]( so instead of throwing an error here, it happily derives to the non-hardened key but I understand that people who don't know crypto, should not use those libs anyway, but maybe, just maybe they will have a second thought, if a guy who wrote a 300 pages book on the topic, including on HD wallets, has no clue, which I would not blame him for, as I myself had to go very public to have somebody point me to what's going on. But enough of that, here is where hardening makes a difference:
        &gt; xprivKey.derive(5, true).xpubkey
        'xpub68RxTHwivj2fVVct3TYatDbi9yPSAcyUnrz3pvacZJRJXmzJiJVhL2g398iRRkdF8ii7SGPzXWpRWrvTWD6eL7sKV7LJLGSnB4ukDJg4eLb'
        &gt; xpubKey.derive(5, true).xpubkey
        'xpub68RxTHwab4VhKaZMaKQnWfgSoZcwXGSgpV4GEJeBW7BBHimo5KWq16N3dsR4ztVa2g4meVLaFqbrGd8hKR2ASpgiZtAUg5nooSHSUGW2baU'
        &gt; xprivKey.derive(5, true).xpubkey === xpubKey.derive(5, true).xpubkey
        false
So in conclusion, you can not derive to a hardened key if you only have the HDPublicKey. You can only get there, if you know the HDPrivateKey. On the other hand, having either of those keys, allows you to derive further keys from it. I assume you can't tell from looking at an extended private or public key, if it's hardened or not.

Funny how our best assumption is that it took "about 10 minutes", as that's what the blockchain does. By comparison, all other claims it would have taken longer or shorter are hearsay.
If eye-witnesses testify and other time-stamping mechanisms supported the version that it took 2:40 I would probably believe it but with a lot of money at stake I would probably do the math on how likely that is and given the answer decide on whether to dig deeper for evidence that people faked their version of history.

Proof of burn is a one way "peg": The units on the other chain cost exactly one BTC but there is no way back.
Atomic swaps are no peg at all: They only guarantee that assets on one chain can get atomically swapped for assets on another chain but they require the units to be bootstrapped on both chains independently if you have no two way peg.
I assume that submarine swaps are also swaps and not a peg.
A two way peg pegs the unit on the second chain to the unit of the first. The exchange rate is fixed. It is as if you were transacting with the same unit of account on both chains.

Don't want to beat a dead horse here. I see that different currencies along the way are probably a bad idea but the nodes using trust instead of cryptography on an edge along the way ... why not? Thanks to onion routing, other nodes would not know if a channel got updated between other nodes or not. As long as the pre-image gets handed down, there is no need to use it on every edge. Lets say nodes give each other credit, while the splice in is waiting for confirmation ...

Sorry but this sounds a bit unbelievable. So do you promise that no matter what, if I join using bitcoin and leave using bitcoin no matter the amount, you guys will not ask any questions? There have been so many exchanges before, that first were without KYC until some whale wanted to cash out and then he suddenly had to jump through all the KYC hoops and loops.
Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with KYC being required beyond a certain activity level but to state there is none, to me sounds like false advertisement.

Problem is that even if you formalized things and fixed those bugs in core rather than declaring them to be the rule, you would have to implement them for the first 6 years of blockchain.

OP fears a central bank or something could "cheaply" cripple bitcoin into oblivion but as pointed out many times, the bip is probably meant to read like "if an 80% super majority wants to change the block size, the most moderate change cropped to x [0.5, 2] is applied". So if 80% want to increase the block size, the most moderate increase of those is picked, or x2 if it's more than x2. If 80% want to shrink the block size, the most moderate vote is picked or x0.5.

It's not as bad as portrayed by some but it is pretty bad. With this wallet you do **not** get an exclusive BCH wallt but you get both a BCH and a BTC wallet.
Both use the same BIP44 derivation path and address scheme that will result in people losing money even if they interact with people that do not try to scam them (Not all people that value and trust BCH are scammers). Receiving coins to the wrong of the barely distinguishable wallets will result in users receiving one coin on an address on the other coin's account that is beyond the look-ahead. 
This and the fact they talk about Bitcoin being worth $x in the intro tutorial but then put BCH above BTC is malicious and deceiving. One star.
Edit: Bitcoin Accounts receive into one address at a time, into arbitrarily many accounts and their addresses, that are all derived from the 12 words backup. Upon restoring your coins from a 12 words backup, your wallet will restore account 1 and only account one if it has no transactions on its first 20 addresses. If you use 5 accounts with 100 transactions on account 5 using BTX and now accidentally receive 12 BTY to your account 5 address 101, restoring your coins in a BTY wallet will normally not find your coins and probably not even allow you to restore more than one account. As much as this is not understood here in r/Bitcoin, normal users will not understand it neither.

Meanwhile I suggest you look up [free speech]( yourself.

That said, I don't like censorship here neither but censorship by a private entity is no free speech issue. Here we have the possibility to choose [voice or exit](
Edit: Ok, it was wrong I called "Thermos" and I did it as I thought it resonated with you guys who are upvoting the false statement about Theymos limiting your freedom of speech.
Also what is wrong with you? From the answers further down I have to assume you actually believe that you are defending freedom of speech by suppressing one form of maintaining a communication platform? Sorry I know you will flock to down-vote me again but are you stupid? How on earth would meaningful communication work if everybody was forced to listen to everybody even though he doesn't want to? It's "Freedom of Speech" not "Privilege to have everybody listen to what you have to say". "Freedom of Speech" means you go unpunished if you tell bullshit but why on earth would anybody be forced to allow your bullshit on his platform? I am not saying that XT is bullshit but has the right to consider it bullshit and is his channel. Leave it if you don't like his way of handling things. I don't like him neither for various reasons and one of those is that he has too much control but shutting him down on the grounds of freedom of speech is just stupid because you are doing the right opposite of what you claim to be doing. By making him comply with your way of thinking, you take away freedom.

Ok, so how does hardening make sense? Unfortunately [BIP32]( fails to address that question but looking at [BIP44]( you can see for example, that knowing the master xpubkey doesn't give you anything. Neither does purpose or coin_type.

Proof of reserve should at least proof the amount in the books but users often don't have all their funds in the order books or they have the funds in stop limit orders that only get revealed once a certain price is reached.

Libra is just a derivative of the fiat we are criticizing from day one for all the same reasons that now apply to libra but I wouldn't give libra too much credit. Nothing new here.

You can import ledger accounts in Mycelium Android. This allows you to receive but not send unless you have the ledger plugged in.

Your claims though are not clear to me how they should be possible. Tokenizing assets doesn't remove the third party risk.

If the server is trust-free, there is no need for it to be run by a known entity. Think of a server behind TOR that not only provides the service for free but actually pays you for using it. There are liquidity providers that would happily help out with liquidity for free, as long as they can do this anonymously. Sure, at first people will freak out if their "free transactions" get provided by "pirate coins", but eventually some will see the benefits of using "satoshi coins" and "DPR coins" and at some point people would stop freaking out and just accept that you can't track coins anymore. … and that's where bitcoins are fungible.

I'm confused people consider net worth in this. As a mathematician I'd rather do the math:
* Your BTC holdings: h
* Cost of hardware wallet x: cx
* Probability of losing my BTC without hardware wallet: pl
* Probability of losing my BTC with hardware wallet x: lx
Put your coins into x if your expected savings `(1-lx)(h-cx)` are bigger than `(1-pl)h`.
In other words, if a hardware wallet could guarantee your holdings to be save (lx=0) and you consider wherever the coins are now to be a 20% chance of losing your coins (pl=0.2) by the time you want to spend them (at least assume 20% if it's an exchange or a regular Joe's Windows machine), you should consider the costs of having a hardware wallet as it's price and the costs of not having one as `0.2*holdings`. Minimize your costs. Buy a hardware wallet if you have more than 5x its value in BTC. Not before.
If you find losing 0.2*holdings scary but it's still lower than the price of the hardware wallet you are eyeing, consider reducing that 20% chance of loss by improving your security.

Yes, well, kind of. This kind of calculation assures you that TN is a viable alternative to vanilla bitcoin transactions but that is still way way off of what you can achieve. If your server can handle 30*60*24*30tx/month, it still can only handle 0.5tps, so apart from peak times basically making it unusable for even small transactions, this server would never be viable to do a $1000tx one $ at a time.

As stated above, it has some serious issues where both the client and the server can lock up funds indefinitely and make the other part pay a ransome to resolve the situation. If money being destroyed is not your concern then it would still be a problem to get your users a wallet. I guess that will ultimately be the biggest hurdle. Maybe if you integrated a client side JS wallet in your website you can have your clients top up their private-ish TN wallet that then talks to your TN server. But then you would still have to match your clients' funds on the server side to benefit from the TN network and you should consider that the recipient has to be online at some point to actually receive payments.

Ok, so if I extend the above analysis to a general formula, this is how it looks like:
Probability p for a block not to be found after t seconds is:
p(t) = 2^-t/600
t | p(t)
10 minutes | 50%
1 minute | 93%
6 s | 99%
1 s | 99.9%
2:40 h | 0.002%
And at first I was a bit insecure despite having studied math but now looking at this I'm pretty sure this makes sense.
Edit: Of course the formula does not take into account propagation of solutions, network splits or dos attacks. It's the ideal situation of all the hashing power sitting in one room mining empty blocks.

We agree that the expected value is 600s (historically a bit shorter due to hash rate growth between retargets).
This implies that with an infinitely large sample set, 50% will take longer and 50% shorter.
But also when picking an arbitrary moment chances are 50% to not see a new block for 600s. I'm pretty confident this can be chained like I did.

Showerthought: What if B2X proponents realize that BTC miners will only mine B2X if they are willing to lose a lot of money short term and permanently if they fail to destroy the 1X chain? What if those BTC miners now realize that mining 1X could end them up mining an orphaned chain, as B2X attacks the 1X chain? What if those who have no clue or strong opinion just mine BCH if it's more immediate cash anyway? I guess that come the split, there will be miners that want 1X or 2X to win and mine that chain no matter what and the others will mine BCH like they did when BCH oscillated against BTC.
Now if the above holds any truth, buying BCH pre-fork to dump them right at the fork can help keep miners at the 1X-2X front and not retreat to some boring BCH.
Equally important will be the timing of swapping one's coins of both sides of the fork.
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:14:20
Sergey found that you can use any address when you use `null` for the derivation path but here is my version of how this bug was discovered:
 Background
We were developing SegWit support for Mycelium and one of our design decisions to go with "mixed mode" meaning that you don't have to switch accounts to receive bitcoins to a SegWit or legacy address was not easy with Trezor hardware wallets. I knew in Trezor you define the derivation path for the change and inputs and give a bitcoin address for the payments and Trezor doesn't like if the "account" for the change differs from those of inputs but the Trezor would still let the user confirm that "extra payment" to himself. This cost us some extra work (and Trezor techies were more on the rude side of a tone in their reply to our request to streamline the more private way of using their wallet) and KeepKey was a better user experience right away.
 First suspicions
To my surprise, Ledger wallets were totally fine with the change going to a "different account", so I asked Sergey Lappo to investigate just how different that account may be, meaning to investigate if the wallet knows about the 3 standards and allows change to go to one of 3 accounts or if there is room for more creative choices of accounts where only the hacker would know how to recover them later, allowing the hacker to blackmail the victim.
 The confirmation
The next day Sergey Lappo came back with the result: Yes, you can use different accounts and yes, you can put very weird accounts. Instead of Account1, Account7936197/3493452/3405106/7139759 for example. And as hardware wallets generally don't remember where they put coins but the user with his desktop software or Mycelium wallet has to remember where he put them to later spend the funds. This is a problem. But it gets worse:
 Hacking without the need to blackmail
Sergey found that you can even send to addresses that are not part of any account at all by leaving the derivation path (account number) empty (`null`), opening the door to send the "change" to any address of the hacker. And as the Ledger doesn't specify the Accounts the coins are being spent from, you can even empty all the accounts the hacker can find (the standard accounts for example).

Lightning nodes could even provide fungibility, as they by design swap my coins for the coins of a liquidity provider. With the node and the liquidity provider being anonymous (cause they can) you would definitely see nodes that charge a negative fee, cause people happily provide liquidity as a form of mixing coins.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:08:37
Your wallet will show an address that has never been used before. It might have been used though on the other coin, which is bad for your privacy, as receiving $5 for some personalized payment might coincide with some huge transaction on the other coin.
My point above was the reverse though: If you use address 101 of your wallet because it's your 101st incoming transaction but the other sends you the other coin, then your other-coin wallet might not expect it as it allows you to skip some addresses but not 100. The standard demands to expect up to 20 addresses being skipped. Not more.

Somebody I know tried to kick off something like this in Munich and produced a laminated QR-Code to give it to a homeless guy. That guy turned it down as law does not allow you to ask for money and any sign reading anything that could imply they were collecting money is against that law. This is why they usually have just an empty cup or a hat next to where they sit and they don't ask you for tips neither.
I understand why those laws exist and in other countries it can be very annoying when people harass you into giving them money (in Barcelona a gang of beggars, one with an iron rod asked me for a Euro) or they violently offer merchandise (on the river Nile they threw cloths into my window and asked to throw money down to their boats and at touristic sites they actually beat each other in order to get closer to the tourists and offer their stuff) and others clearly sell as a form of begging (here in Chile they sell patches for whatever you are willing to pay) but some middle ground is probably better than this stupid attempt to "forbid poverty". And don't they do that in the US, too? I had red of a state where you are not allowed to give food to a beggar?

Yes, "Ethiopia" is not a valid recipient, so his comment was factually right.

Ok, so where  you see a bell curve in my formula is beyond me. It's an exponential curve. Check [this image]( from above link to see how `P(X &lt; x)` looks. No bell here. Not symmetrical neither. What are you talking about?
The formula has a parameter λ which I said might be slightly off. Maybe it's not `ln(2)/600` but the formula is this if the λ is chosen correctly.
Looking at wikipedia again you can see that


As our mean is 600[s], λ has to be 1/600 and not ln(2)/600 with which I conclude that the correct formula is: P( X &gt; x ) = e^-x/600.

With confidential transactions, which at least requires Schnorr signatures, you can make better coinjoin transactions, where amounts don't matter anymore as they would be shielded. At that point it will make sense to aggregate many normal payment transactions into one coinjoin but it would still require the collaboration of all spenders to sign the resulting big transaction.
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:23:49
So, the bitcoin address is a base58 transcription of a ripemd-160 hash with some check bits in the end and a "1" in the start in its most common form.
So it's "1" + 20 bytes + 4 bytes checksum. Check [this chart](
So the address is merely a funny encoding for it's 20 bytes of actual data. So the 2^160 addresses is true. But the base58 encoding makes good for the lacking bits per symbol by using more symbols aka longer strings. That's why addresses are usually not 25 characters but rather 35.

Most importantly, if done right, which I assume but didn't check, you have no custodial risk. Even though the recipient can charge per second, he depends on the sender counter-signing each second. If the sender has a power outage, the recipient physically can't continue charging. In other words, if the recipient wanted to over-charge, he would have to infect the sender's machine.

Anybody who built anything substantial in the history of bitcoin will be a hero. There is not always a need for an immediate return on investment.
A transaction hub can charge fees and thanks to a certain network effect, people gravitate towards the biggest such hubs, so developing it gets you into a great position of being a big player later on.

The hub fees make it susceptible to a DOS attack I guess. If I can open a $100 channel to make the hub open a $100 channel with its own funds, that's a problem.
Yes, I have to lock up as much money as I lock up at the HUB but that might have value to me without me compensating the hub for doing so.
Therefore I suggest to consider a slightly different fee:
* opening a channel to the hub is cheapish
* making it open an outgoing channel to a new recipient costs smallish fee + interest for the amount times expire time.
* the hub could offer a return of the fees for closing out the channel early (as one way to increase liquidity)

I'm sure some wizards will improve on my ELI5 but ...
CT stands for confidential transactions. These are transactions that proof to spend only as much as there is to spend (upper bound) and at least zero to each recipient (lower bound, upper and lower bounds together make the range proofs) but don't share with the public how much goes to which recipient. This is possible thanks to zero knowledge proofs, which in turn are relatively expensive (and some of them rely on a trusted initial setup but not the ones we are talking about here). They are expensive both in bytes used for a transaction and in CPU time needed to verify them. u/nullc shared research on how Benedikt Bünz at Standford achieved a 5x improvement on the size of these range proofs for a simple transaction but basically a gigantic improvement on the size of gigantic transactions: In every extra kB we spend, we can pack more range proofs. Only downer: the computational complexity remains high.

Yes ... I got distracted about this part a bit. Problem is that Mycelium does support import from clipboard but that is highly insecure and [I try to get it removed]( but to no avail so far. Anyway, I highly recommend you get a qrcode, using local tools on a virus free, secure pc to turn your alpha numeric code into a qr code and scan that with Mycelium. I use `qrencode -o /tmp/qrcode.png "[your alpha numeric code here]"` for example, to then scan it with the wallet. `qrencode -o /tmp/qrcode.png` and ctrl-d to end the input of the alphanumeric code to not have it on the shell history.

So if only current bitcoiners trade according to their preference at the next fork of A-Coin and B-Coin, suppose the A-Coiners hold 90% of all pre-fork-coins. Also suppose that both sides want to only hold the coin of their preference after the fork.
At first, both trade A and B at equal value, as they don't know yet how the resources are distributed. Lets assume 1% of all assets gets traded at this price point. Now you have 1% of 90% exchanged for 1% of 10%? Not exactly. Those 1% traders met and started swapping A-Coins for B-Coins but there were 9 times more B-Coins for sale than A-Coins. The first to sell B-Coins got full A-Coins for them, but A-Coin sellers quickly realize that the demand is high.
If A-Coiners and B-Coiners knew a priory how many buyers and sellers there are on both side, they would know that the average price at which A-Coins will exchange for B-Coins is 9/1. Anything above is expensive. Anything below is cheap.
With these forks what I assume that is happening, the smaller side of the fork is more active and mobilizes a bigger percentage of their traders to actually trade, so the demand for B might initially not be 9/1 but 9/5 but as A-Coiners wake up to the trade when B-Coiners already sold all their relatively few A-Coins, the initial 9/5 ratio shifts beyond the 9/1 ratio.

RBF and Batch send caught my attention on your list.


Is Batching something that happens under the hood when you send many transactions in a short amount of time? I had some thoughts on RBF and batching in that direction but it quickly gets scary as you have to keep track of UTXOs in unconfirmed transactions. You don't want to end up "replacing" a transaction, only to find out both get confirmed because they were using a distinct set of UTXOs.

May I quote [this tweet by 


This was their reaction to [tweeting]( about my new project [WalletScrutiny.com](
As the release manager of a Bitcoin wallet myself, it is an essential part of my job with each of our updates to have the release that was built on my machine be checked by another engineer reproducing it on their machine. If that other engineer cannot reproduce the build, we are not releasing the update until the cause is found. This protects me as I can build wallet-stealing updates for guys that take my family hostage, with peace of mind about not doing harm to our users and it protects my boss against me being sloppy and catching a virus or me breaking bad cause I have a gambling issue and really really need that money.
The team behind Samourai being secretive about their identity would be a red flag but if [coindesk]( did their homework, Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill are in charge. This certainly is a good thing assuming they value their freedom more than a million dollar which I would estimate to be the money managed by their users (+50k downloads).
I don't want to pick too much on Samourai which is doing an amazing job in terms of features and also code quality but claiming to be open source is not worth much if the builds are not verifiable and 99.9% of the users don't build their own app. Also Samourai is in good company as my project shows.

Telling me that I'm wrong while not providing what's right is pretty bold from you, especially as you yourself posted links that support me.
The [cumulative distribution function]( is essentially my formula from above.


That is the same statement as


My formula was


and can be written as
P(X &gt; x) = e^-ln(2)(1/600)x
so with L = ln(2)/600 you have the exact same formula. (L stands for lambda which is not available here.)
So I might be wrong about the exact value of L and I'm sad I can't give you the solution with confidence but the fundamental formula I'm 100% sure to be correct.

I use LBC a lot and wasn't aware of such a policy. I tell my clients that I prefer avoiding escrow in cash transactions all the time and always use escrow for online trades. I considered it fair use and would strongly hope for LBC staff to support this mode of operation. After all in cash trades escrow provides no advantage except for maybe acting as a wallet for the first time buyers which is why I mostly end up using escrow even on cash deals.

The incentive to implement something like this is certainly there. I was just suggesting to not hard-code extra-red warnings if the fee exceeds 3mɃ or to only consider price per kB as the normal user will use the app and "learn" that a transaction costs 0.1mɃ and be surprised when it costs 0.2mɃ the next time but he will be pissed if it suddenly costs 1mɃ … unless he was used to 0.5mɃ for some time already. Also he will be pissed if he gets a red warning with every payment, just because fees generally went north.

Maybe. The big block brigade is probably more offended by the late start of the schedule than the formula in detail and many would rather want the formula to be applied right there in the past where Satoshi failed to do so, arguing for an initial ramp up and a start ASAP than to wait yet another 1.5 years but if we [separate the issues]( maybe we can achieve consensus finally.

I did not get that far with electrum. Issue was that the build instructions were not good for building a release version without signing it and I didn't put much effort into signing it as that should not be necessary to verify the build. As they themselves say the builds are not deterministic (which might be stricter than my standards though) I didn't dig deeper for now. I expect that many wallets will improve their build instructions to get up into the green territory.

Not quite. The attacker doesn't have to fill the full block alone. If bitcoin has a natural demand for 0.8MB blocks, he would have to contribute 1MB-0.8MB=0.2MB as opposed to 20MB-0.8MB=19.2MB, which is x100, not x20.
That said, we need a fee market and not a 20MB block size, as a nation state would not run out of funds out-bidding its citizens even at a GB/block, if that's what it takes to take down bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-03 04:03:01
At first I also thought that lightning could help distinguish BTC enough, to let people pull out of most alt coins to the point of them disappearing but consider this:
* coins that are compatible with lightning, such as ltc, can be used for routing. You can have an atomic payment from sender wallet btc-channel to intermediate wallet, ltc-channel to second intermediate wallet, btc-channel to recipient, without caring that the intermediate step is not btc.
* lightning allows you to pay btc bills with any lightning compatible alt-coin. This means that lightning gives these coins enormous utility.
* there are features that are incompatible with btc. Freicoin and others on purpose have indefinite inflation. Grin and others use mimble wimble. Those coins will be favored by some people for their specific properties and once they support lightning, you will again be able to pay btc bills with your grin. 
I think the building block that is needed to make at least coins with superior features like monero or grin obsolete is sidechains. A grin sidechain would allow people to move their bitcoins into a grin network without leaving the bitcoin as a store of value but gaining the mimble wimble privacy. But on the privacy front, we also have confidential transactions which will make it into bitcoin hopefully soon, too.
* Freicoin was worth 1.2mBTC at some point and now sells for 1.44µBTC.
* LTC in my mind never had any good reason to exist. It peaked at 40mBTC and sits at 9 now.
* grin is the first alt coin I find worth looking into but long term I hope we get bitcoin to at least the same privacy, although I doubt we will be able to compete with the block space efficiency, which is why I hope we get it as a sidechain.
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:59:15
Yes. End game. So how does your end game look with increased block size to allow an equal 4billion transactions per user per year?
And this is without relative locktime. I don't oppose bigger blocks for the end game. 1gb is pretty reasonable 20 years from now but an x20 increase doesn't solve anything.

I agree wit that deleting addresses only happens in your wallet and is probably not what you think it is.
Just use a wallet that supports BIP39 for Mnemonic passphrase and BIP44 for a standardized HD wallet and you should never get tempted to re-use addresses. Wiping coins into ever new addresses can provide privacy if done right but what you do neither provides privacy nor security. All the contrary, whoever got a payment from you will know your not so private address, as that's where the money came from, so he can see all future funds that you move to that address. Also the security aspect of revealing your public key might become a security issue in the future where quantum computers might become able to empty re-used addresses but long fail to empty addresses that never revealed their public key.

Not sure what you are talking about. Our code is open source and we verify with deterministic builds, so even if I as the maintainer tried to exit-scam, others on the team would notice it and stop the roll-out. In addition to that, we don't obfuscate the app, so third parties can also fully verify every build.
That said, if you had issues, how about you explain your issue? Maybe we can help you? Maybe you found some bug we should know about?

@_date: 2015-07-09 17:22:20
Well, sidechains and off-chain transactions are maybe not what you think they are.
"Micropayment channels" or "transaction channels" for example wrap possibly 4 billion transactions in two on-chain transactions. The sender locks up a fund, updates the re-distribution with the recipient many many times and at any point either of them may publish what they agreed on, with no third party risk.
Now the 4 billion limit can be removed by simply adding bits to the priority and the payment can go through hubs that know nothing about the users and may be hosted on TOR, so you can have the channels in a multi-hop system.
The lightning network is one approach for this that has no third party risk over multiple hops.
A simpler solution would be to have the sender and the recipient communicate and send 1ct. at a time and if things go wrong, they choose a different relay node, black-listing who stole their money. Relay nodes could be completely anonymous and nation-less behind TOR and offer the service for free or even at a premium if tumbling coins has value and people pay them to be allowed to provide liquidity. This would be way inferior to lightning but it would allow all kinds of constructs that have none of the problems you are talking about.

Correct me if I'm wrong but the currently deployed lightning protocol would allow that a payment goes as I described. It's only the lack of software that makes it less likely to happen today.
To my understanding, a lightning payment works with pre-images that are compatible with bitcoin and all crypto currencies that support the same scripting as bitcoin (ltc for example) but beyond that, a node along the way could also do a wire transfer to the next node, so if on any of the edges, trust exists, there would even not be the need for scriptable money.
Further the use-case for btc to ltc lightning is in atomic swaps, so this will be a common feature of nodes that do lightning in more than just btc.

If your wallet has no coin control, you can try to use a high fee. Mycelium at least would not include UTXOs in a transaction if the UTXO wouldn't pay for its own size. Also you can check the list of UTXOs. If you have 5 UTXOs and that 888sat is the smallest, try to consolidate your coins sending them to a new hd account with a 4 input 1 output transaction.

Coinmap.org unfortunately decided to better have full control over the venues listed on it, after maintaining a very valuable open source project for years.
As I don't want to support a closed data list, I'm searching for alternatives for my use and to send users to, to see where bitcoins are accepted.
I'm more interested in it being open data than open source. I just don't want to help maintain a great database of some bait and switch project that can just walk away with my free contribution. Luckily the coinmap.org data is free via openstreetmap but currently I have no good link for a website that would host this data, preferably the way coinmap.org did before introducing the silly heatmap thing.
If there is none, I am considering to host one of those 50 forks myself.
If OSM at large really has an issue with those bitcoin entries, which I doubt, as many that edit bitcoin data would also edit other stuff, I would be fine with having the data on github and work with merge requests.

An evil player could, theoretically, while ramping up his mining farm, already mine and once he singlehandedly amassed 51% of the hashing power, he could turn rogue and block transactions from happening (Enforce a 10kB block size limit or something). That would be a bad thing.
In general though, this number goes up every day by some one digit percentage, so an ATH is nothing out of the ordinary and as it makes above attack more expensive, it's a good thing.

Originally, "full nodes" was equal with running the "bitcoin software". It even had a stub for a trading platform integrated.
Mining got stripped out years ago. Now follows the wallet and with pruning it's likely we will have even more specialization. A little problem coming from the specialization is that fewer and fewer users run full nodes that back SPV wallets. In fact apart from idealism, there is no reward for doing so, and upping the costs by increasing the block size will not be helpful.

At times I could turn over 100 BTC in small chunks at 15% within weeks and at times there is no buyer at 5% for weeks.

If we all buy Zimbabwe Dollars, their value will rise. Sure, fiat currencies are very good at not being a store of value, so the central bank would quickly react and prevent that pesky deflation but initially it's true for all goods that if we all buy in, their value will rise and gives the thing no merit at all as detached from any underlying further qualities the opposite is just as true: If we all divest from XY, its value will go down.
Or how does the OP quote differentiate Bitcoin from any of the thousands of alt coins? It doesn't. Should I therefore buy into all of them cause maybe they will catch on? That is stupid madness.

Killing the troll or the patent would put all the burden on the one troll killer, while the reward were for all. Same is true with an unjust legislation: Small companies will not kill it, as they can't. Big companies will not kill it, as it helps them fend off the small ones.

At WalletScrutiny today we finished our first round assessing the 84 apps we had found to look like maybe being relevant Android Bitcoin wallets. The results are grim:
* 3 are verifiably built from the project's published source code
* 21 apps claim to be open source but either we failed to compile them from the information provided on their repositories or the compilation result differed non-trivially from the app found on Google Play. Trivial differences would be file timestamps, differences in few files that can be quickly understood to be harmless, like an API key not being included in the repository, although that is pointless as it sticks out in the diff even more.
* 25 apps are closed source meaning neither the Playstore description, nor their website nor GitHub searched for their appId revealed any source code
* 19 apps are for custodial services, the biggest being Coinbase. Coinbase recently reached 10 million downloads and with no other app reviewed having even 5 million, that is more users on Coinbase than on all open source wallets combined. Being your own bank ... not so much Sad
* 18 apps turned out to be either not wallets, not for Bitcoin or they had only 1000 downloads or less.
This project is only getting started. If you want to look behind the curtain and maybe want to contribute, [source for the website is public](
Now the next steps are:
* Automate verification for wallets that were verifiable once
* Efficiently collect wallet updates
* Alert when verification fails
* Build awareness
If you don't understand what this is about or think it is not important, consider this:
If you are the release manager of a wallet, would you tell your brother to trust your app? Should you trust it? After all it was you who pushed that compile button, right?
Well, if your computer has a backdoor, your compiler might bake in some wallet-stealing "feature" into every version of your app without your knowledge.
How big is the incentive to plant such a backdoor? For some wallets it is gigantic. Hundreds of millions of dollars. Criminals would kill for that amount, which brings me to the second issue:
What if somebody puts you under duress? If whatever you build is not being verified by a second person, ideally far away on an unrelated system, you can't trust yourself and nobody can trust you to release the software you should release. If in an open source project, verification is not easily possible, most likely it is not done internally.

Edit: I wanted to call out wallets for a long time for their snake oil marketing. With this project I did in the most objective and verifiable way possible. A wallet that claims to be secure because it's open source but turns out to not publish the source that the app on the Playstore is compiled from, deserves 1* ratings for this alone. Unfortunately that is currently the standard, so I see my task in educating people to care more for their keys.

Ok, how should I put it …
I sold bitcoin in Chile for a long time now. I get my salary in bitcoin and I have a sell and a buy offer. I started selling at 5% and always got my offer filled within a day. I tried out 10% in times of being out of fiat and when I didn't get my offer filled I dropped to 0% to pay my bills. Now I decided to always keep an offer on LB but high enough so it's worthwhile to figure out how to restock if I run out of bitcoins. At 5% I would only sell it to those that turn around and sell it for 20%. At 15% I'm still the cheapest at times, even though I serve new users, starting at $20 and that's most of my customers. If you think I'm greedy hanging out in a chat with some maybe customers all day, explaining them how to use bitcoin for a $1.5 please think again. Sure, some make it worthwhile and I tell all my customers to explore the market cause I'm already charging 15%. If they still buy, I don't feel like a "greedy son of a bitch".

I think we have differing ideas of what a sidechain is. My assumption is that it is a chain that works with the tokens of the main chain. Granted, the [original sidechains paper]( talks about "pegged sidechains" but never defines sidechains as such, so I see room for your definition of sidechain merely being a related chain and not necessarily a chain with a peg but my interpretation seems to at least [not be contested]( in the bitcoin community, so excuse my ignorance but instead of down-voting me and asking me to read your full text (which is not smooth to read), a clarifying pointer to what you consider to be a sidechain would have been a fair answer, too. Granted, my comment was blunt but I had raised the same question in other comments before, without getting an answer, so ... sorry for that.

KYC is about knowing who you are dealing with. At localbitcoins, KYC is done poorly and users re-verify supposedly verified accounts just to make sure.
Usually it's enough to clearly establish intent though. ID is to fix things afterwards. If I could get BTC buyers to reliably put bank wire subjects like "payment for xBTC from giszmo for tony43, LB633743", I wouldn't ask people to come on Skype and show their id.
When payments have no subject at all though, chances are, the account holder is paying for a fridge on Craigslist and I end up releasing BTC to a man in the middle and get sued over the non delivery of a fridge I knew nothing about.

I suspect (if he actually is involved with the project, which I have to assume for now), that they are rowing back from an attempted bait-and-switch but at least I would fully support coinmap if their data is open, as it allows me to provide a similar map, with **all** venues, once my other project with hopefully thousands of locations comes life but for whatever reasons gets blocked out of coinmap.org.
There will always be pages specialized on different scopes and my flavor of coinmap would not show alt coins, which was the reason for many prior forks. It's just not ok to be locked out from using a database that I helped to build up.

The first years the only wallet there was had a checkbox that read "mine bitcoin". Bitcoin was the wallet, the miner, the full node.
Today, mining software relies on external full nodes that are not wallets and the block rewards are mined into wallets that are often not full nodes and usually not miners. And none of the before need to be archival nodes that hold the full history of bitcoin. Miners might have only a month of transactions or if they spv mine, not use an own full node at all.

May I propose what I wrote [here](
So lets assume it's 2030 and with or without negative fees at some points we achieved fungibility. Nobody trades certain bitcoins at a discount anymore, which is what fungibility means. Will we still have a chance on low fees? I bet we do. Providing nodes will be as easy as `apt-get install lightningd` and sending it some initial funds for bootstrapping. Maybe you want to tweak the fees to gain traffic/help the network faster but most **lightningd will be run by those who move money a lot anyway. Employers for example.** Instead of paying me my weekly $100 paycheck in an on-chain transaction, they would put $300 into a channel that gets updated every hour in my favor by $300/24/7. Whenever I buy I coffee now, it would get shifted by $3 in their favor, with a request to credit some other node $3 which eventually would end up paying my coffee. I would pick a route that doesn't go me-&gt;employer-&gt;starbucks but maybe me-&gt;employer-&gt;google-&gt;piratebay-&gt;anon with each only knowing his direct neighbors, to hide my coffee addiction.
Now my employer would nominally lend me $300 minus what's on my side of that channel and probably charge me interest on that but given the security of this "loan", interest rates are as low as they can get. With bitcoin being deflationary, this loan could be considered an investment that already pays interest, held by my employer.
Would my employer charge me for cpu cycles for each coffee I buy? I'd argue he wouldn't. anon might have stopped paying me for using his tor hidden service but if he charged a significant fee I would find somebody else who doesn't, to include in my route for anonymity.
Not sure where fees could come from if we figure out fungibility.

Yes, BC.i is an eye witness and so are others and the protocol dictates that the timestamp may not jump backwards in time by more than 2h(?) but that's it. By the sheer likelihood of nobody finding a block for 2:40 you can say with about 99.99%(?) probability that this never happened as portrayed.
Anybody cared to do the math, what the probability of not finding a block for 16 times the expected value in a sample of 368000 is? I'm pretty sure my 0.01% is still optimistic.

Not a bad thing if people get a vested interest in boosting TOR's infrastructure if you are concerned about TOR as a whole. If you are concerned about a single TOR node, then that's not my concern. The main entry node can delegate to other nodes, all endorsed by one successful hub provider. Centralized management but distributed infrastructure.

Any transaction containing newly mined coins (both chains could have coins mined into dust outputs that are free to grab thanks to trivial brain wallet) are only valid on their respective chain.

1ct. would be too much for many and a joke for others and such a discrepancy hurts the service: Some avoid the service, others don't pay as much as they would if it was more expensive.
Look how free-to-play works: 90% pay nothing, 9% pay as much as is necessary to perform optimally in the game and the money is made with the last 1% that pays a fortune to buy stuff that adds nothing but status in the game. Golden name, Funny hat, etc.
For what you want I would add a subscription option, where you pay per month, with 95% of that money getting distributed among all your up-votes. 5% for the company. Down-votes also cost the same, with the money going to a good cause of your choice (company-endorsed good causes). But you can pay as much as you want, with suggested levels that mark you as a silver/gold/platinum member of the platform.

Please explain why this does not work with Bisq.
Is it because of the collateral? The complaints about the goods not being shipped will come much too late.
Is it because using not the exact bank account should lead to suspicion and deal reversal? You can probably fool every Bitcoin seller once and even if it doesn't work all the time, it's probably worth the scammers' time to try.
* Offer nice jewelry
* Get buyer to want to send money
* Hop on bisq and create a fake account under the target name
* Open trade with any bitcoin seller
* Put in your collateral
* Send jewelry buyer bank account information
* Hope for Bitcoin seller to be happy about the name matching
Edit: The trade limits for new accounts and the collateral certainly make it harder to scam but it also makes it hard to grow for the platform. The number of offers is laughable. 28 and 25 for USD and EUR respectively, with all other fiat currencies having 5 offers or below. In my market there is zero offers. Had my offers open for months and found 2 takers for tiny amounts so I had not bothered running my client for weeks now.

Once quantum computers are powerful enough to find private keys of public keys, HD wallets are under a threat that's not very obvious.

Pardon, what? I very explicitly did not verify 38 wallets and that is not the aim of the project. It is about verifiability only and states so in many places.
So I found that some of the most popular wallets are closed source and I call them out and you tell me to work for free another year or two before coming forward? What did you do for the security of Bitcoin users? How am I supposed to know if the project will get any attention after putting in 2 years of work? Reviewing just one wallet is a full time job if you review what 5 others are coding.
@_date: 2016-02-21 17:36:10
Mycelium dev here. We use the bitcoind's estimates but due to the randomness involved all over the place, speedy confirmation can almost never be ensured on the chain.
Even if you choose the priority option, the next block might take an hour to get mined, for whatever reason others might ramp up their fees just this same moment (guess that never happened to the point where priority would get priced out) or the miner might choose he doesn't like recipients that contain letters that rhyme on "noodle" or not include any transactions at all. You can never know for sure but with the priority option you should almost always get it into the next block or if that fails, the one after that.
That said, I personally almost always use the economy option if circumstances allow it (aka only I will have to wait or the recipient will not check it before tomorrow. Tips, gambling websites, etc.).
I use the normal option if the recipient somewhat trusts me (paying a friend to pay my beer, allowance, etc. but also when selling &lt;$50 to strangers sitting in a cafe, with an hour time to talk bitcoin).
If you are not happy to explain all these details to strangers you might be better off to lean towards higher fees but as it's a dynamic system, so the higher fees you are comfortable with, the higher you drive the price for others. Being reluctant to overpay, helps to keep fees lower for a bit longer.
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:23:29
Ok, I should have included that option, too but I am not convinced that is what we are looking at. Not only did 42 transactions disappear to return to "normal" build-up, it was also 19k transactions above 100sat/B that disappeared. Most of those should have gotten to a rebooted node, shouldn't they?
But you are probably right, given there seams to be a gap in the data 18:00-19:20 timestamp. If that would have been a time without blocks, things would look very differently.
Hmm, so the chart is mainly cute but not actually informative at all?

Hey, that looks so cool. Would be nice to see a quote while picking the options. With or without recording is the same price? Chilean cellphone costs 14mɃ/5minutes? Seams a bit steep to me. If I had some bitcoins at hands, I would have tried it out though :D
I wanted to offer 14mɃ for any nice video of how to use this but now as I saw that it connects as soon as the payment is detected I'm a bit skeptical. So if it takes some minutes, which certainly happened a lot to me, you might randomly get connected at any point in time? Sounds stressful. I guess I would prefer a notification and a dial button becoming active instead.
@_date: 2017-04-23 15:54:32
I would argue that it depends. The passphrase makes the search space larger and as the pbkdf2 used is quite slow to compute, the attacker would have to spend quite some resources to even brute force 5 letter passphrases while most funds will be without extra passphrase. But yeah, it's almost security by obscurity.

It's hard to predict but my guess is that fees will be close to zero. Nodes need money and to get a channel opened towards you, you would have to pay interest but if fungibility is a concern then intermediary anonymous nodes might sponsor transactions to get their funds mixed. So anything, including negative fees is possible.
Edit: Bitcoin's fungibility is my biggest concern, long before block size. [seams to think the same]( Maybe he can comment here, too.
Sure, with bitcoin being fungible, nobody would pay a premium to get his bitcoins mixed but the discount at which you can get certain coins is a direct measure to how fungible bitcoin is and how desperately in need of fungibility we are, to avoid taxes being payable in white-listed coins only for example. Only if mixing is part of the fabric of bitcoin can we achieve fungibility. 
So lets assume it's 2030 and with or without negative fees at some points we achieved fungibility. Nobody trades certain bitcoins at a discount anymore, which is what fungibility means. Will we still have a chance on low fees? I bet we do. Providing nodes will be as easy as `apt-get install lightningd` and sending it some initial funds for bootstrapping. Maybe you want to tweak the fees to gain traffic/help the network faster but most lightningd will be run by those who move money a lot anyway. Employers for example. Instead of paying me my weekly $100 paycheck in an on-chain transaction, they would put $300 into a channel that gets updated every hour in my favor by $300/24/7. Whenever I buy I coffee now, it would get shifted by $3 in their favor, with a request to credit some other node $3 which eventually would end up paying my coffee. I would pick a route that doesn't go me-&gt;employer-&gt;starbucks but maybe me-&gt;employer-&gt;google-&gt;piratebay-&gt;anon with each only knowing his direct neighbors, to hide my coffee addiction.
Now my employer would nominally lend me $300 minus what's on my side of that channel and probably charge me interest on that but given the security of this "loan", interest rates are as low as they can get. With bitcoin being deflationary, this loan could be considered an investment that already pays interest, held by my employer.
Would my employer charge me for cpu cycles for each coffee I buy? I'd argue he wouldn't. anon might have stopped paying me for using his tor hidden service but if he charged a significant fee I would find somebody else who doesn't, to include in my route for anonymity.

The mailing list post added two important aspects:
1. Bloom filters reduce drastically the data required to signal that a block is relevant, at the cost of false positives, but in the range of 0.01%
1. "Committed" bloom filters allow fraud to be detected, as you could quickly check if other nodes would serve you the same data.
In the end, bloom filters are just a tool you can use. You init it with a target capacity and false positive rate and then you add bitcoin addresses for example in your post. You can then download the bloom filter to check locally if any of your addresses is covered by the filter.
    for(block:allBlocks)
        bf = new BloomFilter(3000, 0.00001);
        for(address: block.getAllAdresses())

Right now, constantly full 1MB would already not be very agreeable for many people, especially at first time of install. 50GB/year of history.
If we go to 8MB blocks as early as January(?) next year, we would allow spammers with infinite resources (banks, nation states) to make sure the blockchain will grow at 400GB per year.
Sure, for a data center that's all not big numbers but it's definitely limiting to how many people can have it at home or even afford a server to run something on that data. The disk space requirement would put it already at some levels above any low end server plan.

Voting with coin-age? So who should do that? Wallet providers? Should we at Mycelium update our wallet to vote for what we think is best? Should we clutter the UI to add a voting option? Should only the über-geeks vote?
I'm against having wallets pick for their users and against cluttering UIs with `Do your transaction, voting for BIP X (*), Y ( ), Z ( )` radiobuttons. Yes, Bitcoin is a political currency but how and when to scale the block size is nothing people should vote on.
Engineers do what they believe is right for the system and having some billion bitcoin days destroyed to support your choice, might give you a warm fuzzy feeling that helps to stand all the haters that scream at you but ultimately, being right is not a thing of voting and in the future we will have more bitcoins in the hands of less technical users that think more short term and we might end up having a majority vote for what would break bitcoin's core promise of being censorship resistant money and core devs will have a hard time justifying why they don't follow the democratic vote.
Imagine we want to add anonymity features like [confidential transactions]( and all the core/classic/whatever devs agree that it's save and necessary for Bitcoin's fungibility to do so but all of a sudden some very old coins vote against it. Satoshi himself opposes the change. What would we do? Follow his command? Take that as proof that Bitcoin was FEDcoin all the time? No, I would not want Bitcoin to be democratic. If it forks, pick your fork and choose wisely but if the majority doesn't agree with me, I wouldn't just give up on what I am convinced to be better for censorship resistant money.

Some have free energy (as in their land lord/parents/company/socialist government/... hasn't found who's causing the high electricity bill yet), so there is quite some flexibility in the block production in relation to the fees.
Even if the block reward would vary 1 to 10, you wouldn't have 90% of miners switch off at 1 and all running at 10 as nobody would bother fixing his mining setup if it runs for less than 5% of the time, as there is more than energy cost but also rent and maintenance and those "above 3" blocks are probably below 5% of all of them. To some extent you might be right though, as mining hardware slows down improving that fast and block rewards drop, miners might consider it worthwhile to keep hardware on standby for longer.

As I understand it:
* You know a bloom filter of person X
* You look at only the addresses that match the filter
* Any isolated transaction is probably a FP
* Any transaction that sends between two of those addresses almost certainly marks those addresses as hits
* Any chain longer than 2 addresses increases the certainty, even if the bloom filter originally matched 10% of all addresses
* If you find chains of length 10 for example, even a bloom filter matching 50% of all transactions ever made would reveal those 10 addresses as 99.9% likely to be from the same user.

Well, you wouldn't publish the found block based on the one-time 90% likely correct hash computed by the faulty ASIC. You would verify them on your CPU, loosing about 0.00001s per found block. Not worth loosing your reputation over.
As described above, there should not be any impact on network converging but the approach is amazingly evident. So much so that I wonder why not all ASICs do this since ever. Engineers designing these ASICs must have asked which error rate was tolerable before, not? Or is this something so deep in the design tools that you normally don't see it?

If you are not talking about an expired invoice you could also spend your change with a higher fee to bump it. Some miners will pick up free transactions if that allows them to pick up juicy fat fees.
in mycelium I would just send all my money to myself. Open the account you used. Send. My addresses. My accounts. The account I'm already using ("Account 1" for example). Set fee to "priority". Set amount to "Max".

The 8 years is arbitrary.
The problem is that if you wait until "oops! emergency! a big bitcoin stash was just spent and we are pretty certain it was not it's owner or a hack! panic panic … oh, look, that UTXO had it's pub key revealed … was it quantum computers!?!?" then we really have a problem. Then we would know that the attacker would already be after the second biggest stash and as soon as that went missing, too, panic would break lose across the whole bitcoin space. All would dig out their wallets and send to quantum safe addresses at once – revealing their pub keys weeks before getting mined, making it worse for them even. Not a good situation.
If we could smooth that out a bit for example by guessing when quantum computers might be a worthwhile investment to hack bitcoin addresses, then we could design rules to transition bitcoins over one UTXO by one. You could for example say ok, a QC would cost about 10 billion USD now and a QC-day therefore about 100 million USD and provided you know the pub key that would crack one priv key (no idea). Ok, UTXOs with more than 100 million USD and the pub key revealed for over a day (address re-use) will be invalidated as soon as this BIP gets activated. (I'd love to know how many addresses would be affected by this.)
This way only a small fraction of all addresses would be affected and they would be affected at different times, to fan out the urge to move coins.
The BIP could assume QC costs to half every year and we would need a way to know to how many BTC that translates, according to exchange value but that's my rough idea for now.
@_date: 2017-04-19 01:51:53
Not sure. Maybe this?:
The idea is to instead of throwing code (your transaction) against code (a smart contract) and telling all full nodes "go figure!", you provide your expected outcome and intermediary results with your transaction. This allows the full nodes to know in advance that you either lied or you provided a state transformation that actually terminates nicely, with data that allows you to check different steps of the computation in parallel.
As triggering smart contracts never is a black box thing, you know in advance how your data will compute with that smart contract, so you know the intermediate and final state in advance.

Your original post proofs exactly why you should use "high" and "low" and not decide how many BTC to pay. I'm not saying you should use a wallet that doesn't tell you how much "high" would cost you but the fact you expressed your fee in absolute terms and your expectation that after 3h something magical would happen that makes the transaction confirm then, when it didn't confirm the last 3h shows you don't understand how those things work.

Depends on both your receiving and sending wallet.

I actually like BIG (and I struggle to get that in line with "taxation is theft") but with 300€/month you are still a wage slave. Also it's not a BIG if you don't get it if you earn money.

At the time, the 500€ bill was a concession to the Germans who had the highest denominated bill with their 1000DM bill, worth about 500€. Given that due to inflation, the 500€ bill is now only worth 700DM it is really a stupid and late step to end the 500€ bill now.
But looking at the $100 bill things are even more bizarr. It's in circulation since a time where $100 could buy you a nice car.
In Chile by contrast we have 20,000 pesos bills. When the pesos was introduced in 1975 it was worth 1000 escudos. When the escudo was introduced in 1960 it was worth 1000 pesos. The old pesos. "Peso" is "weight" and 1Peso coin was originally (long long ago) "worth" 8 silver coins or half a gold coin.
So … if we were still on a gold standard, my 20,000 CLP bill could buy me 20,000,000 escudos or 20,000,000,000 old pesos or 10,000,000,000 ounces of gold. Too bad it only buys me decent meal in a touristy restaurant.

ITT: Nobody gets OP's point.
Let me know if I get it: You claim that once block rewards are (almost) gone, miners will much stronger watch the per block reward and might have thresholds of accumulatable fees at which they switch hashing on and off.
As most miners mine for pools, the postulate change would happen at the pool. The pools currently advertise a pay per share which miners manually use to decide if the continue mining or not. This PPS could fluctuate strongly enough to automate miners to not bother with mining at certain price points dynamically. Also miners might mine only at night when electricity is cheaper.
Yeah, I guess a bit of this is already happening but I would not expect much fluctuation in the hash rate on a per block basis. Difficulty retargets. Backlogs build up. Wallets have huge inertia in fee estimation. ... I don't see hashing to fluctuate 10x as in OP. 10% maybe. 10x would probably require counter measures to assure faster confirmations.

While I would support hard forks that made old UTXOs unspendable, most here would not support this move but just illustrate the point:
If our current crypto becomes weak, we can rather easily introduce the next stronger version of crypto but bitcoins that were sent or mined to the weak version, would eventually become spendable by anybody with a quantum computer for example. At some point it would become more lucrative to "mine" big old stashes than to mine for bitcoin's security. Lost coins would be treasure troves to be unearthed again. Giving an incentive for such an  utterly worthless activity would be rather stupid.
The alternative could be: Get your coins out of the deprecated addresses. You have 8 years to do so. After that date, these coins will be irrevocably lost if not moved to the new standard before. 8 years for all the world to speculate if certain big stashes will move or actually are lost coins will probably wake up all the people with bitcoins in old addresses and help to destroy for good any coins that were actually lost.

It's never free. Even if those machines hacked themselves and fell under your control, not using them efficiently comes at an opportunity cost and using them for mining is almost indistinguishable from not using them at all in terms of returns.


Yes, of course, using them for other things and better yet many other things at once is why mining does not make sense at all cause mining would only result in the hack being removed and not in finding a block even with a billion of these devices.

Uhm, I was playing devils advocate here. Satoshi Nakamoto and all that came after him missed that Bitcoin mining allowed for ASIC boost. The idea was to use a well known and understood hashing algorithm as a simple primitive (SHA256) but it's more efficient to break SHA256 down in its primitives and - using a collision in some bits - skip 20% of the computational steps to calculate a valid SHA256 hash.

If people say: "Buy/Sell asset A", they usually mean that it is under/over valued.
Buy means to increase exposure.
Sell means to decrease exposure.
If you are all in, you can't buy but you can increase your exposure shifting over to some leveraged products or borrow money to buy more.
If you are not invested in A, you can short A, if you want to still "sell" A.
Working/Buying with Bitcoin in contrast is more like saying "use it as money" and therefore I would say that "work for money" is as important as "spend it as money", both independently of whether you are buying or selling, which is both ok if you have a better insight on where the current price should be.

On the long run, I'm more worried about the UTXOs than the historic transaction data and I agree that it should be solvable, although I don't see any BIP that would drastically penalize increasing the UTXOs.
To me it sounds ridiculous that the miner who mines a transaction gets a reward for penalizing all future miners with whatever he mined into the ledger for all eternity. A more reasonable fee and reward structure would reward all future miners just as well, and depending on the burden, which is UTXOs. Something like fees that depend on the UTXOs increase and paid into a pool that gets paid out 1% at a time. (Sure, timely inclusion in a block also needs an incentive.)


As if banks and nation states would care paying some millions per day, if in return they can continue their fiat ponzi some more years.
@_date: 2016-02-29 00:01:40
In other words: Spend the coins to yourself with a high fee. 1mBTC or something. Bitcoin allows to spend unconfirmed transactions and some pools consider not only the first transaction in a chain when comparing their fee with other transactions and by paying 1mBTC you would put your incoming and your transaction to yourself together ahead of all the rest and should get confirmed quickly.
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:19:52
Ah, right. I thought by "additional btc" you meant fees. Sure, later UTXOs are all spendable.

Mycelium Dev here.
For Local Trader we use a centralized server that stores end-to-end encrypted messages that we can't read ourselves. If StorJ or Maidsafe or whatever such service was ready to take over in a feasible way (and somebody provided the pull request) we would not hesitate to make local trader fully p2p.
Ok, one other feature we would need would be decentralized messaging. Google makes it very easy to wake up phones if you use the google stack. Anything else would be an extra battery (and extra data) drain. Therefore we currently have this [nasty dependency]( on google libraries.
With our re-write we have a high priority to provide the same degree of privacy as now (or actually better, as coin-shuffle will be ready by then), without the need for supporting servers run by Mycelium.

Why would they be worthless if we hadn't agreed on some schedule to fase them out? If attacker manages to brute force 5 key pair per day and he went after Satoshi's 20k times 50 BTC, he would dilute the overall supply only very slowly or in other words if Satoshi woke up and sent the remaining 19,985 UTXOs to a safe address, why would those be worthless if we hadn't agreed on that before?
The problem I see is that the attacker would of course go after the biggest stash first, so as the stashes are following a steep distribution, most of old-crypto coins would be in only a few addresses, so the most damage would happen with the first getting hacked which is why I would want to have a general rule that invalidated those coins that are lost for good, so that the other coins can be protected by moving them.

@_date: 2015-07-17 15:28:00
cause they can. They make a profit from these fees and bitcoiners just seam to be the least price sensitives, so I expect them to go even higher once they see that bitcoin option still gets used.
I topped up my cellphone paying 20% 3 times now and the first two times I complained to the company about the fees not being clear but the third time I did it because the inconvenience of filling out some forms to setup my bank account to pay it or of waiting for the next day and pay at some kiosk in the street let me pay "one last time" the 20% and I hope I support a viable bitcoin business with it long term. Bitcoiners are price-insensitive.
@_date: 2019-04-20 21:28:53
Depends on Satoshi's identity. Whether he was a fabrication of the federal reserve or some actual old school cypher punk. In the former case, many bitcoiners would be tempted to dump their coins but institutional investors might happily take over, seeing the signs of where things are going. In the latter case I wouldn't expect much price action. It would get us into big news and that might spark a bubble but ... who knows?
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:04:02

With only an insight server, you might be able to track but not to spend. Mycelium allows you to spend.
At Mycelium we take your concerns about privacy serious and hope to soon be able to provide a solution so you can use your own full node as a backend server but meanwhile we promise to not track and like to emphasize how the spv-module where you talk to random full nodes (using Bloom filters or not) is a privacy nightmare compared to just trust one server even if we were tracking. With random full nodes you share your addresses with usually five different full nodes on every start, while probably half of all full nodes are run by entities that track your wallet.

Thank you for your feedback.

Also the project for now is about Android wallets only and I would need a bigger team and actual money to expand its scope. Also I still work for Mycelium and if I add hardware support to get into the green category, people will call me out for cherry picking criteria such that only Mycelium wins ;) No, seriously, I am a bit shocked to only have 3 green verdicts at this point and certainly plan to raise the bar but not now.

I picked some of the biggest exchanges for the chosen time frame, which I cut short due to no data being available from kraken prior to January 2014. Most likely an aggregate view of all EUR vs. all USD would be more informative and I would love to see it if you have it.
Unfortunately trade volume is also affected by trading fees, slippage and friction, so it would be great if the exchanges published data on how many first time traders traded per day (I had 3 today on localbitcoins, buying $50 on average, after a week of silence. And I charge 15%. That for me is a stronger signal than some no-fee exchange without spread having millions in volume.)

You do realize that hash rate is proportional to blocks found and the chart is the average of the last 1000 blocks or 2.4 * 10^24 hashes. The average of the last 10^20 hashes would be neither BU nor SW most of the time and on few occasions 100% the one or the other. Even at the  144 * 600 * 4 * 10^18 hashes average, variance is extremely high. That last one is shown on coin.dance as the 24h average.

If our (redundant) servers go down, which has happened and for tor users just this Saturday, then you are out of luck for paying your coffee that you were about to pay but as Mycelium is fully compatible with BIP39/44, you can always recover your wallet shall we switch off our servers for good.
We are working on a rewrite and one of the design goals is to change that. Running such a server is not an asset but a liability that we would gladly get rid of.
Unfortunately Mycelium's centralized servers also provide privacy that is not easily achieved in a fully P2P wallet unless you don't expect money on more than a hand full of addresses max. at a time, which would be a huge limitation for many users. In our research for a [coin shuffle tool]( is also proposing improvements in that space, that will flow into the new wallet.

Both CPFP and scorched earth RBF are kind of inevitable long term and opt-in RBF is a gentlemen agreement that holds for now.
CPFP comes with additional blockchain bloat, which is why it's not sufficient for solving stuck transactions. RBF (used to unstuck transactions, which is not really the primary use case. Avoiding transaction chaining is) unstucks one transaction at the cost of another. CPFP unstucks one transaction at the cost of two others that won't make it into the block.

This could work, but make it 95%. Problem is that if I see a chain of transactions that I want to follow (you paid me and I want to find your paycheck), if I know your bloom filter, my search might fan out at some points but hitting addresses that are not covered by the filter will tell me where I went in the wrong direction and I can search the other branch.

Every single feature increases the complexity of your project. Should we just leave the whole innovation business and pay with shells and beans instead? In Mycelium, the relevant crypto routines are from bouncycastle, not from OpenSSL but if we would kick BIP70, we would still depend on BC.


BIP70 is an alternative payment logic that the client even can ignore. There is nothing stopping the client from broadcasting the transaction instead of handing it to the merchant to broadcast. And the latter is not resembling the credit card model where the merchant gets to take money from our account without proof of the account holder's intent neither, as the client signs the exact transaction and only that transaction the merchant can broadcast or not and this "or not" is a good thing. If the merchant has in his terms of service that a transaction fee of at least X has to be paid, he can stop the transaction instead of going the long route of dispute if the transaction ends up in limbo for days.


Yes, Andreas slipped there, implying that BIP70 could save you from hackers on your server ... or ... did he? Actually he did not. The shopping cart that you get your information and the QR code from is not necessarily the same as the payment server. Granted, many clients would fall for a hack where the BIP70 payment request was swapped for the hackers BIP21 request but many would not. Also this is not the only protection provided here. Andreas also mentions the infected laptop swapping out the QR code. Again, if I scan that code with my phone and don't see the expected merchant being verified, I will not hit that send button.
That said, I believe BitPay is a bad actor in our community. The removal of the BIP21 fallback caused a lot of harm and controversy. A good wallet that speaks BIP70 ignores the BIP21 part anyway, while a wallet that doesn't speak BIP70 would ignore the BIP70 part gracefully (as defined in BIP21).

What makes you think that? People that do mine, switch to buying if their mining stops being profitable, which might occasionally affect price supports but the other way around, it also can affect resistance:
If price goes up fast, mining becomes more worthwhile, so people might delay their btc buying and invest in mining instead.
In conclusion, I see mining following the price but miners as a group with huge bitcoin investments also play a role in both price support and resistance.

Previous message: [bitcoin-dev] Hiding entire content of on-chain transactions
Next message: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Number Request: Addresses over Audio
Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]
This is my BIP idea: a fast, robust, and standardized for representing
Bitcoin addresses over audio. It takes the binary representation of the
Bitcoin address (little endian), chops that up into 4 or 2 bit chunks
(depending on type, 2 bit only for low quality audio like american
telephone lines), and generates a tone based upon that value. This started
because I wanted an easy way to donate to podcasts that I listen to, and
having a Shazam-esque app (or a media player with this capability) that
gives me an address automatically would be wonderful for both the consumer
and producer. Comes with error correction built into the protocol

That's the no-zero-conf standpoint and while I agree that in ten years zero-conf will probably be as ridiculous as the first emails having been internet-wide broadcasts but last time I checked, payment processors did accept zero-conf transactions just fine.


He can't. Did I say he can? The standard client behavior for BIP70 does dictate though that the transaction gets sent to the merchant for broadcast. If the client broadcasts, too, then he didn't follow the BIP but of course you can throw around unsolicited bitcoins if you want. I bet some wallets do.


It would be unnecessarily disruptive. Much effort went into on-boarding of tens of thousands of merchants and the long tail of them get probably less than one customer per day who pays in bitcoin. That would over night turn into one per month. Not temporarily as with January's fee event but probably for a very long time and those who really wanted to still buy at that merchant would do the same as they do now with the BIP70-only bullshit: They would go to some random website that promises to pay BIP70 invoices accepting BIP21 payments only that users would buy lightning payments with BIP21 payments.
Would it be a bad thing? Compared to their BIP70 stance? No. They would probably cause much confusions, as we all know they are against LN and their high Bitcoin fees are only to promote bcash.

Consider banks also use external clearing houses. They trust each other more than they trust a clearing house that takes a fee on top of poor accountability. By cutting out their middle men, they would also win a lot. It's not all black and white and I personally would celebrate if banks spear-headed a paradigm shift replacing trust in men in suits with cryptography. As that might next hit banks themselves, it will be on us though, to wrap it as such a paradigm shift.

3 minutes content, 6 minutes self-advertisement and shout-outs is probably a bit unbalanced.
That said, here is my TLDV:
The discussed protocol consists of a POS (or any offline recipient) that will dispense goods (or generally accept payments) if the buyer knows the magic word (invoice pre-image that the recipient shares with the actual lightning server).
So the recipient would not hold the private keys to the coins that were sent to it, which is a very desired feature but it would still need to hold the pre-images that would work to pay there but that is sort of ok, as a hacker that can break into the vending machine to steal the pre-image would probably be able to steal the candy without pre-images anyway. You just want to avoid a situation where stealing one vending machine allows the thief to empty all other vending machines with extracted pre-images or do leaked pre-images have other issues, too?

The heavily obfuscated code consisted of one line of plain-text early-out if it's not a release package. Then comes some obscure string to be decrypted using the package despription as password. Turns out, the copay package description works to decrypt the obscure string, which is a bunch of more code, which does the actual wallet stealing. But only if you hold more than 100BTC, to not get noticed too easily.

Forks are good for drama and flashy news just like the world ends with every halfening and then it doesn't.
A split of a coin with both sides taking away half the value is about the worst of all outcomes for the project, so the forking was a failure and the sum must be lower than what it was before. If the fork ends in one side completely giving up instantly, the surviving side comes out stronger than before. The numbers you posted look pretty close to the former of these cases.

Thank you for the insightful comment.
How would you see a transition if ever QC were believed to be only years away from being cost-effective to attack big stashes of bitcoins? I hope we can agree on forbidding broken crypto, essentially expropriating owners of old UTXOs in order to make sure lost coins, especially big stashes of these stay lost and don't get mined for instead of mining for bitcoin's security.
I haven't thought of this approach [here]( but one way to put it would be to build a heuristic of how much it would cost to steal coins and if the old-crypto UTXO is worth more than what it would cost to steal it, make it lost forever. This way the 20,000BTC somebody lost on a hard drive would get invalidated long before the 50BTC mined by Satoshi would be affected and even longer before any coins of people screaming the loudest now would be affected.

It's massive but I think by making it public, the only defense there is, is destroyed. Devs should have quietly analyzed if the master seed is shared with the hacker or account seeds for example. If only account seeds, they could have updated without touching the hack but adding another hack that wakes up all wallets at a certain time (block height for example) and send all funds to a new account that the hacker doesn't have.
The hacker is watching the balance under his control and has a transaction emptying all these wallets ready to be broadcast. Should "his" balance fall, then either a script or he manually will send all funds to wallets out of the users' control. Only defense is to make that balance fall to zero in one block. You could probably even get these transactions to a miner without the hacker seeing the accounts getting emptied before the block is actually mined.

From a random site? Well, tough luck man.
Either compile it yourself or get it from the trusted provider. For me, the "we are anonymous anonymity fighters" stance the Samourai devs put on is a red flag itself and for what it's worth I looked into their build verifiability and find it highly lacking:
* They use [2]( [dependencies]( that are only defined by repository and branch name, so you will never know what the code was when they built it
* They don't define well how to build their app for deterministic builds
* They have quite big binary blobs in their apk that are not reproducible (zxing related 1MB blobs)
It's actually really easy to compile this wallet but of course most people install from playstore and the playstore version does not necessarily coincide with the github code, so you might want to know who builds those apks ... which you don't.

Thanks. The hype around SegWit is such a joke. Yes, SegWit was a fundamental upgrade to Bitcoin and required for many things to come, including the lightning network but the update we provide now is just a tiny fee reduction. Probably less than 5% of all transactions are done using Mycelium, so the impact on other users is minimal, too. Mycelium users being capable of receiving to SegWit addresses has no impact at all to the Lightning Network and its users. The only thing that would matter to other SegWit users (such as LN users) is that Mycelium can receive funds from SegWit addresses, which was an issue we resolved many months ago. Mycelium could always send to and receive from SegWit addresses. It only did not see unconfirmed SegWit transactions before Februrary this year(?).

This kind of attack is what keeps me up at night but this specific attack doesn't affect anything but copay users with more than 100BTC.
As Android lead developer of Mycelium I am very well aware of the dependency problem but quite frankly unless we get 10000 devs to monitor all our dependencies all the time, there is no way to make it 100% secure.
Modularization was what I joined for 3 years ago. I'm still a big believer in the approach but we are now taking a different one. With modularization, the idea is to have one app that handles private keys and transaction signing for bitcoin for example. This app would have very limited dependencies and very little code itself. Another app would provide fancy UI and all the nice stuff that needs tons of dependencies and own code.

u/MaxTG, please file a bug report if you think we missed something for the Ledger. I can only try out stuff with a Keepkey and would have to get up to date with the other hardware wallets we support. This week my focus will be precisely to get spv mode forward, to get it into some select hands next week.
spv-mode with keepkey? Haven't tried it yet. We are struggling a bit with address creation timestamps to avoid having to sync for hours when switching to spv mode but we can peek at what our stored transaction history has on timestamps to speed this up.
To tell a bit more, we had a repository of public modules that we snapshot and pushed to our public github every now and then but long living branches like the spv mode never left that internal "public" repo. If you look at the github, you notice some more commits than usual between releases, in an effort to migrate to work on the public repo, for better community engagement. spv still needs to be migrated and needs to merge the changes from master and generally is quite far from master. This is my task now, which I'm less than eager to work on ;)

On second thought, why is 1kB/s not enough? That's 0.3s for an average transaction or am I missing something? Even if you sometimes have to wait 20s for signing, that's not your normal transaction and probably a power user.

"advice" is not the problem. Mine usually is to get informed and to buy $10 worth of bitcoins to see how easy it is ...
If your advice is to sell the house, life insurance, first born ... and get a credit to put all into X, yeah, that is probably a bad idea.
A friend asked me if he should buy when bitcoin first hit $23. I said "probably yes". It went to 32 and back down to 2. The situation was tense until some day he called me to tell he just sold at $100, happy about the profits after all. Since then I reject direct investment advice but still happily share what I know about bitcoin and its ups and downs. By now I was criticized once for telling somebody to buy but many times for not doing so long ago.

The most exciting products depend on some serious changes that are being worked on right now. Many of the above mentioned "inventions" were low hanging fruits but once the protocol is ready for sidechains and lightning network(s), there is a universe of applications to launch using those. It's just a question of who will write the libraries to make these features more accessible but with libraries, applications are low hanging fruits again.


would be much better with lightning network. The innovation here is totally neglegible and I'm not surprised it's not taking off. I still have to pay two full transaction fees plus the price of the video, which puts the price of the video at the "transaction fee x 10" level to not feel ridiculous. With LN you could go arbitrarily low with your content price.

For your consideration just [one of the bugs that was fixed]( explained:
If you have a virus on your computer that exploits you not having updated your Ledger wallet (all models are affected), you might pay a coffee using your account 3 (the one with the petty change, not the life savings) and **nothing** will indicate something is wrong. The device will ask you about the $5 you want to spend to that address. You confirm as usual.
* Next time you check your balance it is zero.
* You check your other accounts (the ones with the life savings) and it's also empty.
* You review transactions and find the coffee was paid but the transaction was somewhat bigger than expected. It sent all the funds from all the accounts. $5 to Starbucks. The rest to 1x23445555... 
* You call Ledger but they can't help you.
* The hacker will offer his help. For a fee.

I had some 4k stickers produced over the years and my more recent batches were $30 per square meter. With the 6cm x 6cm stickers I had, that turned out to be 196 stickers. Yours look even smaller. Anyway: In crowded inner-city locations in Munich, stickers last about a few days. Here in Chile though ... my favorite sticker was a 10cm x 10cm sticker on a bank's "Cambio $ €" sign, right between the "$" and the "€". Nobody removed it in 6 years.

With very limited information you could suspect this to maybe have happened but as long as you are not rejecting proof of your own existence (hey, we all live in the matrix) you will probably accept that the launch of the bitcoin blockchain [was made public at the time]( (Note that the genesis block was mined the 3rd of January and on the 9th, the source and software that had this genesis block's ID embedded was released.)

So what is your criteria to judge if a cryptographic chain of blocks of data is a block chain or not?
I'm a Bitcoin maximalist but if you create a chain of blocks that need your signature, I wouldn't deny it to be a blockchain. If you don't run it on a public network it's still a blockchain. Bitcoin is a permission-less public ledger run on a blockchain and for me there is more to bitcoin than just blockchain.

Oh, F-Droid will be a huge improvement if I understand that right. I think, with F-Droid, F-Droid would compile the app, not the provider of the code, so their build server might do shady things but you could verify it isn't by verifying the builds again? As F-Droid would have the only signing key needed to push updates, they could serve bad versions to some and good versions to others, which could be mitigated by requiring two signatures but else, it looks much better to me than to have google not caring about openness of code at all.

We are investigating. Turns out that our backend electrumx are proxying from a bitcoind which is lacking transactions that the client is requesting. This issue seams to be more severe on some days than on others and I don't have a clear picture how to fix it yet, as the bitcoind should have the transactions in question. What makes things worse is that the client has no control to switch to a different server as we have a load balancer, so we have to detect the issue server-side to maybe pause the use of affected servers.

I'd usually be with you on this one but on the other hand it's also pointless to discuss the first year's inflation of bitcoin (where there was no monetary value to it, yet had infinite to 100% "inflation") and it's pointless to distinguish values below 1% on a currency that is more volatile in its value than that per day on almost any given day.

So BreadWallet can now send to bech32 addresses? On the one hand that is very honorable but not really actual segWit support. On the other hand I wonder which wallet would require the sender to use bech32. In our wallet I would want in this order:
1. a less conservative standard fee estimator, so that non-power-users stop over-paying on fees
1. RBF, to allow to go really low on the fees without nasty consequences
2. smart automatic batching, to further reduce fees (Using RBF, batch as long as prior tx is unconfirmed)
3. segWit for hardware wallet support
I searched for Java bech32 libraries and came across [Samourai]( Honorable of them to release it to the public domain. Plaid a bit with that code (see PR). Maybe we can provide sending to bech32 quickly. Guess it would be 2 days of work but it would not fix those other more urgent issues and neither would it accelerate releasing our modularization.

Miners have an incentive to fool the estimator and mempool-based is what I do manually, so I agree that currently it's the best we have but it's not exactly solid. Not a science. Predictions will always fail. Especially when they are bout the future.


People want to send money. People want to pay no fees. And people in general will never understand why some transactions in bitcoin are more expensive than others. This is why we also should make bigger transactions at time, to not accumulate dust for the future. This is why we should not complicate the UI with multiple recipients and why RBF should be used to not force the user into understanding how much to pay up-front. We can allow him to pick a payment window and handle the fee in the background, trying to keep it low within the payment window. We could ask the user at certain thresholds for permission to pay higher fees.

Many here ramble about it not being easy but the tweet is about barriers, not about it being easy.
If "having to work" is a barrier to entry by your standards, you probably got the tweet wrong. Yes, with an IQ of 83 you will not develop a single app ever in your life. Damn barriers to entry. And with an IQ of 120 you will probably not become the CTO of a medium sized company. But with an IQ of 100, a computer and internet, you can in fact very realistically get to the point of developing something like flappy bird and release it to an audience of billions in under a 6 months. Sure, a top notch developer with with all the tools at hands does it in 5 hours inception to release but there is no barriers to success in the field regardless of your sex, color of your skin, country of residence (*), ... You even can offer your work [anonymously]( under a random name.
(*) asterisk here. There are barriers. If you live in Iran, you can't publish on google play for example. [Or use github]( But this is a minor barrier that can be worked around.

Awareness is necessary, yes. For some that freak out about lost funds. Everybody else is already freaking out about having to be aware of too many things in their lives and for them, this is concern-trolling.
If you have some 3mɃ and a backup and forget about it for "a few decades", you will either have nothing to worry about, cause Bitcoin is long gone or you can afford an expert to look into it and if the wallet you used was any decent wallet, then the information you asked the user to write down now, will still be available.
For example, BitPay claimed to be compatible with BIP44 while they were not. They had a bug where one in 100 users would get completely different accounts than defined in the standard. Knowing the derivation paths would have been both more complicated for the user and less helpful. Just remember the wallet.

* I have my bitcoins in my wallets and cold storage and enjoy being my own bank? Well, you unfortunately will still need banks for certain tasks. I would be pretty screwed if banks rejected my business. Paying utility bills without an own bank account would turn into an extra 1-2h per month of work but getting cash to pay every-day things all the time, like supermarkets, all but one restaurant in my city, would either be 20% more expensive (using that BTM) or a huge hassle, traveling 200km to meet people with some liquidity to then still lose 5% compared to the deals I get with a bank account to convert btc to fiat.

You already charge a ridiculous "UTXO sweeping fee" which many perceive to be intended to make bitcoin look inferior to bcash. Wouldn't it be convenient if you could add another fee on top of that for people using this inferior tech?
7% failed payments is not 7% costs on your part and neither 5%. So a client sends the wrong amount or adds insufficient fees, resulting in no timely confirmation? Take 1% service fee, contact the client asking for a refund address and send the funds there. No need to charge 5% on all transactions that work smoothly. For almost all clients this can be automated. You could even punish people for too low a fee if the transaction confirms in the next block but after the invoice expired as per your small-print. All better than not accepting 90% of all bitcoin wallet users.

In your answer to you say it yourself: The Multisig part of your question is over-complicating the scenario.
Assume you and 4 others want to pay something together (a multisig account for example) but nobody wants to go first. Yes, you can make the transaction atomic: Either all pay or nobody.
1. All five share information about bitcoins they have. Think bitcoin addresses with balances sufficient to pay the thing. In detail, you want UTXOs amounting to the share amounts.
2. All five share addresses for change
3. Somebody creates a transaction that defines the exact order and fee and everything
4. The others sign this transaction if they like it.
Once all signed it, the transaction is valid and can be broadcast by anybody having it. Any change to the details would invalidate the existing signatures.

That is not how any of this works. Value can flow between fiat and crypto without much trade volume at all.
* People can buy billions of dollars worth of bitcoin while value flows out of bitcoin into fiat, as there is two sides to every trade: If the sellers make their coins cheaper and cheaper in the process, to get rid of them, the market cap of bitcoin drops.
* On the other side, even if there is not much being traded, value can flow dramatically. Imagine sha256, ECDSA and RIPEMD-160 found to be broken in a bomb-shell revelation, demoing it by sending all bitcoins in existence to random new addresses at once live on stage. Once everybody got the news, all value would have flown out of Bitcoin, with no actual trades happening in the meantime, as nobody would be able to move their bitcoins.
* The second case is not likely (there is a 60 billion USD bet it will never happen) but it's intuitively clearer how "value flowing" can happen in heads, without exchanges reporting on trade volume. 
* The reverse example of a joint declaration of all central banks that they will close shop and sip piña colada in Hawaii, spending their bitcoins they were hoarding since 2009 is just not as convincing to take all value away from fiat in the blink of an eye.

If a service requires identification, then avoiding the identification is one way of dealing with it. Avoiding the service is another.
I sell on localbitcoins and explicitly require identification (except for in person trades) as scammers are rampant if you give your bitcoins to anybody who can make somebody send money to your bank account. Before requiring identification I refused 50% of the trade requests until I finally fell for a scammer who scammed somebody who subsequently claimed to have sued me over it, out of $1000. And yes, I do care about having a valid phone number and am not happy that it's worth nothing in the end. Proof of ID is still a hard problem without a centralized body.

If you use Mycelium and you import 3 addresses derived from the same private key as watch only accounts, you will see your 3 balances on those three accounts. If you then import the private key, the relationship between these accounts gets clear and they are merged into one.
As Bitcoin addresses are hashes and with the two you mentioned, clearly of two separate things: A public key and a script, you can't compute the script from the script hash to calculate the public key to get to the public key hash, thus only the owner of the private key knows they are related.

Did you know that not all combinations of 12 words are valid? For a start, there is only 2048 valid words and those words are chosen such that a 4 letter prefix fully determines the word. For example both "mom" and "moment" are valid words but you will not find cases like "**Port**ugal" and "**port**". Neither are there 2 or 1 letter words. Also there is a checksum: Only one in 128 word combinations are valid. Turns out the easiest to remember are 12 times the same word and the easiest to type is 12 times a 3 letter word like "mom mom mom mom mom mom mom mom mom mom mom mom" but I would recommend "oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil" as it is even faster to type as it needs no distinction from a longer word with the same prefix and "o", "i" and "l" are one cluster on your keyboard.
(At the risk that anybody takes the above serious:
* No, please don't use a key you find on the internet
* No, 12 times the same word is not a good choice
* No, any combination you chose for your convenience is not a good choice)

going fractional surely is super tempting but I'm sure, even if Gox used 50% of its users money to run business, they wouldn't fail to pay out just yet. Spreading this kind of FUD might get them there in case though.
I'm not defending anybody who's touching our savings at Gox but try to give an argument why cashing out to a certain account might just be delayed for other reasons. It's not like they had just one bank account and one wallet. They have to move money and this should be organized to minimize costs.

I have high admiration for people who grow wood. Plant a tree to harvest in 80 years. Seriously, that is so beyond most people's investment horizon but what you do in such a case is you watch over your investment. You don't plant the forest and check back in 80 years. Same with your bitcoins: If they are worth a lot, be ready to do some maintenance from time to time. If sha256 becomes obsolete 5 years from now, you may want to move your coins to whatever new hash we use then.

Nope. Pre-2.12 versions have no SegWit support, so when you update to 2.12, your wallet will show an update progress, which can take a while if you have many accounts, as there is quite some database changes to process. For example as sqlite is being used (as for most android DBs), adding a column to a table is impossible, so the table needs to be copied twice if you want to end up with a new schema under the old name. Then all the new SegWit addresses need scanning for transactions ...

A bit more information about this: We pushed [2.12.0.4]( to testnet and to our public github 12 days ago. It was sufficiently stable to also release it to our [590 beta testers]( Google play provided us with first crash reports two days later and somehow there seams to be a general delay of two days now, until we see crash reports. These looked ok and we fixed more stuff and with [2.12.0.10]( we decided to start the public rollout this Monday. Slow though, to not have 300 people affected by the "one in a thousand" bug.
So if you get an update, it should be 2.12.0.10 or higher. We will probably roll out 2.12.0.11 in 12 hours, after finishing internal QA.
So this post has 90% upvotes but when I first saw it, without my reddit credentials at hand 100% haters as top level commenters? I'm slightly confused by that. We are a team of engineers and in particular, who was leading the segwit feature implementation put countless hours into this and the work is there to see for all. Anybody keen to [review the few little changes it took to implement SegWit]( 618 commits. 449 changed files with 130,172 additions and 69,236 deletions.

Mycelium has what you want. You can't stop the wallet from creating a new seed for you but you don't have to use it. Just use the Cold Storage feature. From the main screen go into options, then cold storage and Masterseed.
Mycelium is on github and has verifiable builds, so if you want to install from play store, you can still verify if the app was compiled from the code we provide and we would actually appreciate if people outside the company would care about deterministic builds, as that seams to not be the case so far.

Proof it.
Edit: I mean it. I work for a competing wallet and thus refrained from bringing up the concern for a long time, to not appear like slinging mud at the competition. Not my intention.
Actually last week I was struggling with our own deterministic builds that turned a bit complicated as the databinding library introduced some non-determinism but with repeated builds, each file can be verified ... and so I though I could have a look at other wallets and built Samourai to see where you stand. Assuming good intentions, I think it's quite easy to get to deterministic builds from where you are.

The upgrade to segwit requires a full rescan of all your addresses. If you ever did that manually, you know that the balance drops to zero until it "finds" your coins again.

Then get rid of them altogether. I work for Mycelium and our wallet supports BIP70, which puts us in the position to probably get some business from people struggling with their BIP70 payment requests but we don't ideologically support their way of forcing BIP70 on people neither. This feature at this point is almost a liability for our wallet thanks to them.
I was a big fan of BitPay's open source efforts but they turned evil. After all this time of not accepting bitcoins without BIP70 I see no other way of putting it. Get rid of them.

Relax! BIP39 **is** a standard. It is not the only standard and bitcoin core might not have adapted it but it's a well defined standard.
You are right that there are minor issues but to say it's not a standard is ridiculous.
The derivation paths are defined in a completely different collection of BIPs. 44, 49 and 84 for example are the BIPs describing the key derivation currently supported by Mycelium and while it is true that other wallets might support other derivation paths and that might make your funds seemingly disappear when you import your Mycelium key in a wallet that supports no SegWit for example but to encourage people to write down the derivation paths now, is not realistic.
Yes, these issues exist. Restore your backup with the same wallet that you received the bitcoins with. If that wallet has gone out of business, try another. If there, some of your funds are missing, ask an expert about standards, telling him exactly which wallet you used and when (or better: in which version).

No, you should not trust me and I have no clue why millions trust single people at all and less do I understand why they do so where there would be no recourse for an exit scam, as the devs are anonymous. That is the whole point. Should I ever not be in charge of building a wallet, I would still build my wallet or pick one with deterministic builds that actually others care about. bitcoin core is very strong in this part. For Mycelium, the "actually cares about" part is not there yet. Our builds are verifiable, we do verify them, so a gun to my head will not get you far (I would sign whatever app you want me to and I would beg my colleagues to approve of it but I couldn't get it on google play without other devs confirming the build matches the code).


Well, you might not like the messenger but I can promise you that my message will sound like the most obvious thing to care about, once some big "open source" wallet with snake-oil salesmen tactics manages to lure millions of users to trust it and then pulls an exit scam. I'm not saying that Samourai is doing just that. I only said that the combination of non-deterministic builds and secrecy about the people behind it, is a red flag to me. I hope they improve on that and with FDroid they will have to.

I'm the release manager of a Bitcoin wallet and I lose a lot of sleep over code reviews and threat models involving evil employees. I look at PRs assuming that colleagues try to sneak in wallet stealers in some dependency or the code itself. It is a full time job and you have no chance in hell catching a wallet stealer if the whole project is set to steal your wallet. If "only" the release manager is corrupt, he targets those that use his binaries. Then you yourself can be safe by compiling it yourself but I would argue this is only making things worse: You will vouch for the project potentially perpetuating a long con, as most people will just use the binaries you implicitly vouched for.
We had a deterministic builds working once but then other things were more important again and we never switched to using them for releases but in order to remove the release manager as a threat, which also protects him from being a target of criminals, deterministic builds, checked to match the open source code and open source reviewed by third parties would be the gold standard.

Mycelium is currently a BIP39/BIP44 compatible wallet (with lots of extras). BIP44 defines a hierarchy of accounts that all are derived from one seed, which in turn is derived from your BIP39 12 words passphrase.
In this sense, deleting an account makes no sense as the account you want to delete is inevitably yours as long as you keep using the same root seed or passphrase. "Deleting" it would not delete it permanently, as you could always re-discover it.
If in turn you want to use a new passphrase, you can do that by deleting the app's data:
1. double-check you have your wallet backed up. 12 words written down on paper plus backups of all non-HD accounts.
2. open your Android's settings -&gt; applications -&gt; Mycelium
3. delete data
4. open Mycelium
5. create new wallet
6. three-dot menu -&gt; cold storage -&gt; master seed -&gt; 12 words passphrase of old wallet
10. send coins to Account 1 of your new wallet

People are nervous about USDT by Bitfinex and BTCTs are better be backed by actual BTC and most likely it is possible to verify that backing but the backing is not cryptographically enforced from the BTC side. Technically the trustees can agree to inflate their BTCTs or to spend the backing BTCs for whatever they agree on. Technically, hacking/strong-arming some trustees puts all BTCT users at risk of losing their actual asset. The private keys are with the trustees. Not your keys - not your bitcoins. Yes, the probability of BTC-China, Bitfinex and Bitstamp all being hacked/strong-armed at the same time is smaller than if it was just one MtGox but the security model is by far not comparable with a trustless system like Bitcoin itself where even compromising all the miners would not empower you to grab coins.

Well, then charge a fee for your service. You currently have absolutely no incentive to make the user experience smooth. How many people click on pay with bitcoin and then back out because they can't use BIP70? Bet if you put an IQ test before paying with Bitcoin, you will have even a lower rate of failed payments.
BitPay is totally ignoring that BIP70 is not widely used and to say you are a bitcoin payment processor while in fact you are only a BIP70 payment processor is deceiving.
I bet your chart is not about 7% failed payments but about 7% payments that did not go as smooth as targeted with BIP70. Some of these might have resulted in significant support costs I grant you that but then add some small print about hefty fees if the transaction doesn't meet the requirements. Currently you are totally over-charging for the use of this smooth BIP70 experience while preferring bcash but why not add a third option:
* BTC ($0.05 + 1% fee)
* BIP70 ($0.05 fee)
* BCH ($0 fee)

Weak argument. On Android for example you can upgrade apps without wiping the user data if the upgrade is signed by the same key and the version is not decremented. No specific signing key needed.
System libraries come from a trusted source (signed by a specific set of keys).

SegWit to me personally has always been a tool for things like lightning. SegWit without lightning is only mildly interesting but of course we have to work on that, too. To get our users' fees down, we would be better working on RBF.

Common theme in ZH "news" spotted.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:31:44
fees are complicated.
* it's per byte, not per $
* it's highly volatile as the network load varies
* there is no guarantees
* transactions are chained, which makes a high paying transaction confirm slower if it comes after a cheap one
* not all transactions can be bumped
I would love to implement RBF first, which could fix all that and open the possibility of zero trouble low fees.
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:38:45
I don't make that kind of decisions but anyway, here are some personal thoughts ...
It's making things more complicated and that is not good for security neither. Which wallet did do that successfully? Many features are annoying to some users but appreciated by others and by excluding them from the premium version, we would send a terrible message. Who would want to partner with us if it was only for the free version? Where are the users with money?
I worked at a company that had ads mainly to push users into the paid tier but we don't have banner ads. We have very select partners from the crypto space that are definitely not meant to annoy you.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:25:11
If you wanted me to vouche for it, you would have to get deterministic builds with every build, signed by security experts.
That said, I don't know why people trust most of the software they use, (me included) and I want my company to get to this standard but other stuff is always more important.

Yes. But SegWit provides that and smaller transactions and my argument was that the transaction size improvement on a low-volume wallet is not as high priority as RBF for example. Exchanges and payment processors on the other hand ... they have much more to gain in relation to what it costs to implement.

Did you break open your personal hardware wallet? Did you make sure the random number generator was not messed with? Does it matter if you bought it from the makers themselves or found it on the ground next to your car?
Being your own bank is not easy and we are not used to it and the fact that nothing happened to a certain wallet in the past, is no guarantee that nothing will happen to your funds in the future. For a long con that makes you $200,000,000 US, you might go to some length to gain trust where no trust is warranted. Just think about how much money each of the wallets manage. Together it's 80 billion USD.

A trusted initial setup with toxic waste. If the parties that made the initial setup held on to their "randomness" or if it was not in fact random and whoever convinced them to create it in the "random" way they did it, knows it, he can deanonymize transactions and create coins out of thin air.

Well, custom fees are coming but the merge request tries to make it too fancy, so it's not yet ready for release. And yes, you guessed my worries but bitcoind 14 is also too conservative. Personally, when not buying flights, I almost always opt for the cheapest fee but also CPFP bumped many times. RBF by default would ease my mind about low fees.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:48:09
That is how you could do it with RBF not with CPFP. With the latter you increase the costs as you only can add transactions.

As of now, a simple transaction with Mycelium Android costs 0.5 to 3.7 USD depending on your priority.
The segwit branch in progress is probably not getting merged as it's easier to go another route.
What would you expect from RBF? I see it as the most pressing feature for low fee, predictable confirmation, replay protection, ... but what do you expect from it?

Mycelium is compatible with bip39 and bip44, yes. Importing keys from another wallet means trusting two wallets with it, which is only recommended for recovery. Every wallet out there could decide to steal all their users' funds, which is why I recommend high caution to consider track record, trust in teams and key figures, stakes beyond customer funds etc.

Oh, comeon, please, you are repeating his argument without thinking. **If** the HF was 100% uncontroversial, skipping replay protection would be ok but if there is any doubt about the controversy, any HF should have replay protection as an industry standard. HF initially always create two chains and the winner is not decided by who does not add replay protection. If you want to do a HF, nobody should be forced to upgrade his software if he doesn't want to follow your HF. If he wants to follow it, he will have to upgrade anyway.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:57:37
We probably could steal funds as nobody cares what we actually release. Nobody cares about the 12k lines of code changed and nobody cares if we release what we have in our public repo. But people care about a single button. Hmmmm. Ok.
Good thing is that this is industry standard but it keeps me up at night. I do the releases and I have to review 12k line changes knowing full well about [the art of hiding shit in 12 lines of code]( so even if we had deterministic builds and some people who cared about reviewing stuff, chances of missing something would be high.
And this is why I want modularization and a seldomly changing signing module with deterministig builds more than some lower fees or segwit.
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:46:13
This is the button we have now, only would it work more accurately if we had RBF and we could define arbitrarily high block targets, including infinite aka zero fee until further notice.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:17:03
the wallet is under a look but don't copy license.
what you can do though is provide merge requests. we are not against custom fees and segwit. in fact we have a branch for both. custom fees are only delayed due to bugs. segwit though is delayed due to the branch being not in line with our current preferences to release modularization first.

Ideally wallets make sure you do that before anything else. As lead dev at Mycelium my plan (but it's not approved or even discussed much yet) is to offer a split tool and a forced wallet update through servers that refuse to broadcast transactions that don't signal consent with replay risks. Pretty disruptive but I guess it's wallet devs' responsibility to protect the user.

Here in Chile they had Pesos. "Peso" means "weight" and "1 Peso" or "1$" (yes, that symbol is not only used in Gringolandia) was originally 1/8th of an ounce of silver. In the last century Chile had two reforms. The Escudo was introduced. 1000 Pesos = 1 Escudo. Then a new Pesos was introduced. 1000 Escudos = 1 Pesos. The spot price for 1/8th ounce of silver is about [1,342CLP ... or 1,342,000 Escudo ... or 1,342,000,000 old pesos](

Why would you trust it if it was open source?
Would you compile it yourself?
Would you review the code?
Would you assume that somebody capable would review the code?
Being open source is by far not enough to be trustworthy.
Edit: Open source is a necessary condition for it being trustworthy but by far not sufficient. You would need code reviews by security experts and deterministic builds, signed by those researchers for every build all the time or in absence of deterministic signed builds, you would have to build it yourself but you would still need a trusted review of the code and every library it depends on. Is it hard to sneak in wallet stealers in the bitcoin moonitor? Sneak it into the charting library or something that depends on.

Mycelium has custom fees since 2.9.3.

If you would introduce a rule that would require a transaction to *not* contain script, then that would be a soft fork (tighten the rules of what transactions are allowed).
I was hesitant now for a second, as there is also the coinbase transaction but that one has no input, so there is no script, neither. All fine, you can remove script with a soft fork. If that would be the only fork to come, there would be no transactions apart from coinbase transactions after it. A very drastic approach to the blocksize issue.

Of course there is no way of stopping a client from broadcasting whatever transaction but I suggest you read BIP70 again, too, especially the part that reads:


There may be written or implicit conditions of the payment but a payment provider might refuse to broadcast transactions for any number of reason or no reason at all. Tough luck fighting with them, if they report to the merchant that you didn't pay. You might be better off not broadcasting the transaction yourself.

bip21 already allows you to define recipient, amount, label for transaction, label for recipient address. bip70 is a bit more sophisticated than that. It asks the wallet to fetch data from a server and that fetched data may be much more than would fit into a QR-Code, which bip21 payment requests usually do easily.

Also as this service is sufficiently easy for the consumer, I bet there will be a race to the bottom with the profit margin with little to no way for you to lock the users in to your service, so any fee is fair as long as there is competition.

I'm not sure if mining a block is possible without a coinbase transaction. My guess would be "no" and for the coinbase transaction to be valid, it probably needs at least some operator as defined in script, so yeah, probably removing script is not possible as a soft fork if continued mining is a further condition ;)

This well thought out video has a bunch of nice pokes against fiat that a non-crypto-nerd won't understand but we here cheer it on. Crypto proponents cameos, subtle hints and word plays.
The elephant in the room of fiat financing perpetual war is alluded to with Hamilton reaching for the gun and the connoisseur (or whoever knows a bit about gringo history or whoever watched the "making of" video) appreciates the hint at Hamilton having [died in a duel]( That's great as it can be seen on so many levels with "rapper 1 turns to violence as he's losing the argument" being the least sophisticated take on the ending but I somehow feel there might be just as many hints for the [MMT]( folks in there, that we totally miss.

Can't see much immorality in paying people for review … if it were done in a transparent fashion.
* Require to link back to the offer in your article (Mention that you expect a reward, linking to this offer in a clickable link, containing a payout=BITCOIN_ADDRESS parameter.)
* Disclose how much will be paid out under which conditions (We will check our server logs for referrers to this page and randomly pay out a trillion dollars among all of these via changetip in reply to the reviews)
Being transparent helps reviewers to not look like shills, if participating in such a project or not. I just yesterday did a [review]( of three services in one post and would be in a bad place now, if the winner turns out to run a program like this. Are we supposed to not review or even mention companies? Are we supposed to not do friends favors in reviewing their services? Motivations for favorable mentions are diverse but that doesn't make reviews a bad thing. Here on reddit you can always be of a different opinion, down-vote, up-vote or hide stuff if you feel like it.

Ok, cool, so we can discuss the challenge openly thanks to sharing it?
* `6Pf...4C` is the encrypted private key which is probably correct
* `211`, `3 is the parts OP thinks to know about the passphrase
* there might be 6 to 8 digits between these parts
* these "digits" might also contain letters and special characters
* `3 might also be `3O
So with that information, in the best case the search space is 10⁶
In the worst case it is 80^8 * 2.
I ran a little test, brute forcing this key with Mycelium's bitcoin library bitlib (I work for Mycelium, so that was most handy) and got one try per second on my laptop. With bitcoinj I got 2/s, with multi threading I got 7/s and I rented a 32 core machine from digitalocean where my code yielded 36/s for $640/month or $640/(36*60*60*24*30)=$7 per million tries.
The bounty of $170k would buy me 24 billion tries.
* In the best case of 6 numeric missing, this would be worth it. I would only need a million tries to certainly find the answer. $7.
* In the worst case though ... I would need 3*10^15 tries. $23 billion. Or in other terms, if I would invest the full bounty, hoping to find the solution in the 6 letter range I would have a chance of success of 170k/23B=0.0007%.
Edit: Maybe the code could be faster but not a million times faster. Maybe OP could come forward with more details. With the given odds I'm out.

* Use Hardware Wallets
* Do Multisig
* With Multisig, even a shitty wallet can improve your security. 2of2 with a poorly protected seed in plain text on your virus infested laptop and a hardware wallet is more secure than only your hardware wallet that might have a bad random number generator or other backdoor/vulnerability.
* Unfortunately HW wallets are not good at Multisig yet. Standards are missing but BIP174 is promising and hopefully helps make all future HW wallets compatible
* For now, use electrum. Later bitcoin-core should work, too.
* Shamir's Secret Sharing is more secure way to split your master seed into a 3 of 6 puzzle to hand out parts to people you trust, to combine them in case you die
* Don't give puzzle parts to people who would kill you for your coins

I'm tempted to write a bot that checks every block if the past 144 blocks were hashed faster than ever before and post to reddit about this new ATH. The bot would post several times per day on some days but would be just as relevant as any other hype about hashing power. These articles are only ever relevant for noobs that never looked at an all time hash speed chart with log scale. In the past we had weeks where it went up 5% per day and more recently, it's less aggressive but of course with a stable price, hashing power increases over time.

I could claim the same about network security and cryptography. Still I don't copy those subs here.
@_date: 2019-09-26 23:14:52
The claims in the article are not exactly that outrageous.
So the central bank is evaluating the possibility of holding Bitcoins. That's the claim. "Four people with direct knowledge of the matter" is the source.
Nobody said that the central bank is about to announce anything. There is not even a claim of high ranking officials knowing anything about these explorations.
Many central banks produced papers on Bitcoin and the claim here is not that they want to switch to Bitcoin or in any other way jeopardize the "value" of their "currency". It's about "international reserve". Holding assets gives your fiat currency value as it's perceived as backing. Holding USD is a huge problem for them due to sanctions and at the order of magnitude of foreign reserves they currently have, Bitcoin actually does have some liquidity, so I find it quite plausible that some people float such ideas.
The way it's proposed could well be the closest for Bitcoin to be politically palatable for a government in dire straits like Venezuela.
At least all this makes way more sense than the "Petro" which was not fake news. At least not by the news outlets that spread word about this joke of a project.

Much appreciated that there are people constantly after the scammers. I, too, do call out people for not having cold wallet strategies or otherwise fishy offers.
It's just not really practical to digest more scammer warnings. It makes sense to cut off one's attention at a certain threshold as scams are relevant for those affected and for the big scams, the bitcoin reputation as a whole. The small scams should be handled in the respective communities. If XY is a scam, yeah, great, there's an XY sub. Whine about it there but don't pollute with it. Many that are not active in XY, might never have joined the fabulous offer precisely because it looked fishy and getting confirmation later is basically expected noise.
If your hairdresses scams you, no need to inform somebody around the world. Most scams have about the impact of hairdressers scamming, so their client group should warn people that might be affected.

* routing puts limits to the speed for **arbitrary** payments. If n users started trying to buy something at m shops as fast as possible (using "users" and "shops" as those are sources and sinks for the cash flow. LN doesn't distinguish between user-accounts and shop-accounts), the "map" according to which you can do payments will need frequent updates that needs replication to many parties as channels deplete and get replaced or re-balanced.
* on-boarding is limited by the block size limit
* there is no limit to how often A pays B if they don't affect the global routing, which would generally be the case if A has a direct non-public channel to B. As there can be many such A-B cases, the overall transaction limit is infinite and thus an irrelevant metric. The goal is to increase the number of cases where a payment from A through B to C can be done without having to tell the rest of the world about updated states.

In the context of a real product that is safe against a bit of vandalism, the extra CPU power should not be a major cost factor.
I'm trying to think of a setup where people would throw in coins, bills and maybe also crypto without cashing out quickly each of them. Maybe some tipping thing. Some artist does his thing and in the end, collects the tips in form of either on-chain or lightning BTC or even in other cryptos, all communicated via a simple QR code. Not a finished idea, sorry ;)

Hi Rene. Op provided me with details but very poorly communicated. At first he talked about 4 to 8 digits to brute force with letters and special characters around that he remembered. Very doable. After some back and forth I suspect the 4 to 8 "digits" also may contain letters and special characters and the "known" parts also might have variance.
If you are working on this, good luck but I kind of doubt OP's seriousness. Might still give it a try for the fun of it.

Well, therefore I say you could use this for a cloud backup.
If you encrypt `cosigners[]` for
      var master = HDPrivateKey(Mnemonic(passphrase))
      var storageKey = master.derive('m/42/42');
      var publicKey = storageKey.publicKey
you can drop it in the cloud without worrying about being able to recover it later. This is what I am working on for *thisApp right now, using the bitcore libraries. Please let me know if there is anything insecure about this.
To recover the `cosigners[]` from the cloud, you would now only need to ask the cloud for whatever BLOB there is stored for `storageKey.publicKey` and knowing the `storageKey.privateKey`, you could recover it.
The server would know close to nothing.

It might sound funny but I honestly believe there are bitcoin believers thanks to cryptolocker. I met two victims that would never have heard of bitcoin if it wasn't for cryptolocker. They contacted me to buy bitcoin. I spent an hour with each, explaining all the stuff around the scene and both were the smartest IT guy of the respective companies, so they very much understood what a game changer bitcoin is. Neither of them came back to buy more but they know how bitcoin is a mighty tool and I'm sure with a little more buzz around them, they will join in.

So just to make something up that some fictional employer might pay you much much more for is grassroot campaigning. Spread the word about their product in a smart way. You managed to create a bitcoin frontpage post with 70 upvotes. Do product placement for X in non-X subs in a polite way and get $1 for each post in a new sub that has at least 50000 subscribers if it gets &gt;70&amp; upvotes.
Go on some dark net markets and you will find how people sell accounts. 1000 XY accounts for $5 or so. They create stuff with scripts but at your hourly rate, you would still be way better off creating XY accounts all day long than in your current job. Or sell in-game currency. WOW gold was done in China but Venezuela is probably 100 times cheaper for things like that now.

So you basically claim it's just an infinite spread. No sellers at any price. And I doubt exactly that. I think the thing is just not trading yet, so you can only lock in your buy offers but no sell offers yet. That's my whole point.
If indeed you are right and this is a traded entity with thousands of traders having access and still not a single trade going on at even $400, I kind of understand the excitement but I doubt that, as that would mean that nobody is capable of arbing between real bitcoins and that vehicle, which makes the "$400" kind of pointless.

why do you care about length? If you don't read it, abbreviate it. If you read it to compare if you have it right, you probably don't read the full addresses in current format neither. If you read it **to** somebody, it actually is shorter, as you don't need to say "upper case" and "lower case" all the time. "upper case A" is just as long as "abcd" and if you spell these a lot, you might omit "case" and only announce it upon change and probably when being interrupted by numbers which maybe might get you to a comparable length, with the benefit of the recipient having direct visual clue about what went wrong if something went wrong. "what was letter 15" is faster fixed than "repeat all please".

I find it reasonable to apply the QALY concept in many areas. Why not? If a charity wants to bring clean water to a region that maybe has "not that dirty" water and another wants to bring education to the same region to spark the economy, the impact on QALY of the second might be bigger per dollar than the first and that might be a good argument to attribute funds to the second.

The security aspect is really a non-issue at this time. The privacy issue also is a minor issue as for donations I would want that transparency.

I should have mentioned that it was over a year ago but I know there is a huge discrepancy between bitmap and the truth.

I heard that about Argentina and know it was not true cause I tried it out. I heard it about Iran and know it was not true cause their only source was my friend and developer there.
So do I think India is going into Bitcoin? Or Russia? No. In fact I know they are not, cause if anything that calls itself a country would move into Bitcoin, its value would be way north of $1000 long before anybody would write about it. If Russia or India did that, we would be north of $1million.

Neither of those guarantees you protection from patents. A global patent grant has to be challenged country by country. Prior art is no killer for such a global grant and open source no-budget projects will not defend by themselves against the most nonsensical license claims brought forward by a team of lawyers in a million dollar case.

This is very dangerous. Coinbase would loose a ton of customers. Really offensive, sudden use of patents is common among companies that don't have anything but patents, aka patent trolls. If Coinbase would troll other bitcoin companies, they would troll back as good as they could and Coinbase has attack surface. The likeliest scenario these patents could get used aggressively is that Coinbase goes bankrupt and is forced to sell to the highest bidding patent troll. Therefore I hope they give a perpetual license to "all bitcoin companies" before they go bankrupt.

Ok. Tough one. The unicorn alien technology we've all been waiting for is finally for sale. But … it's an R-Pi with an Antminer U3 and a nice 128GB SD-card at an ~~insane 400%~~[60%]( markup? There is certainly more to this. The product will be shipped not before November, so I suspect there will be some marketing with why we **actually** would buy this. … at which point those who are not yet on the waiting list will bite their *****. … or laugh at those who are buying an R-Pi for much monies.
What most catches my attention is the "Micropayments Server". Have they figured out how to do the lightning network? But if they do it in some trusted computing closed whatever chip, which true ~~Scotsman~~Bitcoiner would use that? And if it was open sourced, which true Bitcoiner would buy this device?
They have my attention and certainly many who do work on hub and spoke networks are listening up now, too.

Pruning nodes help with the decentralization. They provide exactly what SPV wallets or Lightning Nodes need.
The current bitcoin core pruning is primitive but it's possible to better shard the data, so that every node has just a small percentage of the block chain, without the need to run full copies everywhere.

I find it highly relevant albeit not without a little explanation.
Bitcoin is not the most private of crypto currencies and the coins listed above all (that I had heard of) try to be more private than bitcoin and are getting the boot on a big exchange. That sounds kind of relevant for attempts to make Bitcoin more private.
Either way I think Bitcoin's biggest challenge going forward will be privacy. We will need confidential transactions or something like that. Else big business and lazy users will destroy all fungibility.

Any valid address is equally likely to be ~~used~~ found by chance. You can't rule out it was just a random address and therefore you can't disregard it. Sure, it's a pretty "[nothing up my sleeves]( address to convince people it's actually not spendable but how can you programmatically tell if an address is not spendable? There are better ways to destroy bitcoins than by sending them to maybe not spendable valid p2kh addresses.
Edit: The first sentence was misleading. In more detail, if you pick a valid address, chances to find the keys for it is abysmally low, yet by generating a key pair the chances for the resulting address to have any exact form are all equal.

Only looking at the diagram, he's probably right but does that mean, bitcoin has no value? I would doubt that. Bitcoin stepped up to deal with central banking, which in my opinion should be illegal and it turns out it is most useful for gambling and buying drugs which are, but in my opinion should not be, illegal.
It takes away control from nation states and that's a good thing. Consenting citizens can still support the fiat system or not buy drugs or gamble but now they also have an option.

I agree with much of what you say but Samourai's bashing of BIP70 also is borderline ridiculous. BIP70 allows to embed a BIP21 payment request in the same link/qr-code and as such is an addition and optional. BitPay should only be blamed for making it mandatory. Especially in light of full blocks, it makes sense to do the receiver-side broadcasting of transactions Samourai is hating on so much. If there is an 80MB backlog and my client pays me $1000 with RBF and without fee, I would love to be able to say "I didn't broadcast this joke of a transaction and hope you did neither cause I have no business for you".
Disclaimer: I work for Mycelium and our wallet supports BIP70 since forever. So far we got no request to disable it via the settings for example.

Sorry but they are slow. Ok, the Order 4 shipment is still kind of in time but also this one took 3 business days until it was marked ready to ship, although it was "on stock" when I ordered. Yes, I picked free shipping all the time but if something is "on stock", it should be packaged the next day and then be shipped according to plan but order 5 did not go like that at all. They waited 7 business days with one item marked "restocking" although all were in stock when I paid. So after 7 days they split the list into two shipments. Then they told me that one item was discontinued and I should get back with them about how to resolve that. I picked other items. Meanwhile they decided to get a knife ready for shipping. Then another ticket came in about knives not being deliverable via the selected shipping method. I should choose something else. (Shipment  already contained a similar knife.). Then they packed the items I had picked as a replacement for the discontinued item. Then they packed another small single item a week later. I repeat, all items were marked as on stock when I ordered, yet the last item was ~~sent out~~ … I actually don't know what it means but the tracking reads "18 Sep 2015, 16:52:17PM	Dispatch Pre-Alert	In Transit" and I interpret that as it not having reached the first facility of the logistics provider (POS Malaysia).
So to recap, I bought 11 items on August 20th and the last of them were handed over to the logistics provider on September 18th, with one of the item totally taken out of the shipment and with 2 support tickets.
All that is not perfect but I like them anyway.

"equalizer" is probably a bit of an exaggeration. If your oxygen-tank bound wheelchair guy is known to have a gun, the attacker can probably still scare him to death with the extra oxygen he needs in an average life-or-death-situation. A surprise-shot in the dark though ... probably quite effective when the attacker didn't expect it.
Either way, in civilized countries like Norway I consider alarms quite effective against intruders planing time-consuming wrench attacks, too. Once that goes off the intruder would pretty much assume the police is informed and he has 2 minutes to leave. That's enough to grab a wallet and run but not to enter a mnemonic and negotiate the many options of multi-signature and decoy and time-locked wallets.

Mycelium is still listed on bitcoin.org, with a tiny error there, actually: our servers cannot fake transactions, as the client verifies every transaction of the user.
**SegWit** ... yes, it is coming, ... our developer version can already verify segWit transactions and full support (BIP49 was authored by Daniel Weigl, the Android lead dev at the time) is coming but have many things to juggle right now.
**BCash** was added as a module, as a proof of concept for our modularization concept. Actually I designed the modularization library. To use it for a crypto currency and then using bitcoinJ's way of syncing was not the best of all decisions and we are kind of recovering from that but as BCash has value, many of our users asked how to redeem this value and some lost their bitcoins trying to redeem the value without our feature-for-the-purpose. I'm a bitcoin maximalist but that didn't stop me from converting my BCash to Bitcoin - at 16%. Would all big holders do so, BCash wouldn't still sit at 11.5%.
Hey, I agree with you that BitPay turned evil when they took Jihan's money. Before I applied at Mycelium, I had considered BitPay the top company for software developers (Blockstream didn't exist at the time). Today I wouldn't be for hire if they asked.

Hi developer of *thisApp here. Glad you like the concept. Hope you like the finished app even more :) (coming in two weeks^TM )
The volatility is really the biggest issue with bitcoin loans. In *thisApp, the promoter fronts $100 and has no idea when he will ever get the corresponding bitcoins and at which rate. He can though always close the deal by paying at that merchant with his own bitcoins into his own pocket.
While buying directly gives him full control at which exchange rate he will get, using coinapult-locks takes away the whole holding of bitcoins, so that might be a different target audience: People who want to use the payment network but not the token. While I am clearly not of that flock of people, they definitely exist, so we also have to consider how to cater to those who don't want to care about volatility all the time but still want to drive bitcoin adoption.
I don't use coinapult, so I have a question for you: Does coinapult support locking of incoming funds received by a certain address? What exchange rate do they use? Maybe we could implement that from the thisApp side.
Sure, without any direct cooperation with coinapult, things would always slip a bit, as we have to create quotes that are being paid maybe 10 minutes later and coinapult would use the exchange rate of when the transaction actually confirms. If the locking is a manual  process that can only be performed on spendable funds, which would of course make sense, things would be even worse. With a coinapult API, we could maybe trigger that locking from our side but that would go a bit against our vision of … (waiting approval from John to share more insight of where we are going …)
Furthermore for privacy we would probably prefer to get an extended public key or multiple deposit addresses, as the merchant would probably receive dozens of payments and these should not go to the same address. In the worst case of two customers paying for about the same amount at about the same time, both not paying exactly what they were asked to (including a tip), *thisApp might get confused, although I'm pretty sure I have that problem down to a one in a million problem even if running on just one address.

Same here. In 3 years I had more than 70 trades and never had a scammer. Ok, one called me a scammer cause I complained about him not sending his money from his bank account which he interpreted as me not wanting to send him the bitcoins but that minor friction aside, it's a great service.

Well, bitcoin wouldn't be bitcoin if it allowed a payment processor to force a merchant to use it for all future. So we will never be able to promise you a cut of future bitcoin payments you will be able to buy the certificate at any value with the merchant making a commitment to accept bitcoin at any value. So lets say you buy a certificate over $100 worth of gasoline at your local gas station. The gas station might sell this to you at $50. Or $200. That's up to you. The certificate though has a part where the merchant commits to accept bitcoin at face value (as per exchange-rate-provider), at a discount of x% or at a premium of y%.

OP is a bit confused. Uber gets slowed down by some countries messing with their preferred payment method credit card. In Argentina for example you need a USD CC to use Uber, which in turn is possible thanks to Bitcoin. Uber is not giving up lightly when it's facing legal challenges and I think they deserve the 25% of all rides as a compensation for being the door opener.
Once countries give in and drop the anachronism the taxi cartels are, the fight will be about the margin. Uber will drop from 25% to 5% or whatever low the competition drives them. They will just not go to 0% unless they can extract profits from making the driver casually advertise the latest product to the clients or whatever. They have management and staff that needs to be paid.
Can you do that with just some lines of code? Not really. Or not easily. You will always need to sort out fraudsters and other disputes and improve the product to match the competition. Decentralization is not a solution for everything less do you need a blockchain for everything but I'm sure we will see some solutions in that way in the not so far future. Meanwhile let Uber pave the way and get a little reward doing so.

2. there is no way china can split the Bitcoin blockchain for a week straight. There are just too many ways to get the blocks across. Satellite phones, long wave radio, microSD in hand luggage, [IPoAC]( … you would have a block propagation reduced to hours vs. seconds but certainly not a week-long split.

It's a centralized node. All they could do is to freeze funds that were sent their way for opening channels.
That is much less of a danger than to ~~freeze~~ steal all funds currently in "channels", which is how much people trust changetip for example. To my understanding, they are rivaling changetip directly, so they are a clear advancement over them.
So could they still freeze funds? Sure but only the amount sent their way during a few hours window and if they want to have plausible deniability, they would have to warn users not to open channels within an hour. The "hacker" would then have to negotiate terms with users how to split the … $6? each, in order to recover parts of it? Sounds like not worth the effort for an inside job, worth much more in fees per day and it is even questionable if it's worth for an outside hacker.

Hmm, I guess this will be addressed with the fees. On-chain will be proportional to the size in bytes, with a certain price in satoshi/byte at any given time.
LN will be roughly proportional to the value transferred or to be more precise: you will pay for the service of facilitating a transaction (sub-cent) but you will also pay for funds laying dormant at your end of a channel. This will be a low interest rate but it will long term not be due per transaction but you will kind of rent a capacity your way. If you want to be able to receive money, you will pay for it proportionally, as somebody has to fund the channel. There might be events where you will get rewarded for closing a channel early.
Problem is just how to communicate all this to the user.
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:18:27
128GB is way way more than you need for a pruning node. It leaves plenty of space for the UTXO set and application data. Only hope that the SD-Card has the reliability you need for that, as those regularly die and are not meant for many write cycles.
@_date: 2016-10-19 19:18:54
said it already in his first sentence but spoiled it in his second sentence:
LN works without any custodial risk whatsoever^(*). You don't have the money go from one bank to the next to the next to the recipient. You have nodes that facilitate the payment and take fees and maybe require data but the payment will go atomically from your wallet into the wallet of the recipient^(*).
That said, you will always be able to close your channel whenever you want and to maintain more than one, just like you may have more than one credit card.
I guess there is good reason to believe that the KYC/AML that banks are forced to do, will result in thinner margins for them than for "annonymous nodes" on TOR that might probably even sponsor your to use them. No, I don't believe that the banks will keep a grip on LN and as they would never get control over funds flowing through LN, they will not even try to.
^(*) No node ever has the information to reliably on its own terms grab money that the sender didn't agree to leave to it. Trying to do so would put the node at risk of losing all the money it would have a legit claim on but sender and recipient have to be vigilant and online to ensure that.

@_date: 2016-10-23 18:34:30
LN alone can not solve the scaling limits.
7 billion people doing 5 slow, unreliable, expensive transactions per day would need **70GB** blocks if done on chain.
7 billion people doing 5000  instant, cheap transactions per day would still need **100MB blocks** if done using LN, opening and closing 1 channel per year.
I personally assume we will eventually get to blocks in the hundreds of MB but on a schedule more in tune with Moore's law starting with 1MB today and not with big jumps like proposed by Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin Unlimited. Doubling every 18 months would still get us to 100MB in just 10 years.

Blocksize is already a problem and 2MB would be more so. On the other hand, fees are not really a problem yet. Yes, the false promise of free, instant transactions people were brabbling about are harder to argue for, now that transactions cost 10ct. but it was never instant and it was never really free and even if the economic would change in absence of a block size increase, it will be temporary and the alternative might be that Bitcoin just ends up being another Paypal.

We want to open up to more innovation, also maintained by third party devs, without compromising on our security model.

Assuming there was a block worth 100 units, while the normal block only is worth 5 units is kind of a stretch but so be it. Let miners split a block into two but it will not be worth doing this most of the time and miners will adopt.
What would happen if Satoshi decided now that he wants to re-introduce his bitcoins into the economy via mining fees and creates transactions worth a million bitcoins in fees (or whatever fits into one block)? Miners would go bonkers over this and play hot potato hoping they will be the ones to hold the million when all come to their senses and start mining again? I doubt that. They would not sacrifice bitcoin to gain some bitcoins and find a solution once this happens. The same would happen if OP's concerns ever plaid out, which I doubt if we keep any limit on the block size.
Even the concern that miners wouldn't mine until enough fees accumulate is no big concern as the retarget would still ensure a block on average every 600s. The protocol doesn't care if mining hardware goes idle 50% of the time. In fact this would even be good for security, as this would constitute 100% reserve capacity for when some mystery miner attacks the network.

No, I am not saying that but there is no single answer to what the right fee might be. Tipping a guy in the street I might not care too much if it confirms at all, tipping a waiter in a Bitcoin-accepting bar I might care to not look like actually trying to double-spend and trading face-to-face with a guy I never met before, I would want next-block confirmation to not have him turn nervous when I try to leave before the first confirmation – after three blocks of waiting with him.
Whenever I got used to one tool to give me close-enough hints on how much to pay I might be better off with that tool than to dive into a theoretically better one. If my tool horribly over-estimated the fee, I might have learned that I usually get next block with the +5 block option. Switching tool requires re-training that.

So you are suggesting to use some branch in the HDWallet for the k value? Makes sense for HD wallets. Instead of "hoping", write a BIP or is there already a BIP for that? I can not see why that would get much controversy. It would be an extension to BIP44. With a payment using m/44'/0'/account'/1/i as change address, why not use m/44'/0'/account'/1/i/0 or m/44'/0'/account'/2/i for k?

"instant" was always an illusion and "free" was what you will find a lot in all kind of presentations from 4 years ago.


I understand that the perceived costs of a cash transaction is lower than the 10ct. and that 10ct. is too much for many people that get by on a dollar per day. This was what I mentioned to be a temporary condition and I would not panic even if the fees were $10 or $100 for a limited time. Bitcoin not working now is no excuse for hacks that might destroy it altogether.
Edit: Half your comment was on my "wrong" number of 10ct. per transaction. I happen to have done 2 transactions today that long confirmed and had a 6ct. fee. I assume that people that get along on a dollar per day might tend to these lower fees, while people moving millions might overpay, driving the average up but I always use the economic option in Mycelium, do dozens of transactions per month and wait to actually have to do anything to rescue a stuck transaction but as I said before, Bitcoin is developing and quick hacks will not get us to the end goal of a relevant currency that can challenge central banking as a whole.

A cryptocurrency with a built-in inflation is still sound money in my book, as long as it's clear from the start and the distribution of the inflation is well defined and not up to the whim of some select "officials".
Changing bitcoin in that sense prior to seeing it fail due to the lack of mining rewards would be totally unacceptable though. After all there is many people with stake in Bitcoin that would protect the currency at a personal loss just like people run TOR nodes without direct compensation. The assumption that mining has to be profitable is a false one if you ask me. "Mining Bitcoin" will be "Policing the Blockchain" eventually.

Mycelium Android lead dev here. I wish people would do that for mobile wallets. Internally we do cross-check what the other devs on the team do but we very rarely get feedback from outside the company. See our [special thanks]( for some exceptions.
At Mycelium, one dev does the release and while we have security measures in place, the release manager could do a lot of harm just like in any other of the wallet teams and as far as binary releases go, also in the hardware firmware space. Deterministic builds are lacking in the industry and I had the hope to have Mycelium pioneer in that case but so far we didn't get to address this seriously/successfully.
In the hope we could get some better industry standard, here is how I wish it was:
* Deterministic builds
* Interested third parties that ring an alarm as soon as the released binary differs from the deterministic build, in an automated fashion (bitpay runs a build server for mycelium builds and vice versa for example)
* with the above in place, reviews would actually help protect users
Do I trust my keepkey? More than my Android phone alone, yes, but I did not break open the case to check if there is a radio module inside, phoning home. Would reading their open source help me in that case? Did many people crack open their devices? I don't know but their github repository alone can not wash away my worries.

Not preventing any pool from still doing it. Child pays for parent can be used by receiver to push the transaction if the sender is not reachable/cooperating, while the sender might try a scorched earth replace by fee, which is probably not supported by a relevant percentage of the miners, yet once the transaction is evicted from the pool, the sender can do exactly this.
correctly explains that CPFP usually also is in the sender's tool box. I had not included it, as both RBF and CPFP would not be used to double-spend against the recipient.

I can add some insight on that. Today I noticed that [Mycelium]( is currently getting installed by more Colombians than any other nation and they overtook the US some time ago. We were on slow organic growth until April 18th (that date marked a minor spike up but similar to other minor spikes before.
Country | January 1st | April 18th | May 9th
Colombia | 5 | 180 | 410
Bolivia | 0 | 3 | 33
Ecuador | 0 | 6 | 32 
Mexico | 4 | 9 | 22
USA | 163 | 136 | 187
I tried to figure out what was going on, as there was no clear date at which things happened (an app getting featured at a major TV show usually results in spikes with declines) but it looks like a massive boost in general interest. Like countries waking up to Bitcoin. WTH? And why Colombia and not Brazil? Even Mexico is much slower and more following the global trend.
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:04:56
No. Mycelium spoke and declared to not have picked sides. Its engineers are in charge to prevent users from losing money. I believe we have to provide ways of dealing both sides of long lasting chain splits and August 1st is a likely candidate for such a split to happen. You need a way to see your wallet from both perspectives: A transaction might be confirmed on one chain but not on the other. And you might need a way to split: I assume this can be done most easily by sending all your funds with an RBF transaction and once it confirms on the legacy chain, we publish a transaction with a slightly higher fee, so the segWit chain confirms that.

ASICs probably make little sense in HFT but as we just learned via another reply, HFT does indeed use FPGA, which was also a technology mining went through.
I simply annotated that I assumed that HFT already does use GPU. HFT is an arms race, so anything you can remotely call HFT will not run exclusively on CPU. I did not know it was using FPGA though.

a reusable payment code is a recipe to create a transaction that only the recipient can know belongs to him. Unfortunately on the blockchain they are also "tagged" and the recipient has to consider all such tagged transactions but using prefixes in the tags allows to reduce traffic if one day a lot of such transactions would be too much to receive them all on mobile for example.

Ok, I agree with the idea that money should represent favors owed by society but I don't agree with old favors being more valuable than new ones. In fact I'm struggling with money being favors detached from persons.
Think of it this way: 8000 years ago, 99% of humanity lived in societies small enough to know everybody. Less than 150 people per group. No global ledger was needed. Groups started experimenting with more local ledgers like shells but it wasn't that essential. People knew who they owed to and who owed them. Same as it probably works in your family. You sweep the floor without keeping a ledger of who owes you to sweep the floor next. In such an informal society, ledgers are quite subjective and can gain and loose rapidly. Massively abnormal behavior might lead to loosing all your favors in a day (by killing a member of the group). Also you might win a million favors in a day (by saving the lives of the group). Inheritance of favors on the other hand was on probation: If the son was an arrogant prick, he might loose all his father's favors the day the father died. Some might still remember the honor of the father and give him credit but with time, the son will lose a million favors rapidly.
With cold hard money this is not the case. You can inherit a ton of gold and your villain son will be able to redeem it at face value. If people know about his wealth and bad intentions, they might charge him more than they would charge a good, modest person but ultimately the more money you have, the better you can navigate the market and communicate your offer such that you get the best price.
I wish there was a way to enhance economy such that people can discriminate against anti-bad behavior ("bad" being something different for many people). I want to boycott the bad actors and support the good ones, at least after I took a decision to put them into the one or the other category but our global economy where the environmentalist Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation holds Shell stocks and the local bakery got bought by Wall Mart last week, I can't know who makes a profit from me acting the one way or the other.
I want to regain my power to decide to whom I owe a favor – or at least to whom I don't.

I appreciate the enthusiasm but the UASF is not about node count. It's about economic majority. It's about which coins users attribute value to.

Well, if I would have to pick any taxes, I would probably pick a Freigeld like tax but freicoin completely fails to achieve this. You can't decentralize demurrage.
Demurrage would only work with a traditional state paying his minions with that kind of currency and the citizens being forced to accept that currency.
Freicoin lacks the demurrage that would actually be high enough to incentivizing spending while it already is too high to be sustainable if it ever reached a substantial market share. 1% demurrage per year is high above any expected volatility even if it were the world's reserve currency while 1% of the world's reserve currency flowing into mining is insane, too. I would want a demurrage to be 20%, replacing all other taxes, with a mining reward being as close to zero as possible.

No, you are missing the point.
Currently, miners take a transaction if it looks nice enough and ignore any attempt to replace it. This is the default node's behavior. Usually it makes no difference if you add a 0.0001Ƀ fee or a 10Ƀ fee. It ends up to be mined by those pools no matter what.
There are however already now pools that would consider an alternative transaction with a higher fee. Those pools would swap out the transaction not only once but again and again until they find a block. OP suggested that making this the default behavior would make sense to allow victims to avoid thieves to make a profit of their theft.

Nobody said that being your own bank was easy. It only got 10,000,000USD "easier" thanks to bitcoin but you're still a ffing bank. Ways to protect your funds are plentiful and it always boils down to convincing the attacker that there is easier money to be made elsewhere. The more reason to believe you had tons of bitcoins you leave in the mind of the attacker, the more you need to ramp up your security. Multisig and clear instructions how to deal in case of an attack. Codes to signal attacks. Decoy wallets. Time locked funds etc. can all help protect you but the best protection is to convince the attacker that you are not worth being attacked.

"Transaction costs $0.05" – Rule Of Nature
Sorry, where did OP pull that number from? Guess what, yes, with a limited block size those who pay the most will get in and if you try to pay your morning coffee with an on-chain transaction, you might loose the bidding game against the other dude that wants to close his lightning channel he was using the last 5 months to do a gazzillian transactions, paying hundreds of coffees, seconds of air time, seconds of streaming, deciliters at the gas pump, transactions on his high-frequency trading bot … whatever.
The point is that on-chain scaling to match paypal and visa is just not worth it. First, because we would need GB blocks, not MB blocks. Second, because we are not fine with only visa level. Third, because on-chain is not instant, less private (than onion-routed LN) and just not efficient to store every micro payment forever in ideally more than 10k copies. We are engineers and we can do better.
Lastly, miners also have costs and at some point the mining fee has to pay for mining + indefinite storage in online, highly available, ultra redundant storage of 300B. This can never be much lower than law of nature's transaction cost of $0.05 once the block rewards are gone but we want to go lower. Much lower.

Your question is not well defined. How many participants are there? 5 users + 5 x 5 intermediary nodes + 5 recipients? The answer is 6x5x5=150. If on the other hand the users are sending the coins in a ring among themselves plus one to make it "5 hops" each would need a channel to his left neighbor and the total can be as low as 6x5=30 or maybe 35? Or maybe 30.04 if the extra hop was really limited, sending tiny amounts back and forth.

I guess in a standalone app it's manageable. You loose development speed if you have to teach your app some type safety but in the end if the js bitcoin libs get 10 times the attention than the java libs, they will turn out to be more feature complete and better tested which means more security. Of course with both having the same dev support, java wins but I doubt these are more than x3 apart in terms of work required to do it right.

I don't agree on change address discovery being a limitation in BIP44. It has it's dedicated branch in m/44'/0'/\*/1/*.
I don't know thought, why the account currently has huge gabs on the change branch. Also copay is not BIP44 in that it does not warn the user when "creating" more than 20 addresses without activity on the external chain. BIP44 wallets can not find those transactions and Mycelium can't span gaps of more than 3 on the internal chain where 's wallet has gaps &gt;15. 
Edit: So I looked some more into copay and it seams it's not BIP44 for various reasons. First, on the external chain it skips arbitrarily many addresses without warning. This will cause users "loose" their funds as kids inevitably will play vanitygen with that "generate" button. Second the internal chain acts weird, too. While I could not reproduce the large gaps has, I got address re-use, which also is bad.
@_date: 2015-10-25 03:09:39
Mycelium does not store such information but it could and therefore it is in your best interest to assume we do if you are very concerned. As the wallet asks the servers at mycelium, these servers could log which IP is interested in which addresses and this could happen for all kind of reason within or outside of Mycelium's control. At Mycelium this privacy concern is taken seriously and preparations are taken to provide full SPV mode that does not rely on Mycelium's application servers to check balances.
For now you might want to hide your IP address by using TOR. Also with SPV mode using TOR is the only way to avoid leaking what you are interested in, unless you run a full node.

Kind of difficult to pull off. Then the site operator would have to immitate the communications of his top sellers and avoid any side-channel communication. Sure, a lot would go un-noticed in a flawed system, so he could MITM his clients but it wouldn't go on for a week unnoticed with more and more money flowing in and tons already on stock.

Technically you ensure it to be pseudo-random in a well defined, sufficiently secure way. With the k values coming from the HDWallet, importing that HDWallet into a different program would allow to audit if the first program indeed used sufficiently safe k values thus protecting the root seed. It could spit out a warning that non-standard k-values were used, leaving no way of knowing if the root seed is at risk. Other than that, using a strong random source should be just as good as using the HDWallet for k values.

@_date: 2016-10-25 13:15:05
Simple answers:


Currently we are hitting a limit with about 4tps  Ergo, for 1000tps you would need 250MB blocks.


Visa at peak does 45k tps. That's 12GB blocks.


We don't know. Here in Chile I could probably download 12GB in ten minutes with my normal ISP but maybe they would kick me for using 50TB/month. Catching up with the blockchain would thus be even harder. If you download 2GB/minute, you would still only catch up two days per day of downloading.
But even the 250MB blocks would be a huge issue. Not necessarily for running a full node for your business' payments. It would clearly download fast enough and with pruning there is no real issue about storage neither. But miners need to get new blocks quickly. Every 6s delay in getting and verifying a new block is a loss of 1% of their revenue. Every 6s delay in sharing a found block (upstream is usually slower if you are not in a data center) is also a 1% loss. Bigger blocks might bare the potential for non-linear costs in validation, so it's hard to say if validating 600,000 transactions would be doable in "just" 250 times the current time it takes to validate a block or maybe much more, so here again you might have an edge with a real power-horse of a machine over your standard laptop. You would not need a Google sized data center though.
Switching back to the 12GB blocks Visa level, with the mining perspective: Now things get really tricky. You might not need a Google sized data center but you would definitely need some sophisticated solution to verify blocks. The equilibrium point of how much you would invest into CPU/RAM would probably get you some 64 core machine with TBs of ram. Something nobody would buy for solo mining or even a small pool, so yes, big pools would profit from that and thus you would get a strong drive to centralization.

As currently the $20/month is the leading option, with $2/month being the lowest, I wonder if people know what they are voting on.
I have a spare laptop with a pruning full node that I power up every now and then and that is never to run any non-free software. Some have Raspberry Pis that they use equally rarely. An R-Pi costs $10, with a $10 sd card and negligible power costs and lets say writing it off in 3 years, that's $20/36 months.
Or another way to look at it: How much are you willing to spend on leather wallets? I would be surprised if my leather-wallet spendings would exceed $2/month and by global standards that's probably well above average.
If we want people to appreciate "don't trust but verify", we have to get the costs down to that level.
With LN you would probably jump into the $20/month range instantly but with outsourced monitoring of channels and other improvements, I'm optimistic that we can get both the transaction and the wallet costs down to the $2/month range long term.

Not sure what he was talking about but I understood it like this: He made brain wallets based on "correct battery staple horse 329093" and thus locked away the funds in that wallet until he remembers the number. The number being just 6 digits allows him though to brute force it at a later point in time but this being an extra effort, he will not spend the coins or even know how much there are until he really needs them.
I also have some such dead coins. Distributed 1000 paper wallets with 3mɃ each. I promised to not take back the money until a year later. The oldest hold the money since two years but I consider this my last reserve. Last time I checked, less than 5% were actually spent.
And then there is that one dollar I sent to a non-discoverable address in my HD wallet. I know it sits at m/44'/0'/0'/0 but I suppose it will be discovered in the future when wallets simply check for more stuff in an HD wallet.

Mycelium or any smartphone wallet is vulnerable to attacks carried out by the carrier, the manufacturer, the wallet binary provider, any app that gains root access which could be a zero day jail brake in any app like candy crush for that matter.
Any charger, including the ones you buy yourself could run a malicious adb trying to steal your funds. Again it would require you to allow debugging or it would need to exploit bugs in the phone/android itself.
Any friend could see you punch in the pin and abuse your trust.
(nobody said being your own bank is easy ;) )
On Android there are efforts to move the actual keys to a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) which would make it pretty much impossible that other apps mess with the wallet. While this sounds nice and while this certainly is more secure than many other models, it's also just another thing to hack. Those in control of TEE and the respective encryption keys would again have access to your bitcoin keys if they cooperated with the right people. Again, friends learning your pin will not care about TEE neither.
You can minimize your exposure by uninstalling Mycelium or deleting its memory. After all, your 12 words are a paper wallet (assuming the 12 words are on paper). You can manage several such 12 word wallets.
If you do a paper wallet, make sure the printer has no built-in harddrive. Many printers do and store every document you ever printed. Especially big copy machines are known to do that. At least when getting rid of your old printer that you printed paper wallets with, make sure it certainly does not have a disk.
... and when you did all that right, be sure to not forget your passwords, keep them in multiple locations and make sure you know how to recover them.
Also multisig … but I'll leave that to somebody else …

I understand how inheritance is an important and active process of parents not only providing genes for their off-springs but it is one example of where the "favors being owed" analogy becomes more questionable.
Again, I acknowledge that money is more efficient and thus favorable over remembering who owes what but I also struggle with the inherent lack of empathy that comes from relying solely on money. Empathy is constrained by [the human brain's lack of tracking more than 150 entities]( over an extended time span. Therefore I see the need for a tool to extend that capacity. And no, I don't advocate to abandon capitalism until we find such a tool but rather I'm hopeful that the market value of such a tool will be incentive enough for it to come in the one way or the other.
as you can see I don't romanticize barter communities but try to narrow down on the problem many don't see in capitalism, only to blame capitalism as a whole. Ten times per day I hear people complain about stuff being too expensive and I translate this to business opportunities, short-sightedness of the actual costs involved or over-regulation. Ten times per day I hear people complain about wages being too low and I translate that to business opportunities or a lack of understanding of the value of that job. If people would think like that and had tools to understand why wages and prices are the way they are and had no barriers to make it better, then I guess people wouldn't see capitalism that much as a threat. And if after all the analysis the conclusion is that the market player actually does charge too much thanks to some immoral regulation that allows him to do so or if the business makes such a high profit thanks to exploiting common goods (polluting the air) then people should have the tools to discriminate against that in ways beyond a 2 day boycott of evil [companyname]. With such transparency and persistent boycotts in place, bad actors would be regulated by demand and people would feel empowered and not victims of a global economy that's drowning them with heartless decisions as they would force companies to keep an image of empathy which ultimately would give empathy the value it deserves.

Turns out that there are 7 users on the platform that share his IP addresses. Call me paranoid but I would spend another hour or three digging before trusting this with any amount of money. And when you consider scams, you have to consider that the listings contain just about anything that might fool the one or the other investor. So if there was no "mining" yet, I would also try with one of my accounts this form of loan.
Also: What kind of business model is "localbitcoins trading"?? Send me your coins so I can sell them on localbitcoins? How do they plan to re-stock if not via the next loan? Yeah, selling bitcoins is profitable for the seller but how do you make good on such a loan?

For those who are not that intimate with what's going on in Bitcoin: You are of course aware of a beer that was bought with a lightning transaction on testnet in Room 77 (Berlin), which by the definition of "testnet coins have no value" was no transfer of value. Core devs joked at the time that we will have to switch to testnet 4. Testnet 2 and 3 were introduced because testnet coins were traded for actual bitcoins, which is not the idea behind having a testnet.

The history of diamonds is very interesting in this context. Diamonds were a fad in the 1950s when De Beers started its campaign and succeeded fooling soon-to-be husbands into putting a month's salary worth into those stones (for no reason). To this day, there is still a strong sentiment that a wedding ring has to have an expensive diamond of a certain value determined by the buyer's potential.
If there was any such sentiment at all about owning bitcoins, that could lead to a run-away deflation. If those 45 million millionaires felt pressured to own at least a bitcoin, some of them would have to throw all their wealth in to achieve that, and 80% would have no chance to ever achieve it.

1300 connected right now is "not too many"? I'd say it's still a very successful service and my chart of choice for real time charts. bitcoinwisdom.com for example has a lot more functionality but not allowing to look at a 24h chart drives me nuts. When I click on "1d", it shows me whatever long time span.
I don't see the market depth of bitcoinity as particularly useful especially due to the confusing bar chart for change but putting it upside down doesn't improve that. mtgoxlive.com did that, too, although the whole chart was BW +90° and it's funny to see the price chart eat away from the depth but ultimately it's more comfortable to have those in two charts. At least that's what I prefer.

I see the point and I bet at Mycelium that's what we will do, too but in a way it's not ok and I'd like to call out the wallet that actually produces output that makes this necessary.

Ok, I see but at least my keepkey asks me to long-press a button twice for every transaction signed and for the user it's close to impossible to distinguish if those dozen of transactions spend the same UTXOs or different ones.

They do both but glass fiber gives you orders of magnitude increase, while copper only gives you close to nothing.

Thank you for your summary. Greg being pessimistic about success scares me to be honest. Within Mycelium we are torn between full support and just signaling for now.

on-chain transactions is not really a good measure for economic activity. with off-chain solutions, there is no public visibility on transaction count, which so far probably doesn't affect the numbers much, at least not on the BTC side. Worse is that batching can mean that a bitcoin transaction actually represents 20 or 200 payments. For example the "active addresses 24h" shows 349k for BTC and 310k for ETH. Doesn't look like x4 activity for ETH there.

could you please check this if you spot anything that you did differently (apart from this being testnet)? I assume your wallet is your major and important wallet with a lot of history but if not, would you mind emptying it and sharing an xpub key with us for further investigation? I suspect something on the `m/45'/2147483647` branch but another idea would be that you skipped many addresses. The BIP44 look-ahead is 20 addresses and mycelium does just that and does not allow to create addresses beyond un-used addresses at all but copay does allow just that, so maybe you hit that "new address" button just a bit too often.
Edit: To recover from the last guess, you would have to create activity on those intermediary addresses with no gap bigger than 19 addresses. Unfortunately Mycelium allows you a gap of exactly zero, so using secondary tools would help, if you hit that button a hundred times or have huge gaps for other reasons.
Edit: Oh yeah, I would argue copay is not bip44 compliant … I just hit that button 25 times and it keeps giving me new addresses. I must confess I would prefer having a way to generate more than one address in Mycelium at a time, too, for cases where payments from multiple personae are expected but bip44 would mandate that a compatible wallet would have to create activity on its own every 20 addresses along the way, which would be an awkward feature.
Edit: I just tested it and although I suspect the Mycelium wallet would detect this transaction as transaction to self later on, now it's only detecte as outgoing.

The second you broadcast the transaction, it is "in limbo" aka "there is no strong guarantee that it will eventually get confirmed". If you paid a high fee, it might only be "in limbo" until the next block is mined but for that time you contributed to "funds in limbo".

He rightfully is concerned that a wallet that only asks for "its" transactions leaks its addresses.

Users are not that political. At Mycelium we have 135,000 monthly active users and so far not one even asked us if our servers support UASF. We had BU shills calling for boycott and aggressively promoting their project but with SegWit ... not so much so far.
That said, we are probably all on board with UASF if it has about 50% miner support. If miner support was closer to 30%, things would probably look different.

Trying to sell 7% of any security traded by millions will always result in more than a 7% drop in price because by far not all holders would be willing to increase their holdings by so there should be a lack of liquidity. .
Provably destroying ones titles to those 7% should on the other hand increase the value of the rest by up to 7%. If the destruction was an accident. If not, then why did somebody destroy them? Are they evil? Sbould all stop using them? Other psychological factors come in but lets asume it's an accident to all we know.

If the bitcoins are not in your wallet, where you control the keys, all you have is a promise. Get them into one of [these wallets]( asap.
The hardware wallets are maybe overkill and take too long to start getting your promise converted into bitcoins, so I strongly suggest to start with one of the other wallets. Just be sure to be free of viruses and to generally not have anything installed that might be after your coins but generally, an android phone with Mycelium (and no other bitcoin app installed) should be safe-ish. If you are nervous, install it on an otherwise clean, un-rooted phone, make a backup, verify your backup, receive the coins to your address and wipe the phone. The backup is then all you need to restore your access once you sorted out what to do but with the phone being wiped, you are safe against future android security breaches.
On Monday I will start working for Mycelium and use and trust that wallet since years but in theory if you are more paranoid than me, you might want to look into multi-sig wallets. At least the model allows for more security than a normal, single-sig-only wallet but it's also a better chance at loosing your coins due to lost keys.

As long as you have the private keys and don't transact during chain splits, you are safe. August 1st is a very likely candidate for the next serious chain split, so mark it in the calendar and don't transact unless you know exactly what you are doing. With a bit of luck we have segWit before August 1st or the fork will be resolved within hours and all this was big fuzz about nothing for the normal users. Of course this fuzz is very important for the people making the change happen or not. I don't want to down-play the importance but I would still hope it blows over without disruption for the regular users that doesn't even know August 1st will be a defining moment for Bitcoin.

I'm a bit confused how copay could possibly be fully bip44 compatible. According to [their blog]( you can import bip44 into copay but they don't claim full compatibility and neither do I see how that could even work. There is no p2sh in bip44. Hope that makes sense.

I guess the whole point of the poll and discussion is to figure out how people look at this. Sure, I would easily pay $100/month (in fact I do for my full nodes and gadgets), so for **me** it's reasonable but the question can easily be interpreted as to figure out what is a reasonable cost for **the general public** or for **those who most need bitcoin**. This last group inlcudes the most vulnerable: **the unbanked** and others that could easily pay $1000s per month: **the bitcoin entrepreneurs** and **cyber criminals** .

Yes but friendlier to mobile clients. I just started reading [the bip]( and the trick seams to be that the recipient gets a notifications transaction where the sender notifies him about a certain bip32 branch that he picked for his payments. Now all the recipient has to do is to watch those addresses instead of watching all addresses. The notification "transaction" could also be done out of bands.

This is one example of an "organization" trying to solve the same problem on a tiny tiny scale but it is good to illustrate the transparency issues. The book keeping is public and people close to the project trust the people involved but it's very very hard to proof to an outsider that all things go as advertised. Scaling this to solve the world's hunger would definitely result in corruption and misallocation of resources to a degree.

I guess my server would allow for many more than 300MB. The 72h timeout is a bit more tricky to deal with. Ideally we would never throw away valid transactions as even if we had constantly full blocks, a jump to bigger blocks could sweep up really really old valid transactions, which is why we would ideally never forget a valid transaction for the stats.
Another thing I would like to see is some CPFP awareness in the stats. 5sat/B transactions confirming is not independent of what child transactions confirmed in the same block. I would love to see a chart of what sat/B clusters got confirmed in each block.

Venezuelan government tries hard to kill all capitalism. A bakery can't just sell more or more expensive. They have strict quotas and strict quantities they are allowed to sell, only that they might struggle getting their rations of flour to even fulfill those quotas.
I'm not from there but I was surprised when I traveled in Bolivia and an old baker told me how that was how it worked in Bolivia. He was member of the bakers guild and only this way he was allowed to sell bread. He's not allowed to process more than a x kg of flour per day and he has to sell five styles of bread at the regulated price.
What happens in such collapsing countries is that the black market flourishes. Goods that can be stored for longer, get bought up at the ridiculously low, state sanctioned price and either sold on the black market or stored away to be sold once price controls are gone. In Venezuela, washing machines … or flour are good stores of value compared to Bolívares Fuertes. But hording is a crime of course. (Yeah, socialism)

Sounds reasonable but isn't BIP39 good enough to stick with it while proposing a new BIP to overcome the short-comings? I prefer interoperability over "the best" if it's about such details.

Who won't know the value of the transaction?
I'm confused. In the original Zerocoin proposal there were transactions ZC -&gt; BC, BC -&gt; BC and BC -&gt; ZC. I understood the really expensive ones are the ZC -&gt; BC as here an expensive zero knowledge proof has to be validated but the output would go to normal BTC addresses, so … ah, I see. The implicit nature of the BTC fee is the problem. Well, then make it explicit for the ZC transaction. Make the first output of the ZC transaction go towards the coinbase transaction. As this is all hard-fork territory, I see no issue with adding such a rule.

Hi. Latest new dev at Mycelium here.
Are you in contact with Mycelium already? Where did you get the prior version from? Where the latest version? If the signatures don't match (one of them compiled from source for example) you can't update over a different signature but might get offered to replace "that other app" depending on your version of Android.
I just tried the update myself, installing from the website for the first time, as I didn't get it from the play store neither and it went smooth. The process looks a bit different but it explicitly read that no data will be lost. The play store and the website package are the same APK with the same signature, so I assume it should be fine from the play store, too, once it's found there.
Mycelium has a release process with quality testing and beta testers, so that you should never get offered a really bad update. So unless you manually uninstalled Mycelium, your data should still be there and Mycelium only asks to create a new wallet if there is no data, so the OP reads like the data was wiped.
Please contact info if you have further questions.
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:56:48
Right. Which is why you should care who is behind these servers. 8 are not signalling because 4 of them are my private ones I have been too lazy to switch. These are mostly irrelevant wallet-less full nodes. The other 4 are Mycelium's servers. These are the proxy for 135000 monthly active users. I suppose we will switch to UASF this week. If all wallets and exchanges are on board, node count is irrelevant.

There is no way to define any of the following on a blockchain level:
* Who is poor? (Many shout that people with a smartphone can't be really poor)
* What is a person? (This is more of an implementation problem but people receive social security for dead people even in the government run, centralized system.)
* What is food? (Do hamburgers count as food? Or more seriously, does diet food without calories count as food? How about gold nuggets "meant to be eaten", sold by the clever food venue that only wants the "poor" to convert their food-credits into something that retains a high re-sale value even if orally consumed once?)
Edit: With your skype-session you solve some of these problems but you would basically limit it to one-on-one relationships.

    $final_hash = hash('sha256', $user_agent.$server_seed);
    $final_binary = substr(decbin(ord($final_hash)), -1);
I see a deposit address that is probably created for me. Where can I verify the system was fair for others, in the past? How can I proof to others if it doesn't pay out? This is not provably fair.
Satoshi dice if I remember right worked as follows: The server had a list of `$server_seeds` and you could download the hashes of those. The `$final_binary` was `hash(transactionID + server_seed) % 2`. Every hour the past hour's server seed was revealed. The deposit address was always the same, so others could audit all past games.

I see this guy is promoting his product Rivetz since mid last year at least? I'd be interested to learn a bit more about Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Android and how Rivetz uses it. To me it sounds like TEE executes any code that is signed with the right key isolated from the rest of the OS. I wonder if devices that support this have some LED that indicates that the screen being shown is actually rendered by TEE and not by HeyIAmTee.apk. Also I would like to know what the extra hurdle is to get into TEE.
More specific to Rivetz, I'd like to know how this is meant to be integrated. To me it sounds like they would want Mycelium for example to leave the actual wallet to Rivetz and its TEE app, so the user would get a Rivetz screen to confirm signing of transactions, while the rest of the app that doesn't need private keys would work on the OS level?

ok. I threw your xpub at [blockchain.info]( and generated your first 1200 addresses and change addresses from the xpub and replaced those in the transaction history and that gave me bip44 conformity as to how I understand it. Unless you skipped more than 1200 addresses ;) (Edit: which blockchain most likely would not list, neither)
I do see though that the change chain is being used densely to 25 and then a jump to 41, with the address chain only going to 23 but no matter how one would read bip44, this should all be covered even if Mycelium only scanned "highest index on address chain + 20" on the change chain.
Or … not :( Looks like the culprit is [here](
Reading [BIP44]( again I now wonder how "Address gap limit is currently set to 20. If the software hits 20 unused addresses in a row, it expects there are no used addresses beyond this point and stops searching the address chain. We scan just the external chains, because internal chains receive only coins that come from the associated external chains." was meant. I could imagine situations in which you would want to skip addresses even on the internal chain but that's not BIP44 compliant.

I took the figure Tony Gallippi used when he compared peak performance of Bitcoin that he claimed to be 7tps while reality now shows 3tps. It doesn't matter if it's 20k or 45k. As said, 20K is a different league.
I sort of agree with some of your arguments. I would compare the hubs to mail providers and the dominance of gmail or US companies in that space is scary but privacy aware users can use alternatives and I see very good reasons why people would care more than with mail servers. A transaction channel hub is much less critical privacy wise than a mail provider. It doesn't need to know nothing about its users, can charge a fee and be run using apt-get install once we are there and all it can do bad is share transaction history or deny service.

Yes, Mycelium is bip39/bip44 compliant so you can recover your funds with any bip39/bip44 wallet.
bip39 is how the seed is generated from your 12 words and bip44 is how the actual addresses can be found based on that. Mycelium is just slightly non-compliant in that it allows you to create many accounts and if you don't use the second account for example, it's totally bip44 compliant to not "find" account 3 etc. You would have to "create" account 3 on such a wallet manually to find the respective transactions and funds.

It's one of bitcoin's most common topics and has been discussed here and on the forum over and over since about 5 years.
Essentially it boils down to being a slippery slope and we would open up to centralization if we decided to use black lists implemented in the standard wallet.
If you sell ice cream for bitcoin and end up holding some stolen coins, nobody will cause you trouble or even bother to ask where you got it from. If you sell a Tesla and it gets paid in full with stolen bitcoins, you will get asked. Same if you sell it with cash and the bills turn out to be from a bank robbery. If you can document what you have to document, which is nothing in the case of ice cream and eventually something in the case of the Tesla, you are good.

I know Electrum was the main driver of BIP39-like wallets and it could be the driver for improvements over BIP39. It's just a slight problem for Electrum users to rely on just one software to recover their backup, as just like with BIP39, Electrum is not compatible with the standard as a result of going beyond the standard.
Also I disagree with BIP39 being a trap the other wallets will never be able to leave behind. It would be trivial to test for wallets according to BIP39 and BIP39 v2 in parallel. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:15:47
Absolutely. The protocol will be open and most likely if the first to run it don't help others to start hubs, they will get a lot of hate but having a head-start in services around it (how do you fund the receiving channel?) will definitely make a lot of money.
One consideration is that those outgoing channels could be funded with other people's money again, so while one doesn't trust coinbase and wants a channel rather than a promise to receive coins, another could opt in to lend his funds that sit at coinbase to such channels. It would be a save scheme to invest in and coinbase could take its cut. Or they could just decide that it's so safe that they can just change their TOS such that a large cash out will be processed within days and abracadabra they can sell their customer's money to other customers in a very safe way.
This would result on people earning interests on their bitcoins while they are at an exchange.
Another thing to consider is that competition could run hubs that function as tumblers. Users using these hubs would get paid for using them, while others would pay them to tumble their coins. As the hub users don't have to trust the hub and the tumbler users already trust anonymous guys on the dark net, this hub could run on the dark net. Also very profitable even without jumping through AML/KYC hoops and loops.

@_date: 2015-02-27 17:03:33


Still, a structure that is used significantly more than once.


Again, an operation that took almost at the order of a second per block, now takes at the order of ms does sum up. Where are we now? Block 345000? Times 189ms? That's 18h you could save? ... ok, that's unlikely reasonable but assuming the blocks were that big since genesis, it probably would save you 18h of CPU time, right?

Well, the cost issues can be covered with prices. Who said that a zero coin transaction has to be for free or even cheap?

A naïve approach is to use the external chain's mandatory look-ahead of 20 addresses and apply it to the internal chain, too. Make the gap 21 and I bet Sentinel will also loose track. BIP44 does not mandate a look-ahead on the internal chain, assuming it to have no gaps. Equally BIP44 does not mandate on how to check how many accounts of the HD wallet are in use. If you create an "Account 2" in any BIP44 wallet, Mycelium only finds it if you "create" an "Account 2" on your restored wallet, too. I might be wrong but I guess copay would not find secondary accounts.

If you have no clue where to start, I'm almost certain, your wallet should not leave your private use as programming a wallet is dealing with other people's money which naturally attracts all the evil hackers you can think of.
Please get involved with an existing wallet and if for any reason you see limitations in it that you won't get fixed with the support of the team, fork and do it better. Alone, you will screw it up. Without a vision for something worth putting work into, you won't gather more eyes to look into stuff.

This can go under the radar and for free, as you would essentially pretend to be honest miner, reaping payouts from all pools, keeping pools balanced in the process to fake a healthy ecosystem.

If UASF stands against 99% of the miners, those can disrupt the UASF chain as they please. You can't win if there is 100 times more evil miners than good ones.
On the other hand, if there is as many evil as good miners, evil miners can either attack the "good" chain or mine the evil chain but not both. At 50% miner support, the non-supporting miners are no real threat.
I would agree with you if there was not the threat of non-UASF miners throwing their hashing power at UASF to disrupt like somebody once did with Coiledcoin ;)

If it's the former, don't bother pushing them. They will come back asking eventually.
If it's the latter, encourage them to read the [8 pages whitepaper]( The main things you need to learn to understand the whitepaper are that there is such a thing as cryptographic  hash functions and public key cryptography. Both these concepts can be explained in 5 minutes.

Your scheme still has single points of failure. If I understand it right, timelock protects against the loss of key1 but not key2 but worse, it is one provider's closed source solution. The user has no way of knowing if the app creates poor randomness for example.
Edit: BitKey has a github repository. It contains just one dmg file and a readme with a hash. What is the point of this? The hash even is using MD5, which is known to be obsolete but even if sha256 or sha3 was used, it wouldn't help anything, as the source is not verifiable as far as I can see.

So there are people paying fees to tumblers in order to disguise the history of their transactions. A tumbler provides this service at a 3% fee (this figure was what I saw when I last checked 2 years ago). If the tumbler now uses the funds to run a hub, he could offer negative fees for his hub (-1%) and still earn 2% and he would get actual traffic and not only coins that need tumbling. As a community we could also support this in order to hold up bitcoin's fungibility. (Yes, I want stolen funds to get back into circulation as the alternative is broken fungibility and government controlled white lists of coins that are allowed to be spent. May people better care for their belongings if they want to "be your own bank".)

"Surprising", "should be fast", ... I bet more than one developer does profile the performance.

I was not aware that Mycelium had this "most secure" claim, too and I suggested to change this to something more objective like "we work hard to provide the most secure", so I called them out without realizing I shouldn't have done so. I'm a dev, not a marketing guy and marketing guys seam to have a different understanding of marketing claims, so I can't make any promise and might ultimately just shut up about this.
Anyway, why do we support Mycelium for anything below Marshmallow? Cause Marshmallow currently has [13% market share]( and users who don't root their phones are usually very safe with lower versions, too. We have users that get scammed into voluntarily sending their coins, that lose money on rooted phones, that loose their backup but so far to my knowledge we have not a single of our +100k users that lost money that he wouldn't have lost had he used Marshmallow.
For those who want extra security, we have trustlet and hardware wallet support, we support cold wallet spending, where you can keep your money on for example 10 paper wallets and several levels of pin requirements configurable.
If we want to bank the unbanked, we can't require the latest Android or a hardware wallet but have to make it secure on what the people have and that's what we are doing.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:50:28


It is not. Payment providers do not have to accept zero conf on all transactions and BitPay doesn't neither. They could just recommend to use a certain fee level and then do their secret risk analysis and then either accept zero conf or wait for 2 confirmation like everybody else, too.


They have costs to consolidate outputs but not ridiculously high costs as they claim, just to make BTC look bad. Usually I pay less fee to pay my BitPay invoices than they force me to add to then reclaim my output cause yes, you can still pick the fee with them and ironically they even accept these payments with zero confirmations. Total clown show.


Sure. It's only about the UX that BitPay is not in the boat and has nothing to do with Jihan Wu.

* They push for BCH
* They force you to use a BIP70 compatible wallet with non-standard modifications
* They charge you a high fee if you don't use BCH (They basically claim that spending the UTXO you create, costs them $1 to spend, so they charge you $1 extra on your bill, even though they know very well how to not spend $1 when sending the funds on.)
* They are probably not integrating lightning network anytime soon, as part of their BCH shilling

Is there any implementation of this? I believe it's already very valuable without the signed/commitment part. Also I believe the 12GB estimate is wrong. My naive attempt at implementing something similar (just heard about this today) implies about a 3 GB index as of now. [My code]( creates 1.5GB of index files but so far only covers the outputs, not the inputs.
It's currently broken and I'm not actively searching the bug but I'm pretty sure the size estimate of about 3GB to be rather accurate. 3GB is manageable on a new smart phone. 80GB in general not.

Just like the tumblers. But for added anonymity you could choose to send money always via 3 hubs. My hub, intermediary hub, your hub. My hub doesn't need to know I'm sending to you. Even in a two hub scenario my hub wouldn't need to know to whom at your hub I'm sending.
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:35:34
It's a probabilistic process. There is no such thing as remaining time.
For simplicity what you are trying to achieve is 33 penny tosses in a row, all resulting in heads up. That happens once every 2^33 or 9billion tries. You are doing 500k tries per second so you would expect to be lucky once every 9billion/500k seconds. That is about 20k seconds or 6h. Should be doable. If you were not lucky after 3 days, you probably did something wrong.
Edit: As there is no caps numbers, my estimation might be a bit off. There are as the name [base58]( suggests 58 valid symbols, 50 of which are letters. I and O are both capital letters that are not allowed, which also goes against your task, so there are 24 valid capital letters in 58 total alphanumeric symbols. Using exact numbers and (58/24)^33 instead, I get to **100 days**. Damn.
Edit: Try rolling a vanitygen address without capital letters. That should be very doable in 2 minutes.

I think, Bitcoin will ultimately only stay fungible if we manage to integrate tumbling in the core clients. If people only tumble if they have "something to hide", Bitcoin can at any point turn into the mark of the beast with government approved wallets being the only money that will be accepted. I want to see Satoshi spend his money without having to worry about revealing his identity and I don't see that happen with CoinShuffle or CoinJoin. Sure, ZeroCoin would make it happen, if only ZeroCoin would work. With hubs as I envision them, sponsored by people needing a tumbler, Satoshi could easily swap any amount of bitcoins for different bitcoins. Ok, his hub would know but he could run a hub ... well, something along these lines.

Mycelium dev here.




This is to comply with [BIP44]( which mandates a gap limit of no more than 20 unused addresses. I see how this is annoying but in order to still be a BIP44 wallet, we would have to stop you from showing new addresses at some point. If you have a suggestion how to show more addresses, maybe cycling through those you showed days ago that never got used, once you reach the gap limit, [suggest it here, please](


This is true for all BIP44 wallets that run on Android below Marshmallow (and don't require you to type in the 12 words on every start). It sounds scary but it's actually pretty hard to recover keys. "Just rooting" is not true. You have to "just root, without wiping the data". Yes, a determined thief that is after your wallet in particular, might have his setup ready to snag your phone and steal your funds before you can recover your wallet from your 12 words and send the funds else where but to our knowledge this has not happened to any of our users so far. And many failed to recover their seed after breaking the screen or something.


I assure you, security is our top priority, too. And I believe we have a good track record of not screwing up.


I did not look into Breadwallet's HD scheme but at least bitcoin core chose to not support BIP44 because it is not as secure as what they chose. BIP44 mandates non-hardened keys at the address level, which leads to a non-obvious way of loosing money: Share your xpub (for accounting for example) and just one private key ("hey, the address is empty anyway") and you basically shared an xpriv. This is why Mycelium and other BIP44 wallets don't allow to easily export single addresses' private keys. But you see how it's not trivial to communicate the issue to a standard user.


~~In Mycelium you are lost if you fail to type in the correct pin for 3 times.~~ We have an opt-in option to reset your pin after 3 days (block count based). I assume Breadwallet also has some limit there?

Reported as spam. Sorry guys, there is 10 posts about this every day. Can't you keep it at once per day at least? Am I supposed to write a bot to share why this is a bad idea?
The Problem
* Users confuse custodial exchanges with wallets. "Not your keys, not your coins" did not get through to everybody yet and it is totally right.
* Users use custodial "wallets" aka bitcoin banks.
* Custodial services have issues that makes them end up being so-so-custodians. Bugs leak funds, hackers steal funds, owners exit-scam, operational costs get covered with user funds, one of the before gets claimed as excuse for another, ...
* As nobody knows how much the service has, the service can continue operating as long as withdrawals can be covered with the little funds that are left.
* Users don't know which custodial services actually have funds and which not.
The proposed solution
1. We pull all our funds from the custodial services.
1. The so-so-custodians get expelled from the community.
1. We put our funds back in to the actual custodians. (\*)
(\*) **If you hate my post because of this one line, then you don't get my point. I am all in favor of pulling out funds from custodial services. Pull your funds out of exchanges. Pull your funds out of stable coins!! But do so permanently. The proof-of-keys initiative is promoted differently though. It suggests to pull out all funds on the same day to test the custodians. That is the only aspect I am against, as it's both unrealistic to proof what it's out to proof and there are less disruptive methods of actually achieving this.**
Why the proposed solution is a bad idea
* Exit scams: Whoever is running a custodial service with the plan to exit-scam, will happily proof his reserves if it was on a clear up-trend before. They will follow the up-trend until the tide turns and pull the exit-scam then anyway.
* People who are less technically versed, don't want to be "their own bank" and prefer to keep their coins with those services.
* Traders: Day-traders will feel like Christmas with artificially chaos induced by such an event. The last thing they will do is to pull off their funds.
* Custodian wallet security: Custodial services have most funds in cold storage (Those who don't even claim that, are clearly incompetent or outright scammers). Moving all funds to hot wallets is when hackers will grab the funds if they already have sort of access now.
* Exchange staff: High stake withdrawals are green-lighted by very few employees in the company. You can't just go on mechanical-turk and staff up for some stupid proof-of-nothing event. Withdraws will take very much more than just a day and those who got served first, will have to hold their breath until the last withdrawal request got executed to not render the whole event even more pointless.
* Financial Backdoors: So even if after all the above, the service is short some bitcoins, they can borrow them. For a week. And promise fantastic interest.
A better solution
Encourage auditable accounting: Not saying the following is the best approach. Others did research on this but just for simplicity, a model of an exchange that I would much rather trust than an exchange that doesn't provide this feature: 
* Assign a 30 byte nonce to each account.
* Mail to all users to encourage participation come the date.
* At a certain time (January 3rd at noon GMT for example) take a snapshot of the user database.
* Publish a table with only these columns: hash(username + nonce) and balance in each currency.
* Find bitcoin addresses that cover the total of the bitcoins in the published table.
* Use these keys to sign the hash of the table.
* Mail all users with clear instructions on how to find the table, hash it and find their pseudonym, verify the signed message with publicly available tools.

There's a hundred ways to get scammed on localbitcoins and you chose the safest one. Congratulations.
Yes, scammers should get called out but if the deal took place outside localbitcoins, I can't even consider whatever name you posted a scammer, as maybe you're the scammer. Who knows? Where's the proof? Maybe you are black-mailing the guy.
Stick to only messaging through the platform and you get dispute resolution. Hop over to whatsapp and you don't.
For face to face trades, I see no benefit in paying localbitcoins a fee, as they cannot know if the cash changed hands. For everything else, pay the damn 1% and quit whining on reddit about your stupidity.

On chain transactions are not necessarily and automatically more private. Using transaction channel hubs can just as well be considered more private if done right, as the record of every payment is not publicly available.
Sure, a symmetric system where privacy doesn't depend on a hub sharing or not sharing its data is easier to grasp but a system where many hubs compete could also introduce privacy. A hub would need reserves for outgoing transactions and would charge a fee for lending out this money. Did you consider that this fee might even become negative as individuals would want to lend this money to the hubs to swap it for other money? This incentive could lead to a set of strong hubs that operate on the dark web out of any state's control but would still attract a lot of customers.

To use these sites offline is a totally overrated recommendation. It's much easier to sneak in poor randomness than it is to sneak in something that reports home all generated keys.

This is a terrible idea.
The Problem
* Users confuse custodial exchanges with wallets. "Not your keys, not your coins" did not get through to everybody yet and it is totally right.
* Users use custodial "wallets" aka bitcoin banks.
* Custodial services have issues that makes them end up being so-so-custodians. Bugs leak funds, hackers steal funds, owners exit-scam, operational costs get covered with user funds, one of the before gets claimed as excuse for another, ...
* As nobody knows how much the service has, the service can continue operating as long as withdrawals can be covered with the little funds that are left.
* Users don't know which custodial services actually have funds and which not.
The proposed solution
1. We pull all our funds from the custodial services.
1. The so-so-custodians get expelled from the community.
1. We put our funds back in to the actual custodians. (\*)
(\*) **If you hate my post because of this one line, then you don't get my point. I am all in favor of pulling out funds from custodial services. Pull your funds out of exchanges. Pull your funds out of stable coins!! But do so permanently. The proof-of-keys initiative is promoted differently though. It suggests to pull out all funds on the same day to test the custodians. That is the only aspect I am against, as it's both unrealistic to proof what it's out to proof and there are less disruptive methods of actually achieving this.**
Why the proposed solution is a bad idea
* Exit scams: Whoever is running a custodial service with the plan to exit-scam, will happily proof his reserves if it was on a clear up-trend before. They will follow the up-trend until the tide turns and pull the exit-scam then anyway.
* People who are less technically versed, don't want to be "their own bank" and prefer to keep their coins with those services.
* Traders: Day-traders will feel like Christmas with artificially chaos induced by such an event. The last thing they will do is to pull off their funds.
* Custodian wallet security: Custodial services have most funds in cold storage (Those who don't even claim that, are clearly incompetent or outright scammers). Moving all funds to hot wallets is when hackers will grab the funds if they already have sort of access now.
* Exchange staff: High stake withdrawals are green-lighted by very few employees in the company. You can't just go on mechanical-turk and staff up for some stupid proof-of-nothing event. Withdraws will take very much more than just a day and those who got served first, will have to hold their breath until the last withdrawal request got executed to not render the whole event even more pointless.
* Financial Backdoors: So even if after all the above, the service is short some bitcoins, they can borrow them. For a week. And promise fantastic interest.
A better solution
Encourage auditable accounting: Not saying the following is the best approach. Others did research on this but just for simplicity, a model of an exchange that I would much rather trust than an exchange that doesn't provide this feature: 
* Assign a 30 byte nonce to each account.
* Mail to all users to encourage participation come the date.
* At a certain time (January 3rd at noon GMT for example) take a snapshot of the user database.
* Publish a table with only these columns: hash(username + nonce) and balance in each currency.
* Find bitcoin addresses that cover the total of the bitcoins in the published table.
* Use these keys to sign the hash of the table.
* Mail all users with clear instructions on how to find the table, hash it and find their pseudonym, verify the signed message with publicly available tools.

No, the receiving wallet probably would show unconfirmed transactions. To me it sounds more like coinbase has some transaction batching going on, where they only send transactions out every now and then. Or they pay out using RBF in which case it's fair to not show the transaction at all but in which case a "decline" button would also make sense.

Hi. Yes. We had to do something along the line of what you describe here but I guess you got something wrong. We had considered to silently fix it but as the fix would either require your money (dust) being sent to some of your addresses or your privacy in form of these addresses being shared with us so we can send money there for you, we decided to inform you of the unfortunate issue so you can fix it yourself to avoid doing either of these potentially unwanted things.
This issue only affected very few people - probably one in 1000 - that managed to create hd accounts without transactions. This is against BIP44 and can lead to your funds "misteriously disappearing" when you restore from a backup, until you receive money to these gap accounts.

I'm pretty much a bitcoin maximalist but don't approve of religious dogma. I bought my first alt-coin months ago but would have said the same a year ago, too: Please don't make Bitcoin a cult. Keep an open mind and reason why not to buy a certain alt if your friend tries to convince you it's the next big thing. If that thing really is better in all ways you and he can come up with, you still have the network-effect wildcard but if that doesn't convince him, let him learn his lesson - or learn a lesson yourself. New things come and almost always they are fads but not always. Bitcoin is hopefully proving this and so will other things in your life.

It's a trusted custodian of way too many bitcoins. Provided people tip amounts that matter (and no, tipping 1sat does not matter and is worse spam than sending a simple "I agree"), the bot controls funds that matter of many people. Such a bot pulling an exit-scam would do more harm than all the good it might have done before, especially as this bot in particular only works in r/bitcoin, so it's not introducing new people to anything.

The more recent return to bitcoin's "normal" volatility can be attributed to the block halving I guess. 
* At the halving, rewards for mining drops by half
* We don't know how many miners will stop mining with half a reward only
* With a serious share of miners stopping to mine, the block size debate will boil up
* Things can get hectic with new FUD about China forking the chain probably already being made up and ready to be "revealed"
* If that drives the price down, more miners will "temporary" pause their rigs, making the situation worse
or … 
* the price goes up x2 and saves the day as no miner will switch off their rig, which seamed kind of almost likely just some days ago.
So there is just two competing, dramatically different scenarios that can reinforce themselves, and maybe some manipulators that try to push the price into either of those trajectories. Speculators, even if they believe in the long term success might pull fiat out, betting on some cheap coins towards the end of the week.

@_date: 2017-06-07 01:26:33
I guess as this thread shows, the best course of action in a case like this would be a transaction that sends (almost) all to the miner. Make the miner escrow to your money and then sort out who's right or wrong. Else you might just as well be the scammer. Sure, the miners could just grab the money but there were cases before where they didn't and you might want to reward them for their cooperation but how are strangers to judge if the second transaction is more right than the first?

I think Patreon offered added value and I would support any alternative that took an open approach:
* Allow your content producers to receive tips in whatever alternative ways they choose.
* Encourage direct donations by supporting Bitcoin and lightning network for the supporters even those that are not registered.
* Encourage direct support by allowing producers to replace the platform-provided bitcoin receiving address with their own (single address or xpub) or even their own lightning node.
The platform could still manage the custodial services of distributing funds at the end of the month, taking a cut for their "service" for the millions of sheeples while allowing those who know how, to skip the custodian and its fees.
Such a platform would be under constant pressure by investors to cut the direct options but if marketed as the artists' platform I guess it could very well compete with those more oppressive players even on the profit side.

Nope. Even if SegWit and LN already were a thing today and blocks were 2MB we wouldn't have enough capacity for Venezuela to switch to full-on Bitcoin. 32 million people would have to open and close channels at least once per year. That is 64 million transactions per year. That is 2tps for Venezuela alone, with a ~~10~~ 18tps capacity. If Venezuela would take such a step, you can bet on the already existing volume of 4tps to easily double. (7tps is the theoretical maximum that we usually don't get)
Edit: There is many "if"s. I had to correct the capacity upwards, which kind of makes it look feasible but I don't see how functioning LN would not cause the biggest hype around bitcoin ever, with an easy x10 in demand for first time bitcoiners. We are still at the low double digit millions of user. Global penetration is less than 1% to have ever transacted in bitcoin.

This should be the top concern. NYKNYB. Just because this tip bot accepts lightning, people flock to it? A tip bot should be agnostic to how you get in or out in the sense that it should allow you to use on-chain, lightning, alt-coins, ..., charging a realistic fee for each of these. The LN fee being the lowest would proof a point but to call it the lntip bot to me is hand-waving over the fact that people still use it as a custodian to their money and should think twice if they would lend money to that random guy on the internet.
To the "don't put in more than you are willing to lose then"-replies: It's not only about me losing $1 or $2. If I tip people using this bot, I endorse it and if the bot then "gets hacked" aka "pulls an exit scam", I'm complicit in the obvious outcome of this experiment, cause after the scam only those who saw it coming from the start will get heard.

As responsible disclosure is thrown around here a lot, may I explain a bit?
* Sharing vulnerabilities is illegal in many countries.
* Searching vulnerabilities is illegal in many countries.
* Owning tools commonly used to search for vulnerabilities is illegal in many countries. Some limit these tools to licensed security researchers.
* Bounty programs often come with a catch: You enter a contract, which puts you under more rules than you otherwise would be.
Not all companies have bounty programs. That doesn't mean that you will not get rewarded for responsible disclosure. And not all rewards are in cash. Doing the right thing can get you creds as security expert, so if you don't get that 5figure reward, maybe you get that 5figure job instead.
When you find a bug and decide to do responsible disclosure, you approach the company and state so, get a pgp key and hand over all the stuff. You do not negotiate a price up-front. If you do, the company will assume you are a scammer and if you still try that route, you better keep anonymous as else you get trouble for black-mailing and all the other illegal things I mentioned above.
Now the ball is with the company. You might help fix the bug but basically you wait for them to fix their stuff.
Now, if they don't fix it, you might have a deadline they defined themselves but normally not. They will inevitably react slower than you had hoped for, you might tease them if you see fit but you will not disclose stuff without being very sure about the consequences.
Only after a fix is published and rolled out sufficiently by the company's standards, the company will give you credit and allow the disclosure of how you found the bug.
If this doesn't happen within a reasonable timeframe, you may disclose the issue even without the company's permission but then the company might sue you. They have a strong incentive to not sue you though, as they have little to gain from this. It doesn't help them get people into their bounty program and chances are high that nothing will come from suing somebody who responsibly disclosed an issue and waited months before going public.
The bounty has a similar dynamic: If the company pays too little, people will be less likely to enter the bounty program.
Trust is the number one thing both sides need for the whole process to be beneficial for everybody but both sides can play it rougher at the expense of future interactions. The bug-finder wants to be known as a security expert, not an impulsive hacker. The company wants to be known as reliable in protecting the users, no for suing security researchers.

No. You can very well design exchanges such that they can match buyers with sellers but cannot arbitrarily control your bitcoins. Especially with Lightning network and for pure crypto exchanges that will be the model in the future: Non-custodial exchanges.
In the meantime you can design schemes to audit exchanges that don't require trust in anybody. Trade-offs are then usually that either you open all the books (exchange and traders usually don't like that for privacy) or you use fancy cryptography (hard to do but most likely possible such that every user can verify that the total and his balance is accounted for, without any two users assuming to own the same asset, without revealing names or total amounts) or (this is an or. you took it as that's the only way.) you use a trusted auditor.


So you want to "trust no one?" Suppose OP manages to start a mass-hysteria to actually pull through with the plan. Further suppose that **all** exchanges are short 2% of the bitcoin holdings. According to the plan, all would go out of business. Do you really think that is what would happen? What would happen is that by far more than 2% of the funds wouldn't join the cause but much rather have their funds ready to manipulate the artificially thin yet turbulent market. But ok, for sake of argument lets assume all traders are stupid enough to join this. Even if the exchanges had not expected this to happen, they would rush to provide the funds to get out of this stress test before the others. They would have days to claim to have backlogs from withdraw verification and they could take short term credits at fantastic interest rates to cover for any liquidity issues, as it's for only a few days. A whole eco system disrupted to learn exactly nothing.

I don't agree with the focus on miners. Yes, futures contracts are classic tool to hedge positions. You need steel for your car factory? You buy futures (long) if you want to lock in today's price. You produce corn and want to insure it's worth your hassle, even if that insurance costs a small fee? You buy corn futures (short).
Still there are other actors that don't use futures as insurance but as a tool to bet on the price. Especially to bet on a down-trend, there is little alternative to buying shorts.

Transaction channels are off chain mostly but inherently need two transactions on chain to enable millions of transactions off chain.
changetip works as bitcoin only service but their internal book keeping is similar to expedia that also accepts bitcoin but doesn't cash out bitcoin. Poker sites might cash it out but do accounting in $$.
All that is off chain by definition and doing on chain transactions for internal book keeping is stupid.

For example if the best guess about the exact second of the politician's death is the winner-takes-all ticket, then the assassin could make his guess long before anybody else would be aware of what's about to happen. Some sugar is needed to make this work but if every guess costs $100 and covers a 6h range and only the first to grab any 6h span is counted, you could bet a million for this to never happen and leave it to others to make better guesses.
Obviously body guards would have an eye on that public data, too and the politician would know how much his opponent's value his death, which makes it easier to justify and adapt security measures. The politician could even run a counter-bet of 2 million USD that the assassin himself would survive (so others have an incentive to bet they won't and grab the reward if they were right) or all kinds of complicated bets on top of that.
This is pretty dark stuff to think through but I heard that real assassins don't work like that and neither do those who want to kill somebody, exactly because it's not anonymous enough. Better get some bag in a back ally.

Did you read my "A better solution" part?


What do you mean by that? Send to an address under the user's control as the proof-of-keys project suggests or would you be happy to see the custodians show you your bitcoin without sending them out? The problem with the former I laid out above. The problem with the latter as an alternative to my "better solution" is that you cannot know if the custodian is showing the same bitcoins to different people. My approach is designed to leave no room for the custodian to not account for certain balances, as they cannot know in advance, who will check their part and who won't.

Yeah, it's not a zero sum game and thus I know I may praise bitpay and copay without hurting Mycelium but with certain other wallets I have to raise my concerns. If Samurai wallet claims to be the most stealthy, while in the background it just uses the blockchain.info api, I can't help but say something. And same with wallets that have as their major claim to be the most secure wallet available when there is no grounds to that claim. Had they advertised their wallet as most easy to use, secure wallet, I would have no problem giving them all the praise they want. At Mycelium we sent many users their way while our iPhone wallet was discontinued.

This is a terrible idea.
The Problem
* Users confuse custodial exchanges with wallets. "Not your keys, not your coins" did not get through to everybody yet and it is totally right.
* Users use custodial "wallets" aka bitcoin banks.
* Custodial services have issues that makes them end up being so-so-custodians. Bugs leak funds, hackers steal funds, owners exit-scam, operational costs get covered with user funds, one of the before gets claimed as excuse for another, ...
* As nobody knows how much the service has, the service can continue operating as long as withdrawals can be covered with the little funds that are left.
* Users don't know which custodial services actually have funds and which not.
The proposed solution
1. We pull all our funds from the custodial services.
1. The so-so-custodians get expelled from the community.
1. We put our funds back in to the actual custodians. (\*)
(\*) **If you hate my post because of this one line, then you don't get my point. I am all in favor of pulling out funds from custodial services. Pull your funds out of exchanges. Pull your funds out of stable coins!! But do so permanently. The proof-of-keys initiative is promoted differently though. It suggests to pull out all funds on the same day to test the custodians. That is the only aspect I am against, as it's both unrealistic to proof what it's out to proof and there are less disruptive methods of actually achieving this.**
Why the proposed solution is a bad idea
* Exit scams: Whoever is running a custodial service with the plan to exit-scam, will happily proof his reserves if it was on a clear up-trend before. They will follow the up-trend until the tide turns and pull the exit-scam then anyway.
* People who are less technically versed, don't want to be "their own bank" and prefer to keep their coins with those services.
* Traders: Day-traders will feel like Christmas with artificially chaos induced by such an event. The last thing they will do is to pull off their funds.
* Custodian wallet security: Custodial services have most funds in cold storage (Those who don't even claim that, are clearly incompetent or outright scammers). Moving all funds to hot wallets is when hackers will grab the funds if they already have sort of access now.
* Exchange staff: High stake withdrawals are green-lighted by very few employees in the company. You can't just go on mechanical-turk and staff up for some stupid proof-of-nothing event. Withdraws will take very much more than just a day and those who got served first, will have to hold their breath until the last withdrawal request got executed to not render the whole event even more pointless.
* Financial Backdoors: So even if after all the above, the service is short some bitcoins, they can borrow them. For a week. And promise fantastic interest.
A better solution
Encourage auditable accounting: Not saying the following is the best approach. Others did research on this but just for simplicity, a model of an exchange that I would much rather trust than an exchange that doesn't provide this feature: 
* Assign a 30 byte nonce to each account.
* Mail to all users to encourage participation come the date.
* At a certain time (January 3rd at noon GMT for example) take a snapshot of the user database.
* Publish a table with only these columns: hash(username + nonce) and balance in each currency.
* Find bitcoin addresses that cover the total of the bitcoins in the published table.
* Use these keys to sign the hash of the table.
* Mail all users with clear instructions on how to find the table, hash it and find their pseudonym, verify the signed message with publicly available tools.

No, I don't expect anybody to leave anything on exchanges. Exchanges are not wallets. They are exchanges.
If you want to know if an exchange is solvent, figure it out by less disruptive means cause the way OP calls for puts at risk what normally should be in very cold storage. Also whales won't like to not trade on a disruptive day like the one OP wishes for, so at least some whales will not be on board with the whole idea.

Fair enough but that is not how the first iteration will work. As far as I have seen, the first iteration is limited to some 0.1BTC to test the waters and people might want to close out only to know they can. Also there is the potential of big hubs trying to steal, under which circumstances you would better have some head room for sudden closing demand.

I'm fine with whatever details. As I said, I don't know the state-of-the-art in proof-of-reserve but gave a simple, workable example of a good-enough protocol that I would totally support.
You commented on the size of the nonce, which is ridiculously huge at 30 bytes if you use the right hash algorithm. I left the hash algorithm undefined on purpose. Just tried to give a run-down of something that would achieve more and be easier to implement than the initiative promoted by OP.

You don't have to trust Mycelium. That's the whole point of a hardware wallet. The keys never leave the device and you confirm the transactions in a way that Mycelium would not be able to do on its own.
On the other hand, if your Ledger gets a bad update, this update might be designed to be plugged in to a PC to leak the keys somehow rather than for the Mycelium users or the reverse or both but hardware wallets attempt to be single purpose devices that don't allow access to private keys or free signatures without user approval.

If BIP148 ends up with moderate support but high enough to not loose all its miners until the first retarget, then BIP148 can do a lot of damage to Bitcoin. Imagine some 15% splitting off and months later still keeping, with segwit also activating on legacy bitcoin. What a mess that would be.
BIP148 is a game of chicken (I didn't invent that analogy but I think it's quite accurate). Maybe BIP148 leads to segwit activation before August 1st, only to avoid the harm that it would do if we went into a contentious split but if BIP148 has less than 50% support after August 1st, we can only hope to see it go away or somehow win asap. Two chains is the worst of all outcomes.

Uhm, not. Negative energy prices are nothing new and not a result of market distortion. Or if in this case they are, there is no reason for electricity prices having to be always positive in a free market neither. It is simply cheaper for a nuclear power plant to pay for very short term consumption of their over capacity than to have the regulated by essentially burning the over capacity on cite. Storage power plants can ease those fluctuations and solar and wind power make them worse but there is no inherent magic in a free market that would guarantee positive prices at all time.

* Mail to all users to encourage participation come the date.
* At a certain time (January 3rd at noon GMT for example) take a snapshot of the user database.
* Publish a table with only these columns: hash(username + nonce) and balance in each currency.
* Find bitcoin addresses that cover the total of the bitcoins in the published table.
* Use these keys to sign the hash of the table.
* Mail all users with clear instructions on how to find the table, hash it and find their pseudonym, verify the signed message with publicly available tools.

I'm Android developer and not very familiar with iPhone. On Android you can get the app's binary from your phone and at least in the case of Mycelium, you can reproduce it from our public source code and the diff should only be the signature that the user obviously should not be able to reproduce. Is that not possible on iPhone?
On the code review issue: Yes, copay got burned from a third party library and gets a beating for using the insecure npm repository but I think it's not fair to put the blame on npm, only. This can happen in Java and other ecosystems, too. This is why we need orders of magnitude more code review. Giving up and going closed source can not be the answer.

Connecting to the Mycelium servers has a very different set of issues/advantages than to connect to full nodes. I would claim that our users have better privacy as they don't share their wallet with random full nodes all the time, half of which are run by chainalysis. SPV wallets can also get eclipsed, so where Mycelium users might run into a hacked Mycelium server that could fool them into believing false balances and confirmation status of transactions, SPV wallets can be eclipsed and made to believe that transaction A was broadcast, while transaction B actually was.
It's all trade-offs and I don't claim that Mycelium is the most secure of all wallets as we still have no deterministic builds which I assume is true for breadwallet, too (yeah, the publish-key-holder can push whatever to the play store) and we also should have better isolation for our modules and, yes, we want to connect to the bitcoin network as SPV wallets, too but we are working on that and I promise we will not claim to be the most secure wallet even once these things are done. It's deceptive advertisement what breadwallet is doing and I would appreciate if they would stop that or at least the bitcoin community at large would see it as what it is.

These questions I would not ask before gifting bitcoin. I gifted sub $50 in bitcoins for baby showers and usually pitch it as a lottery ticket: If the kid knows what bitcoin is by the time he's 12, he probably won big time. If not, throw away the paper wallet but not before he's 12.
The questions ... gnah, fix the typos please, it's mnemonic and has nothing to do with pneumonia ... I would consider them if your friends/family came to ask how to put substantial amounts into bitcoin, not for a gift.

The $120 are completely irrelevant to the fee. You might even experience a $20 fee for sending $0.1 while other users of the same wallet send millions for $1.

No. We use multi-signature schemes and yes, some people will use custodial services.
For example: Create a wallet controlled by your phone, your laptop and your spouse's phone with 2-of-3 multisig. If one of these get stolen, you can still recover.
Or have a company hold one key and one on paper as a last resort. The company can co-sign stuff and enforce previously defined rules, like daily limits without second factor confirmation, limits with email confirmation codes, hard limits that can be changed with 3 days of notice, ...
Or have a company hold 2 of the 3 keys, one of which they keep offline on paper. Now when you do transactions, the company will co-sign your transactions as above but can't lose your funds due to a hack. They could still exit-scam you as they have full control over your funds if they use both of those keys but they cannot do fractional reserve banking or accidentally lose your money aka get hacked.

This is a terrible idea.
The Problem
* Users confuse custodial exchanges with wallets. "Not your keys, not your coins" did not get through to everybody yet and it is totally right.
* Users use custodial "wallets" aka bitcoin banks.
* Custodial services have issues that makes them end up being so-so-custodians. Bugs leak funds, hackers steal funds, owners exit-scam, operational costs get covered with user funds, one of the before gets claimed as excuse for another, ...
* As nobody knows how much the service has, the service can continue operating as long as withdrawals can be covered with the little funds that are left.
* Users don't know which custodial services actually have funds and which not.
The proposed solution
1. We pull all our funds from the custodial services.
1. The so-so-custodians get expelled from the community.
1. We put our funds back in to the actual custodians. (\*)
(\*) **If you hate my post because of this one line, then you don't get my point. I am all in favor of pulling out funds from custodial services. Pull your funds out of exchanges. Pull your funds out of stable coins!! But do so permanently. The proof-of-keys initiative is promoted differently though. It suggests to pull out all funds on the same day to test the custodians. That is the only aspect I am against, as it's both unrealistic to proof what it's out to proof and there are less disruptive methods of actually achieving this.**
Why the proposed solution is a bad idea
* Exit scams: Whoever is running a custodial service with the plan to exit-scam, will happily proof his reserves if it was on a clear up-trend before. They will follow the up-trend until the tide turns and pull the exit-scam then anyway.
* People who are less technically versed, don't want to be "their own bank" and prefer to keep their coins with those services.
* Traders: Day-traders will feel like Christmas with artificially chaos induced by such an event. The last thing they will do is to pull off their funds.
* Custodian wallet security: Custodial services have most funds in cold storage (Those who don't even claim that, are clearly incompetent or outright scammers). Moving all funds to hot wallets is when hackers will grab the funds if they already have sort of access now.
* Exchange staff: High stake withdrawals are green-lighted by very few employees in the company. You can't just go on mechanical-turk and staff up for some stupid proof-of-nothing event. Withdraws will take very much more than just a day and those who got served first, will have to hold their breath until the last withdrawal request got executed to not render the whole event even more pointless.
* Financial Backdoors: So even if after all the above, the service is short some bitcoins, they can borrow them. For a week. And promise fantastic interest.
A better solution

You do know that Coinbase and others did halt registrations because the queue to on-board people was weeks long? They said "stop throwing money at us, we can't handle the volume with the staff we have". What do you think what  happens if now all these people they on-boarded over years, hit that withdraw-all button all at once? **Do you really believe (please just answer this one) any of the big services would process all these requests in a single day?** No way they would. They have 95% in cold storage and have to manually approve any reasonably big withdrawal.
* Yes, pull funds from services that you are only using as bitcoin banks right now.
* Yes, avoid custodial services if possible.
* Yes, support the creation of non-custodial alternatives. Try out bisq. Try out atomic swaps.
* Yes, prefer services that are more transparent over those that aren't.
* USDT **is** a custodian. Holding your USDT in your own wallet does nothing in terms of auditing its backing. If the project was honest, it would first and foremost promote sell all USDT and other stable coins to test if these coins actually work, too.
I am on board with the goals of the project but the means don't achieve the claimed goals and there are better alternatives.

An argument in favor of Casa's approach for hardware wallets is that if you never make a backup, you can know for sure that nobody took your keys with one simple test: Is the hardware wallet still in your possession? If it is, nobody else has the keys.
Cool. But if I don't have a backup, I can lose my funds in a fire or from simple hardware wallet rot. So I need multi signature. 3 of 5 for example. And a very solid protocol to test if all my 5 keys still work, so I can rotate to new keys if they don't.
So for this kind of "simplicity", I need cheap hardware wallets from more than one provider, which calls for a protocol standard.

This sort of leaks can be prevented by open source and verifiable builds and third parties actually checking things.
1. Somebody has to review code
2. They have to share the exact revision used for the binary
3. They have to provide how to deterministically build the binary
4. Somebody has to reproduce the build
5. Now somebody can confirm the binary matches the reviewed code
This verified binary can safely be installed.

Ok. Bought a ColdCard but I will probably not put any significant amount on it for a while.
The reasons why I will not trust it:
* Secrecy about the makers. The stakes are high and there has to be a cost to pulling an exit scam.
* No passphrase with your bip39? Absent a passphrase there is no protection against a faulty RNG. Many discuss that 100% offline solutions can't possibly leak your keys but if the keys are poorly generated in the first place, the attacker can have full control over all the keys all the time and pull the exit scam once the balance of all known wallets starts dropping for good. (If I can define the seed myself aka diceware, I will most likely trust the device more.)
* OpenDime: The OpenDime is highly insecure and worse than a paper wallet when it comes to redeeming it. Any software on your computer can read whatever usb stick you connect. If I understand it right, the private key would be there in plain text, ready to be read by whatever software. They should probably give the ColdCard a USB host feature, where you can redeem OpenDimes into the ColdCard secure element somehow.
That said, if the ColdCard is completely open source, I would love to see Trezor to pick up some ideas from there. Transparent case. Secure element with direct contact to some UI (LED). Sound like good ideas.

If it has more than 51%, the legacy chain will reorg into it all the time. That's the point. If it has above some 30% or 40% people might give it a chance to ultimately win. If it has less than that, people might give up August 1st. It's game of chicken if we really do this with less than 50% as it would be highly disruptive. Bitcoin would split in two, legacy would have to add some reorg protection in the hard-fork and the urgency of this could turn out hectic and disruptive again, with people again picking sides, ...
If UASF does not have at least 50% support by August 1st, it could only win if we get some solid proof of malicious intentions of the non-signalling miners. Some leak of state actors sponsoring it would be an example. Not saying that that is what's going on but with boths sides just being gut feeling kind of "better", there is no chance a minority UASF would win ultimately if it starts off with some 10% for example.

Ideally, each exchange would share some data that proofs their control of amount x of bitcoin and amount y of fiat and a list of user balances this is comprised of. The users need to be anonymized but with a way that every user can check if his balance is accounted for. Ideally this would even work without revealing the total balance.
The fiat side would obviously need an auditor. The Bitcoin side could be done by the exchange itself.


Well, then it's not trusted.
Having some auditors would be a big plus vs. an exchange having no audits at all. And if customers cared, they would have to compete about their transparency and improve it step by step. Problem is, customers don't care.
Your suggestion assumes that at least 85% of the funds would be in on your auditing. Let me assure you they are not. And you know how devastating a lack of 15% of the funds would be, once the bitcoin goes up another 10x.

somehow reddit is glitchy. Your reply is not visible to me in the thread, so I reply to my own post here:
You can't claim to have the most secure wallet just because you did one thing better than others. I would challenge that claim, too but for sake of argument lets assume your wallet is the only one to do one important thing right. This is not enough to claim to be the most secure wallet. It's like claiming my safe deposit boxes are the most secure ones on the market because I'm the only one to build titanium boxes. If the lock is less secure it's completely irrelevant that my material is superior. Security is measured by the weakest link and limiting your wallet to Android 6 is no magic bullet to make it the most secure wallet.

There are whales that do day trading and they will keep their coins there for busy days where artificial disruption might cause some price action. And that's ok. The  only reasonable goal of the project can be to teach people to not mistake custodial services for wallets.

Litecoin is not a sidechain to bitcoin just because two users agreed on a value for an atomic swap once.
Sidechains to Bitcoin are characterized by using tokens that can always be exchanged for bitcoins at a pre-defined rate, essentially allowing to leave the bitcoin blockchain with your 3mBTC, do whatever you wanted to do on that sidechain and once you are done, you can get your 3mBTC back (minus fees but never +- volatility).

So bitcoinwireless asked me to pay 0.2355Ƀ for my 2000CLP bill.
According to Google, $1 = 472.2CLP
2000CLP = $4.24
$4.24 / 0.2355Ƀ = 17.99 $/Ƀ
That means I got about $18/Ƀ. I wonder how that is no fees. Or do I wonder how I came to the conclusion it was fee free? If google got the rates right, I paid (21.17/17.99=1.18) 18% in fees.

If you are afraid of a scenario where many double-sha256 miners decide that attacking bitcoin is more profitable that to protect bitcoin, then adding good miners can be worth while. Relying on the nuclear option to change the POW algo is not what I would feel comfortable with. Sure, we might be able to make bitcoin survive but we are in a highly adversarial domain and it's hard to get many people in line if it would come to this. Better vote with your miner and counter questionable miners with your own hardware.

My understanding was that chain pruning was that in local storage all *addresses* that hold a zero balance would be forgotten to free up disc space but … in Bitcoin, you don't spend from addresses but from prior incoming transactions, so I guess pruning means that the transactions that already were spent in future transactions are to be forgotten which would be consistent with your answer, right?
Pruning thus is no protocol change but only a client change?
Mike, do you have a good source on why in Bitcoin you don't spend from addresses but rather from prior transactions? Never thought much about it and now that I do, it makes sense as else the ordering of transactions would be essential but I guess it is one of the most common misconceptions about the protocol.

Even if Bitcoin was an invention by the central banks, it would be better than fiat, as it can not be inflated. Even if they had 50% of all bitcoins. The US federal reserve inflated the money supply by 100% in just 30 years. All the money that existed 30 years ago is less than what the fed spent since then. With Bitcoin that kind of spending could only work for 15 years if they had 50% of all bitcoins and fiat was replaced by it.

Wait, something doesn't compute here. Correct me if I'm wrong:
* OpenNode the company was offered 1.25 million USD by Roger Ver if they add bcash along with bitcoin as payment option?
* OpenNode is a payment processor much like bitpay and coinbase but ... much smaller?
I assume the offer would involve additional conditions like bcash may not be presented as an inferior option and if you take the money you may not talk about having taken any money? Or are you some early adopter so millions mean nothing to you? Why not simply take the money, tell the story, add the shitcoin for some months or whatever it takes and then remove it on customer pressure and fund some open source development for the lightning network with the funds.

from another thread, after explaining that lower fees need rbf first cause stuck transactions are a support nightmare: i agree but I'm afraid of opening that box. With rbf I can not rely on change outputs to be spendable. If you spend your only one big utxo on a low prio transaction to then put a high prio tx on top, currently you get warned that there are unconfirmed inputs and the wallet stupidly sets the high prio rate for only the new tx. You confirm. The mix of low followed by high prio gets confirmed somehow and you see your 2txs. With rbf the first tx would get an update, lifting both to high prio as only that way you can get high prio on the second tx. Or we replace by a final tx paying the second bill and chain it with a new rbf for the first? Oh and the transaction history also needs a way to show multiple payments in one tx. Of course people will want not only a bump feature but also an undo-button. Of course that will be a PR nightmare together with the bitpays not instantly accepting transactions that depend on rbf. And then there is the correct handling of one version getting confirmed after broadcasting a replacement transaction. The intent of the now invalid transaction needs to be preserved, the user notified and enabled to seamlessly authorize a new transaction, maybe to be signed with his hardware wallet.

Proof of keys made it into the r/bitcoin front page every day, multiple times on many days and the initiators still promote this as some event where we test the liquidity the big custodians, to return to business as usual afterwards. Something like "lets pull all our bitcoins at 3pm and put them back at 4pm" and the following "rant" is against that and only that.
I **fully support to not use custodian services** where there are non-custodian alternatives and for wallets there is plenty and for exchanges, the alternatives are there, too and deserve more attention and liquidity.
The Problem
* Users confuse custodial exchanges with wallets. "Not your keys, not your coins" did not get through to everybody yet and it is totally right.
* Users use custodial "wallets" aka bitcoin banks.
* Custodial services have issues that makes them end up being so-so-custodians. Bugs leak funds, hackers steal funds, owners exit-scam, operational costs get covered with user funds, one of the before gets claimed as excuse for another, ...
* As nobody knows how much the service has, the service can continue operating as long as withdrawals can be covered with the little funds that are left.
* Users don't know which custodial services actually have funds and which not.
The proposed solution
1. We pull all our funds from the custodial services.
1. The so-so-custodians get expelled from the community.
1. We put our funds back in to the actual custodians. (\*)
(\*) **If you hate my post because of this one line, then you don't get my point. I am all in favor of pulling out funds from custodial services. Pull your funds out of exchanges. Pull your funds out of stable coins!! But do so permanently. The proof-of-keys initiative is promoted differently though. It suggests to pull out all funds on the same day to test the custodians. That is the only aspect I am against, as it's both unrealistic to proof what it's out to proof and there are less disruptive methods of actually achieving this.**
Why the proposed solution is a bad idea
* Exit scams: Whoever is running a custodial service with the plan to exit-scam, will happily proof his reserves if it was on a clear up-trend before. They will follow the up-trend until the tide turns and pull the exit-scam then anyway.
* People who are less technically versed, don't want to be "their own bank" and prefer to keep their coins with those services.
* Traders: Day-traders will feel like Christmas with artificially chaos induced by such an event. The last thing they will do is to pull off their funds.
* Custodian wallet security: Custodial services have most funds in cold storage (Those who don't even claim that, are clearly incompetent or outright scammers). Moving all funds to hot wallets is when hackers will grab the funds if they already have sort of access now.
* Exchange staff: High stake withdrawals are green-lighted by very few employees in the company. You can't just go on mechanical-turk and staff up for some stupid proof-of-nothing event. Withdraws will take very much more than just a day and those who got served first, will have to hold their breath until the last withdrawal request got executed to not render the whole event even more pointless.
* Financial Backdoors: So even if after all the above, the service is short some bitcoins, they can borrow them. For a week. And promise fantastic interest. They even have the **fiat collateral** as the initiative is targeted at at "bitcoin and all the other cryptos" but not at your fiat.
A better solution
Encourage auditable accounting: Not saying the following is the best approach. Others did research on this but just for simplicity, a model of an exchange that I would much rather trust than an exchange that doesn't provide this feature: 
* Assign a 30 byte nonce to each account.
* Mail to all users to encourage participation come the date.
* At a certain time (January 3rd at noon GMT for example) take a snapshot of the user database.
* Publish a table with only these columns: hash(username + nonce) and balance in each currency.
* Find bitcoin addresses that cover the total of the bitcoins in the published table.
* Use these keys to sign the hash of the table.
* Mail all users with clear instructions on how to find the table, hash it and find their pseudonym, verify the signed message with publicly available tools.

@_date: 2018-12-18 14:26:47
I didn't. I mostly value your judgement around here. What is wrong with my assessment? Do you really think that the initiative could help find bad actors? Do you really think that the coins lost from the disruption caused by such an event would be worth it?
I use bisq, have Trezors, ledgers and a keepkey, 8 different wallets installed on my phone, run 5 full nodes, both archiving and as wallets and run lightning nodes and invite all to do all of this and get their hands dirty but I will **not** support a campaign that encourages to "audit" custodial services by pulling out all funds at 3pm to put back the funds at 5pm. Whoever comes up with such a plan has no idea how withdrawals and cold storage and traders' minds and marketing and anything of this works.
If you use your powers and silence my such posts and any other such critics and sticky five of those pro-audit-bullshit posts and twitter and facebook did the same, you would not achieve a participation of more than 30% of all funds in custodial services. No way you would. And now these 30% of funds rushing to the exit would squeeze through it slowly and services would report the withdrawal queue to be hours and then days. People would get nervous. More people would join in even on those exchanges that have the liquidity but I see no way more than 80% of the capital to join this even if the drama went on for two weeks, so services short 20% of the funds would still pass the test. And if they are 10% short of those 80% they can borrow with fantastic interest. Etc. I listed it above.
On the other hand, a service being short just 5% of the bitcoins can be totally ruined in the next bull run.
And that is the other problem: The campaign encourages to pull out BTC but not fiat. Custodial services can perfectly use the fiat to buy or borrow missing bitcoins, especially in this bear market.
All this is not addressed by the campaign and therefore it cannot reveal any but the most blatant scammers.

i bet they have more data than you do. if the chance of your transaction not confirming within 72h is x% then they either need an insurance over this potential loss, so they can still recognize the tx instantly or they have to wait it out. As they can't know if some crowd sale will clog the network now and for the next 72h, they have to somehow model these outliers that you don't consider until they hit you. Next block confirmation doesn't proof anything. It's a single data point.

The fees will not be an issue as off the chain transactions will make sure of it. These will resolve privacy, speed and price concerns if implemented correctly and I intent to work on such a solution based on micro transaction channels.
The problem is that the current block size would by far not allow every person on earth to do just one transaction per year, so it is not really a micro-transaction issue at all and as we are at 25% load for current block size, we will need a solution within a year or two but we will get it the one way or the other and raising the debt ceiling … uhm block size can actually be avoided with very positive effects as the pressure to innovate will bring us brilliant products.

Yes. Which is why we strongly recommend not to use Mycelium on a rooted device.


Judging by our support emails, most money is lost because of "no backup" and being able to reset the pin saved many. Also as you now saw, there is at least two more ways of getting to the keys: even if there is full disk encryption, there is a [chance to get in]( with raw access, you can brute force the pin and you can maybe reset the pin. Our paradigm is to give the user time to recover his backup before anybody can steal the funds if he loses control over his phone.
Way too many users call us and ask to undo some transaction, reset their account or what not. We need some sensible middle ground where people can't shoot their feet too easily and with the default resettable pin I think we are doing the right thing.

We always said that SegWit is on the roadmap and our SegWit branch on github is public since months now I think.
I took some beating for my personal stance on SegWit that I still stand by but never has anybody at Mycelium expressed that SegWit would not come. I just don't see it such a priority as some rambling brigades portrait it. Our current SegWit release is a bug fix for our broken hardware wallet integrations, a compatibility fix to allow sending to bech32 and not a fee-saving feature (in my personal view). The fee-saving aspects of SegWit are very secondary to it being a tool for lightning network and similar scripting that requires a malleability fix. The amount of one-star ratings for lack of SegWit we got was ridiculous. The system wide effect of Mycelium producing smaller transactions is minimal as we are not such a big player. The fee-savings for its users are "only" 50% and only relevant in fee events like in January. Go beat mining pools, bitpay and coinbase to support segwit. These are the ones who produce the majority of transactions and thus can have a system-wide impact on blocksize use.

I guess it is a quite common thought. I talked to people who had insights that pointed in that direction. Logs of the forum indicated that most forum users in the early days were in fact sitting in Washington. I just don't know yet what I would make of this. Would I rather want a new world currency with the properties of Bitcoin or would I switch to Litecoin hoping the gov has less of a share there or with any other crypto currency? I guess Bitcoin still living is the clearest sign of it having the full backing of the US-government as it would cost some lousy 50mio to shut it down today. Why wait another year? Sure, they still can shut it down next year or in two years but now the NSA could do so secretively with nobody knowing where the attack came from, spent from their pocket money.

once bitcoind 0.15 gets released, Mycelium can offer much cheaper confirmation targets. Currently we offer as the cheapest 20 blocks with a 95% confidence, which could go as low as 1000 blocks with an 85% confidence, although I highly doubt that this is a good idea. Too much support. But smart fees are also more flexible with weekly cycles.

This evidence is hard to produce. How is your position on doing a HF for peace sake, with an immediate soft limit? So Garzik is merging some code that would require the HF to be triggered instantly with a "big" block and most that are worried about 8MB being too much, are worried about "abusive" use of the blockchain (8MB instantly and forever) ant not so much about organic growth (slow 1.7x up-ramp from segwit + 2x increase from HF). Therefore I would suggest to at least embrace the HF part of 2x to ~~show~~ proof the willingness to touch the 1MB base block limit eventually but at the same time take a hard approach on soft limits. Maybe some UASF that limits base+witness to 4MB or to 1MB*x^t ?

We are currently at 20% rollout and worst bug we know of is that if you try to sign an arbitrary message with one of your addresses, the app crashes, which thus is no blocker, as normal transactions are not affected and no database gets corrupted by this.
We started beta rollout weeks ago but then when we decided to roll it out to production, playstore didn't work for us. We set 5% rollout, google didn't roll out the app. We updated beta, google didn't provide the update to beta testers. For about 2 weeks we had these issues. During these 2 weeks we kept improving the app but didn't get as much feedback as we had hoped for, as the beta rollout also was stuck at a version without our most recent 5 updates. Anyway, now it is in google play and seems to work with the rollout increments, so if you are in a hurry to get the latest version, joining beta should get you that last version instantly but waiting for 100% rollout should not be far out neither. I will check if we can do that now, although Friday usually is not our favorite day to roll out.

Never used it but to my knowledge it is a linux where everything is treated as if it was in /tmp (gone after reboot). Still, you can install software and updates (which would also be gone after the reboot), so you could get scared to not use the bundled electrum and better install a fresh one for just this one transaction and see when those lazy tails maintainers have the bug fixed, so you don't need to do this with every time you use your wallet.

Ok, I'm a mathematician and could live with a 1% chance of owning 100BTC being equal to owning 1BTC, especially if that can change a million times per second and never gets resolved in my lifetime. So far this sounds like a good idea but then the paper goes into details about how to reduce variance without explaining well the primary proposition? How is Blitzkrieg equal to a full graph? How does this not crumble and fall as soon as one player tries to resolve his contract?
So in order for Alice to pay Bob x, Alice stakes an arbitrary amount &gt;x and together with Bob creates an oracle that resolves with estimated value x for Bob. But absent an on-chain funding transaction, where is the commitment to the Alice-Bob relation? What if Alice uses the same collateral to pay a thousand other Bobs? If all the Bobs share all the data, how is that a win?

In bitcoin, you don't spend from the balance of an address but from the output of previous transactions. This is why sometimes transactions can grow big even when sending from just one address but on the other hand a black list can be transaction based rather than address based. The user of the wallet can still split "good" and "evil" coins but as stated in the top rated post, destroying the fungibility (why is this word not in my spell checker???) of bitcoin would not be a great service at all.
My hope is for ZeroCoin (no Alt-Coin but an addition to Bitcoin) to come for the rescue.

If they do, they will crush bitcoin. The window of opportunity to do so is closing very slowly. The US-gov has two options: 
* Crush bitcoin and make sure they can fool the world for longer (and by crush I mean crush no matter what. The next year it will be possible without violence. After that, not so sure.)
* Adopt bitcoin. I thought they would already be invested in bitcoin and for me this option is not off the table. Satoshi could well be the US.gov so they could have 2million Bitcoin by now + most of the bitcoins in US hands. That's a damn good start into burning the dollar. They could still get hands on 2million Bitcoins easily by scaring people with almost-50% mining attacks, legal hassle and giving in later.

How bad an actor do you think they are? What would happen if a company was state sponsored, selling good hardware at dumping prices? This is my number one fear for a state sponsored attack on Bitcoin:
* Build up a mining hardware company (better three)
* Run it like you ran it for profit. Just be 3% better than the competition. 3% is not suspicious but a big deal and if you are not really good and actually 5% worse, sponsoring of 8% is needed but not 100%.
* Have your mining pool(s)
* Have a kill switch in the firmware: Once the target difficulty is over X, refuse work if not signed by one of your pools' private keys.
By the time the attack becomes obvious, the attacker would have maybe paid 8% of it and 92% of the loss will be eaten by those pesky Bitcoin enthusiasts the attacker wanted to attack anyways.

How much does a $1000  – ?Ƀ – $? round-trip cost? I would say 5% if you live in the US, 10% if you live in Chile or maybe 15% in Iran for example.
How much does a $1000 – ?AAPL – $? round-trip cost? 20% in the US? 30% in Chile? 60% in Iran?

Working on a wallet, I look at this chart a lot, trying to figure out if it's charging the right fee. 150sat/B for a 20 blocks target. 20 blocks is about 3h. Looking at the chart at hands that spans only 48h there were several events in which a fee of 200 sat / B was not enough for next block confirmation and 150 sat would usually have gotten the payment through in the next block but it's impossible to know when the network traffic might spike or blocks might roll in slower and in an up-ramp of traffic, 150sat/B can leave the user with no confirmation for days. Tough call. Support gets more complaints about high fees but unconfirmed transactions is also very common.
Time to implement RBF. My plan is to add opt-out RBF for anything but the highest priority, where it would be opt-in RBF. The idea is that if you did not pick a high priority, then the transaction may run a risk of never confirming by your choice, so it might just as well be marked as such, so you can change your mind later.
Because such a default would get us bad press because merchants won't instantly accept payments based on heuristics anymore, we might have it opt-in all the way. Also in the first iteration there will probably not be a button to cancel a payment or change the recipient but only a bump button but for future iterations the plan is to RBF all the way and produce transactions that pay several bills, if there is still some transaction dangling unconfirmed.

i agree but I'm afraid of opening that box. With rbf I can not rely on change outputs to be spendable. If you spend your only one big utxo on a low prio transaction to then put a high prio tx on top, currently you get warned that there are unconfirmed inputs and the wallet stupidly sets the high prio rate for only the new tx. You confirm. The mix of low followed by high prio gets confirmed somehow and you see your 2txs. With rbf the first tx would get an update, lifting both to high prio as only that way you can get high prio on the second tx. Or we replace by a final tx paying the second bill and chain it with a new rbf for the first? Oh and the transaction history also needs a way to show multiple payments in one tx. Of course people will want not only a bump feature but also an undo-button. Of course that will be a PR nightmare together with the bitpays not instantly accepting transactions that depend on rbf. And then there is the correct handling of one version getting confirmed after broadcasting a replacement transaction. The intent of the now invalid transaction needs to be preserved, the user notified and enabled to seamlessly authorize a new transaction, maybe to be signed with his hardware wallet.

Unless I'm fine with probabilistic bitcoins I thought? If I'm fine with those, I can be a pool. So now what?
I have to trust a finder? Those accumulate reputation and only hold funds in escrow for very short times? So there is the concentration drive and why would I not have a lightning channel to those reputable finders and route through them without having to trust them even briefly? Because finders can route between a million entities without having to open a single outbound channel? Where is a record of their reputation kept?

If we get too close to the gap limit, we might have to also consider the possibility of a transaction not confirming. Currently we allow you to receive on new addresses upon unconfirmed transactions. But that's probably a manageable risk with one in a million believing to have lost fund, while they are just behind a larger gap.


Please leave comments and pull requests regarding this [here]( I can't promise prompt resolution though.


It's a process that very much depends on the device and normally can be done without wiping data but there is no one size fits all solution.


We did not do any Marshmallow specific changes regarding this so far. We were working full time on the new wallet but will look into this soon. Also I'm not yet familiar with if and how breadwallet prevents running on rooted phones or otherwise phones that don't provide advanced protection mechanisms other than by setting the min. android version to 6 in the playstore listing. Their [Manifest]( at least doesn't look like it would prevent installation on other devices.

… which can be very severe indeed. Imagine pool-A giving his miners pool-B's work, acting as a miner to pool-B. Now every time a miner finds a share, this share is provided to the other pool, but if a block is found, this is not provided to the other pool.
This is actually the most effective attack I can imagine for a big pool to destroy small pools. Imagine A has 40% hashing power and B has only 10% but pays 5% more per share. A can make that pool find 20% less blocks by diverting 10% of his miners. Now if B keeps paying the higher premium per share regardless of finding 20% less blocks, this is even profitable for A. If they adopt the pay outs per share, nobody will mine there anymore.
I would be interested in hearing how to defend against this. Of course if one miner has hashing power in the order of 20% of the total network and doesn't provide a block, you can kick him out but he could register with 1000 accounts instead of just one.

Ok, I'm late but here is the deal that is easy to code in a weekend (in contrast to all those other things I read above):
I want an Android App that allows me to run deals with physical places to accept bitcoins into my wallet. The app should keep both me the bitcoin junkie and the what-is-bitcoin-merchant updated of our mutual dept. 
* The merchant should be able to type in the price in any currency (google converts to USD, bitstamp converts to BTC, later updates will support formulas using vwap, min, max, etc.. Later updates will also be able to detect tipps)
* The merchant should know (sound) when the bitcoins arrived (blockchain.info has an api for that)
* The bitcoin junkie should also get alerted of his updated debt.
* When the merchant receives fiat from the bitcoin junkie, he should be able to tell the app.
The bitcoin junkie part of the app should be able to keep track of more than one merchants. Cloud to device messaging would be a bonus.
Improvements would be to incorporate fees for fiat delivery delays, limits on the amount of bitcoins to be bought, merchants should be able to link to several bitcoin junkies, too (maybe the one would handle big volume but the other would take no fee etc.).
It would help people to accept bitcoins in a bitpay way so they never actually touch bitcoins and don't need to worry about volatility or regulations as in their books it's just the bitcoin junkie who owes them fiat. I'm interested in any feedback as I'm thinking of doing this myself.
@_date: 2013-05-31 19:19:02
It's much easier than that. All the scam is on the front page
"2800W" (*)
"ensuring cool [ ... ] operation"
These two lines are all you need to know to see it is a scam. 2800W is nothing but cool.
Here in Chile it's winter right now and I heat my room with occasional 400W or 800W. 24/7 2800W would be anything but cool. My mining operation used 1500W and we had to cool the room by installing extra ventilation to the room itself to not reach sauna temperatures.
Any machine that consumes 2800W, radiates 2800W. Exactly. No more. No less. No matter what. If they would have some alien tech to convert heat to electricity to power the mining again, they would consume less Watt and therefore not declare it to consume 2800W. Maybe they have a black hole in the unit that absorbs the heat so the unit radiates the heat to the inside. Yeah, that would make sense. Black holes can absorb arbitrary amounts of heat.

It was always stupid to start mining and I guess it will always have been a great idea to have done it.
The idea of mining is not free profit. As long as some "hey, I want to mine" dude can make profit, the people more enthusiastic will ramp up their capacities faster and those who don't pay for electricity will finally mine when others switch off again … just until the next generation of ASICs comes out or the next price round makes it profitable to invest again.

For downloading the blockchain you have to assume the 8MB blocks though, as only that allows you to independently verify transactions. Being able to throw away 6MB each is pruning of data that should not be needed after having verified it once.

I definitely trust you more than the other guy for naming cold storage. So your name is not the most unique and posting ID would be kind of weird, too. Are there any videos of you on youtube that you would claim to feature you? If such a claim would go unchallenged by some other Daniel Berger I would consider it more valuable than posting an ID that I can't verify.
In the end it comes down to how much you hold in cold storage and there is no reason to have any deposit address in a hot wallet. They can all be watching, so I don't understand that part about the 100BTC. Coinbase made public they have 90% in cold storage. I guess having all but 10BTC in cold storage would be ok for you, too. This way you could hold hands with your server when people are rushing out of your service and normally everything should be covered or covered shortly. Somebody exceeding your hot wallet would have to wait for somebody else depositing or you moving out of cold storage but the queue should move automatically upon receiving fresh funds.

It's kind of the truth. I don't have nothing I call a social security number, so yeah if you so will, I'm lying. Sorry for that. The truth is that in Chile every citizen knows by heart his R.U.T. which is the number in his national ID and provides this everywhere. 80% of Chileans give this number when shopping. Foreigners struggle a bit when shopping here. The questions are: "Do you accumulate points?" You either say no or you give your RUT. The other question is a bit tricky as you actually have to understand it as it is either "Do you want to donate 3 [or whatever it is that rounds up to the next 10] Pesos?" or it is "Do you want to get back 3 Pesos?". If you accidentally opted to get back those nasty 3 Pesos she will take you for Scrooge McDuck, but don't try to get rid of that nasty metal to the student who's packing your bag as they don't want that metal neither. He gets 200-400Pesos.
Other true story: When entering a national park, you have to provide the RUT, too. Craziest place where I had to give it to a police officer and only got away because I could plausibly claim to be a tourist was in Santa Lucia park in Santiago.
Essentially if somebody here wants to know your name and email address, he will always ask your RUT as that's his primary key in the user database no matter if it is your social security provider, your supermarket, your bank, so yeah, the RUT might not be generated by whatever entity in the states generates social security numbers but in Chile nobody generates IDs other than the registro civil.

having a backup means having to worry about the backup. if you loose it to some nanny that cleaned up your stuff too carefully you might end up owing somebody a lot of money while having lost your own bitcoin stash.

I'm charging a friend's phone so in case the process differs from the description in the mail (phone charged without mail) I might not be aware of the phone being charged already.

I am talking about under the radar stuff. Release the app. Google will not delete it. People will use it. If done server-less which is my current vision, there is no record of who actually did trade. The app would send mails back and forth or maybe SMS in later versions but could do this even encrypted.
Then you would have maybe 10k of installs with 9.5k of them not doing any trades and 90% being outside the US anyway. This is not a solution for the US where other services work just fine. This is for Chile where I live and for other countries where there is just no bitpay or even exchange yet. I want to get bitcoin started in the less fortunate parts of the world quickly. If these countries hear about bitcoin once the USD collapsed, we will have worse slavery than we have now.

From the linked answer:


Not only that, the miner does not know anything about the block or even the chain and might actually be mining for another coin entirely. This happened for example when StEligius directed its miners to some alt-coin to kick their difficulty to the moon.

I am on localbitcoins and try to provide easy access in and out of bitcoin to my neighbors. Not only do exchanges always take at least on hour cause we have to talk about our bitcoins so much, it also helps to bootstrap bitcoin adoption. Yeah, they make me sell and buy when I don't want to, but that's what I charge a fee for. I know where I can balance my portfolio, so I don't care buying or selling more than I wanted. That's called market maker.

Back then it was really really frustrating to test bitcoinwireless.
What I thought it was:
* Provide email address (otpional) to handle issues
* Provide tel to know what to charge
* Pick carrier
* send bitcoins to the address provided whenever I want to recharge
* within seconds get my phone charged
* (USSDs inform me about remaining balance if I sent less than a threshold)
What it actually was:
* Provide email address
* Provide tel
* Pick carrier
* Pick package
* Get email to pay exact amount
* send bitcoins
* get email to confirm payment and announce another email within the next *hours* to *explain* how I will get my balance to the phone (this last mail never arrived and bitinstant took 2 weeks to reimburse what I paid)
Now I'm eager to see if the process now
A) works at all and
B) is stream-lined.
I'm really the biggest fan of bitcoinwireless if it doesn't cost additional fees and is easy to use like my version  above. This would be sooo awesome.

Well, cash out not working is a pretty serious defect for an exchange and I did these round trips for speculation, too that I sent bitcoins and cashed out bitcoins but you can't claim he hasn't lost anything when his purpose of sending bitcoins there was to get fiat and he's now waiting for his fiat forever.
I try to limit my exposure to the exchange-went-titties-up-risk as low as possible by holding money there for as short as possible and MtGox is very bad for that risk-minimization.
@_date: 2013-02-06 23:40:45
So I tried again and the process was the same as last time. The first mails came instantly but the last, important mail with how to actually charge *sic* the phone is missing. Again it was announced this might take hours. Hours means 3 confirmations or human interaction? 15 minutes later I didn't get anything yet.

I donated $10 and coinkite is no big name for me yet. Bruno, Rassah and Roger are doing an amazing effort separately from this one but it is not easy to quickly find a good channel to donate for a certain cause and having a limitation to use Bitcoin doesn't make it easier.
Yeah, if my best friend sitting in Vietnam asked me to donate so he could do [whatever great plan to help] I would likely contribute more, but lets discuss the best alternatives rather than to bash somebody who most likely really just wanted to help.

basically all transactions should have made it into both chains. just the block id will change in the future. Malicious people could maybe get conflicting transactions.
As the blocks are only putting in sequence what you sign and broadcast, a change of that sequence doesn't undo your transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:45:21
looks better than bitcoinity but I would hate to switch in a situation that might even be raised by bitcoinwisdom themselves. Ƀ0.02 / month, Ƀ0.2 / year … that is $10/month, $100/year for removing ads? Seriously? But yeah, the price is a mixture of donation and kind reminder to donate but I prefer pay what you want. Much more likely I would pay.

To those who urge you to not spend your coins: Ah, please shut up about "never spend them!!!1!".

I tried and liked the integration. It is instant! (I assume after 2h without confirmations I would be back to no gold) and it gave me a discount on the expected amount to pay (bitcoinwireless charged huge markups for example)
To be honest I never missed reddit gold as I don't spend more than an hour on reddit per month.

open source apps like this or any other are only secure if you build them yourself or if others approve of the binary being compatible to what they get when compiling it themselves. Therefore I would only trust it if the people that put it into the chrome store are totally open about their identity and provide ways to check on the binary compatibility (I have no clue if chrome plugins are compiled at all).
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:43:37
I'm glad I used a throw away address to sneak around and never sent any bitcoins that way. The bitcoin bust is all about DPR? I guess it's more about the many dealers and customers that left their shipping address and other stuff on the server.

35000 people working on making my attempts to protect my communication obsolete is quite intimidating.
So SecureRandom didn't work in Android? Surprisesurprise! Guess what, with 35k employees you can put 10 in every big company to sabotage everything.
How many NSA-guys are coding for bitcoin? How much review and with which discipline would you have to do to make absolutely sure no "accident" sneaks in that would allow others to just empty every hot wallet? People approve of changes but if I don't understand that specific line of that brilliant contributor, would I have the balls to admit that I don't understand it? Maybe I spent hours reading it and deciding that the code is beyond me makes me feel like ok, I'm not ready to do reviews. Maybe 5 already approved it and it was the 5 other NSA-guys. Whom can you trust? You need to trust somebody as you can't review all code down to the OS.

bitcoin mining is the process that makes bitcoin invincible against take overs. If you have 51% of the computing power you can stop all transactions from happening for example. Or demand dramatic fees to get included. A botnet like this usually is not used to attack bitcoin but to promote bitcoin as they want to cash out their collected coins and don't wont them to be worthless, thus they are supporting the security of bitcoin. Unfortunately horribly horribly inefficient as CPU-mining is 6 orders of magnitude less efficient than state of the art ASIC mining meaning you need to infect 1000000 laptops to get the performance of one ASIC. 1000000 laptops can help send spam much more efficiently than they can help mine bitcoin aka secure the bitcoin network so this looks more like something that will get bad news for bitcoin than a load of money to the botnet master.

Only people with money to play with, invest at all. Some feel save having 1 month of fiat, others only feel save if they have a year of fiat and many actually have no fiat to play with at all. They are in constant debt. Therefore the poor will completely miss the bitcoin revolution. (Ok, apart from the street artists that accept bitcoin donations or sell their art for bitcoin just to take profit from the hype.)
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:27:16
I don't see how BIP70 would not increase the blockchain size. Even if it doesn't increase the transaction size significantly, wouldn't it still make pruning futile as the count of charged addresses would only ever increase and never decrease?

Order ID 982 :)
Ok, with hot sauces you got me. Here in Chile nothing is spicy and your expensive shipping rates made me go for the big package. Hope it will ship in time for my spicy food loving guest who comes in 3 weeks from now :)
I found the order process not perfect: I wanted to order 1 of each and that was a minor hassle. When I  saw the bill, I wanted to order 2 of each but my cart already was an order I guess, so the cart was empty and I could not just hit +1 on each but had to go through the products again.
The transaction was sent (blockchain sees it) but I did not get a confirmation from you. Other sites have the "please pay" turn into a "thanx" once the transaction is visible. Not shipping it if the transaction never makes it into a block is still an option you have but the customer wants immediate feedback when he paid.
I hope I won't forget to report back on delivery or problems.

You don't want to because they are d-bags or they are d-bags cause they don't want you. I imagine if you are a business in the USA, Iran is kind of off limit to you although they have a very convenient mobile recharge network as well. You can buy codes at every corner.
Oh, and Germany is also still a d-bag country? Interesting.

As I had an argument with the btctip.com-guy over the issue which resulted in me calling him out as a scammer [1] in my sig on the forum, same question to you: What is your cold storage strategy? How many %% of the total will be on your server? How will you deal if your hot wallet gets emptied in a singulary event (hack, you  moving the money, your "business partner" moving the money)? Which legal entity (your real name and proof of ID please) can I sue if you steal our money?
Each person might only have some $$ on your service but the total is too tempting if you are anonymous and can call it a hack. I would love to spread the word using your service, but you charge no fees, so maybe you are in it to spread the word. Maybe you are in it to get rich quickly. In that case, all those people I might make happy sending them their first millis, might end up thinking bitcoin is a scam, just because you are a scammer. This is why I can't tolarete loosing $1 to your service and I try to prevent it for others as this is the worst advertisement in Bitcoin there can be and actually is a lot.

Whenever people whine about bitcoin being soooo expensive now, I make sure they very well remember that today November 1st it was worth $200. No matter if it actually would be 212 on one and 215 on another exchange, I only want to see their faces when next year I tell them "I told you so!".
My landlord now also regrets that she didn't accept one month's rent in bitcoin a year ago. Told you so! ;)

No answer to your question but I am very concerned about exactly these questions and here is my take:
I am alert and if people would actually strongly push for &gt;10MB, it would be all over the place. I feel some (how do you say that in English) joyful expectation to see the first full block, the first 10 consecutive full blocks, to see what fees will do. I guess many people want to learn what the miners will make of their power to decide which transaction gets in and which not.
At least I want to see this and I hope we won't raise the ceiling before we get this data. After that I believe that every person on earth should have room to hit the block chain with one transaction per year at least. This should be enough to sync your semi-private ledger in whatever off the chain solution you use to still have an accurate public ledger and I have no doubt that we will develop solutions that provide the same level of security with off the chain transactions that still allow you to be your own bank.

So you feel fine eventually having to compensate your users losses of up to 5Ƀ? I know you don't advertise your service as a long time solution for my life savings but guess what, neither did instawallet and many others and still they found themselves sitting on shitloads of money, firstly due to users not really thinking but secondly because bitcoins appreciated in value making pocket change amounts suddenly worth a fortune. For this I urge you to be a bit clearer about your policy and eventually require a return address outside your server so you can close shop without a year long reimbursement process. This would also allow you to prevent funds to exceed a certain threshold. (Something along these lines …)
Else, thanks for open-sourcing it and please fix the off-chain-transactions as tipping $0.3 should not cost 30% in fees.

Just donated $10 and provided bullshit all over the place. worked fine.
