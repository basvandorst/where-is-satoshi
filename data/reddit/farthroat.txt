The narrative for the past several months has been "Store of value" not a currency
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:05:16
An unfortunate reality of getting into a fight with someone else is you will have to resort to their methods.
I believe Core fraudulently attempted to gain control over the BCH twitter handle not too long ago. Agreed, its a sad childish approach.

because anyone with half a brain knows Ver and Andreas have nothing to do with the price of the coins. 
Did Andreas' hotel conferences cause BTC to hit 20k in 2017? These figure heads have very little to do with the price/performance.

Key word being *currently*. If you look at a local road Sunday night @ 11pm, it will seem like there is no traffic/congestion problem.
Its the peak times that tell you whether volume is a problem or not.
I'm all for lighting, but until it has large scale usability, its nothing. its Segwit.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:23:22
Arguing large block size hurts the original bitcoin goals while implementing lightning on top of Segwit is a reach. 
Block size increase is the only actively working solution, as fun as Core's alpha/beta projects are, i'll believe it when i see it. 
One year anniversary for Segwit just around the corner!

The argument is made in the opposite direction; Core should rename to bitcoincore
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:24:55
Agreed, but the debate is about who and in which direction. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:38:30
increasing the native functionality to handle capacity is the solution running on extreme principles?
yet LN on top of Segwit is the elegant solution... 
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:35:32
Free market 101
BTC has been aware of transaction limitations for over 2 years now and we're still beta testing a possible solution. 
LN better do the trick, in my mind Core is 25 months behind schedule. Im not here to say BCH is that alternative, but you must realize the cause of the market share/value bleeding. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:58:48
Do you believe that every time BTC has hit critical with fees that its Ver's doing?
That would imply the introduction of Segwit and Lightning is for nothing else but to combat Ver?
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:33:08
shhhh dont give away the business model 
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:28:05
If you think Ver was responsible for all the congestion backlogs BTC has experienced over the last several years you have some readding to do.
FYI, if Ver was the cause of the congestion problems, that implies Segwit and LN are just to combat him lol
look at the tech, elegant simple solutions will always win out over band aids piled on top of each other. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:37:01
The shame is people believe is something other then the underlying technologies. 
These are the people hurting cyrpo and slowing adoption 
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:49:45
I encourage you to read up on all the changes that have taken place in the top 5 coins.
Is hash rate you measure of 'great things'?
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:14:42
i dont understand this sub anymore... this guy is not offering to buy this sub, he's said he would pay 100k to prevent censoring. 
I'm assuming with the end goal being the ability to openly debate? 
Doesn't that worry anyone? the "enemies" objective is just an open discussion
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:33:57
Introducing two foreign technologies on top of what Bitcoin was intended sounds more misleading to me. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:31:25
All alt's are crap coins now haha 
on par for this sub, ban away!
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:43:57
An important distinction to make that BCH exist because of BTC technical struggles.
Ver is nothing more than BCH's Andreas, if you think swings from 20k or ratios down to 0.09 have anything to do with either of them, you and your friends have a very wrong impression of crypto.
look at the tech, look at the need/demand and make conclusions that way. Blaming or rewarding these figureheads based on investment performance is short sided. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:55:27
huh? there are countless sources stating the fee model is as designed. Core is not looking to remove fees at any time. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:10:45
The same argument from a legal perspective could be said in the other direction. 
Ver believes that the changes that took place to BTC in Aug of 2017 no longer make it Bitcoin. Stating it is deliberately misleads people.
