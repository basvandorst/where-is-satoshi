THANK YOU for pointing out the (now being edited) text under Gavin's photo - we didin't pick it up :/
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:30:00
don't forget the machine, gotta mention the machine... that way they can buy some moar. Which they'll want to be doing. OH YEAH, we have ourselves some pretty funky spokespeople.
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:29:39
yes, thanks, also edited.
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:07:37
THANKS zeromaintenance!
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:05:19
Has been awesome (and surprising) to watch donations come in. THANKS coincrazyy :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:06:58
thanks aye-aye, that's exactly who this is made for - people who don't know much about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-21 00:14:20
Thanks for sharing the links around social media  much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-11-27 11:29:49
Hey rem0g, I have a transcript now - do you know anyone who could make subtitles?
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:09:33
Yes, wouldn't it be great if this somehow did touch the mass(es). And, thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:28:07
Hell yeah, we're just in beta stage of making Melbourne the BTC capital and already kicking the rest of Australia's arse. Now that Hamish and Andy are into it, it's a done deal. Thanks guys.
Mikey - you rock, this would be a hard core tour for hard core bitcoiners. hhhmm... 
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:08:23
not yet, we'll be dividing it into three sections for youtube. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 11:03:36
Yes, DDP, definitely a digital point.
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:17:07
thanks Torsten.... huge relief to get it out. Two more parts to go - we've already got heaps of footage to go through.
@_date: 2014-02-05 03:10:48
add to the craziness, get some Bitcoincufflinks from VeraChan on King Street... oh, and they'll be able to eat spaghetti at Waterfords in the Docklands after Friday night too. Maybe meet some of the Bitcoin crew for a drink this Friday night 7 Feb for a load more unprintable ideas!
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:12:04
YES, am waiting on a transcript which will be posted for anyone who wants to make subtitles :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:12:20
VERY COOL, thank YOU!
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:39:01
Firstly, kudos to the women mentioned, respect to you for all the work you've done, energy and passion you've invested in making cryptocurrency easier to use, THANK YOU.
On a different note (gender gap aside) something else to think about.... my first immediate thought when I read this was "same-same... US centric blogging oblivious to what's happening in the rest of the world". 
As a woman on the other side of the planet I've given up with being heard by the 'big' names in Bitcoin, just too time consuming, frustrating and (speaking from many years in the corporate world) reeks of familiarity.... find out who knows who, get in the 'right' circles, jump the necessary hoops, make contact with the decision maker, tailor conversation (say what he wants to hear), follow up... .... dare I even say.... sleep with the 'right' man.
FUCK THAT. 
The reason I'm drawn to the blockchain technology is that I hear it being a tool for levelling the playing field - to put ideologies into practice, explore what works/doesn't... we are just touching the surface with this technology. It's up to us to create something that works for women, to balance the scales.
My personal interest is in creating a social constitution based on agreements - a BEHAVIOURAL based constitution. Too much attention on contractual 'ownership' of properties/things, what about owning how we relate to each other??? 
@_date: 2014-04-04 07:09:52
Great idea, please add Melbourne Australia *PLEASE*
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:05:51
thanks magicalelf :)
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:39:16
there's three - the Hub 673 Bourke Street (Level 3), PolyEster books on Brunswick Street, and here at an aquarium/hydroponics shop in west footscray
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:15:40
thanks Mikey for posting this, interesting responses - and thanks to one of the comments, it's now being edited to fix Gavin Andresen's name.
@_date: 2015-03-16 12:19:31
IGA's and foodworks have independent owners, easier to talk to, and talk about crypto's.
@_date: 2013-03-15 12:03:54
maybe we should email IGG as well, see who'll be first to accept BTC?
@_date: 2013-03-07 10:51:44
reading my mind? I'm thinking of couch surfing, checking that out first. Thanks for the link, will come back to it if I don't have any luck surfing.
@_date: 2013-03-07 10:54:56
Yep, interesting... the error message when I clicked notify me....
"ERMEHGERD SUMTHING WENT HORRIBLEE RONG [In other words, there was an error submitting your form]These errors appear below.
This aint Reddit buddy, you need a real address here!
Please go back and fix these errors".
@_date: 2013-03-16 12:26:41
I got exact same email this morning... at least they responded!
@_date: 2013-05-21 06:05:50
Polyester books in Fitzroy accept BTC online (although their site is down now), and I'm talking to them about accepting in store as well. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 02:21:20
it's official, AmarusSpirit accepts bitcoin  YES!
@_date: 2013-03-07 10:50:10
Yep, that's the one - thanks. Contacting them to get a sense of when they're accepting orders again. Oh, and they've got an investment opportunity, checking that out to.... sounds like an interesting venture.
@_date: 2013-03-08 10:30:50
I agree exciting, not purely for the profit... the more people aware of this currency the stronger it becomes. So far I've given 8 away in the last two weeks and the conversations I've had have been really engaging. One dude is now mining as a result, another is considering storing his savings in bitcoin rather than the bank. When a friend came to visit yesterday I gave her one too and she's now researching with a view to trade. It's made my connection with friends richer.
@_date: 2013-03-15 11:46:50
Just emailed them... I think this is a great idea and we should be doing this to many more sites ie EFF and Wikipedia - they're response to my email was just plain stupid. So many people think fiat currency is LEGAL!
@_date: 2013-05-07 02:42:43
GREAT WORK.... I'm tackling businesses in Melbourne, VegieBar might be the first to accept.
@_date: 2013-02-25 09:24:38
purely for a conversation starter.
@_date: 2013-05-17 12:35:53
I just ordered something with BitSpend... they added a tax to the price, plus their fee. I'm waiting on an answer to my email asking if they can include the tax IN the price. Haven't heard anything for 48hrs. 
We need an Australian version of BitSpend. Anybody on to it yet?
@_date: 2013-03-11 09:18:51
I'd really like to pay for accommodation with bitcoin... anyone know how that's possible?
@_date: 2013-04-21 13:41:44
KimDotCom from Mega was mentioning something about starting a MegaCard for Bitcoin... haven't heard anything about it for a few months tho so I don't know where he's at with the idea.
@_date: 2013-03-18 04:28:52
Got it... unfortunately my housemate is preoccupied with getting married (in SriLanka) and can't hear much about how easy ur suggestion could be. I gave him cash instead and will persist with him when he gets back. Thanks for letting me know how to make it happen.
@_date: 2013-03-12 02:26:10
thanks, I found a place in LA via airbnb, have paid one day with fiat and paying the rest in bitcoin - very happy about that. Have bookmarked the merchant directory, THANKS.
@_date: 2013-03-11 02:20:33
yes, of course, airbnb... thanks for the reminder, I have a friend in Melbourne with airbnb. Didn't even think of that for LA, some great places available. Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2013-03-18 04:23:04
Hhhmmm, might have to jump on a plane and check it out.... researching how far from LA that is. I can easily book flights from the airport right?
@_date: 2013-03-18 04:00:17
OH YES that would be great... now sitting at sydney airport waiting for mechanical repairs to plane. Thinking, researching, thinking... emptying my head... I did read about a fast food type place that had a swipe machine to accept bitcoin somewhere In US.... where? Maybe go there while I'm in the States and interview the creator. Want to get bitcoin happening in Melbourne. Any other people want to catch up in LA?
@_date: 2013-03-12 01:38:47
great to see it's back online, thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-15 13:06:47
Not so sure about that, now that I've emailed kickstarter what more is there for me to do? We could also create a list of the top ten most influential sites and get a campaign going so there's a constant flow of emails from all around the world. That could also work, it sure wouldn't do any harm.
@_date: 2013-05-20 08:01:06
GREAT! I'm collating a Bitcoin information pack to give to retail businesses in Melbourne and will add this. Suggestion - rather than why isn't bitcoin totally worthless... why is bitcoin valuABLE?
@_date: 2013-05-05 15:08:31
also blogs? Would be interesting to see if peoples' opinions are affecting BTC value.
@_date: 2013-10-28 05:44:15
Eclectico 163a Acland Street in StKilda, brick and mortar only retail business now accepts BTC
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:29:13
could be done in different languages, however NOW is said.
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:48:26
A friend is right into ayuaschca and I can see she's changing as a result of her journeys. This is one of the reasons I invested in Bitcoin, I thought *if* the value increases, I'll go to Peru and try it out. Here's the place my friend suggested:
When I contacted the guy there and asked if he'll accept bitcoin he said he'll look into it... he's now contacted his web person who's looking into getting an online payment for their site. So it looks like it's going to happen :))
Had the thought there might be a few other bitcoiners looking to expand their thought processes/get their minds blown/purge like a rocket... give aya a try as well... if you are, this is the dude to do it with.
I'm planning on going 18/19 March til 10 April... if anyone's interested and wants to pay with bitcoin, please get in contact with him. If he gets a few requests it could speed up the process!
@_date: 2013-02-25 09:14:49
getting used to reddit, want to post this to here  Now working out how to do that
@_date: 2013-05-20 10:29:07
Finally got the invoice sorted, I put the order thru thinking somebody would have to respond, and they did. With an apology, and a possibility of getting the phone sent to me earlier than promised - I'm happy and will use them again.
@_date: 2013-03-16 12:49:57
I want to sell some bitcoin to my housemate who's SriLankan, he's going over there for a few months this year and asked me how he could sell them over there. Localbitcoins doesn't show any possibilities for face to face - how big is bitcoin in Sri Lanka? And India for that matter, I thought those two places would be big adopters of this technology.
@_date: 2013-03-12 02:15:28
contacted this dude, he's open to accepting them  which is not very surprising considering the space! I even get to do an aerial class while I'm there, think that's happening in the lounge room. Let the upside down view of the world begin :o)))
@_date: 2013-03-18 04:19:10
Really like this idea I will take it on while I'm in US. Not much on bitcointraders for LA at all... I plan on leaving behind me a trail of businesses at least considering accepting BTC.... if anyone says there was an Australian woman here talking about bitcoin this year, that was me!!
@_date: 2013-04-29 07:16:09
banks and Govt/regulators, yes, let them trade bitcoin
