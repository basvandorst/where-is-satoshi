Or only if you use a SegWit transaction. AFAIK, there is no fix for transactions of the current format.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:10:33
Maybe you'd like to provide it?
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:20:51


Which does not do much if their users don't use SegWit transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:40:24
Not even checking your claim, but together with AntPool it would make less than 32% of the hashrate. If all other pools supported SegWit, we would see more than current 36% signalling blocks.

Extension Blocks includes malleability fix.
@_date: 2017-05-06 06:54:31
I don't believe it without proofs, but it may be true.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:03:47


But SegWit does not provide any increase for non-upgraded wallets. So you probably assume that most users have upgraded software. Then you can also assume the same in case of ExtBlk. Not perfect, but maybe not that bad either, especially if you compare to the current situation.

SegWit is being promoted dishonestly.


1. Old nodes don't matter. See [this comment](2. Even if you consider old nodes, the compatibility is about the same in SegWit and ExtBlk.


The Merkle root of the extension block is included. I don't see why SPV wouldn't work.


Yeah, that would be false. And the same lie I read about SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:43:54
I take it as you don't want to provide the evidence.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:40:25
Here is an answer from the proposal creators. 


The [specification]( doesn't directly mention the malleability issue, but it says that the data in the extension uses SegWit format. It lists the differences compared to BIP141. Hashing and signature scheme is not changed. It makes me believe that ExtBlk fixes malleability and quadratic complexity the same way as SegWit does.
@_date: 2017-05-06 06:40:05
**ExtBlk transactions work the same way as SegWit transactions.** Signatures are not in the part of the transaction that is hashed for transaction identifier. If you modify the hashed data in any way, signatures are invalidated, transaction is invalid. If you modify the witness part, transaction identifier does not change. Thus, the transaction is not malleable.

I think, it is unlikely that miners implement any change in the consensus rules without community support. An actual fork to 2 separate chains is possible if and when the community is already split to to that point.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:54:25
Me too. But this theoretical discussion of why ExtBlk would be bad is based on an assumption that ExtBlk is adopted.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:37:13


Right. But those don't matter. They serve neither their owners (can accept invalid blocks) nor the network.


Where did you get the term "pseudo-SPV"? A node that validates a part of the block according to old rules has nothing to do with SPV.


**This** is what SPV is for. You are only concerned about your transactions, so you need a light node.


It is possible to use SPV on the P2P network. I think, MultiBit and similar software works this way.


You want a fully validating node - you run it. The thing is that a node that follows old rules is not fully validating. It just wastes your resources without providing benefits. It's actually worse than a proper SPV node. An SPV node can request and verify the relevant witness or extension data; old node software can't do that.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:00:57
It's OK. You don't have to provide excuses for not providing evidence.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:34:48
If we assume that ExtBlk is adopted, that would mean widespread support.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:22:04
SegWit is a very bad idea because it gives you the false sense of backward compatibility and security.
@_date: 2017-05-06 06:51:06
That's why SedWit does not significantly increase capacity. These slow user's transactions will take the main block space needed by SegWit transactions. In contrast, ExtBlk transactions are not affected by old-type transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:44:51


That's not called SPV nor pseudo-SPV. That's called "outdated software". SPV is a mechanism for checking individual transactions without validating blocks (only headers are validated).


Probably ignorant or dishonest.


There is no reason to run a full node and not upgrade. When a soft fork happens, old software cannot be a full node any more. Either validate everything (for security, for serving API clients, or to support the network) or validate only your transactions (using SPV and/or API server).
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:23:23
Name the fake pools.
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:52:35


In case of SegWit, ExtBlk, or any other change, old nodes don't matter. They have a different set of consensus rules. They can't even relay blocks (because blocks without the additional data are not considered valid by other nodes). They are not good for the network and there is no practical reason to run such node at all (use lightweight software if you don't want to process *all* data). All nodes that matter will upgrade before the change. Some will upgrade shortly after.
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:33:06


Note that the same can be said about SegWit.




Those would not be "full nodes". Note that if SegWit is adopted, nodes that are not willing to deal with "witness" data, are not "full nodes" and would accept invalid blocks.


The resolution transaction outputs are not spendable until it's confirmed by enough blocks. The same as with mined coins.
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:57:26
So you assume a relatively quick adoption of SegWit transactions. My point is that you can also assume a relatively quick adoption of ExtBlk transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:26:37
How exactly?
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:30:23


Which is a very small fraction in the given situation (just large exchanges may quickly upgrade).
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:16:23
Maybe you got my comment wrong. I don't believe that all the pools you named are under the same control as AntPool. However, I don't dispute your claim. Assume, it's true. I wanted to point out that another claim in this thread is still false:


@_date: 2017-05-05 13:12:13
Any "soft fork" is a change of consensus rules.
