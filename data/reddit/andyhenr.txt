I'm waiting for a pretty large withdrawal; and they also claim 'technical issues'.  They came with a canned response 
"Dear customer, due to the fact that many users are requesting withdrawal at this moment, which results in a slow reaction of Bitcoin Wallet; so this may cause a little delay of your withdrawal.Please don't worry, our tech team is trying their best to deal with this situation, please wait patiently and we feel very sorry for your inconvenience. Thank you for your understanding!".
And also "I'm sorry I can't tell you the accurate time, but our tech team is handling. Please kindly wait for a moment. We're sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience."
"so you had a technical issue in processing the withdrawal?
We have no issue, I mean they're finding a better way to make the withdrawal become faster."
etc etc etc.
I'm worried, in all honesty. It's a very large chunk of bitcoins; house type of money.

Here's my 2 cents:
- If you want to invest into bitcoin; then just buy in for the long term. Sure, looks like it may correct down now a bit; but when it's done, who knows? If you can perfectly time bottoms and tops, you can then trade. 
- Option 2 thus is: if you believe you can time the swings; then buy bitcoins, use a future market with leverage, short on a peak, sell at a bottom and you will make excellent money.  However, if you are not very very good at it; you would then be gambling. 
So, in short; look to your strengths; if you want to long term place it, then buy in now. Sure, it can go down a few percentages, but if Lingham, Kim Dot, etc are right, if you just buyt and hold on to bitcoins, it can be worth a lot. 
If you are a savvy traders and can detect market moves, or just love to gamble; buy bitcoin and trade it via a futures exchange.
