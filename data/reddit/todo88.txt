Theoretically as the fork approaches, the price of the original chain will increase in value as more people want to own pre-fork and the economics will work themselves out after the fork is released and there are two chains. Exactly, yep. Everyone who has BTC before the fork is released is by definition an owner of coin on the second chain after the fork.

Implied in your question is whether you should sell high and buy low. The answer to that is of course yes. But no one knows where the price is going. No one can answer that question honestly. If you think it's best for your portfolio, do it. If not, don't do it. Anyone pretending to have a crystal ball is lying.

Because they use the same original blockchain. Basically You start with one chain, and when a fork hits, each new chain uses the original chain, but all new transactions after the fork only occur on that chain. So, using Bitcoin Cash as an example...   
  
You have the original Bitcoin chain. This chain splits into 2 chains with the fork. So, you have the Bitcoin you had before the fork on the Bitcoin fork and the Bitcoin cash fork. 
the two forks can't interact with each other, but because they use the same base fork, you have two copies of that original Bitcoin.  
  
Does that make sense?  
  
To add onto that, if you have a Hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S, it can distinguish between the two forks and it allows you to go into the different wallets of each fork. So it creates a new Bitcoin Cash Wallet on the new fork, and you keep your old Bitcoin wallet on the old fork.

It was a circle jerk in 2013 before the $1200 bubble pop. The subreddit quality ebbs and flows but usually ends up worse when the price is going up at a quicker pace.

I think it's about perspective. From the perspective of a long-time holder, the price is increasing. From the perspective of a day-trader or someone who just lost 5-10% of their investment in the past 10 hours or whatever, it's down.   
  
I understand your point, and agree with it. Just something to keep in mind.

Both will work, yes. Coinbase hooks up with your bank account. I've never used Local Bitcoin personally so I can't attest to that, but I presume it's mostly cash transactions.

It's back up. Thanks mate.

It's 107 on btc-e, and its drop started before gox went down.

I was using bitcoinplus back in July of 2011 and I was very proud of my .014 bankroll from mining when I was getting about .00003 BTC per 4 hours or so. If I knew then what I know now, I would have invested big time, but as it sits, I still only have the .014 BTC. I'm going to start mining again tonight though. It was always rewarding to see those payouts! Best of luck to you in the BTC market mate! Maybe in a decade or two we'll have a nice small fortune.

Gox is back down.  
  
EDIT: And as of 10:00PM PDT it's back up

Living the dream!

Gonna be a good night for traders and a tense night for investors. Ultimately it's just money changing hands.

I just got this message myself and reported it. It's too bad that people feel the need to take other people's money like this...
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:11:40
Not sure we're at the end of this thing quite yet.  
  
EDIT: But I hope that's the case.  
EDIT2: And the market spiked upwards when it came back online. Sweet!

Maybe. There is no certainty in Bitcoin speculation.

Nah, he's just making a topical joke.
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:57:24
Hopefully you'll be able to get a good price in after it comes back up!
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:06:02
Worked like a charm, thanks!
