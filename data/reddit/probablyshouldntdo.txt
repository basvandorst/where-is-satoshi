1. Download Brainwallet.org for off-line *.zip
2. Roll 8 hexadecimal dice 8 times to get a private key in hexadecimal
3. (This is my fuck-up) Transcribe the 64-character hexadecimal number wrong, replacing all instances of the number "0" with the letter "O"
4. Copy paste this into the Brainwallet.org offline converter with "Hexadecimal" selected.
5. Brainwallet.org offline converter automatically recognizes this is not hexadecimal, and automatically sets the input to "Base 64." A private key in Base58Check is generated, the key starts with the number 3
6. Use the Brainwallet.org address generator with this private key that starts with a 3; generate [this address](
7. Send $1 to the address...it works!
8. Attempt to import private key (starts with a 3, Base58Check) with Airbitz and Mycelium, neither recognize it as a private key. Neither does bitcoinpaperwallet.com
Anyway I know I messed up here, I'm just curious what exactly happened. Since the address has $1, there must be some way to access it? I'm assuming if I paste the address onto reddit someone will figure it out in a few minutes, but I'm really curious about the problem.

Select "Private Key" under "Get Address From," then enter the private key and get the address.

brainwallet.org offline to create the private key, then brainwallet.org offline converter with that private key to create the address.

I just messed up when inputting the hex dice number. I typed the letter "O" instead of the number "0" -- so when I used bitwallet.org, it wouldn't let me use Hex input and defaulted to Base64 input (on the [converter](
I didn't notice it and created the private key. From Base64 --&gt; B58Check, it created a private key that began with a "3." When I ran it through the converter, it created an address that I was able to send $1 to. 
But now I can't import the private key.

In the style of so many bitcoin news stories lately, I guess I should say "my customers increased by 1,000%!"
