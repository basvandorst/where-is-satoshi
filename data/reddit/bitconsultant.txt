It does benefit the consumer tremendously, the rate of identity theft and credit card fraud is running rampant. The banks have to cover those costs somewhere and its becoming increasingly expensive. The banks will be hard pressed NOT to adopt bitcoin, eventually its a zero sum game as the rate of credit card theft will outpace the money needed to stop it. Simply because of the fact that banks are using 40 year old technology. Bitcoin is a natural progression in the technology of money.
Triple entry accounting is the solution and banks will adopt bitcoin, not because it will save the consumer money but because it will save the banks money.

Very well put, saying bitcoins don't have value is like saying proof of work doesn't have value. PoW is the settlement mechanism which replaces trusted third parties. 
This technology use for accounting purposes on a global level is unprecedented and most certainly has value.

Agreed, I help businesses integrate bitcoin and for this reason, and many others, we have stayed far away from coinbase. We always recommend  Bitpay as it is much more professional and easy to use for new businesses. I've had some merchants send me coinbase invoices thinking they were accepting bitcoin when in reality they are only accepting coinbase.

The bitcoin URI is a universal standard.
Bitcoin URIs are formed with a Bitcoin address and some optional parameters, such as amount and label.
Example: bitcoin:19mP9FKrXqL46Si58pHdhGKow88SUPy1V8?amount=1&amp;message=donation
To implement this in html you would use.
&lt;a href="bitcoin:19mP9FKrXqL46Si58pHdhGKow88SUPy1V8?amount=1&amp;message=donation"&gt;Donate Here&lt;/a&gt;
When this link is clicked it will open a bitcoin wallet and automatically populate 1 bitcoin for the amount. 
You can also use the URI with just an address, "bitcoin:19mP9FKrXqL46Si58pHdhGKow88SUPy1V8"

We are down in Portland, OR trying to spread the Bitcoin love. From our experience business owners often cite a lack of demand for not accepting bitcoin. Remember that the only reason these market vendors accept square now is because of the demand, very few people use cash. Also, business owners are not properly educated about the technology, very few if any know that they can instantly cash btc out to dollars. 
However, we have realized that certain businesses, especially restaurants and bars, attract a lot of new local bitcoin customers when they start accepting it. So right now it should really be marketed at attracting new customers and also saving money in the process.

Yes, Electrum is one of the oldest and most secure wallets and it does not require downloading the blockchain. 
However, If you are looking to store large amounts of bitcoins it should always be offline. Any desktop of web wallet should only be used for spending amounts.

This is implied when someone makes a backup. Breadwallet prompts you to "make a backup" by writing down your seed. I wanted the image to be straight forward and less intimidating for new comers. Once they download and install a wallet, they are always prompted to make backups by the wallet itself.

Assuming you are on windows.
1. Install [Malwarebytes]( and scan your pc for malware.
2. Go to  and download the zip file at the bottom. **This will allow you to run the website offline.*
3. Disconnect your computer from the internet.
4. Unzip the bitaddress.org.zip file you downloaded and open bitaddress.org.html
5. Follow the directions and generate a bitcoin address.
6. Save the public (share) key and private (secret) key to a USB or print them out on printer. **Make more than 1 copy.*
7. You can now send your bitcoins to the public (share) key. 
8. **Do not store your private (secret) key on any online computer. Do not lose your private (secret) key. Do not let your private (secret) key get into the wrong hands.**
9. Whenever you want to access and spend your bitcoin download [Electrum]( and import your private (secret) key. 
**Once you do this step your wallet is no longer an offline and you will need to make a new one.*

Complexity is a result of Bitcoin being an emerging technology. There is a lot of minds and money going into simplifying Bitcoin, this includes applying all the emerging security features like bio-metrics. At this last summers Money20/20 Bitcoin was the predominant platform for hack-a-thon participants. A Bitcoin project called [PayperLess]( even won first prize. 
The way I see it is that people will either build on a platform that is 40 years old and broken, or they will build on an open source protocol which is distributed and secure.

Only problem with that, in the context of bitcoin, is that they are confusing merchants and potentially causing them to lose business.
When a merchant sends out a coinbase invoice they think its a bitcoin invoice but in reality it is not. If the customer doesn't want to sign up with coinbase that merchant just lost a sale. 
We work locally in Portland Oregon and have come across this confusion with a many merchants who use coinbase. We actively encourage these merchants to switch to Bitpay and new merchants who we help, we always set them up with Bitpay. The user experience is smoother and their business model is much more inclusive to the bitcoin ecosystem.

The government has labelled bitcoins both a currency and a commodity depending on which label serves them best. For instance in the recent money laundering trials bitcoin was treated as currency. In the eyes of the IRS though, bitcoin is considered a commodity.

That is exactly what is being put forth in this paper. The fact that if enough people speculate that bitcoins are more valuable than fiat the IMF would have no control in stopping this process. Therefore sending fiat into uncontrollable volatility, which for the IMF is catastrophic since its there stated goal to regulate currency exchange rates. 
But as Andreas always says, stability is an illusion.

Bitcoin is not controlled by 5-6 mining companies. You are making a false claim by asserting these mining pools are single entities and not individual miners from around the world. Look at what happened to ghash.io when they got to close to 51%.
Why would I trust central banks to be honest miners and not collude to manipulate the system to their advantage? The past has shown that the private banking industry is not to be trusted and [public trust of central banks has declined dramatically]( and continues to decline. I highly doubt I would be "the only one" who thinks its a bad idea to trust corrupt institutions with a centralized electronic currency.
What matters about Bitcoin is the removal of trusted thirds parties. In order to maintain a decentralized trustless global network there needs to be incentive its as simple as that. People can and will use fedcoin all they want but the business practices of these overtly corrupt central banks will simply encourage many people to use Bitcoin where there is more freedom, control, and privacy.

Also, we are working hard on getting more restaurants and food carts taking bitcoin. If you want to help simply spread the word to your favorite businesses. The number one response we get from business owners is, "No one asks to ever pay with bitcoin so why should we offer it?"
There is a good size bitcoin community here in Portland business owners just don't know it yet.

The problem is that these dispensaries still need bank accounts to buy bitcoin. They could buy OTC or through an ATM but that still leaves them open to high amounts of volatility and paying suppliers. The only proper solution I can think of is using a lock service like Bit Reserve or Coinapult, however there are fees associated with that and limits to how much USD you can lock. Also a problem with getting that money back out to fiat to pay for expenses. 
The only real solution is ubiquitous use of bitcoin among the entire cannabis industry, a closed looped system would be the most efficient and useful. 
If anyone has other ideas for solutions please share, we really want to help service this industry with bitcoin.
