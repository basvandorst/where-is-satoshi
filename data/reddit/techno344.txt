That's not the impression I got. Maybe they are just testing it out, but I think in the future the idea is that you will have both options.

You ask: "Why is there a maximum number of purchases per 24 hour period? They receive your order, they take your money, they purchase the required BTC, and they then provide you your BTC." Here's what people don't understand: They receive your order, THEN purchase the bitcoin, THEN receive your money, THEN provide the bitcoin. Between purchasing the bitcoin and receiving your money, they are pulling money from their reserves - this is why there's a limit. They have to buy the bitcoin and set it aside right when they receive the order to avoid the volatile nature of bitcoin. That's my understanding of the process anyway.

I see these high risk cancelled posts all the time. Contact coinbase and they will take care of it - don't just come to complain on reddit without trying to actually resolve the problem first.

I emailed them about this. They said that by checking that box you get around the 24-hour limit. So you can still buy normally, but if you check the box the 24-hour limit does not apply. It's because they don't have to front the bitcoin for the normal 4 day waiting period, so they can execute as many transactions as they want if you are willing to take the price when the deposit clears. Basically if you're down with taking a future price, you don't have to deal with limits.

If you see the "read more" section it says you can cancel your transaction at any moment between the point of purchase and receiving the coins.
