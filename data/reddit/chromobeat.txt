I have gone through that progress more than 2 times, and my balance still doesn't sync with the client. 
In my receive tab, when I enter the address on blockchain.info, that wallet is empty. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:46:51
I know all that, but the slider on there cannot go any lower than that 5 dollar fee. Where can I further adjust the fee?
Also, what is the "Replaceable" box there?

Update: 
I figured it out in the settings, so I made [this]( transaction:
Which is my 23 dollars and a 1 dollar fee :)
So I am now fully in Bech32 SegWit wallets, so lower transaction fees for me!
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:22:02
Yep, just saw that myself.
Well, fees were low, so no problem with me!
Though I have a question:
When I try to transfer my whole funds to a bech32 address (bc1q77ayptrfz8phaeszhsr4gqh9kz2ardzpdwz45s),
The fees for a 24 dollar transaction are 0.47474 mBTC, WHICH IS 5 BUCKS.
Why are there so high fees in that specific transaction?

I cannot see anything on the "History" tab on electrum.
The wallet on the Receive adress and the only address on the "Addresses" Tab are both empty when I search for them on btc.com.
Is there anything else I can do?

So a watch-only wallet sees the funds, but the private key-generated wallet does not.
So many questions, man.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:04:57
So I was bored, so I transferred all my funds to a separate Electrum Wallet.
1 dollar on fees, not bad.
I plan on transferring that to a SegWit wallet to complete the process.
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:49:55
I don't wanna waste money on the transaction. Will this cost a lot on transactions? 
The 40 bucks transaction from my blockchain.info wallet to a btc.com segwit one costs 7 bucks by the way.
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:00:14
So, I downloaded electrum, and when it asked for the private keys, I pasted mine.
I don't see anything listed anywhere.
What should I do?
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:41:36
So, when I go to export one of my wallets(I had bought a 10dollar bitcoin wallet for 3bucks), I get this: 








I paste the private key to electrum and I don't get anything!
Am I doing anything wrong that I am not seeing?

Lemme explain why nobody uses them in my naiive, middle-school mind: 
1: Buying Bitcoins is **HARD** for normal people.
 In my country, Greece, we only have 3 ATMs. One of them, which I am extremely close to, says it is "closed", and that they are "getting new ones by the end of this week", aka "shit we got 10 BTCs! lemme get rid of them right now with 11k per, and when they fall I will buy new ones".
2: Price is really volatile. It is as unstable as a chair with 2 legs.
Most people my age will think: "Fuck that, that's too complicated for me. Wallets, seeds, apps, log-ins... I prefer cash." or "Damn, this will be realy useful in the long run, better stock up" or "I can get large amounts of it, no country limits, I'mma send my friends bitcoin with small fees and without my parents knowing". 
So there are the people that will not care about Bitcoin, ones that will buy some mB and forget about them, and the ones that will start using it.
That is why Bitcoin Cash in my opinion will thrive as a coin and will become the norm in some years. Smaller fees, quicker transactions, and simple as fuck when they get the mobile wallet app in the app store and play store.

A guy that is a millionaire that just announced his reddit username, probably.
Not sure tho.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:10:51
Under the name of a throwaway person.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:36:02
You mean a throwaway account on a throwaway Computer on a throwaway network on a throwaway city?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:14:05
BTCs*. That shit was crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:20:40
WTF did I just read lmao
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:08:09
I wouldn't use that too, added it for the comedic effect.

Well, I'm 15, and I'm actively trying to spread the word about Bitcoin in my country. Me and my friend made a simple AF coin tracker and we're planning to translate it to our own language so that people that are not that fluent in English terminology can still learn.
I do get this feeling, that people over the age of 35 are negative about crypto, and I'm trying to be an educator for them. I usually start off talking about it with the money transfer scenario, where it would cost 10¢ to transfer 1 million $ to another wallet that could be in another Continent in a matter of seconds.
I believe I've convinced a lot of people, so try that out yourselves, and I think you will manage something!
I also try to maintain some nodes, but I always need to use my raspberry pi for some other projects hahaha
