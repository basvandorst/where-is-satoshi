On the stock market stop losses fuck me more than they help me half the time. They are actually pretty useful with bitcoin most of the time though. 24/7 market means no gaps up or down to screw you.

Trump supporters often also support crypto? Weird. :p

What about it, exactly?

Yep, much more in stocks than bonds since bond rates continue to be a dumpster fire.

As the above were shown to be fraudulent, even those who had entered in very early in the bubble at low prices were forced to sell as it became clear the value was going to zero.

Can confirm, started with ~5% crypto at $400 btc. Am at more than 66% crypto now, even after selling off some to fiat during the last runup. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:26:35
I'm something like 40-30-20-10 BCH, BTC, LTC, ETH...but only because i've taken some bitcoin profits since the fork and BCH just became available on Coinbase. I'll probably be selling some BCH soon.

Consolidation. Next major price move will bring huge volume and clogged network...again.

Interference by government does nothing but slow recoveries.
Was true during the Great Depression and is true today.
Job growth would have been better if they kept their noses out.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:16:38
One goal at a time haha. Let the CBOE and CME get used to trading bitcoin before the next push.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:26:02
We extended the Great Depression through a Trade War and the New Deal.

Good play, I made some ethereum moves this week myself.

Yeah, i'm calling bullshit on that one. We bailed out banks who made bad decisions and were 'too big to fail'. Now they are all twice as big. Wonderful. Should have let them fail and let smaller banks take their place. Sure, would have been worse in the short term, but we didn't fix the original problem, we made it worse.

If you go renewable before pricing parity, prices go up!? Shocker. Lol silly Justin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:17:27
I'm seeing healthy consolidation so far. Pulled back from 20 but no real breakdown (yet). Another push through 20k on tuesday?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:57:01
This. Doubling of users looks the same as DDOS.

I was with you until 'Putinbots'. Rofl.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:56:22
This exactly.
Eliminating debt takes higher priority for me than speculative investments. Especially with bitcoin running up 10x in a year, taking profits and allocating them to debt reduction is probably a good call.

I stand with Ajit Pai on this one.

Depth chart.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:49:22
inb4 btc corrects to 8k as soon as he switches back.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:04:00
Nah, sell orders will appear as soon as 20k is threatened to break. The first 19k runup was because there were no sell walls from 15 to 19 on gdax. might get a nice 20-22k sprint in a few minutes before a correction though, so thatd be nice to literally minute-trade if gdax doesnt go down (again).
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:49:20
1-2T market cap across all crypto in the near-ish (1-2yr) future is not entirely unreasonable. That's what, 2-4 more doublings. 100k is not out of the realm of possibilites.
@_date: 2019-03-01 16:35:56
No excuse for closing an account after a year or two. Fifty years of inactivity, sure. Banks are cancer. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 19:46:31
How so?

Debt:GDP getting too high for my liking. 
The good while is almost up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:00:42
Liquidity was only low because we broke 10k. No big established price walls or supports yet in that range.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:36:05
That's not how any of this works.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:56:09
Oh for sure!

NFLX is another one where there was a boom, bust, and huge boom.

There already exist heavily crypto-tilted hedge funds.
They've been here awhile.

Retrace to sub-2k or even sub-1k would fit 'depression'. 
Don't think we are headed there, but we have definitely not retraced to the start of the 2017 rally.  
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:23:17
Looks more like anxiety on this chart...but I don't think the full cycle executes this time, we just run flat to flat down for several months before the next bull run. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:49:16
Yeah I think 5-6k is a reasonable floor with an 8-10k ceiling for the next few to several months. Unless we get another major catalyst I don't see bull run resuming until late fall or winter. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:27:29
