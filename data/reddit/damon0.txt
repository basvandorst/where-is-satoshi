The same thing would have been said by nearly every financial expert about Bitcoin in 2010.  NEVER say NEVER.

Nothing is a perfect example - arrogance doesn't obscure ignorance
"Why don't you claim that you can alter the speed of light?" - why would I?  I am not making any claims, simply pointing out my opinion - your the claim maker here.
Try explaining in detail how fundamental physics impacting latency on a decentralized system is anything other than a headline without substance?

Many are forgetting the single most important part - the freedom to choose - 2nd and 3rd and 4th foundations of Bitcoin programmers offering alternative solutions or even the possibility of a FORK is what keeps the 'CONTROLLERS' at bay.
If we only had REAL competition for Government and Central Banking the economies of the world might not be nearly as bad and true FREEDOM would still exist.

InstantDEX itself is DeCentralised in that NO ONE has control except those you give control to.  DeCentralised software can trade on a Centralised Exchange, but only if you chose to allow it to trade on a Centralised Exchange.  You could choose to only allow InstantDEX to trade on a DeCentralised Exchange or to trade on a Distributed Exchange such as MGW.  InstantDEX is simultaneously DeCentralised, Distributed and Centralised and you have the scissors to cut whichever cords you want.

It blew thru borders, required no national political approval, was settled without a war, and didn't extract 50% of the wealth of the people to enact.
IT'S A MASSIVE WIN

That sucks (for you), yet it's great in the long term. The legacy systems make the people bend to their will, beg for permission. Bitcoin/Ethereum don't do that, permissionless and exclusionless. This is why they are legacy systems, because it is the beginning of END for them.
