Failure will only come if enough people don't believe in crypto currency.

What about the cost of mining equipment. Can you deduct that cost from the gain? What about electricity, rent and other expenses related to mining, can all of those expenses be deducted? If so, how?

WTF...Why the hell are they paying bonuses? Senior management, after 6 years, needs to be fired.

What laws are you talking about? In what way(s)?

The Justice Department, under Eric Holder, not too long ago, announced that the Feds are working on solutions for legal marijuana business to be able to deposit money into banks. I'm sure their plans will include digital currency transactions.

Ok, I don't know anything about Ron Paul currency legislation so I can only comment on BTC itself. My feelings are that we don't need government approval to use a digital currency as a form of currency. Now, I am no expert on anything but the barter system has been around since, well, before us. And I don't see how that is going to change with officially legalizing digital currency. 
They may try to outlaw digital currency but I don't see what that point would be or if it would be legal to do so.

Not that I get out much, but what merchants have stopped accepting? Once everything is in place to accept dig. payment why would anyone stop accepting it? This is the question because you don't have to do anything to maintain it.

Yes, deposit insurance. I was being factious but I like that idea. If you can find an insurer to insure you, that would be great and a industry first. You know those insurances companies, they are always looking for ways to make money, I mean, insure people/things.

Now, all you need, is FDIC. BTW, thanks for the Starbucks Gift Card.

7000 is not the end of the world. Its not like your are incapable, young and can't make it make and much more. Most of us have made some bad investment decisions, one time or another and we are still around. You have a short term financial problem that may delay your studies until you can work your way out of debt. And if you think about what happened to you, that doesn't mean it was your fault. You were, in a way, a victim of this crisis, like many others. Work your way out of debt and get back up on your feet.

This really sucks because I see bitcoins or digital currency as property similar to a car or a house, etc. Or, if you want to trade a dollar bill for 100 pennies, I thought you should be able to do that as well. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

Horseshit until someone is being prosecuted. Thanks for the response though.

I am assuming that "encrypted currency exchanges" or just "currency exchanges" refers to businesses that trade fiat for digital currency. 
Is it legal for a person on the street to sell one BTC to John Doe on the street or must a person register before they can legally sell BTC on the street? Does the "street" include the internet, so if the seller and buyer wanted to sell/buy over the internet, would the seller have to register?
If a seller has one million BTC and wants to sell them over the internet, but doesn't want to establish a business to sell them or an exchange, can said seller sell them without registering? Is that illegal?
When does the individual become a business that would require registration?

If the NFL can do it, I know Cyrpto "property" can too.

Can you imagine being the inventor of the future world currency?

They can make it illegal, using bitcoins to gamble but I highly doubt that they will be able to enforce any such law.

How does this response affect MTGox decision to register with FinCEN, if at all?
