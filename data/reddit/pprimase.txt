The more important question is, when mining became so centralized, what's the difference between BTC blockchain vs. private blockchain such as the one that Citi bank is developing. When Citi Bank's private blockchain comes out, why would you rather believe in the BTC blockchain, which is almost private to Chinese miners? **On incoming Citi's blockchain, although you cannot mine, you know there is Citi or its insurance to backup the risks. On BTC blockchain, you not only cannot mine, but also need to take risks on your own.** At that point, average joe might leave BTC for the Citi-coin.
So why not change the protocol to allow decentralized mining? (Because current Chinese miners will veto). I argue it's how decentralized system became centralized and lose its spirit.

I don't see it either. In China, one does not just follow laws. Instead, one need to "guess" how to please the authorities and act accordingly. Therefore, there are many "hidden laws" in China that is more effective then the "written laws".

But if we see it put the option back, it would be a very positive sign.

Yes. The transaction fee is kinda equal bank fee now.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:30:05
How to pay transaction fee? My QT sometimes pop a message says 0.00001 BTC fee is required. But another time my QT just send my BTC out.
The one with fee takes 20min. The one without fee takes 70min. I would always like to pay the fee. But how?

When the rich get on hold of something, innovation stops. I feel Wiki is in it's stagnation phase of creativity. It still fails to see BTC as a donation source.

is not there any law stopping BFL messing with consumers? They delayed the order so much.  Nobody can even break even now.

Nice explanation. Thanks. We need more Econ people here.

America controls the breath of world economy because most international trades, including oil are accounted in US dollar. Therefore USA can control the value for the most of international goods. If bitcoiner still watch BTC in USD, you will never be free from the Fiat. Use it, hold it what ever. Do not let USD value control your opinion, or you will never be free.
For example, if federal reserve prints twice more USD cash and make BTC worth double of current USD value, does it mean BTC are more valuable?

what's a better way to fund an BTC exchange account?
@_date: 2013-07-06 06:27:36
In future, I think when the dispute-resolution mechanism is as ok as paypal+ebay, Craigslist+ BTC is going to be my dream commerce model. I hope it can happen. I really think paypal fee+ ebay fee is a double ripoff.

In fact, profitability: buy BTC straight&gt; buy 520G/s KnC for $5k &gt; buy BFL 500g/s rig for $20k.
Anyway, just google before you buy BFL. HA.

FYI, Yuan is not a freely trade currency. It is hard to trade Yuan/USA already. Don't mention BTC/Yuan/USD.

The amount you can buy and sell are very limited.
@_date: 2013-09-01 21:19:15
I have BTC, but don't know where is the best to sell? Might I learn from you where are you going to sell if profit comes? Gox, Base, Stamps or others? THX
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:01:28
I agree. It is just plain irresponsibly dumb of Conbase.

thank you for sharing this chart. I don't like Gox short term chart either.

do what you like as long as it harms no one==&gt;It's hard to define.
Does owing a gun harm people? No, but until when the owner sometimes has psychotic attach. 
Does using marijuana harm people? No, but marijuana introduces problematic drugs and social issues to complicate everything.
However anarchistic ones are, they need rules as long as they share the same environment, which will become government-like eventually.
Instead, I propose to make the law more prone to people instead of big $$.
All current elections are funded by big $$, of course the elected person works for the big $$ not the 99%.
