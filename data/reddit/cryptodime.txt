Are you being serious?
I read that exact whitepaper.
Please show me somewhere in that paper that details how the company makes its money?
All these things it gives, 5% cashback, 8% interest, and staking the MCO token. What does staking mean besides buy our token and promise to not sell it for 6 months? For what? Besides freezing it in hopes of offsetting sell pressure whilst you build up buy pressure to skyrocket the price. For a big exit scam? Because that's exactly what bitconnect did.
I'm not claiming this is a scam just yet. But it'd be a bit better if the company detailed a single bit of information on how it makes money to pay for all of this. Please point to any page in the whitepaper where it enlightens us about how it makes money. Thanks.

@_date: 2019-07-16 21:17:51
It's not just the charging of fees, but the subtle requirements to waive the fees, such as requiring a balance so the banks can print more money based on your deposits. And if you can't make the minimum balance, that's okay, because banks love nothing more than wage slaves that continue to use them as their main account. Meanwhile, they continue to buy up smaller banks and grow.
I might think it's wrong and agree that it should be a dying strategy. But the current model is not of fees but of control. And they are doing that exceedingly well. The major banks are posting unstoppable profits, growth, and acquisition for decades now.

I recall when this came out. I don't remember what the exact thing he said was, nor does it matter. CSW said in some presentation that P of something (in math, P is usually used as a probability, hence it must be between 0 and 1) was negative. So Vitalik points this out, and asks why someone who can claim that a probability is less than zero is allowed at the conference, because that very much makes him a fraud. CSW is someone who uses "science babble" to confuse "normies" but it doesn't actually hold up under any scrutiny from any middle schooler fresh out of math class.

1. It's 144 blocks in 24 hours, not 240.
2. Looking over the past few weeks, I'd say that 60EH/s is a bit on the low side, but I'll agree to 60 for the purpose of this exercise.
    AttackerSuccessProbability(0.003,1)=0.00600449
    AttackerSuccessProbability(0.003,2)=4.50358e-05
    AttackerSuccessProbability(0.003,3)=3.5127e-07
So I assume the probability above is the chance of success starting at any single block, given 144 blocks per day, then
    1-(1-.00600449)^144=0.579895958
    1-(1-.0000450358)^143=0.00641957
    1-(1-.00000035127)^142=0.000049879
So your numbers are not completely out of bounds but probably off by a factor of 2 (144 instead of 240 blocks), possibly 4 (hashrate of 75EH/s instead of 60).

You have the option of coin joining your BTC. It's your BTC. The banks don't have that option in an open ledger as they are custodians of their BTC.

2. At which point, you reply with "well it's a dumb example anyways because the entire premise of the article is false as why would banks be involved with bitcoin!" Well, there are indeed financial institutions that deal with bitcoin, including a bond that was just announced recently (

I'm really asking here.
As someone who has always installed only the core wallets and not used alternative implementations for bitcoin, is the general accepted route to running a full node for ethereum to run alternative wallets?
It seems utterly bizarre to me that I can't get the core wallet to sync in any reasonable amount of time. I just checked again and I'm still looking at a 2 month sync time. If you take time to read my post, I am far from a novice user and I am even overcommitting a large amount of resources towards this wallet.

btc is not just held in addresses, but in inputs in addresses..
for example, let's say 2 friends send you 1 and 2 btc respectively..
now you send out 1.5 btc, on the blockchain, you will likely use the 2 btc input, so you send out 2 btc, 1.5 goes to your recipient and .5 goes to a newly created change address, which your wallet adds to your list of keys.. now you have .5 in your change address and 1 btc in your original address..
if you ever use the core wallet, try enabling "coin control features" and you will be able to quickly see this in detail..

BTC doesn't HAVE to do anything.
If it becomes unprofitable after a halvening, the miners with the most inefficient power costs will drop out.
Those with efficient power would make more from both having less competition as well as the hashrate going down so difficulty also goes down.
Others then also seek out more efficient power setups and rejoin until it reaches equilibrium again.
This is like high school supply/demand graph level difficulty to understand. The price has almost nothing to do with hashrate but the hashrate does not affect price because the hashrate increase or decrease does not affect supply of bitcoin.

There's only 2-4 million from 5.1 to 8.5k because there aren't a lot of idiot people who would tie up their liquidity for what is an unlikely event. Is it likely that bitcoin will hit 7.5k at 4:45pm today? No right? So why the fuck would people put millions of dollars into an exchange wallet and leave it there in some high ass sell order that will never happen?
You better believe if bitcoin tried to go up to 8k today with no new innovation or business opportunities, that a whole lot more sell orders would go up every single step of the way and a bunch of people dumping it back down. We're at 80 billion, adoption happens a lot more slowly and the majority of sell orders will always be near the gap. There's no sudden magic number you spotted after which bitcoin will zip straight to the moon.
Or here's the TLDR dummy response: do you think that the order books you see now will be the same order books until 8k? Obvious...
Second TLDR bigger dummy response: how many people are selling from 1 to 9million right now? Does that mean once bitcoin hits 1 million, it will jump instantly to 9 million?

To add to my original comment (which I know adds nothing to the conversation), here is a nearly foolproof method for anyone to do the same:
Generate a 24 word seed and do NOT look at it. Put it into 24 different pieces. Wait a day. Tomorrow, look a the first word and just think about the word. Construct the beginning of a story with that word. Every day, look at the following word of the seed and add it somehow to your story. Occasionally think about what number word that is so you know to move along the plot of your story accordingly. By the last word, you should be wrapping it up, B!
On the 25th day, you will have memorized a story that you should keep with you for life.
Of course, depending on how good your memory is, you can do this faster or whatever. But remember that human memory degrades and changes with access, so be sure to tell yourself the story sometimes to refresh it. The key is time and repetition.

I feel the opposite. If all of North Korea starves to death while that shitbird gets more power at the expense of his people, it is not a good thing.
Given Ver's manipulation and escalating the rhetoric while NOT shorting BTC, shorting BCH would seem to be logical next step. But if he does, it will be a sad event that he fooled a bunch of people into walking off a cliff.
Lastly, I would not attribute this to intelligence. It does not take intelligence to cheat people. It simply takes greed and more power/wealth than conscience.

option  (judging): Apparently, bitcoin makes you condescending as fuck. You have a bit of wealth and suddenly you're fucking siddhartha, get the fuck out of here. If you were truly "free" and "far from all the materialism and the w..." (can't even finish typing this without laughing), then bitcoin wouldn't even enter into the equation.
option  (jk): If this rando girl on the beach chose to go with you to your beach house, she wouldn't be free. Because holy shit rapey vibe much?
option  (srs): Don't overdo it on the whole freedom thing. It's the most fortune cookie garbage that bullshit artists like to peddle. Personal freedom, like happiness, is something each individual person must aspire to at their own pace and amount in their own personal conversation, not something for others to communicate externally.

So you can easily use this as an estimator. 2^256 =~ 2^10*25.6 =~ 10^3*25.6 =~ 10^77. Calculator will tell you 1.15792*10^77.

Yeah, but as I said, I take a good amount of bitcoin as income from mining and interest.
FIFO means any btc I take out to pay for the taxes are from 0 basis from years ago.
With LIFO, I already pay income (which is same as short term). 1/4 goes to taxes, 1/2 goes to hodl, 1/4 goes to spending.
With the current sideways action, it averages out and there's actually very little short term capital gains I pay.
On the other hand, my hodl stash of bitcoin from years ago will never see taxes at all (because I don't plan to engage them in a taxable event).
FIFO vs LIFO, just depends on your situation. LIFO works great for me. Others may prefer FIFO if they don't make more than they spend.

Meanwhile, market cap, when averaged across all exchanges, has moved, on average, 2.5 million dollars. Math, it fucking works.

If the order is known, then I would argue it is not 2^256.
It may be a terrible idea to do so but one example would be that the order is always known because the seed words are sorted alphabetically. So then it would be 24!/(12!12!).

You seemed to discount vpns due to your time series, but this is a very limited view of what vpns are capable of.
1. With traffic shaping, blocks could be allowed to trickle keeping bitcoind just a couple hours behind.
2. bitcoind can be set to listen on vpn interface only without upstream route, allowing only connections to a mirrored daemon on other side. This would allow manual control of sync when necessary.
Lastly, you guys should make mention of the blockstream satellite, which was basically created to solve this sort of problem.

I'll start with the easier analogy...
During the gold rush, the people who made the most money were the ones selling the shovels.
But I assume that one's not good enough for you, then I'll just move onto the truth.
I assume you're in high school? Perhaps you've taken a single economics course where they focus on a single type of chart and use that to explain how it relates to everything? And so you've thought about this and you discovered "the secret". The single greatest recipe in the world for making money. Great. Go do it?
Why can't you do it now? There are still companies making mining machines. So you could be there doing it too, except you have the secret to success: keep ninety-eight machines for yourself while only selling two. Wait, that doesn't work? Why not? Maybe because...
1. Opportunity cost is the easiest. Your secret to success isn't really a secret to success because it's fucking dumb and if you were actually smart enough to have come across the right balance to succeed in this business, you could be making a lot more money than being the ceo of shitcorp that makes mining machines and competes at the bottom vs companies that are bleeding you dry by being better...
2. ...competition. The companies doing it are doing it way better. You think you're better than them? They've been tried, tested and true for years. Those that suck make mining machines for shitcoins because they can't compete at making bitcoin machines. Do you know the first fucking thing about the amount of money it takes to hire chip designers, research, keep updated on the current nanotechnology and wafering techniques that about a few thousand people in the world understand so that you can then overrule everyone with your decision because you're going to steer this ship into booty bay?
3. Do you understand economies of scale? How much money do you have? Maybe your parents have money and you convinced your mom to refinance her house so you can dump $200,000 down the toilet on your first run. Oh shit, you don't know people in the industry. You didn't even read the blog by David Vorick where he talks about how they tried making asics and got their project delayed by months and then ultimately cancelled and their final lesson was that they couldn't even make asics in China. They ended up going to Mexico because they don't know the industry and got blackballed from an entire country for no reason.
4. And now you've lost your entire first run. What was your objective again? Was it to make money? Because you're $200k in the hole and you have nothing to show for it. You've wasted a year getting this production run that's ended up costing 2x or 3x the cost and it's come too late and your product arrived late to market and no one's going to buy it. Was it to win? Because there's no goddamn way you're going to win because you now realize you were clueless against giants. Was it to survive and become a pillar to the community? How? You're oblivious to the basics of economics which would have shown you why all this was a bad idea from the very beginning.
And those four things have always been true since 2013. Starting with the first asics that came out for bitcoin, there's tons of history for you to read there. Go google the history of bitcoin asics and find out which of the thirty some odd projects you would be qualified to manage and bring to life. You'll find smart people who knew and understood bitcoin six years ago when you were still in elementary school and they threw away their blood and effort trying to make something and still failed in the market. If only they had your secret huh?

There's a 50% chance of them it happening if they get to attempt it 144 times.
There's not a 50% chance that they can do it anytime they want. Unless they're like, be ready anytime today, and we must immediately do the exchange within 10 minutes of when I say we start, you likely won't lose your transaction in this type of attack..
Still, 1 confirmation is not always safe. Even without attacks, there are chain reorgs sometimes that happen when there are 2 blocks simultaneously mined.
You should always wait for 2+ minimum.
Lastly, this requires a bit of technical knowledge, but if you can see the transaction hit the mempool, check that 1. it's not RBF and 2. It has a reasonable tx fee for the current mempool. Check 
If these two check out, you're more likely not getting scammed.

While I own a dozen pis that I use for various projects (including one that monitors temperatures in an oil submerged mining setup), I'd agree with OP that there are many reasons why an old laptop is better suited for running a node.
1. Storage. Hard drives should never be interfaced through USB. And critical data should never be stored on external drives. External drives have variety of heat dissipation issues and are not meant to be run 24/7. Where do you store the critical data on the pi? On the sd card? There are many more robust recovery solutions for a hd than an sd card. HDs fail in very well documented scenarios that hold true across all the vendors and models. Not so for sd cards.
2. Redundancy. Laptop can have cdrom pulled out and a 2nd disk caddy put in for raid1 setup. This would be critical for running a lightning setup where loss of channels is possible during a disk outage.
3. Power. I've plugged in usb wifi keys into the pi and triggered reboots. Pis are super sensitive to power draws from usb. Laptop comes with built in UPS.
4. Price. You can pick up a super reliable lenovo t430 for like $50 if you're patient. I've picked up t420's for $20 before on ebay. (With local pickup). You can pack those up to 16gb ram and running quad corei7. It has a built k/v/m so less peripherals to worry about. This ends up being comparable with picking up a pi and buying keyboard, mouse, monitor.
5. Encryption. You have more control over the bootloader on a laptop. You can do full disk encryption. I don't think it's currently possible with a pi.
The main con of using a laptop is the heat. Old laptops have shitty fans that should be replaced and crusty ass thermal paste that should be re-applied in order for it to run smooth under load.

Next week, he couldn't figure out how to back up his private keys and ended up typing them into some web wallet where they promptly stole all his money. He's going to lodge a complaint at the better business bureau against the bitcoin core developers because they didn't create a good enough UX and easy enough app for him.

I heard about this amazing new tech. It's an entire monetary system based on cryptography and math. How a consensus can create a network so powerful that it is unhackable and immutable. It can free us from government manipulation of currency.
So naturally, I walked down to my local gas station and bought some from some machine there. That was easy. Research? What research? Why should I do any... wait, what are these fees?
Are you telling me that machine (that I have no idea who owns or operates) next to the casino gambling machines charged me some outrageous fucking fees!?!?!? Noooooooo... how could it have possible happened?

My answer is not for the OP but for others with similar question in the US.
Yes. It is taxable.
Any exchange of property (which all crypto is) is a taxable event.
Unless you apply for a like-kind exchange. But this was specifically excluded in a tax bill at end of 2017. So 2018 onwards, any sale of crypto is a taxable event for the US dollar armount of the trade.

I'm in the US. I probably use wires domestic or internationally once a month. It's always a joke. Can't initiate wires on the weekend. Have to wait until M-F 9-4 (It's not 9-5 because the bank boys need to go home you know). Takes 3 days. Fees are unknown. The sending party takes a fee but then there's a fee on the receiving end that I can't know what it is as it's dependent on their bank.
But banks are second layer to your first layer cash. And LN is second layer to first layer bitcoin. LN is programmatic secured and instant. It's better than banks in every single way. Please make a point to discuss this point in future replies as I feel like I'm simply repeating it.

Update on Feb 22 19:00 UTC below this post
I'm not saying this is a scam, but can you please point out a page on the actual domain blockfi.com that references the blockfi.typeform.com link?
A quick glance has not shown me where it is on the actual blockfi.com site. Meanwhile, the article from bitcoinmagazine references it from 2 months ago saying nothing more than they plan to do it. And both the form and the T&amp;C doc are offsite (on other domains)? Meanwhile, you're typing in all sorts of personal info and your ssn into the form which may be going to someone else.
Also, it asks for SSN but then says to put in all 1s if you're not US citizen. There are people who are not US citizens who have SSNs, which makes this question weirdly ambiguous and unlikely that a financial institution would make such a mistake, nor say something like "put all 1's if you're not us citizen".
Also also, neither the company news or blog mention this. And the reddit account to post this is OpSecThrowaway3, a 1 week old account.
Red flags going up here.

I only took a glance before I saw the gist of your post and wanted make two points.


Why is it that whenever people talk about bandwidth, they assume that all a node does is transfer blocks once?
This calculation means that 1 (unaccounted for) system takes on the entire bandwidth burden of sending all blocks to every single other bitcoin node that does nothing else but receive blocks.
This doesn't take into account other bandwidth uses, including the mempool, peer discovery. Why not run a bitcoin full node for a day and look at your actual bw used?
Speaking as someone who has actually worked with multi-petabyte systems and almost all of the distributed filesystems that scale, you apparently know nothing about hard drives except that they exist and what the amazon price is. You shouldn't be talk about scaling bitcoin if you can't even understand scaling hard drives.
Do you understand what kind of hardware is required to maintain that amount of storage? How about what kind of networking? And what does rescanning the blockchain entail?
You can't take a r/btc headline like "herp derp 8tb external usb hd for $70 can store bla bla bla" and extrapolate that to how this would work at real world scales.

You're wrong. I assume you're new to the internet. Anyone who knows what google is can easily find twenty... count all your fingers and toes... **twenty** years worth of horror stories of paypal seizing their money for no reason and holding it for months, years, and ever behind a bunch of asinine requests that don't make sense.
If you took time to read my original post and try to comprehend, my argument is that money in paypal is not cash in hand. It is not base layer, as bitcoin is. Your banks are a custodial second layer, which have their own KYCAML rules which are subject to different laws depending on country. And paypal is a *private company* running a third layer.
It would be trivial if both parties had an "account" on a third layer bitcoin company for any transfers there to be instant as well.
LN is a second layer that is instant and more secured than both of these. As for your point about wire transfers. I know you didn't just bring wire transfers, which are only available during 9-5 local time. And they take how long? As for the security of name checking. That's not programmatic. It's up to the discretion of the bank whether they want to release that wire or be dicks (legally) and keep the money.
Nothing about banks and their various custodial layers can be even remotely considered secured money. Bitcoin is always secured money. Second layer LN is secured programmatically, instant and better than second layer banks in every single way.

So, I spoke to a blockfi chat person. Here is the transcript:
    bf: Welcome to BlockFi, please let me know if you have any questions!
    me: Hi.
    me: Can you confirm that there is a form to sign up for a bitcoin interest account?
    bf: Of course! We're in the process of launching the product. The BIA is currently in beta and invites were extended to existing customers of BlockFi and their referrals
    bf: The BIA is launching publicly first week of March
    bf: Did you get an invite?
    bf: Happy to onboard you or answer any questions
    me: I received information about this from a friend, he sent me a link to sign up, but it was at an external domain, typeform.com and the T&amp;C doc at another domain, docdro.id.
    me: I was hoping you could confirm those are legit.
    bf: The T&amp;C's will be sent to you when we send you the beta invite. To prevent people tampering with the typeform, we usually send it out. May I have your email so we can send you the beta invite?
    me: Thanks! My email is [redacted].
    bf: The beta invite is on a typeform for now. However, in the first week of march, we will have a redesigned homepage and dashboard for both our products.
    me: Great. Thank you very much for your help.
    bf: What's your first name for our records by the way
    me: [redacted]
    me: Thanks!
    bf: You'll receive an email from us shortly
    me: Have a nice day.
I got this email super quick. It gave me 2 urls, one for personal and one for business and both were on typeform but the generated urls were different. I suspect they generate new urls for everyone.
The doc from OP's checksum matched the ones they sent to me via email, which was from a different site so I assume the docdro.id was something OP uploaded.
My email also had a one page document that I uploaded here:
In conclusion. It seems legit but I can't vouch for original typeform link. Anyways, there's no reason you should follow any links from here. You should initiate a chat with a blockfi rep and ask for an email so they can send you your own link.
Happy Friday everyone!

I get it seems super fishy, but are you sure you typed in the auth into their site?
Usually, with things like this, (I don't know plaid but looking at the demo on the webpage, it looks pretty similar to Zelle), you're not actually giving them your auth but logging into a page of your actual bank that then allows them to access your account. That part is still sketchy. But I doubt anything your bank actually works/partners with would allow their customers to type in their auth for their bank into a 3rd party site.

Anyone willing to read a bunch of mental gymnastics instead of just demanding to see the FUCKING keys doesn't belong in crypto.
There's tons of documented proof of all the times csw did try to fake emails, timestamps, and fake key signings with typos to try to fool people.

You're going to email a bunch of old people who don't know the shit about computers a bunch of private keys holding coins.
Are they forced to receive it? Can you make them understand it? Are they obligated to then install a wallet and then sweep the keys?
What % would you estimate is going to take your bait?
And then even if they do take it because you made it worth their while. You send some senator 1 btc and they take it. Are they obligated to care about forks?
You own 0.0001 btc, did you bother to sweep all 44 bitcoin forks and install their software and sync their blockchains and sell off your forked coins?
No? Why not?
Because just because a coin forked doesn't mean that you immediately came into possession of usable currency you say?
Because there exists a barrier of knowledge required to undertake the receiving of such coin?
Because you don't know how many of those 44 are actually scams designed with a trojaned wallet to get greedy people to divulge private keys?
You're not forced to take any forked coins. You certainly can't simply send someone else some gibberish of a private key and suddenly they are obligated to have skin in the game and also forced to claim all forked coins and pay taxes on them.
Did you simply skip through all of these steps and simply think "gotcha!" when you got this dumb ass idea?

$25 to get your precious kyc. Oh noes. What does that even mean? Your data is already available for a hell of a lot cheaper from any of the large credit bureaus. Or it's available for free to many of the hackers who already have access to that data.
Assuming this is a trustworth exchange (I don't know/care), this is just a free $25 for signing up. Lots of places (legitimate banks) use the same tactic for new customers. It's not some nefarious plan.

In my explicitly stated trivial example (trivial implies basic and simple, not how many contestants you were expecting which has nothing to do with this), if there are only two entries, $4815.16 vs $1 to $9000000000, can you explain "mathematically" who is the winner?

The mathematical view is that to be fair all participants should be allowed an equal number of guesses or guesses to be of equal value.
The guess of 4815.162342 should be given equal weight as a guess of 4700-4950, making it 4690.16-4940.162342.

If one cared this much about storing their private keys, one should simply memorize them.
Also, "bitcoin millionaires" are not the target audience who stash their coins in this place. There are plenty of bitcoin millionaires out there, people who own ~182 btc at the present price, who don't even bother with a fraction of this amount of security.
The target audience for this are just rich people who don't know anything about security and have to pay for it. Or it's people who are connected and already have access to this amount of security. They might as well throw in their btc in there as well.

1. asicboost cannot be used covertly on mainchain anymore (edit: with segwit transactions)
2. limit = how many empty blocks can be mined while claiming the same old lie that it's because of mining too quickly to keep up appearance of not using asicboost
3. freemoney = multiplier for asicboost still used in otherchain
profit = (freemoney\*limit)\*bch + (1-limit)\*btc
If we want to stop the empty blocks, just look at the equation.
It's easy to see what must happen in order to make (1-limit)\*btc &gt; (freemoney\*limit)\*bch.

What you're missing is that everyone is answering your question but you keep on asking a different one in hopes of a different answer.
Here's what you want to know. Yes, it's super easy to cheat on your taxes but if you choose to do so, that's you deciding to cheat your neighbors. You're not sticking it "to the man". You're deciding to steal money from your neighbors.
You didn't come up with some genius method to avoid taxes. I assure you that cheating on taxes is a crime committed since the beginning of time, when the universe decided that there must be taxes. It's not some novel new method you thought up, it's pedestrian, and boring and born out of nothing but jealousy and greed.
You want to know why a bunch of libertarians aren't cheering you on in r/bitcoin for cheating on your taxes? Because the majority of us aren't complete dicks and we pay for the roads we drive on, and the fire stations that keep our entire cities from burning down, and the schools our children go to. Cheat on your taxes if you want, but don't tell everyone else in line that you're skipping in front of them.
More than likely, the amount of taxes you plan to cheat on is not even worth my time to type up this response and I've just wasted it to rant. Good riddance.

It's an action that hides the state of the system. While them injecting 53B and then another planned 75B is not the same as the headline, "printing 128B out of thin air", it is nonetheless, a form of QE.
Every night, banks that don't meet their 10% fractional reserve quota have to borrow money from other banks that have surplus deposits. As more banks need to borrow from surplus, the rates go up. The fed wants this rate to stay between 2 and 2.25% to show a healthy fractional reserve. It was at 2.29% last week and this week hit 5%. This indicates a lot of banks are having to borrow.
The FED stepped in and said, don't worry, I have 53 billion dollars in my pocket I just baked in the oven. You can borrow it from me at 2.25%. Tomorrow, I'll take it back and so it's not QE.
But it is QE. Just because QE - QT = 0 doesn't mean that QE doesn't exist. The fact that QE != 0 means that the economy is worse than it looks.

Has Paxful or BitGo mentioned anything about "proving origin of the transaction"? I assume that's just a point you've created and are trying to hold onto to make progress. Whoever said Poloniex wouldn't divulge account information is also correct. This would put their money transmitter license in jeopardy.
I (and pretty much everyone else in this thread) are trying to tell you there's no progress to be made. I'm not giving you a roadmap of points you need to reach on your way to get your money back. I know nothing concrete about Paxful or BitGo's internal workings.
What I do know is that I can't think of a single reason why anyone from all positions at all technical and managerial levels with any of the three companies involved, Poloniex, Paxful, and BitGo, would take the time and effort to help you. This is not to be mean in that you don't deserve help. But that the cost to them as a business in terms of liability is astronomical and their gain would be zero.

You can see you have 9 outgoing connections, which is more than adequate to download blocks.
It'd be nice if you did forward the port and ran a full node accepting incoming connections but you don't need to do this just to sync.

You're making 50k. Don't expect people living in other states to understand your plight. To them, you have a good job, just mean old California is holding you down with all the socialist taxes. But the truth is that your job fucking sucks and you suck too. No good job here pays 50k.
You're actively rejecting the paths which may find you success because they're too much of a gamble. But the person you're not betting on is yourself. And I hope you'd agree that it feels horrible. When you've had enough of this horrible feeling, change your attitude and make some bets on yourself.
It's even worse when you're blaming the "mismanagement of government and unlimited currency printing" on your problems. Those are slow problems that affect society, not yuppies.
Cost of living is at an ALL TIME HIGH due to the market. Simply put, there are more jobs in the Bay Area than there is housing. That's what happens when we're the 5th largest economy in the world.

It is your time to waste. And I don't mind answering your questions.
I just mean I don't understand what you mean by proving the origin/originator of the transaction. Do you mean getting Paxful to acknowledge that they received the money from Poloniex? I don't think you'd be able to force them to concede on this point.
You can't prove receipt of the transaction unless it moves. So I guess you could spend your life watching this UXTO and hoping it gets moved. If it does, you have a case and you might be able to sue. But why would Paxful or BitGo move the UXTO? They'd have to break all the procedural and engineering hurdles to do so and it would not be worth it.
I'm just speaking as someone who has worked in a professional capacity with some top secret and dod certified projects as a contractor. The amount of red tape that exists is huge and I don't disagree with some of it. The some of it I wouldn't disagree with is for cases like this. There's no reason for anyone involved to help you. I assume you're young. As you work and rise to the top of your industry, you'll think back on this case and understand why as well.

Market rates set by poloniex/bitfinex are usually in the range of 0.01% compounded daily, making it a 3.15% return per year. 2.25% is 0.0061% compounded daily, which is not too far out.
0.9% per day is basically a loan shark for your margins. That's really on the institution.
While the banks do use these loans to skirt around not having enough reserves, they (all banks) do collectively have at least the required amount so that is a limiting factor of how much they can borrow.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:04:54
Yes to both of those but the "higher" part is relative to the market rate.
The market rate is being set by how many people are funding/lending/longing vs people who are borrowing/shorting. I think that we see a pretty high bias, rates for bitcoin being so low, because we're looking on bitcoin based exchanges. Bitcoin holders don't have as much options to get exposure to other markets (stocks) so everyone lends, either directly on exchanges or through the new lending platforms that are popping up in 2019.
USD holders have exposure to every single market available. Bitcoin exchanges are a very small volatile and risky world compared to well established stock exchanges.
And of course, there's the fluctuation of bitcoin market dominance that plays into this when altcoins pump and dump.

Andreas Antonopoulos answered this rather eloquently in a video which I always struggle to remember the name of.
I'll paraphrase his response:
The basis for most wealth in the world right now is whose grandfather killed more people in the past. With bitcoin, a new system was introduced and people were free to see value and become part of the price discovery. Those people may have gotten immense gains from the risk they chose to take early on, but by the same token, if bitcoin crashes tomorrow, are you going to be the one to bail those people out? No...?

I did a quick calculation and I came up with something similar to igadjeed's answer.
Assuming 36mh/s on a cpu, 36gh/s makes $0.04481 per day. So 36mh/s makes $0.00004481 which means it takes 61.14 years to mine $1. So pretty close.
Of course, the reality is that you would never get anything at all because your "dell server" would never be able to get accepted shares on a pool. And you'd never be able to reach payout threshold anyways.
Lastly, there are usb devices that cost $20 and do about 100x what your "dell server" does at about 1/10th the power consumption.

The disk usage is it putting the transactions into the databases. You can see the database files in the chainstate directory. This process is super IO heavy, hence the IO wait.
But the bigger issue is that you mentioned you only have 120gb. This is a hard blocker for you if you want to run a full node.
    du -scBG {blocks,chainstate,indexes}
    252G	blocks
    4G	chainstate
    22G	indexes
    277G	total
Running a full node that doesn't prune requires 255GB at the moment (an extra 22GB if you have index on).
The other thing is what model hard drive you have. 120gb is small enough that it makes me wonder if you have a super old generation of sata or maybe even a pata drive. Those drives will likely be okay once you're synced but for processing the entire blockchain would be brutal. If you can get your hands at all on any newer drive, I'd suggest doing the initial sync on another drive, and then copying the chainstate back to the old drive (again, assuming you're pruning since it can't hold the entire blockchain). I noticed that you're getting about 10MB/s at the best of times from your graph, which lends more to the scenario that your disk is pretty old and will probably lengthen a full sync by a few multipliers.
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:59:51
Yeah, both poloniex and bitfinex do not allow the margin/lending parts to US customers because of compliance with US laws. Same with bitmex, which I think has a funding interest rate of between 0.03% and 0.06% per day for their XBTUSD swaps.
Before the ban on US customers, it was a bitcoin printing machine.
@_date: 2019-09-04 22:06:00
How can I explain? Let's see.
If you have 9 open connections but aren't getting enough blocks, then try banning those ips so you can connect to other ones. Do you want to debug? Try the getpeerinfo command and checking to see if those are valid nodes on the list of open bitcoin nodes.
Set maxconnections= higher, maybe find high bandwidth bitcoin nodes and use addnode= to specify what nodes you want.
Tail -F your debug.log. Following that will tell you what the last thing your core client is currently doing.
Maybe set onlynet=ipv4 if you don't have an ipv6 addr on your system so your core client doesn't waste time connecting to ipv6 addresses for which you have no route.
Or.... maybe the other guy is absolutely right and the answer to all your questions lies with opening your port so you can also accept incoming connections. Do that. Forward port 8333 to your system. You'll be running an open node as well. This won't hurt. You'll be helping the bitcoin network. I highly recommend this.
Instead of the onus being on me explaining, you should understand. Go to google and search the bitcoin core client. Learn all you want about it. It's what I did many years ago as well. Welcome to bitcoin.

Nah. In 2017, there was an altcoin boom, most of the altcoin traders would borrow bitcoin to buy altcoins during all their pumps and dumps.
During pumps, daily rates spiked up to .2%-.4% daily. This happened 1-4 times a month.
Compounded daily, this is between 100% - 250% return annually. Didn't need to touch altcoins to make an ez penny lending bitcoins to others doing it.

Man I miss the days when poloniex and bitfinex were available to US customers. You're right that it has no relationship to the federal rate. I was just using the rates as an example that they are much closer to each other than the aforementioned 0.9% per day. That's near bitconnect levels, which were 1% daily. I was trying to kindly say that it was that place scamming people.
edit: Wow, I just looked and while bitfinex is at 0.032% daily, poloniex is at 0.0032 (0.9977% annually). Guess no one borrowing on poloniex anymore.
edit2: Nevermind, bitfinex is also lending at 0.0026% per day for bitcoin. It was USD I was looking at that was doing 0.032% daily, which is 12.4%. That's normal for USD, which is in high demand ATM.

has brought up a really good point.
Another one to add is the procedural angle.
BitGo has $100 million dollar insurance. This insurance is SPECIFIC to them losing assets due to a hack or an inside job. No other company offers this and in order to have even made this possible, BitGo has very specific chains of trust and procedure involving every transaction. Your private keys aren't sitting in Manager Bob's 2nd desk drawer and he'll just grab them out and install omniwallet to his desktop computer and send you their funds.
There's an absolute zero percent chance they would break procedure. But even if they did, they then run into an engineering task. Someone has to certify that software. The key that they use could then be compromised by software, or the personnel that would perform this task, or the device and connection it is performed on. The amount of money stored in that key is inconsequential. The compromise of a single key and the publicity (distorted or not) would bring existential damage to their business.

The mining pool is 18% of ALL sha256 mining, meaning it is 600% of the BCH network while it mines BTC. When it mines BCH, it bcomes 6/7ths, or 85% of the BCH network. It can do whatever it wants at that point. But instead, it dumps a bunch of 1mb blocks and then leaves when it's no longer profitable to mine bch. The regular bch miners now find it harder to find blocks and "BCH has lately had many long periods with no blocks".

I spent the majority of 2017 lending on poloniex and bitfinex during the altcoin boom, so I'm pretty familiar with rates and what range it can have.
I'm not familiar with magnr, and it seems like it's closed up shops. I can't say whether or not their margin rates were set by institution or by open book. If it's set by open book like poloniex and bitfinex, then it's fair.
I was assuming they meant magnr set their rates at 0.9% per day, but re-reading, they said on average, so I could be wrong. It's not the institution then but the user accepting the loan shark rates.

Your daydreaming about a time machine is like doubling down on stupid. In this premise you've concocted, you have access to something that allows you to shape human history and you use it to do something pedestrian like investing for money. Guess what? You wouldn't need to know about or understand bitcoin if you had a time machine, all you need is to bring back a single sheet of newspaper to have more money than you can spend in a lifetime.
Why don't you just let it go? You made the decision you thought was right. Accept your previous decision with no regrets and let your newfound wisdom guide you in the future. Don't let this "what if" fester and destroy your life. There are people who have committed suicide because they lost their btc.

I enjoy Rogan's podcast occasionally. But sometimes he goes from being open to being an apologist.
An example is when his fucking idiot of a friend Eddie Bravo came on and Rogan decides to have a try at getting Bravo to stop being a flat earther. He can't make a good point and it was frustrating to watch.
In this particular instance, Rogan is trying to appeal to Bravo's emotions because he has nothing else in his arsenal, which is not how you discuss technical or science based topics. Bravo's talking about the north star being magnetic north and how that somehow means the earth has to be flat. Of course, anyone with a goddamn high school diploma could have told him that the poles are magnetic because of molten iron from the rotating body of a globe.
Instead of actually preparing for a subject he doesn't understand by doing some basic reading, Rogan instead fails to convince his crazy ass friend that pictures of the planet taken by satellites are real and just gives up and probably says some shit like "Whatever, I still love you, Eddie."
I think his stance on Alex Jones is pretty much the exact same. Jones is not some insane person because they're friends, and all of Rogan's friends are "free thinkers."

what a dumb thing to say.. governments alone are responsible for wars and choking them on funds will end wars.. right..
people finance wars.. the world switching to btc will just allow a different subset of people to finance a different target/type/style/reasoned set of wars.. i can't even imagine someone like roger graduating from sock puppets to drones.. he's the type of person with the amount of self justification to be capable..

I didn't say he should make Eddie look stupid. I said he shouldn't be talking about a subject he himself doesn't understand, which in turn made them both look stupid. He could have kept that entire podcast to talking about jujitsu and it would have been fine.

Obviously. And this is why the web is still entirely made of html and there's no need for things like js, css, cgi, perl, php, flash, html5, django, cherrypy, python, ruby on rails, go.
Also, the internet doesn't need things like routing because the entire world wide web is a mass amount of layer 1 hubs that just connect to each other. Glad we solved that scaling issue. Layer 3 is severely overrated.

Your link is incorrect. The correct time is 12:20 pm UTC, searching the way you do gives the conversion for 12:20 am. Assuming what this asshat wanted is the UAHF time in EST: here's the correct link:

Lots of people telling you to run other software.
At least one person should tell you that it's worth it to run a full node and make sure you have the latest version. Vast improvements were made recently speeding up sync time.

I and a friend are both big on Poloniex atm. I've been waiting for tier 3 verification for a long time (upwards of two months) and my friend has been waiting for about a month. Just this week, both of our t3 came through and they told me that my request for enhanced verification got assigned to someone who will handle it shortly. (My request was for a REALLY LARGE limit that's much higher than t3.
This was a large surprise for me as reading through r/poloniexforum confirmed that support on poloniex is an absolute nightmare. But then again, they also acknowledged that and that they were working on it. For my friend and I, we saw the results of that in our increased ability to withdraw.
I don't see any reason why they would do so if they were doing a runner. My t3 request had been sitting for months. If polo was insolvent, they would already be hurting for btc during this time when a bunch of people are already withdrawing for bcc. And yet they increased our limits within a day of each other when they could have not done so and we would have been none the wiser. This increase to t3 meant we were pulling out a lot more every day recently.
And from the few dozen times when I've done withdrawals this month, I've never had any issues. I use 2FA. I read r/poloniexforum a lot for warning signs as well, but so far I suspect the only crime polo is guilty of is really bad customer support. And in the crypto game, that's not that big a crime given how many entitled shitheads or lying scammers we have.

Is link layer something you just googled but didn't bother to read?
Layer 2 only works as far as macaddr table can hold. Not only would this not work for even a medium sized company, but with today's virtualized architecture, link layer does not scale enough for clusters.
I don't pretend to have the absolute answer on what layer bitcoin scaling should be done at, but who would want to discuss that with someone who doesn't understand basic networking or just makes stuff up.
Ironucally, the layer one up from the link layer, the network layer, is the base layer for the internet. That's scaled how?
Oh right, that's scaled by routing.

You can be as paranoid as you'd like but I have a good business relationship with Slush going on almost a decade.
I mined on his pool where I trusted him to pay me. And he did. And of all the pools running today, his is the one of the more honest. They don't mine bch economically.
I don't own a trezor because I have my own thing going that doesn't require one. But if I needed to purchase a hw wallet, I'd consider a trezor over ledger initially while looking into comparisons.

You clearly don't understand the layers but in case you do want to know, the internet does not exist at any layer under 3 at all. Layer 2 wouldn't scale enough to work for networks at medium sized companies.
The internet as you know works at layer 7.

I've been super patient but after waiting 1 month, I gave up on my l3 verification ever finishing and put in a request for enhanced verification. That ticket is now ticking away without any response. In the long term, I don't want to but may need to consider my options. Right now, I have serious doubts whether my request can ever be gotten to before Aug 1st and for such a big event, that's really not okay.

overreact much? coinbase has received over $100m in investment and holds more than $700m in customer funds.. but because whole whole "crypto scene" is unregulated according to you (nevermind that coinbase has bitlicense from New York Department of Financial Services), then obviously, this has all been an elaborate ruse to cheat this one sucker out of 200k..
i myself use coinbase and have had issues with banking due to ach and was missing something in the 10s of thousands.. coinbase cleared it up for me and when they did, they gave me adequate explanation that it was due to old banking fiat system.. lastly, the money i've personally moved through gdax far exceeds this amount..

Bitcoin doesn't "need" to work in a hostile and trustless environment. Bitcoin was designed to thrive in such hostility. Bitcoin is a sewer rat and has no dependencies on your "concern" for its survival.
Don't talk about attacking other crypto projects, legal or not. You'll not find many that agree with that type of short sighted thinking.
