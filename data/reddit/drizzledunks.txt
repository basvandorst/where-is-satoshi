Illegal by who's law?  I'm pretty sure China does what China wants with China's banks.

I think it would be great if bitcoin could not be exchanged for other currencies. It's value would be derived from what goods and services it can get you instead of how many dollars, euros, yen,... it can get you.

I would imagine transactions have decreased.  If i had a BTC when it was $1000 and now it's worth half that I know I'm not going out trying to spend it.

If I had more BTC I would get one of these. I just don't have enough to justify the cost.

I've got an Antminer S1 running next to my desk.  I set it up inside an old computer case so aside from a little fan noice it's unnoticeable.

What is keeping Caixin from showing the actual PBOC document?

A friend mentioned that there was supposed to be a bitcoin debit card and the first thing that came to mind was what transaction fees would be tied to it.

I think he's looking for advice on how to overclock without the HW errors.  I've run into the same issue with my S1.  Any freq above 350MHz and I get 14%+ HW errors.  Others have been able to go to 406MHz with only 0.44% HW errors.  It would appear not all S1s are created equal

The fan could use some stand-offs so that it doesnt lay flat on surfaces.  I guess it would have to be placed upside down the way it is now.

Ill be buying more with any money i get from current ebay auctions.

He was about to go out and buy a $4 coffee with BTC and now he can. I'd be angry too

Accepted where though?  It looks like The Glenstone is rather deserted.

fuck, Eligius is shrinking

If I had a large enough mining operation I would.  I would have to convert the coins to USD somehow to make it worthwhile and any exchange would have to report those transactions.

I like the way you logic

Unless you put the fortune back into bitcoins and then bought your hookers and coke with bitcoin, yes you would have to pay tax on it.

Honestly not a bad price.

Wouldn't IRS policy only apply to US citizens or holdings within the US?

You're more than welcome to dump your coins if you're so unhappy. My zero sum life provides me with excess funds that I can use to play around with Bitcoin so I'm not to worried about it.

Price goes down, we all buy up the coins at low price and BFL is out of the game.  I'm ok with this scenario.

I don't own any guns either.  Lots them all in a boating accident.
