Further, did you make any use of the spikes ($800-900) to perhaps sell some, or have you held onto all of them so far?

Probably a stupid question but I know little about (purchasing) books.  I searched "The Intelligent Investor" [on Amazon]( and it brings up several different copies of the book — how do I know which one is the right one?  (I've had this happen in the past, too, and ended up giving up on buying anything... I have no experience with stuff like this.)

Is there any significance to "2048"?

Apparently I know even less about Bitcoin than I thought.  There's different regional markets for Bitcoin, and they're worth different depending on those markets?  I thought Bitcoin was a worldwide thing (as per the nature of the Internet) where everyone bought/sold for basically the same amount.  How does that work?

Oh god I'm stupid, that was actually the first thing I thought of.  For some reason I stopped at 2^10, though (1024) and thought "nope, can't be that."
