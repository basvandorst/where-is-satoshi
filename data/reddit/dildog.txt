Okay, pork belly prices have been dropping all morning, which means that everybody is waiting for it to hit rock bottom, so they can buy low. Which means that the people who own the pork belly contracts are saying, "Hey, we're losing all our damn money, and Christmas is around the corner, and I ain't gonna have no money to buy my son the G.I. Joe with the kung-fu grip! And my wife ain't gonna f... my wife ain't gonna make love to me if I got no money!" So they're panicking right now, they're screaming "SELL! SELL!" to get out before the price keeps dropping. They're panicking out there right now, I can feel it.

"In August 2014, Forrest dismissed a price-fixing suit against Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Glencore. She held that, although the defendant's actions did affect the aluminium marketplace, the plaintiffs failed to show the defendants had intended to manipulate prices"
What ? It's obvious where this asshole gets her bread buttered. There's a legal system, but definitely no justice system. Fuck this shit.

Yes he knowingly broke the law, but that the law isn't applied equally. You are right, there are rules and "we" have to live by them. The problem with "we" is that it has different meanings to different people as cited by numerous examples in this thread.

His Wired two part story was excellent
@_date: 2015-11-06 13:57:49
He really is an ass isn't he. How wonderful of him to pontificate the finer points of business when shitheads like him are directly responsible for much of the economic issues faced today.

"So while we still have a deeply troubled economy, one piece of good news is that Americans are, once again, starting to actually make things. And we’re doing that thanks, in large part, to the fact that the Fed and the Obama administration ignored very bad advice from right-wingers — ideologues who still, in the face of all the evidence, claim to know something about creating prosperity." - Paul Krugman
How's that working out for Detroit shit for brains.

next time perhaps go with a cash only transaction. Banks definitely do not want people shitting in their back yard (in their eyes). Regardless of the public sentiment surrounding btc, banks have the last say when it involves them. Overstating the obvious I realize, but just use alternate methods.
@_date: 2013-03-15 12:33:17
Exactly. If you want to piss money away to retards and other shitheads like politicians feel free. Why not direct it to a worth cause like fightining cancer, poverty, etc.

I was thinking the same thing. If I transfer from cavirtex and place those funds into a TFSA immediately and then withdraw later, does that not exempt me from capital gains tax? It would be nice if cavirtex would allow people to setup a TFSA to fund their bitcoin trading. I do this with my stocks.

Nice try Royal Bank. And if you are a rep of Royal Bank, go suck a bag of dicks.

what else is new. Any volatility and they fold like a cheap card table. Ton of incompetence and little in the way of customer care. I would not recommend them.
