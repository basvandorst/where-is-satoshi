Download malwarebytes from malwarebytes.org, enable rootkit detection in the settings and do a full scan.  If you are tech savvy you can also try GMER 
 Did you download Fallout 4 from a private or public tracker?  You can't trust anything from a public tracker.

I just tried it on some client data that got hit with cryptolocker and the site said it couldn't recognize it as a cryptolocker encrypted file.  I know there's variants out there so it may not work for everyone.  Anyone have any luck?

Yeah but if they spent money on a good antivirus, email filtering and content filtering firewall that I recommended then they get upset and want to know why all of these systems they paid good money for failed to protect them.

That's nice.  Thanks for such an informative post.

China based Black Arrow just announced a several month delay of their asics and miners completely screwing over anyone who preordered.

Nobody is forcing them to develop this client.  You can already donate to them to help support development.  The address is on the front page of their site.

Cryptolocker is a damn nightmare.  I've had several clients get hit with it and had all of their data encrypted.  The only thing you can do is to restore from backup.  I've had to restore more data from backup in the last 3 months than I have in almost 20 years working in IT.

I'm looking forward to doubling my bitcoins with secret hack.

It should work with any stocks app that pulls data from yahoo.  For the app I use I just added the symbol BTCUSD=X and that's it.

I've set this up and it works well.  For security reasons, be careful when setting up your API key and only select the options you'll need.

Someone with really inexpensive or free power might be interested in them or you can play the lotto and do some solo mining but you will most likely lose money doing that.

You are better off just buying Bitcoin.  Small scale mining at home is not profitable anymore and it hasn't been for a while.

Bitcoin transactions are permanent so they have to be careful of fraud.

I've been doing it for months without issue.  If you are in an area that is currently capped you should keep an eye on your bandwidth usage.

Lo rate mortgage?

I don't know.  I haven't been monitoring my bandwidth usage on a per app basis.  You can always set up some basic QoS policies to limit the bandwidth it uses to avoid it getting out of control.

The site is legit.  Their verification process requires a video of you, your govt issued ID and the credit card you use on their site.  There is also an ID check that requires the last 4 digits of your social security number.
I bought some bitcoin there a little while back.  It's an expensive way to buy since they take 3.5% and it's an exchange so you can only buy what others are selling.

Same problem.  I waited 5 days and then contacted support.  They told me to delete my bank account and add it again.  It's been 3 days since I have done that and still nothing.

It could use some tweaking for sure.  One of my questions asked me what month I purchased a certain car I owned.  Problem was I bought that car 13 years ago and have no idea what month it was.  I guessed it and failed verification.
The 2nd time they asked about a street name that was close to my residence but nobody uses street names here.  We all go by street   Had to look up the answer in google maps.

Site is legit.  There's plenty of threads on reddit and bitcointalk already discussing how the site works.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:02:09
It's a gambling site that uses bitcoins.  They make money with ads and fees.
