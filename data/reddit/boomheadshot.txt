It's not spam if you are on staff! You are definitely also not trading on your status as uber god of reddit for more attention.
Nothing to see here folks.

That isn't how either GST or percentages work. You do not pay 10% GST on money exchange (eg AUD to USD), which is what exchanges are.

I would believe the ~~witchunt~~  BTC investigation. Reddit has such a glorious history of accurate detective work.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:42:14
I wouldn't take reddit detectives too seriously about the 'known coins' They have a history of getting it wrong (Boston bombings, sheep marketplace stolen coins).
$63m may be the required operating capital lost assuming certain btc balances, or something else entirely. 
Once the reorganisation. Is complete then gox customers know what percentage they'll get, just like any other bankruptcy.

There are countries [without income tax](  Some of them also have working governments and sound like nice places to live. If this is how you really feel, why don't you just move to the Bahamas?

Reddit investigators don't need evidence.
has decided Karpeles stole the coins, probably motivated by a desire to be hated by a community that realistically was his life's work and spend the rest of his life in jail/fugitive, it totally makes sense duh. 
Anyone who disagrees is simply spreading misinformation because they hate bitcoin.

The ATO aren't going to rape an individual if their guidance isn't available. I have met an ATO auditor on a non-BTC issue, believe it or not they are reasonable people provided you aren't dicking them around.

That is a low end estimate. According to [this thread on the front page]( it will be 630 000 USD if wins the struggle against NSA psyops.

Also, for more information on the above to go ato.gov.au, all of this is available in easy to read brochures aimed at normal business owners.

If they can find an investor to dump the $63 million in working capital in return for rubbish PR and *maybe* $2m profit pa (3% ROI) then I am a monkey's uncle. This doesn't even begin to pay back any goxbtc holders, just the state currency creditors.
I'd say that possibility of gox as a going concern is about as likely as Old GM reimbursing Enron shareholders.

Bitcoin is pretty tied up with Libertarianism/AnCap ideologies (which is a pretty big departure from the governance of any economy I can think of) although this has less to do with the technology than its followers.

I'm on the same wavelength. My hobby is studying people and what names them tick, and is basically an insight into a cult who believe they are under siege. Other than the fact the number one comment is a conspiracy theory, at the moment:
- The top submission to is a conspiracy about the mods suppressing a conspiracy about Gox
- Number two is a rambling post about how world governments are trying to destabilise bitcoin.
- Number three wants to know if a large transaction is related to his missing Gox coins
- More than one submission about the hacked mt gox database, desperately hacked as a part of an "investigation"
- Number ten is a link to a ponzi scheme with people openly admitting they sunk coins, despite the fact the operator clearly described it as a ponzi
- A submission on why criticism of bitcoin isn't allowed for another decade
This is just today. One day only.
Every day is like this, ONLY WITH MORE CAPS **AND BOLD.**
FWIW, while I think that cryptocurrency is a novel idea, I also believe it is a solving a problem that doesn't exist with a new set of problems, and in a couple of decades bitcoin (or its successor) will look somewhat similar to the current financial industry if it ever achieves mainstream adoption.

Have you ever exchanged currency in Australia before OP? I can guarantee that there is a flaw in your logic, or we wouldnt even have a tourist trade. The ATO hasn't yet published Bitcoin guidance. They specifically spend time consulting and deliberating to prevent calamities like the ones you are asserting are true.
Running around calling people dumb cunts is pretty ironic considering how many incorrect statements are in your original post and your comments here.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:24:19


If you think this is good news, then what qualifies as bad news?
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:37:42


Fucking hell OP, every single one of these comments was posted by the pro-bitcoin circlejerk, not the anti bitcoin people you asked for comments from.
It is shit like this (not to mention the good ol suicide hotline) that makes this place a joke.

Please, tell me more about Mt. Gox. 
Ignore those people who tell you to let go of your losses for the sake of your mental health, THEY aren't true believers.

Reddit detectives - such a glorious history of accurate investigations.
Tell me, did reddit ever find the actual sheep marketplace coins? 
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:09:34


Out in the real world business turn people away all the time when it isn't in their interests. One trip to a bank, a school, university or a night club will show you that. It  happens in b2b transactions all the time.
They experimented with bitcoin, and decided they wanted real money instead. They are free to choose whatever they want. Get over it.

Hi everyone, welcome to the Mt Gox conspiracy thread 
In this episode we'll cover some popular theories like:
- I found 150k bitcoins
- Mark lost his keys
- Mark is being blackmailed by the yakuza
- Mark is a CIA front man trying to discredit bitcoin
Once we are done, we will mock Karpeles for being fat and sloppy, while fantasising about cuddling softly with Voorhees and finding some actual good news.
@_date: 2014-03-07 11:18:45
This should be amusing.
Is reddit going to blame a dead guy again?
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:28:29
He claims that declaring it makes it okay. I'm sure he will allow all other spam sites to post, as long as they declare their interest.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:13:12
Yeah, thieves normally invest in infrastructure and pay bitcoin devs for the fun of it. They definitely are going to be altruistic, and not at all motivated by their own selfishness. 
You are deluded. Maybe this is why you are so excited.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:02:10
Two things:
1. Paying 10% GST on BTC transactions is no different from AUD transactions. If you are a business conducting b2b transactions, the GST is returned as a part of your BAS. You only have to pay the GST for business to consumer transactions, just like with AUD.
2. CGT is not, and has never been a 50% tax. CGT is charged as a part of your income. This may increase your tax bracket, but there are no 50% income taxes in Australia. You receive a 50% discount on your CGT for assets held for more than 12 months and a 100% discount if the asset is your principal place of residence.
Stop spreading wildly inaccurate information OP. People like you make this place a joke.

They can avoid bankruptcy if goxbtc holders accept 3% face value. 
Is this good news?
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:47:48
You are still wrong on point 1. The ATO has made no determination on the tax treatment of bitcoin. Until guidance is issued, you treat it like a normal currency. Think currency exchange at an airport - GST is only applicable on the fee, not the money exchanged.
It is due on June 30. Until then, stay calm chicken little.
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:24:48
About what? This place is an echo chamber, and I haven't much in common with people here. Half of the comments in here are serious posts about how any dissent is the result government psyops. 
Even the posters at AboveTopSecret know deep down it is bullshit, they just enjoy the bullshit.
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:15:18
Reddit found two "Boston Bombers" one of which was found dead "with no evidence of foul play" (read what you like into that), neither of which committed the crime.

You literally have no idea what bankruptcy protection is, do you?
The company can only be saved if debt holders (that's you) agree to forgive the debt or another source of capital can be found (unlikely given the scale).
Bankruptcy protection is only protection for shareholders.
@_date: 2014-03-16 09:52:13
But I wanted muh tax free CGT! Fuck that gubbermint stealing my money to pay for emergency services, universal healthcare, social safety nets, infrastructure and education! What has the government ever done for me!
Seriously though, you have the correct answer. I have never met a legitimate business that was afraid of an audit.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:53:59
You said that "it is believed that the company can make a turnaround with restructuring measures" in response to a question on "how this is good for goxbtc holders".
Turnaround isn't accurate. 
Best case scenario is that the court decides to give back a small percentage in state currency to depositors by selling all assets (including your coins) in a fire sale. 
There is no chance of raising $63m for a company that made $2m profit last year - that is what is actually required for a turnaround.
Bankruptcy protection is only good for Mark - it legally  stops creditors from harassment while the court decides.
Just deal with it - you lost money by being naive with it. There isn't going to be much good news, and by grasping at straws, you make look like a joke.
