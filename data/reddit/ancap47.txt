I'm not that worried about losing the coins since the network isn't seeing it, I should still have them. The problem is that its been over a day and even with an old client, this is a problem.
@_date: 2016-04-28 00:09:53
why's that?
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:48:59
I have a feeling that if I did the "sweep", that for some reason the .5 btc from that last transaction still wouldn't be moved over since my core client thinks it was sent.
@_date: 2016-04-29 02:44:17
To some degree. I haven't really been keeping up on the tech and my client is actually pretty outdated (0.8.6), so maybe I created the "high s value" tx? To make things worse, I haven't had it on, so it is not synced up. Although, I have been sending transactions up until this without a hitch.

luke-jr didn't do anything to help, but you know that.
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:20:51
Yeah, I'm aware of luke-jr. I know he's knowledgeable, and I also know that he is trying to derail bitcoin.
That transaction was just me sending from my wallet to my localbitcoins.com account. I don't know why anyone else would have private keys to that or have to sign it. I've always let my client do the work and haven't learned to send raw transactions, so this is all pretty dark territory for me. For instance, you said "two of the transaction ID's that you used for inputs were not valid transactions" - I didn't use them, I just typed in an amount and hit "send".
@_date: 2016-04-27 23:14:09
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:13:06
Why wouldn't I already have those private keys? Now when I tried listaddressgroupings, I'm getting nothing.
update: ok, restarting got listaddressgroupings to work. I wanted to see if those input addresses were ones I used before. Then I used dumpprivkey to look up the keys for those addresses and then importprivkey. However, then I got "Error adding key to wallet (code -4)" for all 5 of them.
@_date: 2016-04-28 04:41:14
We live in an upside down world, though. Our monetary system rewards people who have connections, not merit. Oftentimes, those with big pockets are the most incompetent, while very skilled people live in squalor.
Put it this way - if Brian Armstrong was so damn smart, why wasn't he in on bitcoin back in 2011? Back then, all the "big money" guys were either ignoring bitcoin, or bad-mouthing it. These guys only jumped on board once they understood it became an inevitability, and often only to wreck it. Make no mistake, the powers that be were involved in MtGox in some way - either it was a honeypot all along with Karpeles the patsy, or they pressured him at some point. Either way, I'm sure the masons that run the USA slave plantation are a big part of the stolen bitcoins because they wouldn't have it any other way. MtGox was the big player following the rules and regulations that had the big office and the good reputation, until things went to shit, and now you'd think it was one guy working from his mom's basement.
Wait till Coinbase runs off with people's money and claims they were "hacked", then I'm sure people will talk about how they knew how incompetent Brian Armstrong was - all in hindsight of course.

@_date: 2016-04-28 04:30:03
You sound like you know what you're talking about. Can you ELI5 what happened? Why were the input transactions not valid in the first place? Also, is there still a risk that the old transaction may still be confirmed as stated by luke-jr? I know he's a professional bitcoin troll, but 2% of what he says actually has merit.
@_date: 2016-04-28 00:03:28

When will people stop worrying about this? It has gained adoption in spite of all the negative press and all the doomsayers for the last 4+ years. Cryptocoins aren't going away - you can bet the farm on that.
@_date: 2015-12-22 17:39:27
I think you're underestimating how much the fear factor will dwindle as bitcoin becomes more popular, or how much it already has for that matter. There are already hundreds of thousands of people who have conducted illegal transactions with bitcoins over the darknet, and their successes breed confidence that the government is incapable of stopping them. 
My original prediction from 2011 seems to be holding true - that bitcoin will make money like any other file sharing - impossible to regulate. Even with the government prosecuting people over illegal music downloads, people download free music off the internet all the time because its so easy. Bitcoin is really no different, its just file sharing. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 07:07:44

Well, its a tough call for banks. Even if they know you're getting deposits for bitcoin, their default reflex is to LOVE deposits. They don't want to go closing a bunch of accounts, but now at the same time they are worried about being used to grow the bitcoin network. They're pretty much damned if they do, and damned if they don't at this point.
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:31:13
Who's "they" and who cares? I, nor anyone else, need to sell people on using bitcoin - it sells itself. If it gets to the point where its not working, miners and nodes will upgrade because they have a financial incentive to do so.
It must drive the establishment nuts that all their propaganda doesn't really do shit.

This kind of shows a lack of understanding cryptocoins. The value is still in the difficulty of mining blocks - which is directly proportionate to the total hardware composing the system. The more hardware, the more difficulty, the more robust the network, the higher the price. Having many options of burger joints doesn't make burgers free.

It's also an attempt to confuse the masses of dumb sheep. "Something that has the cool bitcoin tech, but all banky-safe with regulations and not scary bitcoin"
There will be people who use it too, just like people still use itunes even though you can easily download music for free.
@_date: 2016-05-19 15:36:35
The point is that its not "fraud" to buy things with a credit card and no ID. KYC/AML laws exist solely to protect the banking cartels - it has nothing to do with protecting people who buy or sell bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:15:53

Institutions don't make anything legitimate. Being regulated doesn't make things legitimate - that is statist nonsense.
USE of bitcoin makes it legit. The fact one bitcoin is worth over 250 times the US dollar makes it legit.

Trying to cozy up to US law enforcement doesn't legitimize bitcoin at all - in fact it is the opposite. 
US Law enforcement is hopelessly broken, corrupt, and just plain evil. It is used to prey on the citizenry and not justice. People and organizations that are calling for regulation from the monopoly institutions of US policing agencies are disingenuous at best and should not only not be trusted, but actively resisted.
It is important for the "Internet of Money" to create their own "Internet of Security" or "Internet of Policing", completely separate from the old, rotten institutions that Bitcoin was designed to replace and upgrade.

@_date: 2015-10-24 19:37:56


So you're saying that something is only deemed legit once the government decides it's legal?


It's not arbitrary in the slightest - the US Dollar is arbitrary! The price of bitcoin is calculated by thousands of transactions every day around the world - people everywhere are making a decision on the value with every transaction they make. 
What does the number mean? It means that a bitcoin is about 250 times more valuable than a US Dollar.

pussy IS a currency - absolutely. It's why women don't give a shit as much about money talk because they have their own. It can be extremely valuable, and can be accepted ANYWHERE, but starts losing its value in its late 30s.

Because dumb old bitches have the most to lose, even if they don't completely understand how. They know, even if only on the edge of their consciousness, that somehow this fiat system we live in benefits them. They know because in the back of their minds there is a twinge of guilt that they are receiving far more than they deserve. Any competition to the monetary system that benefits them they are going to be suspicious and fearful of. Especially one that smart men, who they realize bear the burden of their special benefits, are so excited about.
@_date: 2015-10-24 16:14:43
Andreas was telling the regulators to do NOTHING. That's dialogue, but it was the only kind of dialogue that Bitcoiners should have - which is telling the regulators to "do nothing".
Bitcoin was designed to replace the failing institutions of the State - namely the banking/monetary system - which also happens to back all the other failing institutions, including police.
Us Law enforcement is completely broken and corrupt and no longer functions how anyone expects it to. They don't protect rights of their citizens - they PREY on the citizenry. Why are people like Brito in such a hurry to work with such evil???
Jerry Brito was always an establishment shill from the very beginning.

These scare tactics seems to be the M.O. from the Freemason/CIA/Country Club crowd of the American elite. They are always the ones pushing for more rules by being the main ones to break them, and then calling for more enforcement to give them more power.

Not really. I think sellers got scammed far more on SR than they do IRL. Too easy for people to claim they never received their package, and often the post office ordered from sellers and confiscated packages.
