Some people worry about bip 101 causing centralization but the difficulty increases are going to cause much more centralization than a requirement for 1mb/min bandwidth and a storage requirement. Bitcoin is already hugely centralized but maybe that's okay that we only have a few main pools. Something like DPOS is so much more efficient than PoW.

This is an unstable state. If one satoshi were equal to one dollar there would surely already be a significant transfer of wealth into bitcoin. Which would require a lot of trust in the system. At this point there would also be a panic on the dollar well underway. If it happens then very shortly you wouldn't be able to get a satoshi for a penny.

Exchanges should hold their funds publicly. Bitshares does this in a decentralized way. Because I know Poloniex keeps a cold storage wallet with everyone's funds verifiably on the BTS blockchain. If they were low we would know. The level of transparency they strive for is still giving me confidence. So glad I got out of Cryptsy. It's like, isn't investing in crypto hard enough?

HI and welcome. Glad you're interested in bitcoin and maybe the wider blockchain community. Or maybe you just have FOMO and wanna make a lot of money. I would recommend you do research and invest in technology that can innovate, survive, scale, and provide increasing utility for the foreseeable future. Decide your plan of action before you trade and stick to the plan. Dont get euphoric, don't get scared. Don't invest more than you can lose. 
The best exchange depends on your country. 
All the top markets are secure (ish). Centralized markets will always have failures. Recently bitfinex had a major breach, Mt. Gox famously stole all the bitcoins on the exchange. A decentralized market like OpenLedger is far more secure (but for the on-off ramp into the crypto-world you essentially have to use a centralized service right now). Remember, own your own keys whenever possible. If you don't know what that means figure it out before moving forward. 
If you're american and just want to make it easy and not deal with placing orders and depth charts and graphs just buy on coinbase.com

Yo. I'm standing up for virtually FREE money transfer on a massive scale. I want to TAKE DOWN THE BANKS and shitty little tiny ass blocks ain't gonna cut it. 
Miners, even Joe Blow solo miner, can handle a 10x increase in blocksize without stretching their hardware and bandwidth. 
Satoshi made Bitcoin to become the world-currency. If Bitcoin won't take up that banner than an alt-coin will. 
BitShares has a 3 second block time, can handle visa+MasterCard volumes, highly decentralized and energy efficient = cheap to run. You can send BTC, Gold, USD, CNY anywhere in ~1.5 seconds, or wait 3 days for your Bitcoin transaction. 
Better take advantage of that first mover advantage, Bitcoin. They're coming for you.

Bitcoin will be under attack always, who it is doesn't matter. To make a secure network that can absorb attacks we need to increase the blocksize. It's really nbd.

No. the natural process in Bitcoin of ever-increasing mining difficulty is the best way to exclude the poor. 
Bigger blocks don't really make it harder for smaller miners. Mining difficulty is not dependent on blocksize.

@_date: 2016-11-23 10:16:28
Hardware costs totally exist. 
The main hardware cost is processing power. The Bitcoin hashing "difficulty" is intense. You need specialized processors to be competitive. Moving to smaller blocks doesn't change the hashing difficulty. 
Perhaps hard-drive space, write-time, and block-verification (hash check) time can be slightly improved but these are miniscule compared to the mining difficulty. 
Bigger blocks mean slightly more storage space, slightly more write-time. These are tasks where a home computer is already competitive with a specialized array. 
No block size change will realistically affect decentralization.

After a block larger than 1mb is mined (only possible after 11 Jan 2016) a node is running version 3 or below will not accept this block. Bitcoin will "fork". The real enchilada with &gt;75% of the hash power will accept the big block as it is propagated and continue to mine on that chain. For a short time there may be two chains but new coins mined on the "old rules" chain will not be valid on the "new rules" chain and so miners will quickly abandon the "old rules" chain in order to have coins that have the value of a Bitcoin. This is the only way to change the hard limit on the block size. It's a beautiful thing. I love watching XTnodes.com. There's no reason to get XT now other than to show support for larger block sizes and because it's an easy switch. We have plenty of time before January. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 20:38:24
HD wallets like greenaddress generate a different sending address for each send. Makes blockchain analysis more difficult. You could also use a mixer for every transaction but that costs a fee and if your coins are tied to a real world person then it's obvious you send them to a mixer (but not where they went after that).

The Argentines want anything but pesos. Average people on the street will give you 12 pesos to the dollar. There is walkway with lots of organized people gathering dollars for pesos at 13/dollar (and selling drugs) pretty sure these folks are going to start accepting Bitcoin. Meanwhile the official rate is 8! The locals just expect pesos to devalue, which devalues it. Bitcoin would make Argentina thrive (eventually), the economy is so used to running uphill that a deflationary currency might make everyone hoard the economy into a freaked out nosedive. But that's what makes cryptocurrency great, it's international! Just because it might do something violent to a regional economy the overall value of the currency will be more stable than a currency belonging exclusively to that country! They will fall back on the strength of other arms and then stand as a part of the world economy. Producing whatever brings joy to them and getting bitcoins for it.

Okay cool. Do you think the 90% threshold is too high? How will we ever come to that kind of consensus? The supply and demand functions, supply being the blocksize and demand being the number of transactions, are so unknown! The miners should have a grand old time trying to maximize profits. As interest in the blockchain is piqued by increasing the supply demand will increase too (at least initially, and especially with a leap to 8mb). By how much? It depends. Blockchain space may not be a "normal good". 
I'm imagining a 3-d plot (X - blocksize, Y - transactions, Z - profit) with potentially more than one peak. At least one on the low size end with just the transactions of people who are willing to pay loads for this magic ultra secure transaction and one on the high end with millions of ultra secure transactions at a low fee for each. 
Final point: For the miners under Bip 100 the highest profitability in the short term will be with smaller blocks. Unless they take a long view on Bitcoin and want the network to grow. No matter what, eventually they will try some squeezing and then buy altcoins that didn't make the mistake of allowing miners to choose the blocksize and are cheaper and just as secure to spend. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 14:29:25
Bip 100 may have more difficulty coming to a consensus on max blocksize. The calculation for the new max blocksize needs to be carried out and propagated across the network. Definitely could result in more complications. 
Bip 101 has a fixed linearly increasing blocksize. There has been convincing discussion (to me) that shows it will not significantly centralize the network. Having a max blocksize known well into the future has the benefit of reassuring those who want to use the blockchain to record information reliably. Increasing the blocksize immediately (come January) to 8mb is a good plan as it will protect the network from these ridiculous spammers and keep the blocks limited so no malicious miner can create giant blocks, a good balance. Bip 101 is also produced, the code is verifiable and clearly created with good intent. Bip 100 is more likely (but still unlikely) to be a subversive attack on the network at this point because we haven't seen it! 
Both solutions require a hard fork of the network. Equally risky in this regard. A hard fork is not a scary thing at all if &gt;80% of the hashpower is behind the upgraded fork.
Why is promotion of client software prohibited? That's insane. Let people make their own decisions. The collusion and even outright corruption on this sub is putrid. The mods should be ousted.

Isn't this kind of comment banned? It's a bit meta and off-topic I think. 
PS we should take the XT fork because it would be great for Bitcoin, long term the price would skyrocket and usage would be allowed to increase. In my opinion the network would still be secure, even with larger blocks. Storage is getting super cheap, it won't overly-centralize Bitcoin (although I think it's already over-centralized and something like bitshares DPoS is ideal, but could Bitcoin even conceivably switch to that kind of energy-efficient, distributed model?). Seems like a no-brainier. 
If anyone tries to change the supply limit Bitcoin will be valueless. That's the number 1 value proposition, limited supply. Without the belief in limited supply the miners are mining Monopoly money. Miners will never choose to do that. You're ridiculous for bringing that up, you FUD monster.

If this goes through it will implode. Even in the best case scenario the question is now "oh I can hold BTC of which there are only 21 million coins total for all time or I can hold digiUSD which the government can inflate whenever they like! now even more easily!", "I can pay with digiUSD and be tracked by the government or BTC where I can achieve a desired level of anonymity". It will only serve to hasten the realization of BTC's superiority. Imitation is the highest form of flattery, no? 
Probably trading digiUSD for BTC will be even easier than it is now. 
There's just no way this is going to work out well. Maybe the government taxes BTC differently or incentivizes digiUSD, or bans BTC outright. It will only aggravate the beast. Example: China.  
The next Bitcoin wave will be the big one. By Big One I mean the one where the USD will actually feel something as people frantically buy BTC. I'm predicting USD will feel the threat of collapse within 2 years when/if BTC goes to 10,000.
