In the Netherlands buying bitcoin is as a pie. You just use iDeal (a Dutch payment system)

Its easy, when there are more bitcoins bought than sold and mined. We will go to the moon! :)

Of coures bitcoin is working as a system, very good actually. I own bitcoins myself. But I mean people rather keep there BTC because it "likely" will rise in price.

This is why bitcoin is not working. It is constantly deflating, so people are scared to spene bits.

Acutely Dutch banks aren't like the 'evil' American banks with there ridicules fees. I'm looking forward to cooperation of bitcoin and the banking system. It would the make adoption of blockchain a lot easyer.

You can't, but i will explain it in a simplifying way.  So there are tree guys that want to buy pencils. There is one seller and he has only 1 pencil. Now the tree guys want that 1 pencil, so they gonna bid a higher price than the asking price. That's how the bitcoin price rises.
