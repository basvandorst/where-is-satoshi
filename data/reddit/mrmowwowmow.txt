 I don't think its fair that you can pay your way to the front of the queue regardless of the reason. I've heard the whole Lighting network/segwit solutions but they have been "18 months away" for a while now

Hardly, it cost $14 to move $1 today to test my hardware wallet.

Sorry for being slow on the uptake but why would a miner mine empty blocks ?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:21:10
Yes but you pay 3% on the transaction for a lot of exchanges. Most alt coins cost $2-15 to convert on shapeshift as the mining fee. Also I wouldn't use a currency that cost me 20 cents for every transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:08:51
Oh god, that would be awful for the morale of the community and for the reputation of bitcoin. I hope that miners aren't that short sighted and realise spamming is killing their own golden goose.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:09:42
I see that eventually (after the year 2140 something when it runs out) somthing needs to incentivise people to mine but surely there should be an inbuilt maximum? I dont think a $14 tip is a reasonable fee. These fees are killing crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:04:16
Sound like the miners have a huge amount of control,  I thought that crypto was decentralised? I assume that if miners refuse to mine then everyone will just jump to another crypto with reasonable fees and bitcoin will become the MySpace of crypto, which would be a shame. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:41:22
Do you think retailers would absorb the fee for crypto  Transactions like they do with visa? That would be awesome

Bitcoins scalability issue is definelty going to be a huge hurdle, however people are already talking about potential resolutions like lightning network. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:01:36
Oh I didn't know it was a meme, just something I've seen around subreddits for a while. I've also seen that segwit only had 13% adoption rate and falling. I guess it's hard to get accurate info when everyone's got skin in the game. I think you make some good points though, so I'm hopeful that we are close to getting this fixed.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:24:14
Cool thanks:)
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:48:50
How? Coinbase will only allow a bank account and debit/credit card 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:36:11
So mostly because people will abuse it? Damn this is why we can't have nice things 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:17:19
Aren't people already spamming the network with low fees because we have this "tipping" system? I get that miners need to be paid for the work but $14 per transaction seems very greedy to me. Isn't there a way for them to compete for the low fees Or do they all have a monopoly on price?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:50:07
Silly question: why do we even have miner fees? Don't they get paid bitcoin when they solve a block? Why isn't that a big enough incentive to mine? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:44:38
But why would anyone use a currency or store of value that cost money to spend? It seems like the fees are running it into the ground and that's not What's best for the system.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:46
Yes, if it's not fixed fees will keep increasing and transactions will slow down to a glacial pace. It will probably take a hard fork to fix it though which is a whole other issue. However no-one of these things are a death sentence and I'm still excited about the future

Taken from another thread but heres a few reasons why people don't take him seriously 
[PZ Myers on Lobsters]( also [this]( also this [article]( There was a good reddit post pinning down his views (because his fans will spin his vague rhetoric so that he can't be criticized), I can find it later if you want.
Search r/askphilosophy forum on his philosophy--I've found that near every philosopher and philosophy student writing articles, on reddit, twitter and discord finds his philosophy takes completely contradictory and nonsensical. If you want articles, I can give them to you, but really almost anyone with philosophy knowledge will tell you that he's a bullshitter. Cuck philosophy did some good debunking on JP's [bullshit source on PoMo]( as well as [JP himself]( If you want authoritative sources on PoMo that people with education consistently recommend that will dispel this sort of popular demagoguery, SEP article on PoMo as well as Gutting's "French Philosophy in the Twentieth Century" are good go-tos.
Then he's got many [many]( climate change science denial takes. He's a little obfuscatory, he won't deny it outright, but basically if you look at the collection of them he's basically saying, don't trust the scientists, their models are dubious, and if it's bad [you can't do anything anyway]( so don't try. Basically, politically motivated typical conservative anti-regulation and activism stuff. Now, I can't find the one where he's saying that climate change models are untrustworthy and the error rate makes them useless [Edit: I've [found one case of that]( though now I remember that there are others, also [see this wiki on his climate change denial]( Ignore the editorializing, see the links of who he RTs and what he says], that was most blatant, but if you've seen people trying to obfuscate the issues of climate change, the links I've given should be enough.. I hope I don't need to link you evidence that climate scientists don't agree with his stances.
He also got famous with C-16. He's [been]( [lying]( about it forever. Those are his responses, for why it doesn't match reality, see what the [Canadian bar association]( said and the legislation itself, as well as the senate debates where every misunderstanding JP had was explained. 
There's also history. He keeps doing bad history in particular about the Nazis. He claims he's studied it for 40 years, but it seems like his sources are shitty pop books and in some cases, far right sources, and in particular this confidence is what makes his bullshit most troublesome. Three arrows did some good debunking  [here]( and [here]( r/Askhostorians [did so too]( Also many philosophers and this same AskHistorians poster have been debunking his intellectual histories of Postmodernism and Neomarxism, but that's almost low hanging fruit with how JP doesn't even try to be accountable to historical fact. On a recent stream three arrows explained that JP used some discredited pop-books in his lectures for his history that nobody who 'studied history for 40 years' would use, so perhaps it's unsurprising that he engages in [some pseudo nazi apologia now and again](
These are some major ones, but really, any time he's speaking outside of his field, it seems he doesn't give a shit about accuracy. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:48:56
Not really as I didnt initially hide my views under false pretenses and am comfortable with people knowing my opinions on this matter in real life. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:16:47
Well you've clearly demonstrated you have no idea what transgender means or what climate change is. People thinking you're an arsehole and not wanting to be around you because you say shit like this isn't a violation of your free speech mate. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:57:37
Annnd there you go. It's not about "free speech" or academic discussion. Its a thinly veiled excuse to shit on trans people (p.s. the term transgender isn't a gender you might want to look up what it is before you start slinging slurs around). I'm glad you didn't bother to lie about why you like JP and straight up said this becuase its the actual truth and more of his fans should just admit that they hate transgender people and dont believe in climate change and stop posturing.
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:11:51
There is so much soild critisism of jp. Hes a hack and is routinely debunked. There's no grasping at straws here.
C-16 puts transgender people in the same protected class as race or sexual orientation. So if you assault or discriminate a transgender person it would be classed as hate crime not just normal assault (like attacking somone who is black becuase of their race as opposed to just assaulting them). Unless you think that discrimination against other races or sexual orientations is against free speech you shouldn't be against that ammendment. jp lied about it to push his agenda. Zero people have been arrested for missgendering somebody. He either misunderstood the bill or just lied about it to fire up his fans.
You can find some solid debunking in contrapoints' video too. She knows her shit and clearly deconstructs his pseudo-intellectual ramblings : 
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:45:37
If you're really interested in transparency with polictal policies then C-16 is a werid one to fixate on. Again the goalpost is moved because I explained how it is not related to free speech at all. The fact that nobody has been arrested is genuinely relevant and shows how small of an issue c-16 really is and is used by fringe groups to attack legal protections for transgender people.
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:09:32
Ok lets say you genuinely care about the legal ramifications of all laws of this nature. Sure, I can understand that to a certain extent if you're a law buff. What raises my susspisons is that there aren't any other laws that jp fans are this passionate about, so it makes me think that the law itself is a little bit of a cover.
As you can see from all the slurs in the comments, most of jps followers simply use the bill as a front to hate on trans people. They couldn't give two shits about the bill. They straight up lie to say you'll end up in prison for missgendering someone, which isn't something you'd get wrong if you're super into this bill.
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:15:50
Not really, his grift is pretty obvious. Contrapoints has a great video on why his reactionary views aren't taken seriously.
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:39:18
Wow you went full mask off. Your unjustified hate doesn't stop contra from being right. I'm not even going to bother with losers who think is ok to use those slurs. (Glad to see youre not actually worried you'll be thrown in JPs make-believe Canadian jail for missgendering her).
@_date: 2018-12-31 11:28:18
Stolen from another thread but this has just a few  things that show hes a total hack:
