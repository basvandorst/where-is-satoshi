Is USD a new token?

Time will tell, innovation always wins
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:13:43
This is hypothetical though. Its like shitcoins claiming 1mill+ TPS without a working network. Until its live that is speculation.
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:03:27
Simply issue hundreds of payments... This sounds like a terrible system
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:08:12
I'll start the bidding at 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:46:06
What is the current average fee and transaction time for BTC?
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:02:02
I clearly said I can't say which it will be
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:16:21
What is the largest payment that will be usable on lightning? I don't know about you but $300 is a relatively small payment.
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:12:56
Have it bypass the transaction for your contact list. Only unknown numbers trigger the fee.
@_date: 2019-10-10 17:20:07
796% increase sounds impressive until you realize they were only trading 28btc before...
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:52:31
Short term thinking.
From a different perspective BTC lost 30%
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:10:39
Efficient... 
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:18:13
Why would people be happy with a 1% success rate?
@_date: 2019-08-11 12:37:03
BTC will not be  in terms of market cap in 10 years. It's power consumption, transaction times, fees, lack of scalability, will cripple it when it comes to real world adoption, especially in an ever advancing technological world. I can't say which project will be on top in 10 years or if that project has even been released yet but it will be one which does not suffer from the same pitfalls as BTC currently does. BTC is a start for the crypto space but like all other technologies the first will quickly die out and a new and improved model will take it's place.

You can still buy with a checking or savings account
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:09:32
...you must be new here. That is incredibly short term. No generational asset is judged on a 1 year trend. You think the S&amp;P drops 50% every year just because it did in 2008?
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:25:43
It is possible! Bitcoin is the "Napster (or Encarta) of digital assets"
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:59:16
So am I? BTC was the only crypto at inception aka 100% of the market. It has since lost 30% of it's dominance to others. Did I really have to explain that?
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:06:30
Short term perspective
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:46:52
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:39:55
Okay so nothing factual has been said other than lightning network has 1% success rate with transactions over $300. My point is stop spreading false information with vague statements. Speculation and rumors are ruining the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:29:03
Has there been any progress on banks running nodes or is this pure speculation?
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:33:52
I would like a btc
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:15:48
I cannot say for certain where the issue lies. But I'm saying I've used the same exchange to send to the same wallet with a different coin and it was instant. But for BTC it took 45 mins.
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:08:55
I transferred off the largest exchange to a private wallet and it had 2 confirmations and took 45 mins. I didn't choose anything I did the transfer as I would any coin but BTC took about 1000x longer than many others I have used. Also I don't need it to be instant but if others are why wouldn't I use them? Having to wait and sweat it out for 45 mins hoping everything went right is not how it should be done.
@_date: 2019-01-20 04:49:53
Next few years... It will be obsolete by then
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:44:56
But it is unusable until it confirms
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:25:47
Other coins don't have the issue of lag on exchange so this appears to be a BTC issue. I'm not into the tech I'm into effective solutions and from an average consumer perspective BTC is not a viable choice currently. I'm not a BTC hater clearly I have BTC and use it but it's frustrating because I thought the times of waiting an hour for confirmation we're behind us. If BTC expects to be picked up by the main stream this has to change. If I was just getting into it and had this same issue I would immediately try other solutions.
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:16:58
But why can I make the same transaction with other top coins and not have this issue?
@_date: 2019-01-01 04:55:43
BTC isn't good for day to day purchases yet. In time maybe but not yet.
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:18:03
But there are alternatives today that do what BTC will do in 2+ years (estimate). From this perspective BTC is already obsolete.
@_date: 2019-01-20 04:50:58
From a consumer perspective this is all one issue and you can't blame the exchange. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:11:46
But who is using it is my question? Why is it not standard?
@_date: 2019-01-20 02:41:00
I used the largest exchange by volume and they arent on lightning network? Who is using LN then? Must be very low volume.
@_date: 2019-01-20 02:59:40
If it isn't easy it wont be used though.
@_date: 2019-01-20 02:53:15
But it wasn't instant? I waited 45 mins for the money to show up?
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:43:50
This is a drop shipping web-page right? 
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:56:11
Correct BTC is great but pleading people to stay away from alts is ridiculous. Bitcoin maximalists are cancer to the progress of all cryptocurrencies including BTC itself.
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:43:30
Bitcoin doesn't cover every use case for cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:36:37
Now does seem like an odd time to come out. I can't even image the shitstorm if craig wright pops up lol
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:02:47
I would agree most alts go to 0, there's 2000+, probably 95%+ are usless. But certainly not all. BTC is a significant portion of my holdings but BTC is not the be all end all of every facet where cryptos can be applied.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:30:55
Good bot
I had no idea
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:22:22
I agree  but I am curious about this:
 [Satoshi revealing](
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:44:00
Hmm the more you know
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:23:42
Yeah boi
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:34:08
Bitcoin has benefits but saying it can do everything is ignorant
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:10:35
Lol it appears so
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:56:54
Knowing who created BTC and who holds 1 million BTC could say a lot about BTC as a whole. What it could do for the price I can't say.
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:42:42
Never going to happen. You underestimate the power banks hold.
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:01:08
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:46:19
You now agree with me after dismissing it in your first comment. Allllrighty then
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:00:43
6000% gain compared to some of the alt gains is tiny. I don't even know what point you are trying to make. All I'm saying is BTC isn't the be all end all of crypto. I love btc and it is a significant portion of my holdings but I also hold alts that crush BTC in there respective fields.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:34:49
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:51:15
So Bitcoin losing 85% in a year isn't a pump and dump?
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:24:03
Personally I think this is a scam and Satoshi will not be revealed.
