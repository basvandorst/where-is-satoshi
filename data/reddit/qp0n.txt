I'm sure there are a handful of millionaires in here now. I only have 10 btc but still making about $10k per day over the last week. I'm starting to get scared, but I'm not sure what I'm scared of.

You clearly don't understand government. This is a jackpot for the IRS. They can make infinite busywork with this ruling, complete with infinite requests for additional funding. They aren't interested in any rational outcome, they are interested in preserving their relevancy &amp; income that is all.

Wait, does the BTC network not track a unique address for each transaction in/out? Where I get confused is where the cryptography gets introduced.

Propaganda from the WALL STREET Journal? ... They wouldn't have any vested interests in protecting their precious fiat systems by any chance would they?
Perfect reminder of one of many reasons why exactly we support BTC in the first place.

I wish there was a way for them to track purchases made with $$ as a result of the decision. I am holding all my bitcoins for the time being, but I did shop at Overstock for the first time after the announcements and spent close to $800.

Bitcoin will stabilize pretty significantly over 2014-2015 to the point this wont be an issue. It will be no different than accepting euros, or buying gas at a gas station. The reduced short term volatility wont warrant that kind of behavior.
Put it in context of stores that offer 'price match guarantees' ... if the value of that refrigerator plummets on the market your retailer will then have to match it. Retailers do this all the time, its not any different. It's the same risk associated with any return service.
Regardless, you could technically do this with $$ already. Convert BTC-&gt; dollars -&gt; buy fridge -&gt; BTC value goes down-&gt; return fridge -&gt; convert back to BTC.

3 great responses, but this helped the most. 
So... if I understand this correctly... MtGox never bothered to implement the most fundamental principles of banking &amp; accounting; tracking balances?
It instead relied on an independent arbitrary system? I thought it was a core security feature of Bitcoin to monitor its own displacement. You telling me the leading exchange site could've had BTC's network do most of their system's work for them, but created a broken one of their own instead? Why *wouldnt* a crypto exchange use the network upon which the entire currency depends.

But thats still a wallet error, right?The actual bitcoin balances are in the appropriate wallets but the wallet reads it differently? Am i close?

Which is exactly what the Swiss bank was doing.... and they were paying the price in purchase value. If the supply can (and will) be increased whenever the value appreciates, people are less likely to hold and trade your currency if they can buy more of it later for the same price.

Is there an "ELI5" explanation for the last few days of BTC shenanigans somewhere?

$ in -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; product
no different than
$ in -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; $ out -&gt; product 
because the value of the $ changes just like the value of Bitcoin changes.

When the investment of reference is literally money, no they are not theoretical. By that logic winning $100 in blackjack and even cashing out the chips is still not "making money"; those gains would still be 'theoretical' until you actually spend the cash since inflation and global monetary values influence price.

Exactly, things like this are never made up, you can tell by the presence of 4+ colors in the scheme, which is one more than 3 colors, thus the B squared will always be able to counter the C squared's stealth melee attacks because you can never B-conquered if you're not divided and you cannot divide 3 because it's prime. 
Unfurthermore contrary to thus hence, the B magnifies the sweetness of the truth theorem when multi-t-plied into the B to create the [Bt]^{""} transnomial: which actually represents nothing whatsoever, however you'd have to be a 7 initial genius to know that, because in the end the [Bt]^&amp;)( trynomansmeal gets pronounced by lesser intelligent beings as simple the word "beat" - a special special word let me tell you - because the law of averages myth tells us that the God Juniper is summoned instantly every time the word "beat" is spoken within a square root of i meters from a pro woke DJ who was once reported to have been "sick as fuck" and has rumored to have been seen "killing it". 
Upon Juniper's arrival the vibrations of his pro crossfades alters the space daylight savings time causing any argument to be interrupted by a "woooooo gurrrrl, hold my argument, this my jam!". And as a result, once again the fundamental law of nature holds;  that any 4 colored graph is a gift of mathematical truth and has remained so ever since Helga exited her transcave to perform *The Calming of the Laser-Raptors* by getting them crunk with Helga-rhythm.... which fossils have proven is the source of the word "algorithm", making the 4-color proof to be the ultimate wubbalubba dub-dub-step mic drop of suck my dickbutts.

I bought 5 BTC at $900 years ago. I cringed, but held.
@ $300, instead of selling, I bought 5 more.
And then @ $720 bought 5 more (thanks Trump!). 
Now @ ~$850/BTC, in total, I've lost just $250 because I kept the coins... and gained $3400 because I kept the faith.
