This is brilliant news!  You can buy bitcoin instantly with a UK credit card.  No "non-sterling transaction fees", no delays, no waiting.   And while you could probably get a better rate by transferring money to an exchange, the delays in transfer means its probably only worth doing for large amounts.

Banks currently don't have an incentive to collaborate while end customers don't have an alternative.  I think its  like a Prisoners Dilemma - they would save on costs by collaborating, but the incentive/rewards for each player to cheat is too great, so they end up not collaborating.
Bitcoin comes along as a small but viable alternative to the current system.   They can see that at some point in the next decade, the incentive to collaborate will become greater than the incentive to cheat each other. They will have to collaborate or lose customers to bitcoin. 
They're not there yet, but they might as well get ready for it...   I bet this is R3's pitch to its new members.

I don't know enough about US financial systems, but if that is true, then that would be collusion to keep other participants from joining the market.  I think that would need to be considered a different game to the internal market "game" for sharing a single source of truth in order to reduce costs.   Not sure though....
Of course that is just in the domestic markets; I'm not sure that you can consider the FED, European Central Bank and Chinese Central Bank an oligopoly, and I'm pretty sure that they do not collaborate...  but now people have an alternative, perhaps this will change.

April 5th is the last day of the personal Fiscal Year in the United Kingdom.  Its a pretty important (or easily memorable date) for most people in the UK who pay personal tax.
To me it adds to the evidence that Satoshi is either British or has strong ties with Britain.
The correct usage of "bloody hard", the passive aggressive apologising to people who asked him poorly thought out questions, and the UK specific headline from the Times included in the embedded message in the genesis block also add weight to the argument that he comes from a green and pleasant land.

If you are looking to jump in as soon as possible, then I would recommend setting up an account with circle, making sure that you set the currency to "bitcoin" and then purchasing bitcoin through them.
Once you have bitcoin in your online circle wallet/account, then its time to do some research on how to safely secure your bitcoin yourself.   
The security of your coins depends on YOU generating a secret random number which is then translated into a bitcoin address.  If you buy this card off ebay, then someone else has generated that number and you will never be sure that they have not kept it and will steal your money. 
If you have an iphone, then I recommend Breadwallet, if you have android, then mycelium..  If you want to understand addresses yourself then  is a good place to start in order to learn more. 
By its nature, bitcoin is complex, and has lots of ways for people to lose money if they do not understand what they are doing. 
Circle is a centralised service, (ie if they go bust then you lose your money) but the chance of this is lower that if you buy one of these cards. 
If you are looking for a physical way to store your bitcoins,      then ledger wallets are good, I also believe that trezor wallets (while more expensive) are good for large sums of bitcoin.  Ledger wallets allow YOU to generate the random number (which is used to produce a private key) on a computer and then export it to the wallet.  Trezor wallets generate the random number on the device (I think) - so are even more secure.

Just reading through some of your responses. If you will forgive me, you may be being naiive with respect to dealing with such a large amount of money.  
Just to be sure, don't respond to anyone posting here offering to help you.  Don't provide any info, hints etc about what you are trying to do etc.   Don't tell any of your local bitcoin friends unless you trust them with your life. 
IF you are for real, for this level of funds, I would recommend reaching out to someone in the community who has a good reputation to protect.   
My first thought is Michael Perklin, or maybe one of the trusted CEO's like Jesse Powell, Adam Back, Eric Vorhees etc.  They likely can vouch for someone on their respective teams who can assist. 
Arrange a face to face, (you will have to travel) and agree how much you will pay for their help to retrieve the coins.  
Even with all this, I would recommend that you do the retrieval in a neutral place, with no internet connection, and with a video camera recording the work/screen and screen capture/ recording  turned on for all work.   This is to protect yourself and the person you employ.

We grew too high too fast during MtGox and then had a 2 year lull after it imploded. That was $800M and a large percentage of overall market.  We're still over cooked, and this is about $600M and a much smaller percentage of the overall market, but could still have an impact of a few $1000 / 6 months to a year growth..  IF this is true and it does implode.

Bittrex has over a quarter of a billion dollars of tether.
Poloniex has 215,000,000.  
If this vanishes it will have an impact on the market.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:06:38
It depends.. 
If Tether are created out of thin air and used to spend on bitcoin. Traders accept them as dollars and they then go to zero.  In effect the buyer has stolen the bitcoin.  At current prices they could have stolen over 100,000 btc.   Impact on the market will be massive.  Tether holders net worth drops, so demand drops.  Also as there are no more fake bitcoins being bought, demand drops from that side also.  
Demand drops - price goes through the floor.  Everyone who bought at a higher price has been defrauded.
However, it looks like tethers could have been used to both fund the bitfinex margin business and manipulate prices up and down at will.  If this is case, again, traders have been defrauded of their funds and bitcoins.   Real money taken out of the system by fraud. 
Even if they are only used to fund the margin business, it becomes a ponzi, people taking money out of the system can only do so from new deposits, while the total amount of "value" in the system exceeds the number of dollars backing it up. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:07:07

@_date: 2017-11-17 19:32:26
While I agree that it may not have the same size of impact as Gox, the comparison of market cap doesn't work between the two currencies.   
Tether is "supposedly" backed by $645M of dollars in a bank, and it's market cap is defined by how many dollars are in that bank account.  
The value of a bitcoin, and therefore its market cap is set by the supply and demand of a fixed supply asset.  The 131 Billion in Market cap would only be meaningful if you could sell every bitcoin at the current price.  If half a billion "real" dollars vanished at the margin, the impact would be many 10's of billions off the market cap. 
Also, all the newbies who have been telling their mates about their amazing investing skills would now be underwater.  They will sell up, or shut up.  The papers would be full of "death of a Ponzi" - weak governments would use "protecting their people" arguments to start to ban and regulate.
If Tether implodes - we're all in a world of hurt, and it seems like the evidence that we have of its solvency is weak - for half a billion dollars, I would expect one of the big four auditors signing it off in blood, not a no-name auditor and crappy snapshots of lists of printed bank accounts.

Agree.  Even R3 (the biggest consortium of banks - and led by people who "get it") have stated that their solution (CORDA) is not a blockchain.   Its multiple databases connected to a timestamping server. 
The issue is the token.   The public blockchain provides security because the token (btc/ether/whatever) provides security.  If the token is private then someone is in charge, and if someone is in charge its gonna be a hard sell to those not in charge to give value to someone elses token...)

Yup agree..   I know enough to know that I don't have enough information to make a judgement about Tether.  But I can see the risk all the way back to me in not having that information.
I would love to see an independent audit, but in the absence of that information, you have to go back to the smell test...

My assumption on exponential growth is only based on personal experience.   
Outside of "bubble mania" I've only been able to explain to 2 technical people the value of bitcoin to the extent where they "get it" and start to buy in.   (Of course during bubble mania, everyone wants to get in, but they don't understand what they are buying and will get out again just as fast)...
I've heard similar stories from other people, which makes me think that normal (ie not bubble growth) is exponential (albeit at quite a slow rate).
This simple model doesn't take into account differences in wealth, or the halving etc, but looking at the graph, it doesn't seem that far off a straight line.  As long as we're above that line, then I'm happy with progress.   
If we go below that line, (and there is no fundamental issues) then sell your grandmother to buy in....

Lack of fungiability.
If you have a choice between buying a bitcoin (which you can see from the blockchain) has been involved in a hack, and bitcoin not involved in a hack, you would place a different monetary value on each one.  
zcash solves this, but has other risks  (toxic waste, unable to validate total number of coins, zero knowledge proofs are "new" tech...)     Maybe some can get co-opted.

@_date: 2017-10-13 10:55:50
Good questions - and this is the basis of how bitcoin works..
When you set up a private wallet on your phone for example, it will give you a "receive" address, which is a string of characters (and an accompanying QR code).  You need to go to Accounts section of Coinbase and choose to send bitcoin.   You put in the receive address and hit send.
Coinbase will send your bitcoins to the receive address (minus a network transfer fee).
I'm guessing you're new to this, so a few words of warning.  
1) choose your private wallet carefully,  I know breadwallet, mycelium and jaxx are well used in the community.  There are many more trusted ones, but there are also scams.  Don't send bitcoin to a wallet you don't have trust in.
2) Your wallet will give you a list of 12/24 words as a backup.  WRITE THESE DOWN!!!!!!!!  If you lose your phone/wallet and don't have the words then your bitcoin is GONE!!!
3) Don't share these words with anyone, don't save them online anywhere, don't save them as a file on any computer with an internet connection that could get hacked.  If someone has these words, they have your bitcoins.
I'd recommend testing with small amounts first, and playing with bitaddress.org to understand how bitcoin addresses, wallets, private  keys and public keys work.   There are plenty (hundreds) of great videos on youtube to get you up to speed. 
While I would never recommend leaving coins on an exchange (such as coinbase) for a long period of time, I'd make sure you are confident you understand what you are doing before moving everything off it.   In the event of a fork, if both coins have value, then I am sure that coinbase will (at some point) give you access to both coins.

When you spend from an address, it helps to imagine it that you transferring ALL the value from that address to "the blockchain", which distributes that value between who you want to pay, a "change address" (which you control) and the miners.  If you spend from a wallet on a computer, phone etc, then that is all handled for you. 
If you try and do it yourself, you can get it wrong and send the change back to an address that you are not expecting (and don't hold the keys for) or paying the remainder of the balance to the miners.   This is why most wallets (ie Bread) will say "sweep the private key".   This transfers all the value from a paper wallet into your phone/computer wallet etc. 
I'm not sure how common it is now (I'm actually not aware of any wallets that would allow you to part spend), but in earlier days it wasn't uncommon to see people having lost bitcoins to change addresses that they didn't control, or accidentally paying a huge miners fee.
Even if that all doesn't make sense, just remember the golden rule to sweep all the value off a paper wallet before spending any, and you'll be good.

Without Gavin, none of us would be here.. he gave away thousands of bitcoins to get the community started.  He is legit one of the soundest blokes in the community...

I think we do need to sort out the alternative units, but millibits, microbit etc is not the right way to do it.  No-one can get their head around it. 
Working up from Satoshis might work..  I can imagine spending "5 kilosats" on something, but its still not easy.
Maybe it will just happen naturally, necessity being mother of invention.

Totally agree.... First thing I did when I hear the Craig wright claim was to check his LinkedIn profile, sadly now deleted. 
At least 5 pages of self-aggrandizing fluff, I stopped reading when he claimed to be the "worlds foremost computer security expert"...
Its clear that he has mental issues, I can't believe that after so long he's still buzzing around this space.

Hmm, you could be right on the satoshi thing, but milli bits, micro bits.  I have absolutely no concept of how many that is.  
I couldn't put it into my wallet without looking up how many zero's that is, and what if I get it wrong...   
And when we get to micro, and people start shortening it to µbits, understanding bitcoin is hard enough....

If you have bought coins on coinbase, and are worried about the fork, then transfer them off coinbase to your own private wallet (ie Breadwallet on iphone, or a hardware wallet) until after the split.  
In reality, there is probably little to worry about.  If you have bought coins on coinbase, then after the split you will have the same number of each type of coin.  The issue is when coinbase will make the functionality available for you to send both types.

Not an expert, but I believe the top achieved data transmission speeds is in the range of 100's of terabytes/sec.  If that will ever make it to comsumers is another matter.

Not a good thing.   Not sure he was right or not, but he certainly exposed a massive risk.

I've been giving this question some thought.  What is the incentive for the trusted parties to mine the chain?   
How about the value of being able to participate in the chain being enough in itself?   How about some kind of reverse incentive, where in order to be given access to the ledger, you need to commit a certain amount of hashing power to the mining network.  If you fail to mine a certain number of blocks per 1000 then your permission is revoked?
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:16:30
I wholeheartedly agree.....   This is just a minor flesh wound..

Wait until all the gambling addicts and the people who have borrowed start posting desperate stories about losing their families money, and the loan shark is knocking on the door.
Wait until Tether implodes and we do a flash crash down to a figure that no-one can imagine.   
Wait until the ONLY news reports are about how many idiots fell for the bitcoin scam...
Wait until you are embarrassed to talk about bitcoin with your family as you're the idiot that lost them all money.
Wait until every other day a merchant is dropping bitcoin as it tarnishes their image.
Wait until 75% of all the current ICO's, altcoins and scams have lost all their founders money and moved onto something else. 
That's when there is blood on the streets.
That is when you'll know its time to buy.

They've got Richard Gendal Brown, he's a bitcoiner and visionary.  
I know that we want bitcoin to be the one and only, but I'm very interested to see what these guys can get working.  If they can get it working, then its a stepping stone forwards to a crypto-currency based future.  
If not, then at least we'll know that it was tried.

If you'll forgive the moonish post, I think this is great news.   I've been pondering why the mining race is so furious at the moment and I think its starting to become clear.   These guys (and these are some of the smartest cookies on the planet) are picking up coins while there's still 25 available every 10 mins.  They've stumbled onto the goldfield and they are making the most of it before everyone else notices.
These guys don't give a damn about the current price, blocksize, centralization or bitcoins current exposure. Their singular focus is on getting as many coins as possible while hoping the wider world doesn't notice what they are doing.
They can earn in 10 minutes now, what will take them an hour and half in a decade.  In twenty years, the entire world's hashing power will be fighting for less than a bitcoin every 10 mins. 
The "moon" is probably not coming any time soon, but when it does its going to leave all of us kicking ourselves for not buying with every penny we have now.

Yeah, I'd played with a vanitygen (admittedly on a pi) and it struggled getting 4 characters in a reasonably length of time.  Getting 8 in a row seems to require significant patience or money.
How does vanity.coin.dance guarantee that they don't keep the private key? or do you just have to trust them?

It was a shame they were conned, but at one point there were 7 references to bitcoin on the BBC Tech pages.    
I've had lots of previously un-interested people telling me about how he's been found, allowing me to say "nah, its not him"...
I think the BBC felt they had stumbled onto a big story and were trying to make the most of it.  They had Gavin there to confirm it, so I don't think they've done anything wrong.    
Once Craig has been confirmed as a fraudster, there will be a lot more people interested in finding out who he really is, and why this is such a big deal.

This is an interesting perspective..  A financial industry version of the organisational changes needed when SAP and the other business process re-engineering initiatives were taking off.  And I guess the end result will be similar, with a few big players like R3 taking over the industry (along with massive consulting fees ;)
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:14:57
I think the term blockchain is causing confusion in this debate.   
Bitcoiners see a blockchain as a technical invention, an integral part of the bitcoin crypto-currency.
Bankers see "blockchain technology" as a re-alignment of their incentives to collaborate to reduce cost and compete with new crypto-currencies.   They don't claim that their "blockchain technology" (or distributed ledger technology) is anything technically groundbreaking over and above a centralised database...  its just that they have never had the right incentive to do it before.    
It is this re-alignment of incentives, which they refer to as  "blockchain technology".   Its a testament to bitcoin that such a small technology can make the big banks re-evaluate their incentives, and will ultimately bring about a more efficient (therefore less costly) banking system and probably improved functionality to end banking consumers.

Bitcoin is that extraterrestrial. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 15:38:03
thats true...  
Although, I'd suspect that the biggest threat to a "bankchain" comes from inside.  The incentive for banks to collaborate only exists while permissionless ledgers are a viable competitors.  If bitcoin became irrelevant, the incentive to cheat would pose a threat to the bankchain.   I suspect that, like most things in life, an unhappy equilibrium between permissioned and permissionless ledgers will develop.

@_date: 2015-10-12 13:58:24
Yeah, agreed, but the threat that this poses to the bitcoin community is quite real. 
If the banks come up with a centralised solution, with sub 10 minute settlement and a massively scalable database. Then the reasons for using bitcoin become less and less.  If they decide to take a hit on remittance profits to stay relevant, ie centralise across countries and focus on providing services to those who currently don't have banking services then bitcoins only advantage is that it doesn't have Quantative Easing (or whatever they are calling it these days).  Bitcoiners will be seen as the anti-government druggies..
