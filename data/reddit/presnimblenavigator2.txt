Once again, bitcoin has caused someone lose a bet that involved the mutilation and consumption of genitalia. 
I think we know what is fueling the rise of BTC
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:16:17
Yea, sorry, I’m wondering why it is still pending at Coinbase. It says 0 conformations. How do I find the info you are requesting?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:36:58
It’s a special coin that were made with real bitcoin keys stored inside

I play poker and yes this is true. Also, just because you have made gains doesn’t mean you are playing with “free money.”  This is now your money and if you lose it, it is just as bad as losing any of you first 1000$ investment

Bitcoin is a limited resource like gold. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, and the last coin will be mined in 2140. Right now there are about 16mil bitcoin mined. 
To mine gold you physically need to go in the ground and find it. In the old days you could stick a pan in a creek and find gold, now it is harder and you have to dig in Alaska or whatever. Same with bitcoin. It is mined via computers doing a ton of calculations “looking” for a code. Whoever finds this code gets 12.5 bitcoin. This process repeats every 10 min

You rock! I jumped into bitcoin and bought a coin at 8k! I knew I was in for a ride, but not one this crazy.

The hashed value is the hash of all the previous blocks. It is confirmed as the correct hash and that block is created and the miners head off in search of the next correct key. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:45:44
Dude you are getting close!

I just happened to be watching it. It dropped from 9900 to 8900 instantly, I already had my $$$ loaded up to buy and just instantly clicked buy on Coinbase and the sale registered at 9500. Then, right after that, gdax froze up and no one could trade. That is how quickly it moved that day.

I sent bitcoin from my ledger nano S
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:29:00
Lol when is it coming?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:02:48
Originally it was 50 coins mined, then divided to 25 then 12.5 and next in a year or two will divide again. This is to mimic a precious metal. 
The only way to get new bitcoin is to mine it, and the only way to get bitcoin if you’re not mining, is to exchange money for someone that has some bitcoin. 
It is worth whatever it is worth compared to other currencies, just like fiat currencies.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:15:16
Basically, yes 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:01:52

I just bought one, but I want cold cold storage 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:48:37
I second the vote for a ledger nano S super simple to use. Way easier to use than to be explained how it works

I think a lot. I think “bitcoin is becoming a important word in the world. It will always represent cryptocurrency like “Kleenex” will always represent facial tissue. Even 100 years from now “bitcoin” will be the  word for cryptocurrencies and this I think there is value in the name 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:47:16
If I buy 2 coins, should I immediately get them off Coinbase? For a paper wallet, is it a file I just print?
 
Should I laminate it before putting it a safety deposit box?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:29:48
Yup! Time to HODL!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:10:22
I hope he makes a double or nothing bet
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:21:17
Wow, is this the man himself? 
Thank you so much for all of your teachings. You’ll be glad to know I purchased your book “the internet of money” and have been soaking your videos up. 
I of course diversify my inputs and listen to other people, but there is no doubt that you are a great linguist and incredible teacher! Keep it up and if you ever come to Southern California, I’ll be there!
Thanks Andreas!

Still not showing the transfer 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:41:53
Is a paper wallet something you can request from Coinbase and then print it off?
Is it best to store them in a safety deposit box or what?
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:47:09
What does this mean?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:49:12
Well, I figure two coins would be great bc it is the smallest way to double your investment from 1 to 2 coins 2 to 4 coins or 5 to 10. 
So 2 coins is my goal but of course we all want more 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:44:16
Lol I’m not scared!! I’m hoping! I’ll soon be one of you all. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:07:10
If we want bitcoin to be a currency for all, how do we protect the very poor in countries that no way of keeping a H.W. wallet or paper wallet safe? 
I know a pin is one way on a H.W. but people could still steal it and get your pin while holding you at gun point
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:39:22
Where do I find the back up code? I already have 2FA on Coinbase and gdax
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:45:12

And if they don’t??
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:07:15
Money isn’t the issue for me (although it would have been much less of an issue if I had bought back in 2013! Haha)
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:48:15
Just patiently waiting for the dip
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:30:17
Hodling is the easy part for me
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:05:17
Will scaling be the downfall of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:08:21
You mean the dip whenit hits 10k and goes back down to 8k? Lol thanks for the advice and I’m kidding, but kinda not!
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:38:20
How do I keep the seed safe? So many things to keep safe! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:07:47
I’ve been learning for 2-3 weeks now everyday but geez, I just know it won’t be at 8k forever
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:22:31
Why are you surprised? Should I buy three?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:30:02
I’ll ride to to 0$ or the moon, which ever comes first. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:40:22
Thanks! A second and third random question is.. 
If I’m about to buy 2 coins, can I buy it on Coinbase and learn more about digital wallets later or would it be advised to immediately get it off Coinbase. 
Also, if I’m going to buy 2 coins, would it be smarter to do a little more research and buy them off the G... thing owned by coin base? 
Let’s say the price of 1 coin is 8000$, will it cost me $16000 for two coins or more
Bc of fees, paying the miners etc 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:33:33
Thank you! Can you advise a wallet! Also, let’s say I buy through Coinbase, will I get a private key? Can I physically write the key down and store it in a safety deposit box?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:12:48
Yea but how do you when is best to maximize. Anyone that has bought at ATH in the past is considered a smart person now.
