You mean big like shares...but then again the rich, they are still manipulating shares even trough it’s a big market, it’s not impossible. The top 1 generated 82% of the worlds wealth in 2017, and that won’t change just because we go into a unregulated market. this will just keep increasing over time.

Funny when bitcoin goes on a rampage altcoins follow up they don’t go down???? at least that’s what I witnessed. Maybe we haven’t looked at the same charts. 
just because bitcoin lose dominance it don’t mean that bitcoin won’t increase in price. For example if the total market cap increase with 30% and only 2% goes to bitcoin it will increase in price but fall in dominance. 
After all it’s the total market cap, we have to look out for. If the market cap increase everything increase most likely (well most coins) also bitcoin.
Blockchain as a technology will have a lot winners. Many of the coins have different purpose. 
It’s like apple and Microsoft both can be winners even trough people look at them just as tech companies, they do have a completely purpose 
(Sry my english is shit)

Sry to say, but it’s still the rich getting richer and the normal guy mostly loosing. I don’t know why people think a unregulated market is good
For the Average Joe and bad for Wall Street....it’s clearly still the rich that manipulate the crypto market and getting rich by the pump and dumps. 
The few Wall Street people that goes into crypto still have the biggest advantage...money. I am not saying that the young and normal don’t have a chance, and some will get rich, but a lot more will lose money. the guy that are rich (old or new) money will always have he best chance of getting richer, by the unregulated or the regulated market. 
Might be some old people missing out....but more and more will come and push the little guy away....no new world structure will be build ( maybe a new cash system if we are lucky )

You must be living in a fantasy world....is this a meme? You think your appearance alone will get you a good job? And a resume requires you already did something.... also that’s not education 
also if you have to get a job in IT you have to have talent.personally what your saying is bullshit..my whole family works in that industry. 
Just listing to your uninformed talk makes me mad. You sound like a scammer that have bullshited people your whole life.
Is this from some self improvement bullshit book you read? Or have written?

You belong on /iamverysmart
He can read for free. We are talking about investment. If he have a computer he can self improve all he want.
You are saying that he should just not invest because he don’t have a lot of money. And then just earn some money by getting a new job that gives him a 6 numbered salary. And I already know a 6 numbered isn’t special, especially where I live. 
But just because other did it and some did it even better don’t mean he have the time to just do it.
Also I live in a country with free education so my poor and rich friends all read books.
Also your saying that small investment will give him a huge opportunity....but get dressed up for a job interview is just a normal thing...if you don’t have the skill set or educationally you won’t get the job. It don’t matter how overdressed you are if you Don’t have the education or experience for the job. Your talking to the wrong audience! Good advice if you have the qualifications but what if don’t have those to get a 6 number salary, then being dressed up won’t matter.
And then you talk about IT jobs. But we don’t know if he works in that field. And in IT ...especially in coding, it’s the talent that matter. If your good you WILL get a good job! And I am sure they will take that 200 dollars course if they need it! You think those people can’t think for them self or what? 
You just giving normal dress up advice to people that already know that. It’s ridiculous. You think people with qualifications to a 6 numbered job don’t know how to dress up??????
And coders don’t know to apply for jobs? 
People can self improve and invest at the same
Time:....and it’s not your cloth or because you read some random book that will give you a job.
It’s your Education and network.
But we are talking about investing 
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:59:04
Bullshit advice ...only investing when you have a 6 figures income ....please don’t listen to this guy.
But don’t invest instead of paying your bills.
if you have spare money. Investment when your young is the perfect time, that’s the age when you don’t have responsibility and therefor can afford taking risk.
Just remember nothing is guaranteed when you invest.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:27:35
So how do you invest 200 into your self ? What education can you get from that?
Good for people and you have done that....but I don’t know many education that only takes 3 years and give you a 6 figured number for only 200 dollars
Congrats for you for finding he holy grail ������
And no shit if you have more to invest then you earn more......it kinda give it self
And beside your logic is so flawed...I could say the same to you......you only earn a 6 figures number....well I earn a seven figured so don’t invest because you can only invest small money so it don’t matter. 
And someone with a 8 figures number could say the same to me....like it said money is subjective...

@_date: 2018-06-26 18:53:03
Not fud...I said in theory 
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:03:22
Investing can always effect your financial negatively As you lose money or gain money:-) 
Anyway I got some advice if you are gonna invest.
There is a lot of ways to invest
Short term (day trading, weekly trading, monthly trading)
Medium term (usually people that hold for 1-3 years. 
Long term (5year)
Then there is the risk tiers 
Low (not in crypto ��)
Medium (medium and long term) 
High risk ( investing in ICO^s, small market caps and day trading) 
The more you risk you take the the more you can earn or lose. 
Now the questions is what your goal is? And how much risk your willing to take? Are you here to 2x 3x in medium risk then holding in BTC or ETC is probably the best way to go.
Are you here for more, then you have to join higher risk like icos.....but here you need to use a lot of time to research or you are gonna lose your money in week. And even when you have researched you most likely will take a loss sometime
Keep your goal in mind and cash in it you reach it. Then take a break and think over your next goal.

@_date: 2018-06-26 14:12:14
Not everyone have the smarts or the funds to reach a high education. And not worth it? That’s subjective? What if he earns 10k and is happy with that? 
Also there is no thing as reaching quickly a substantially higher income bracket. He already have a kid.....maybe it’s not possible. 
Also what if he can’t afford a education ? Not like they are cheap if he live in USA? Maybe he invest so he can afford to become educated?
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:48:34
First of all I am not poor...and saying I have a poor person mentality is very cringe especially if you only earn a six numbered figure....big shot clam down. I was born in a quiet rich family, where I learned to invest since I was 12 years old:-) learning to increase your networth when your young is a good lesson while you study.
My point is that you should always improve your self...it’s not a Golden advice it’s common sense. But buying random stuff and think that will make you get a good job don’t really help. 
If your stuck in a dead end job without a education. Most likely a suit won’t help you. If your only option is apply to jobs that don’t require a education even more so. 
Dunno about your job but most salaries are near the same if you have the same job unless your are in specific jobs like lawyer or coder.
People that work as policemen or care workers....don’t really earn six number figures and can’t just ^improve^ and earn more..
You talk like everyone have your kind of job or something....there is other people in different situations...your not the center of the world.
My point is poor people can make money just as you can by investing...that’s actually the good thing about the crypto space. It’s a new market so you can earn a lot by investing a little.

A better investor hodl and buy at dips 
And a really great one, only sell at the start of a dip/crash and then buy very low....
And I know I am not great enough.....
never sell low if you believe in the tech/project....yes you might save something......but remember you are here to gain not lose, and your have already lost 100% of you investment until you sell!
 ....unless your a Professional trader, day trading should not be your concern.....beside that if your day trade...you need ALOT of capital or it won’t pay off (worth the risk). 
We are not pro traders...that’s why we cling to reddit.....we have no clue why, how and when. the best we amateurs can do is bet what we are willing to lose and then sell when we have reached our goals....
