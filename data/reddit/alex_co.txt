No problem. Good luck. If you need more help, just shoot me a message.

Like others have said, buying bitcoin now is a smart idea. But only if you’re willing to be patient. $100 is going to get you much for a long time. You would need the price to go up over $10k just to make $100 profit. And that could be a while. 
If you’re looking for a consistent flow of money in the near future, drop shipping would be the better route. I wouldn’t advise buying bitcoin to anyone looking for a little spending money. 
But as a side note, it is absolutely NOT too late to buy. Even $100 worth. Many of us truly believe the value of btc is going to skyrocket in the long run because the technology is just too revolutionary.
If you are looking for a quick return, my advice to you would be to find another way to get your spending money, and maybe invest like $10-$20 a week in bitcoin using part of that money. It’ll be slow, but it’ll build your stash and eventually you’ll get a sizable amount of bitcoin.
Bitcoin isn’t a short term investment.

Yeah, like the other guy said, this is old news. Also, you can’t send or receive btc with other people within the app. You can only send btc to an external wallet, so it’s really not fully integrated for POS use, but it’s a step in the right direction!

Wait... HODL originated from a misspelling? I never bothered to look it up. I just assumed it meant "Hold On for Dear Life". The more you know, I guess. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:41:57
Yeah, I completely agree.

You can buy that little with Square’s Cash app and transfer it to an external wallet.

This is actually pretty cool. Totally worth it for $3/£2. That $29/£20 international shipping charge is absolutely insane for something this tiny though.

Nope. No fees.

From the home screen of the app (the green screen with the pay/request options), click on your profile in the upper left corner. Once you're on your profile, scroll down to "Funds" and select Bitcoin. There you can select "Withdraw Bitcoin".
Keep in mind though, you will need to be verified by Square first. It'll walk you through the process, but it can take a couple days depending on how slow they want to be with it. It took around 36 hours for me, iirc.  
Hope this helps!

Gotcha. I like it. Good work!

That's awesome. Not to take away from his achievement (a mix of faith/luck), but I wonder what he thought when the price per btc exploded the following month. He bought this for 45 btc in October ($4444/btc) and the following month the price tripled. I guess it's hard to be upset with yourself when you're cruising in that thing, though. Cool to hear some success stories. Thanks for the post, OP.

I’ve never heard of him. Seems like a good dude, though. I’ll check out his stuff. 
Article says 45, but the author could be misinformed. Do you know what kind of Audi he had before this?

I liked it! Definitely has potential. Are the “episodes” going to be this long or would they be longer?
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:40:03
Gotcha, good memory! Like I said, it could have been the author being misinformed. Thanks for setting that straight.

That was my thought exactly. 20 btc for a car that will depreciate like crazy over the next five years makes me feel awful. But honestly, I can’t exactly say I wouldn’t buy something like that for myself if I were in his shoes. Haha. So kudos to him for treating himself. Not sure how credible the article is, but it also says he bought over 1000 btc back in 2011, so if that’s true, I think 20 is more than fine to splurge on something with lol
