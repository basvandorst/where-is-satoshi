You did take 12 grand of his though.

Not good enough.  Unless there is a court order, there is no reason why you cannot tell him why it has been frozen.  You freezing funds has consequences.

Again, not good enough. There is a court order or there is not.

Sorry you are right.  But you must see the frustration when you hold 30 k and the initial explanation is only that there are 'irregularities'. Why is it that the light of publicity is needed to get ppl to treat others decently

Coinbase is doomed.  The way it handles compliance is very very poor. In a world where one can deal in bitcoins anywhere in the world, there is no reason for Coinbase to exist at all.

Wow you lost enough to put a hit out on that guy.

Coinbase dropped the ball on this for sure.  The verification process is not workable unless one has an autofocusing HD webcam, perfect lighting conditions, and a comet is passing by at the exact moment you take the picture.   
If this is what they think is an acceptable process, then I suggest that is an indication of the low standards in which they run the rest of the operation.  No chance of me trusting them with all the details needed to do identity theft then.

I'm not sure he is correct. But this could just be out of context....or the government needs better experts.

If circle is closing your account then coinbase is a non starter.

It's not political.  Don't do fraud.

I meant if he managed to annoy the compliance bods at Circle, chances are he will do the same to the compliance bods at coinbase.  
*and* he moaned about customer service at circle.  If that is important to him, I am not sure how any person can recommend coinbase.

Don't use coinbase.  It goes against the spirit of btc.  Kraken is pretty good.  
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:24:58
This is just terrible. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 23:19:28
Stop using coinbase.  No reason at all to use it. /thread 
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:50:43
They are making it up. These analysis is not worth the paper written on. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 09:41:26
I've always said coinbase is an anachronism.  It is trying to work with new technology while stuck with a primitive mindset.
