Yes- stated another way, there is no perfect or completely secure way to hold bitcoin. I would say that the security of bitcoin on coinbase is about the same of having money in a Bank safe deposit box. Having bitcoin on a hardware/paper/brain wallet is about as safe as locking it in a home safe (or worse depending on the details).
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:04:11
The trendline should be straight, indicating exponential growth on a logarithmic scale. I made one for Business Insider: 
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:16:41
Yes- Nothing is perfect. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:02:35
Moving BTC only affects the BTC chain, not the BCH chain. You needed to move the BTC off of Coinbase prior to the fork in order the access your BCH. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:02:15
I made a similar chart for Business Insider with a trendline, check it out:

Not all exchanges are created equal. Many have protections that you can't get with hardware/brain/paper wallets (insurance, next-of-kin planning).
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:53:49
Coinbase Bitcoins are worth more than paper or Trezor Bitcoins because my Coinbase Bitcoins have insurance, next-of-kin protocols, and a built in exchange. Mt Gox didn't have these, so I never kept coins on their exchange (although I used it!).
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:34:41
It opened at $800.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:25:50
Moore's law isn't a rule but an observation that Bitcoin seems to be following. It applies to any legacy technology (here, finance) when it becomes digital. There really is no way for Bitcoin to go "mainstream" without it following exponential growth. So the only question really is whether Bitcoin will go mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:23:46
Let the market decide. So far, BCH is way down from its August 1st opening price and BTC is up 70%. There simply is no dev support for BCH, which is the lifeblood of a successful crypto. It is propped up by conspiracy theories, a few bitter individuals, and the fact that Coinbase isn't letting their users dump BCH yet. Meanwhile, EDA and miner centralization continues to fester. BCH could continue to hang on as an altcoin, much like Ethereum Classic, but it never had a shot at being Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:03:05
A lot of the BCH price is propped up by conspiracy theories, pseudo-religious devotion to out of context quotes from satoshi, and idealization of Ver/Jihan. Plus, 8m people on Coinbase are being forced to hold. And there are the mystery miners...... BCH is on unstable ground. 
Edit: spelling 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:29:02
Not at the moment- users have no access to their coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:36:37
No way. Anything over a few BTC I would keep on Coinbase. What happens to your Trezor when you get hit by a bus? People with significant holdings want insurance and next-of-kin protocols. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:38:31
Sorry, we are talking about BCH

@_date: 2017-08-17 10:56:24
Another reason I use coinbase. People's hardware/paper/brain wallets are always perfect until they aren't. Coinbase has insurance and protocols for next-of-kin. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:14:21
Perhaps we are looking at different exchanges? Regardless, BCH has not regained its first day (or first few days if you prefer) marketcap. I was not talking about mining profitability, of course, but the price of one BCH. Alternatively, compare the increase in marketcap in $ terms of BTC vs BCH. BTC has gained more from the fork than BCH. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:57:38
Posts like this are not helpful to anyone. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:26:56
In addition, the price of BCH is being artificially propped up by Coinbase because they are effectively forcing their users to hold. Despite that, BCH is down more than 50% from its high.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:15:20
No insurance is ever "full." Applies to health, life, auto insurance, etc. There are always exceptions. You are correct that the insurance doesn't cover you if, for example, you give your password away via phishing and don't use 2FA. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:06:07
That's just one metric. Another is that BTC has added $1700 in value since August 1st which is almost 3x the current value of BCH. This means that since August 1st, investors have been willing to put $3 in BTC for every $1 they want to put in BCH. The fork has benefited BTC more than BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:59:43
I contractually own them. I don't have them in my physical possession because that comes at too great a risk. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:32:04
Coinbase, for example, is insured under certain circumstances and has a protocol for next-of-kin transfer if you fall ill or are hit by a bus etc. And it is of course immune to floods, fires, physical theft, forgotten seeds, etc that are pitfalls for other wallet types. I never kept coins on mtgox because they didn't have these protections. I am comfortable with coinbase, however. In fact, I prefer them to hardware/paper/brain wallets. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:01:06
The point being that while BTC has been making new highs day after day (up $1700 since August 1st), BCH is well below its August 1st high. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:36:14
I honestly don't care about 1MB vs 2MB max block size. I will support whatever the consensus is because I realize that having a fractured bitcoin community is the real risk.

If you scroll up the thread, you'll see that that was one of several metrics I was using to compare BCH and Bitcoin. I stand by it, but there are others metrics you can look to if you prefer.

Prior to the fork, rather than spamming Bitcoin, couldn't Bitmain have been using ASICBOOST to mine another altcoin?

The more you invest, the more you should keep it on Coinbase. Coinbase has insurance in certain situations and next of kin protocols. I personally would not keep a large sum in an uninsured wallet, especially if the funds would be lost if I were to fall ill, etc.

TA has some merit like looking at levels of resistance and support. Things like "candelsticking" are totally bogus however. Everyone who bought Bitcoin in 2013 has made money, so our point was that this doesn't prove anything about TA. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:53:49
So what would be the next step to increase the block size max? Will we eventually need a hard fork? Or would we stop at ~2MB and rely on off-chain transactions?
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:04:23
Being you own bank is good insofar as you have the capacity to do so. You lose this capacity if you are hit by a bus or fall ill. That is why most Americans keep their money in a place that is insured and transfers wealth to next-of-kin. Coinbase has insurance under certain situations and next of kin protocols. I never left BTC on MtGox, but am happy to on Coinbase.

OK- what if your beneficary is a toddler or a group of fighting relatives or is not tech saavy? I would just keep your coins in coinbase, they have next-of-kin protocols.

@_date: 2017-10-31 19:05:45
The way it works is that miners can go wherever they want. If they don't like Bitcoin, they can already move to any number of altcoins. They stick with Bitcoin, however, because it is profitable. Users determine the price of the coin which is related to miner profitability. Since miners follow profitability, they tend to follow users. Most users are uninterested in a contentious hardfork, will stick with Bitcoin, incentivizing miners to do the same. Then, hopefully, we can all move on from these forks and work together to make Bitcoin better.

These are good reasons to have two factor authentication with 48 hour waiting period before any withdrawals using Vault. The point of Coinbase's insurance is to give confidence to people worried about MtGox, not to prevent you from losing your passwords or falling prey to phishing. 
I'd also rather Coinbase handle any next-of-kin issues. I prefer this to having multiple people try to interpret a private key from a safe and then split the bitcoin among themselves. Sounds easy to us, but this is riddled with risk for those who don't have bitcoin experience.

It matters so long as you are measuring trust objectively. For example, Coinbase is insured in certain situations, so you can trust them somewhat more than an uninsured exchange.
