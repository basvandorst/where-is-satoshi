I'm not sure if you're serious.
You just listed off points that were apparently reasons why you felt gold was worth something aside from being shiny. I just illustrated to you that those properties you listed are not exclusively held by gold. If anything, "so what?" applies more to your initial points than mine.

@_date: 2014-02-03 21:24:35


No it doesn't. It doesn't prove anything unless you're subjecting the counter argument to the same level of scrutiny (statistically significant regression, etc.)
Coinometrics has demonstrated decreasing volatility. If you're skeptical that adoption is driving that, that's perfectly valid. I feel comfortable *assuming* that wider adoption (which there most certainly has been) is playing a role in reducing volatility. Maybe you don't feel comfortable making that assumption - that's fine. But in a world of abbreviated data, which bitcoin most certainly is at this point, there isn't anything wrong with making conjectures.
After all, I'm not guaranteeing anything. I'm just providing examples of how increased adoption *can* lead to decreased volatility.
@_date: 2014-01-21 19:32:21
I don't disagree, however that's becoming increasingly harder to do with each passing day. I'd also imagine that bitcoin would want to emulate a coin that's extremely intuitive if it could. On the other hand, if that ease of use comes at the expense of security, I can't see it experiencing much adoption.
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:02:09


@_date: 2014-02-03 20:41:20
No, you've misinterpreted me. I haven't said the only way to increased liquidity is through merchants treating it like a currency. Liquidity can increase for a variety of reasons. But the avenue it takes is largely irrelevant.
For the most part, we've already seen volatility decrease due to wider spread adoption. Are we at the point where it's low enough for merchants to feel comfortable holding? Perhaps not. But we've undeniably reduced volatility over the years simply through wider adoption and better education about bitcoin and money in general.
There isn't any reason to think this mechanism won't continue to a point where merchants are willing to shoulder the (now lower) risk of holding, thereby reducing volatility even further.
It's not a guarantee, but it has good reason to be believed.

I'd venture to say once you pass the $400-500 billion range, you're now larger than any single company on the planet. I, for one, think this is entirely plausible and dare I say, likely.
Now, is this the point where hysteria as previously mentioned steps in? I'm not so sure. For one thing, information spreads much faster now than it did during the .com bubble or the 70s/80s. So while I agree that the true hysteria is probably a little while off, it may come quicker than expected simply due to how quickly word travels.

You're right. It being so makes it so.
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:02:41
There's an active development team that seeks to make improvements to bitcoin, but in order for those changes to be incorporated, the majority of the mining network needs to accept them.
If the developers proposed changes that altered some of the core fundamentals, it'd be quite the challenge to get the network to agree to the change.
The open source nature allows people to remain skeptical and only implement changes that have widely agreed upon merit.
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:49:56

I don't believe this is an all-or-nothing game. Bitcoin can still experience very wide adoption without completely replacing fiat.
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:09:55
I'll agree. My only contention is that since this is founded in finance, the migration could take a little longer not due to any technical shortcoming, but because people are usually pretty conservative when it comes to finance/money.

Cost/benefit analysis.
Taking the time (money) to get the payment option added must positively affect their bottom line. How many people are going to pay with WoW Gold/Dogecoin? Nearly zero.
As we've seen with Overstock, the amount of people who want to pay with bitcoin is far from zero. Therefore, it may make sense for Amazon to take the time to add it as an option.

You can have a look at their methods and assumptions at the bottom.


You're technically right (the best kind of right) that this is an assumption. That said, it's the only metric I've come across that logically explains the relationship we've seen. If you're wanting a regression to prove with a given statistical significance that it is in fact wider adoption that's resulting in decreased volatility, I'm afraid I'll leave you unsatisfied.
Perhaps someone else has done this already.

@_date: 2014-02-03 19:26:50
Almost all of those criticisms are founded on bitcoin's volatility (which is keeping merchants from pricing in bitcoin, holding bitcoin, etc.)
There's solid evidence to suggest that as that volatility subsides and more confidence is earned, we could see a shift toward merchants treating it more as a currency. I don't think the lack of that is a huge problem at the moment. It's still an immature technology.

I don't think the "whoa there" is warranted.
I didn't say that sales from day 1 are going to continue like some freight train. The point is that Overstock likely did some market research and maybe found that they don't need to do much in sales for it to be cost-effective.
Amazon *could* come to the same conclusion. After all, both Overstock and Amazon have nearly identical business models and both are $1B+ companies so they're likely looking at very similar aspects.
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:39:13
What is wrong with you?
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:01:34
There's a ton of information in this subreddit. I've found it most helpful to search first.
Here's something you can start with:
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:24:59
I completely agree.
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:06:26
The volatility subsides by increased liquidity. When liquidity is low, it doesn't take much in terms of volume to move the price a substantial amount.
Here's an example using a stock I like (Neo&amp;Bee)
If you look at the volume (QTY column) of the shares being traded, you can see that if someone is looking to buy 35BTC worth of shares right away, they'll have to fill 'Ask' orders until they've spent the entire 35BTC. So the top of the 'Asks' (essentially the cheapest anyone is willing to sell shares for) is 1330 shares @ 0.002984 BTC/share.
So you with your 35BTC will spend 0.002984 * 1330 = 3.968BTC to get 1330 shares. Now you have 31.032BTC left. So you go down to the next highest 'Ask' order (1500 shares @ 0.002985 BTC/share) and fill that. After filling that order, you now have 26.555BTC left. Now onto the next order (2500 shares @ 0.002986 BTC/share). You keep doing this until you've spent your entire original 35BTC.
So now you've spent 35BTC and have roughly 13,000 shares. But in doing so, you've moved the price from the original price of 0.002984 all the way to 0.003079 (as that's now the cheapest anyone's currently willing to sell for).
Now consider if the amount of shares at each price were drastically smaller. All of a sudden, trying to accumulate 35BTC worth of shares would move the price a huge amount. This would be widely touted as the stock price being extremely volatile (which it would be!).
As liquidity is increased, what's essentially happening is the amount of shares at each price level is getting larger. Now it takes a lot of money to move the price. If the top 'Ask' order from that chart had been 25,000 shares @ 0.002984 BTC/share) your 35BTC wouldn't even fill the whole order and therefore wouldn't move the price at all.
Increased liquidity = harder time moving price = more stability
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:46:59
Exactly right.
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:46:14
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:36:48
Where do you think bitcoin falls on this spectrum? Because I see what you're saying. Instead of .coms (essentially businesses providing some product) competing in the 90s, we're now seeing competing protocols. 
Now what made certain .coms stick and others fall by the wayside? There's obviously a psychology at play here. With .coms (businesses) I feel that psychology comes down to things like the company name, the look and feel of the site, the user experience, etc. - but all things the public can see and interact with.
A protocol is a bit different. It's fundamentals are out of view and what makes them different are largely specifics regarding behavior, etc. So since the public can't put eyes and hands on a protocol the same way they can a business/website, will we really feel the kind of competition we saw in the 90s?
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:12:25

I really find this to be spot on. The amount of vitriol bitcoin discussions create is intense. You have the proponents acting like you're a moron if you don't instantly grasp and support the idea, and then you have the detractors who feel they're experts in new, never before seen technology.
One things for certain, if news comes out: tell the other side they're retarded.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:25:59
You're not wrong, but remember that any money spent to do such a thing needs to be seen as a sunk cost (it's not like they're getting that investment back). So they need to simply spend the requisite money to destroy it, and then they'll have to do the same thing for every new altcoin.
I'm skeptical that people are going to leave the idea of cryptocurrency in the rear-view. There will almost certainly always be another altcoin.

I have a hard time understanding how people can look at the state of the Internet in 1995 (not even 20yrs ago!) and not see how something similar could (and likely will) happen with bitcoin. In all reality, it will likely happen in a shorter timeframe due to existing familiarity with digital systems/media and an ever decreasing population not accustomed to such.

@_date: 2013-11-12 21:18:22
It's true that there's a finite amount on earth. I see you ignored my second case example.
Consider this: do we know how much gold exists on Earth? The scarcity of gold is dependent on how proficient we are at finding it. That line of thought doesn't go on forever, but for the present and relative future, it's accurate. The same isn't said of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:37:27
No argument out of me regarding the current convenience. When that point is brought up I always wonder, is that the end of the line as far as consideration goes? Because when I think about this stuff, I usually try to extrapolate out reasonable scenarios. In doing this, points like that fall to the wayside and as such, I usually don't even bring them up. In this case, bitcoin's inconvenience is purely due to it being immature. But it won't be immature forever.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:30:19
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:07:56

@_date: 2013-11-12 19:42:45


So if I read you correctly, you're saying gold has intrinsic value because it's scarce. But in reality, gold is only as scarce as it is prohibitively expensive to mine. If you develop technology cheaply enough to justify extracting gold from seawater or mining asteroids, your scarcity diminishes.
Bitcoin is *guaranteed* to be scarcer than gold. So you can't say that gold is intrinsically valuable due to its scarcity, and not apply the same trait to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:38:18
You didn't make any attempt to answer my question. I'm asking why you think the real estate/tech bubbles are comparable to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:26:48
The mistake I feel you're making is focusing only on bitcoin's least established trait - its use as a transactional currency. In that respect, I agree with you, we need to see an increase in the number of places accepting bitcoin. Given its technical and complex nature, that could take some time. That said, I'm not worried in the least.
Its use as a store of value, however, isn't dependent on how many people accept it in exchange for goods/services. It's dependent on how sure people are that it will be worth tomorrow what it was today. Obviously this fluctuates, but it's tough to argue that it's *usefullness* as a store of value is likely to subside for any extended period of time.
Also, at what point does a correction or dip, become a "bubble popping"? A 10% drop? 20%? What are you using to qualify the statement, or rather, why do you use the term *bubble* instead of *correction*? 
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:39:13
The general consensus seems to be that small-scale mining operations will result in a net loss at this point. What computers are you referring to?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:21:22
The industrial usage of gold is massively overplayed and from what I've read, only constitutes about 10% of gold's current valuation. Second, no one has outright banned bitcoins use as a currency. China's red tape is with regard to financial and payment institutions. There isn't anything stopping the average merchant from accepting it.

I don't think the news is something to sell over. The only legit translation I've read through has stated that all this red tape is with regard to financial and payment institutions.

I don't think you quite understand. You also state there are "lots" of assumptions about "other variables" and fail to give a single example.
If you have a small economy, relatively small amounts of money can move the market. As the economy grows, it requires increasingly more money to move the market the same amount. This isn't difficult, nor are there a plethora of underlying assumptions. This is basic math.

It depends on how much you're storing and what percent of your net worth it represents. A good rule of thumb is to not keep any amount in an online wallet that you wouldn't keep in your physical wallet.

I agree - if the fees associated with bitcoin become too large, then altcoins will begin to gain popularity, no doubt about that.

Check out localbitcoins.com. If you're in the US and don't mind linking a bank account, check out coinbase.com.


Does FRN=Federal Reserve Notes? Localbitcoins is going to be the easiest place to exchange a fiat currency for BTC. The problem is they're typically more expensive than exchanges.


A satoshi is the name for the smallest denomination of bitcoin (0.000000001 BTC)


Services like BitPay and Coinbase Merchant Accounts insulate the vendor from the market fluctuations by fulfilling the orders at the value of BTC at the time of transaction.


Inflation =/= fluctuation, you're right. The fluctuations are something that will begin to subside as more liquidity is added to the bitcoin ecosystem. We have a ways to go before that happens, but it's getting better and better everyday
Hope this helps :)

@_date: 2013-11-21 23:03:31
Can you expand on what you feel is good about his argument? I see him making a lot of assumptions about how people are going to use bitcoin and what they want bitcoin for. He said people using bitcoin are simply looking to exchange them for something else and are all looking to "cash out". This is simply not true. I personally have no interest in "cashing out" of bitcoin and I know first-hand many people who feel the same.
The lack of 'intrinsic value' is a really tired argument. Intrinsic value is a purely human construct. There isn't some universal law that dictates that gold is to have value. We've chosen to value gold due to its specific characteristics. It's that simple. It has (had) the best characteristics to fulfill it's role as an early transactional currency and store of value. It was easy to distinguish, relatively easy to divide, resisted corrosion, etc.
Gold has value because of its history and ubiquitous understanding of those traits. If you're going to argue that gold has more intrinsic value than bitcoin, you'll have to qualify the comment with "...right now". Meaning, as more people begin to see the value bitcoin brings forward as a technology, the more it will become a household name, and (by Schiff's definition) the more intrinsic value it will have.
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:32:43
You may need to, because in terms of volatility I see it like this:
How many people are able to move a $1,000 market more than, say, 50%? A shit load.
How many people are able to move a $1,000,000,000 market more than 50%? Not too damn many.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:11:43
I think you're over-embellishing the deflationary effect. If you're simply arguing your point in the near-term (during bitcoin's infancy) I suppose I'll agree with you. I think it's quite likely that the value growth of bitcoin will be substantially less than 400%/year as it matures. 
Are you then of the opinion that bitcoin is just simply, flat out a bad idea?

Bitcoin is one word, just a heads up.
Also, if we look to history for any indication, the increase (as a percentage) we've seen recently isn't on par with previous bubbles. If we look at April, the growth from the beginning of the run-up (~$13) to the peak (~$230 on bitstamp) equals about 1700%. If we agree we're in a bubble, then a reasonable starting point for this run-up is likely around 1 Oct. (~$115). An increase of equal magnitude to April would take the price over $2k.
So our ~300% gain isn't much compared to what we've seen. And yadda yadda, past doesn't predict future, this is just an example for comparison.

Typcially the transaction hits the network almost instantly, and by hits the network, I mean it can be verified that you did in fact have the money available to you to spend (which is mostly what the merchant care about). What I think you're referring to are *confirmations* which come as the result of miners verifying transactions as legitimate.
In general, you don't have to wait for a confirmation (avg. 10min) to buy anything under perhaps $500 or so. If you're doing something like a real estate deal, you'll want to wait for full confirmation (6 confirmations) before accepting the transaction as final.

A 51% attack doesn't guarantee success. It simply gives you a better-than-even chance at mining consecutive blocks. The race attack is arguably the only method in which this is viable. I'll certainly admit it's an issue, but the idea that you need to wait hours for a transaction is pure fantasy. You get the first confirmation, and you're golden for the vast majority of everyday transactions.

You're splitting hairs here. The thing is, people act like it's a guarantee that bitcoin is going to continue increasing in price. If that were the case, or if a person legitimately believed that, it'd be irrational for them to not plug all their money into it. The reason they don't? Because there isn't that guarantee. So while one has to choose if they want to spend their bitcoins on something with the chance that the price increases thus making their purchase more expensive, the knife cuts two ways - you may get the product/service at a smoking deal. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:55:17
Ugh...you're frustrating.
Bitcoin being cloned doesn't detract from its scarcity. Under the current conditions of bitcoin, there is a finite amount. There is also a finite amount of gold. I'm not saying gold is infinite. However, technology can progress to a point where gold could absolutely be manufactured (nuclear transmutation).
The point is that according to "the rules" bitcoin is finite. You can make the argument that someone else could come up with other "rules" and make another finite currency. Great, but that doesn't change the supply of *bitcoins*. That changes the supply of *cryptocurrenices*. Gold is not finite under any "rules" and thus *can* be changed if technology progresses to a point where it's feasible.
This isn't difficult and it most certainly isn't false.

In general, people have successful transactions with localbitcoins. I'd try and do the transaction in cash and wait for the first confirmation before leaving. Also try and pick an experienced seller for your first time.


Have a look at blockchain.info if you're looking for a web-based wallet. As you become more familiar with bitcoin and how it works, I'd look into either Armory or Electrum for managing your bitcoins offline.

1.) I think people get focused on the mining aspect too much in the beginning (myself included). I think that stuff should be left out of top-level talks and then touched on if the topic of "how" comes up. 
On that topic, I'd like to see a shorter, more entertaining version of the "how bitcoin works under the hood" video to explain mining. While it is a complex concept, the fundamentals don't require a degree in CS to understand. 
2.) Like others, I felt coinbase was a pretty easy place to get coins. Most people seem to be hit with the high-risk roadblock, but an email seems to fix that.

This is why any type of investing is seen as a risk.
If you wait and the price doesn't go back down, you missed the rise. And if you buy and the price drops, you lose value.
Trying to time any price rise/drop is extremely difficult. That's why those of us who have been involved for some time ask people to take a long-term look at bitcoin. If you understand the fundamentals and feel that what bitcoin offers people is valuable, then buy some regardless of price. If you don't see bitcoin as having value, don't.

First, calm down. You aren't the first to realize that obtaining bitcoins can be cumbersome.
Second, if you're talking about Coinbase, I'm left to assume you're in the US in which case you have zero excuse to be complaining. Coinbase is arguably the easiest way to get bitcoins aside from selling goods/services for them, or buying them in cash (at a premium).
You have to wait a number of days for them to hit your account, but the price is set at purchase, so you're not left hoping the price doesn't fall. If you're looking to buy bitcoins and then instantly spend them, you fall in a group that doesn't have a solid purchasing method yet. In that case, I refer you to my first three words.

This is an honest question: is it still confirmation bias to believe something that's demonstrably true?
For example, if someone says that bacteria growth increases at an exponential rate indefinitely, is it confirmation bias to say that the bacteria growth is exponential *for a period* until the population reaches a point where there isn't enough resources to sustain new growth?
Because that's what we see here, and it's about as objective a result as one can realistically get. As an economy grows, it simply becomes harder for a single individual to move the price a given amount. This *by definition* must reduce volatility unless it's being argued that the wealth of the individual is outpacing the entire economy, which isn't the case.
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:12:49
I think it's pretty evident that Peter Schiff simply hasn't come to truly understand the potential and implications of bitcoin. He's wanting to solve problems that bitcoin was *designed* to solve.

When I read this story, I thought "Oh man, we're in for a big drop here - probably stabilize around $40-50." Bitcoin is volatile to be sure, but you're making it sound like it's right on the edge of dropping to $0.
If the US Gov't takes a harsh stance on bitcoin, you can bet the price will drop. But it won't hit $0, I'll guarantee you that. I'd also venture to say that it would recover over time, regardless of the US govt's stance on it.

The problem new cryptocurrencies have at this point is competing against bitcoin's network effect. If you come up with something objectively better than bitcoin, it's likely easier to simply modify bitcoin to incorporate the change than it is to build a new currency from the ground up. In other words, any competing cryptocurrency is going to have to be a.) better in some way and b.) better in a way that bitcoin is incapable of adopting on its own.
It's possible for sure, but the odds only get lower with time.

The thing is everything "demonizing" about bitcoin was already said today right off the bat. CP, money laundering, terrorism, criminal activity, etc.
It's going to be obvious if they keep falling back on the same weak arguments and I think most people will see that.
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:56:28
I had the same thought. If it turns out to be true, then I'd imagine the continued price rally will attract more media attention, which in turn attracts more accounts to be set up, rinse and repeat.

I really can't wrap my head around this. What happened in the early days of the internet when the infrastructure wasn't capable of handling the demand? Did everything "crash" or suffer a "complete failure"? No. You just got messages like "Too many connections - please try again later"
I'm sorry but I feel like these points are incredibly shortsighted and live on the notion that development and expansion of services is just going to stagnate.

Don't say things like this. It doesn't help your credibility.
I will say that I'm glad this thread was started though. It seems a vast number of people are high-risk, so there needs to be some discourse on the topic.

There are certain things that people will buy regardless of the future expected value of their currency - food, rent, transport, etc. These are things people need. Few are going to starve themselves to grab a couple tens of a percent of added value. After all, what's the point in saving money if not to eventually spend it?
A currency increasing in value means that businesses actually providing a product or service that people value will be the ones that survive. If you're only looking at the number of businesses as a metric for determining the health of an economy, I think you're making a mistake. More is not necessarily better. I think about all the plastic party favors, confetti, and random chotchkies/knick-knacks that add zero value and require an immense amount of resources.
Inflation incentivizes people to spend and to spend as much as possible. I don't necessarily think that's good for the world. Yes it yields you a higher GDP, but I don't think simply increasing that metric makes for a healthier or more responsible economy/society.

I noticed he accepted a 1BTC bet offered to him that no Starbucks will accept bitcoin prior to some date prior to the end-of-year. SeansOutpost was the escrow.
It could just be an alt-account of the same guy, but it'd be interesting if not.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:21:50
I think the biggest legitimate critique of coinbase is their overzealous flagging of potentially "high risk" activity and subsequent cancellation of orders.
When I first made a purchase from coinbase, this is exactly what they did - flagged me as high risk. In the time I was waiting, the price had climbed, and like you mentioned, I was pretty well convinced it was an excuse to not sell me coins as they had appreciated in value. I sent them an email, expressed my suspicions, and they immediately reinstated the original purchase at the original amount.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:52:09
There's nothing wrong with highlighting that fact, but your comment makes it sound like a joke, or ridiculous, to suggest that bitcoin could be on the near verge of mainstream. Where's the patience? Imagine someone in 1995 saying "well the Internet has some video and chat features, but why isn't there hi-def streaming video? Why aren't there 2 billion people on the internet?"

There's a very solid argument for believing that small transactions (less than say $100) are perfectly fine to do with zero confirmations. The cost of successfully executing a double-spend is orders of magnitude higher than the cost of a sub-$100 item.

I think the fundamental utility of bitcoin make it a little more than a house of cards. It's value will fluctuate, sometimes drastically, to be sure. I can't say I'm a fan of people painting it in a light that makes it sound like it's one piece of bad press away from going to single digits. It's simply dishonest. You can convey risk without being pejorative.

It isn't true. Or if it is, only in the most pedantic sense. For everyday purchases, you can accept payment with zero confirmations. The cost associated with actually attempting a double-spend is incredible. The risk of accepting a zero-confirmation transaction decreases by (at this point in time) roughly **$2.5B** every ten minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-02 17:33:18
That's true, but I wouldn't count on the difficulty dropping any amount that would bring that Mini Rig back into the realm of being profitable.
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:22:49
What I mean is, I think we have some solid reason to believe bitcoin could stick. After all, the failings of eGold and LR are quite similar to the failings of Napster and Kazaa.
If an altcoin is going to improve on bitcoin, it's really going to have to bring something new to the table. I'm not convinced it will simply go the way of a popularity contest the likes of Myspace/Facebook - I think money is a difficult thing to change on a whim.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:21:39
That's simply tracking the most recent price. If an order is filled at $X, the price moves to $X. If an order is filled at $X-5, then the price moves to $X-5.

Keep in mind that bitcoin enables the introduction of financial services without needing 24hr electricity or full internet connectivity. Also, very basic smartphones are simply a matter of time. The penetration of cellular services is actually reasonable in a good portion of the developing world.
As long as people have *some* access to electricity and *some* access to Internet, bitcoin can help them.

This is part of the issue with the heavily propagated notion that anyone who wants to get into mining right now is an idiot. This is *not* something we want to reinforce.
We need more people mining.
There's nothing wrong with advising people that they will need a substantial initial investment ($50k+) to hold any relevancy,  but we need to continue increasing the mining breadth.

From my understanding, their capacity to be truly random is debatable.  By using dice, one gets to be about as random as is realistically possible.

And you could also forego a smartphone altogether. The counter you're making is essentially that a person can use Avenue A in lieu of Avenue B to pay for Item X. Using that same line, one could say that a person could use a paper map to get directions instead of a smartphone. This is true, but the smartphone offers conveniences the paper map doesn't, and people value those conveniences.
This is also true of bitcoin.

Yes, bitcoin has been volatile since inception. If anyone truly expected otherwise, I'd be shocked.
And yes, it's market share has been increasing the whole time.
What's really interesting is that you just leave it there. Why don't you go back through and have a look at the volatility range over bitcoin's lifetime? I'll make it easy: look at the peak highs as a percent of the peak lows and let us know what you find. Do you see a larger range (in terms of %) the farther back you go?

The scarcity argument really doesn't work with bitcoin, in my opinion. It does with gold, because it becomes cumbersome to transact in gold - bitcoin doesn't suffer from this. 
If merchants want people to pay with bitcoin, they'll surely be able to. Both the merchant and the customer want to hold onto bitcoins, but the merchant also wants the customer to buy something because he/she owns a shop. So the merchant will begin discounting prices for bitcoin transactions until the discount is *just* good enough for the customer to part with their bitcoin.

Gold is certainly a bubble by that standard then, yes? If so, I'm alright with where we're at.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:32:57
I don't disagree with anything you've said (except gold is larger than $600bn). The price can be affected rather easily, it's still high risk, etc.
My opinion is that I'm not the least bit concerned about bitcoin's value as it *currently* stands. I realize we're conversing about an extremely immature technology that is experiencing a lot of growing pains and has sizable ground to make up before it's easily usable by the general population.
I see lots of impatience and ridiculous comparisons out of people. Are we actually to believe that the infrastructure shortcomings and relative lack of user-friendly services are going to spell bitcoin's demise? I don't think so.
As far as I know, when a traditional bubble bursts, it doesn't come back. It's valuation far exceeded its utility, and as such, the market quickly and permanently corrected it. Tulips aren't making a comeback and beanie babies aren't climbing up Google trends. Bitcoin isn't a product or a simple service, but a technology - a value transfer protocol, and as such, I'm not sure what about it could be considered a bubble in the traditional sense. Can it's value pass its utility? Yes. That's where corrections come into play. But the utility is just starting to be realized on a large scale.
