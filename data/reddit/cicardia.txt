I believe there's an open-source solution for this. Please check Liquid Feedback - 
"LiquidFeedback is an open-source software, powering internet platforms for proposition development and decision making"
This software is already used for all the proposition, discussion and voting of the several Pirate Parties worldwide -  The payment/funding component isn't there, but any dev won't have to start from scratch.
Bear in mind that these small grassroots parties already won some seats in their national parliaments. Germany is one example.

gotta give some thought on both opinions. I've also been uneasy regarding stamp, but it's still true, untill now I didn't have any issue with them. and they gotta be making tons of $$, why ruin the business just cause other exchange is bigger. BTC isn't anonymous anyway. really running away today would be a lot harder.
think for yourselves

How do malicious traders know the margin calls level?
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:16:20
Yes, I only noticed after writing this! Good choice!
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:23:13
any data supporting this? interesting idea!
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:41:22
you base your trading decisions on which exchanges price action behavior?

It doesn't mention Roger Ver, that's me adding it up.

that would be a nice temporary workaround! +1

TY for clarifying. thought it was for a map feature.
And, it's a fact most "users" just use google, but shouldn't we distinguish between "android users" and "bitcoin users"?
From where I stand, there's a large share of bitcoin users using alternative ROMs, going the extra mile to be independent from google.

well, I use it and it works flawlessly

Perhaps I wasn't clear enough. I'm "upset" because I was able to use mycelium LT on my smartphone and now I can't. There's no way I'm infecting my system with google backdoors.
Even today someone posted "Google IS the NSA"

checked it out. too bad you have to pay for the intelligent alarms... check 
for a complete free and opensource price alarm app. 70+ exchanges, all pairs, assets, futures, etc.

maybe consider posting +1 on their issues page -

@_date: 2015-04-22 00:19:55
IMHO, LT IS mycelium. I've been running electrum-python on my replicant, without a single issue. Never considered using mycelium as a wallet. "Why use a wallet with all the extra unusable code (LT)?"
But you have a point there - "the Wallet itself is fine". True
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:24:29
There must be some better sources than others
@_date: 2015-04-22 00:20:53
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:48:39
yes, I bumped into the issue when running LT. The thing is, if Mycelium is just another wallet, why use mycelium if you can use electrum?
@_date: 2015-04-22 00:22:02
because of Google's proprietary code?
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:50:29
my previous mycelium version didn't have this problem. I updated today to 2.3.1
anyway, if it needs google for maps, why not use osmand? I mean... all the work with tor and then they use google =S
