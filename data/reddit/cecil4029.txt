Thank you for what you do. Seriously. Psychedelics have helped facilitate profound, positive changes in my life like nothing else. I've dealt with depression and PTSD since I was a teenager. LSD and MDMA helped me find my way out of the darkness. Bless you.

A $25 investment in Bitcoin isn't foolish at all. Your dad doesn't know the future. If you'd put $25 in less than a year ago, it would now be worth around $300. The ROI could be very great in the long run. Worst case, you're out $25 freakin dollars... ��

From my understanding, the BTC network will piggyback off of the LTC Lightning Network to help make transactions much faster. There have already been tests performed with LTC using the LN that have been successful.

IME, when bitcoin tanks a lot of alt coins shoot up. Just sayin, watch out for it!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:19:55
It's ok. I've been locked out of my account for 12 days. I found out when I was trying to buy $6,000 worth. I hate them so freakin much.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:39:47
Same. By the time I got settled into my career it wasn't possible to load up on coins like back in the day. Server Cecil was much poorer than career Cecil haha.

This is a great suggestions. MAPS is trying to achieve a lot for humanity and needs our help.

Sounds like me trying to invest heavily in LTC two weeks ago. But Coinbase disabled my account after 3 years of no problems and won't reply. So, your nightmare is my reality right now ��
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:50:08
Thank you for this helpful post. These are things that I've figured out so far in life, but I needed to hear it right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:45
Beats me. I've seen it happen countless times though.
Possibly, people move their BTC cash to alts when it starts dropping.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:18:55
I love all this brutal honesty haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:21:25
Someone mentioned you can take a pic on the Coinbase app and it will also verify for gdax. Not sure if true but worth a shot!
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:41:44
It's absolute bs. I've been on CB for 3 years with 0 issues. I signed up for gdax which is their sister company, and for some reason they wanted me to verify for it. I send a pic of my license, get verified no problem. I try to sign in for the first time and my account is disabled because on my license I have my full name, but my bank account has an initial for my middle name.
I've been on the phone with gdax 4 times and haven't heard anything from my ticket in a week. They say there's no one else I can talk to about it and they've escalated it as far as possible. I've lost thousands of dollars because of them so far. It's absolutely maddening.

COINBASE HAS ME DEACTIVATED FOR 11 FUCKING DAYS NOW AND WONT ANSWER MY SUPPORT TICKET. ��������
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:16:47
PLEASE work on unlocking my account! I've had a ticket in for 7 days now. I signed up for GDAX after being a CB user for years, uploaded my ID, got verified, now my account is blocked. 
Please help me fix this issue. I'm locked out of my account over a simple Coinbase/GDAX error and I'm being ghosted.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:00:21
In a nutshell... I've used CB for 3 years. Signed up for gdax which is basically the same company. I'm confirmed verified, but now my account is disabled. 5 phone calls, 4 support tickets, and 12 days later, I can't buy and there's nothing I can do. They've made me miss out on $7,000 profit on LTC of what I have to originally invest. I hope you get some help soon because this could've been a very life changing experience for me and they fucked me.

It's also the worst point he could starve, not pay for unexpected medical bills, so on and so forth. Sometimes things happen man!
I remember on the LTC sub, this guy was terribly upset that he had to sell all of his at $200 or so. He had held since around $3 but he really needed the money. In hindsight, he made the right decision!
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:29:20
I'm the same way. If you pushed him to buy it in the first place then it's pretty shitty for him to not throw you some. Either way, good for him I guess
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:41:33
Sure. But back then it was "play internet money" that everyone bought drugs with. I think very few people were thinking it'd make them rich.
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:10:45
Holy shit I hope he shared some cash with you
@_date: 2019-08-16 13:39:20
I'm sure some of them are. Most just cashed out their coins to get cash like everyone else.
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:16:22
Very true. I bought yesterday and today from Coinbase for the first time. Do I have to wait a week until it clears to be able to sell?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:11:19
God bless ColecoVision. ����

@_date: 2017-05-25 22:05:22
Looks like you made the right decision. Congrats! :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:24:19
That's what I did with mine back in the day! �� �� �� ��
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:27:12
Whew. That's scary. I think I'll just close that link...
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:11:30
I can't sell even if I wanted to... F'ing Coinbase will take another 4 days to clear.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:59:55
Coinbase. Stilllll waiting. Gonna be June 1st from what they say
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:43:46
You think this could be a scam or another gox? What's strange? Can I move them to an offline wallet once they clear?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:09:38
No offense taken. I'm by no means taking people's word as gospel. There are a lot of people here who are able to study cryptocurrencies as their job. I'm just trying to pull information from many sources and thought r/bitcoin's input would be beneficial. Thanks for the response!
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:54:40
We're almost in the exact same situation. Bought $1200 at $2375. Good luck! :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:13:17
I'm such a dumbass. I had soooo much DogeCoin two years ago and gambled them away on dogespin.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:03:53
No doubt about it. Your closest friends are family. The people I would die for/would die for me without a second thought is as close or closer than blood.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:10:49
I like your style.
