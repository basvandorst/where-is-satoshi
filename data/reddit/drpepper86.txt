Ohhh man, that's fantastic!

So Nicehash can be through of in a similar manner as a Coinbase? I've never dealt with (to the best of my knowledge) Nicehash, so I'm okay then, is my takeaway?
Sorry about the noob questions; I'm just starting to get a handle on all of this
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:45:49
So are the coins (I don't have a lot) I have in my own wallet (the one on my phone) are okay, or should I look at transfer to a paper wallet immediately?

This guy gets it!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:37
Yes, it will

I just picked up a some through an ATM not two hours ago and its already been confirmed...

_That's_ from where I know the name! Thank you!!

How bad an idea would it be to keep my private key in a password safe of some kind (Encrypted with 256-AES)? Am I just asking for trouble doing that?

It wasn't until this past week I realized I could buy a fraction of a coin.
I looked into Bitcoin briefly in August, found out that a coin was worth ~ CAD$5K and took a pass at that point...kinda upset when I found out that wasn't the case
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:00:26
Well that's true...and they've been pretty mum with just how badly we were shafted up here....
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:06:50
I'm quite happy to hear this, actually

And now that landlord has cashed out and is laying on his personal cruise ship in the middle of the south Pacific ocean
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:25:46
Oh thank goodness. Thank you!
If there's anything I've learned in the week I've spent researching this, it's that this is a bad, bad, bad idea and to move things to a personal wallet ASAP
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:00:36
I will, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:02:25
Yeah, that's what I don't like... honestly, it's not that I don't trust the exchanges, per se. More fearful, as I said, of them being hacked.

So I'm hearing "Sell all of your assets and buy Litecoin". Good point.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:42:54
Jesus, dude! That was a hell of a rollercoaster!

I was explaining it (to the best of my ability) to my brother last night and this was one of the first things I told him (of course, after he told me he didn't have the CAD$14,600 to buy an entire coin). Suffice it to say that I agree completely with this being among the first thing newbies are taught!

Friday's payday. If it could dip to, say, a couple dollars a Bitcoin and then skyrocket back up on Saturday to current values(ish), I'd be pretty happy...
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:48:56
That's exactly what my impression was initially when I looked at it back in August (when it was, like, CAD$5k per). It's only been lately, since I've researched it, that I've found I don't need to shell out the full amount for a single coin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:16:03
I was toying with buying into LTC about two weeks ago when it was ~ CAD$130. Now that it's CAD$360, I'm very, very strongly considering buying into it
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:46:38
I kinda figured that would be the case. I'd guess the private key can never be changed?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:38:22
It's currently CAD$16,330.36 /BTC
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:52:28
Made the mistake of buying at an ATM the other day. Won't be doing that again. I paid, like, CAD$3,000/BTC above market value.
