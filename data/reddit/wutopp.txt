Yeah, best case, a lot of shops are using lightning network by then, its not hard to integrate, and maybe there would be a wave of shops integrating it and having a lot of success, and a lot less cost than the visa fee.
Onchain merchant adoption has always been doomed from the start because of limited spots in a block.
Seems early, but maybe :)   
It might rally bullish and at the same time be a nice currency to use, which would maybe take it to new heights. 
But i would be surprised if this happened as early as 2020

The difficulty of obtaining a block changes dynamically so there will always be 1 block every 10 minute. If fewer resources is being put into it, it gets easier.    
But yeah, i lost to mtgox, and learnt the hard way that if its not your keys, its not your coins.
Get a trezor (hardware wallet) and cryptosteel (as backup), and keep it secret, then noone can remotely seize anything.
Even if your computer is riddled with keyloggers and backdoors.
Even more safe would be wiping that trezor, and split the cryptosteel in two safe places in different physical locations :) but thats quite impractical, but could be an idea for long term savings

Miners get the fees from transactions.
And bitcoin is working on reducing size of transactions, and eventually we will increase blocksize. So at that point the fees gained from mining a block should be sufficient incentive. Total fees are already quite a bit pr block

I dont follow your logic, if 1x bitcoin is being sold and bought for a million dollars, which it must to hit that price. Then there are ppl buying btc for that price.. which means you can sell for that price

It could be, or it could not be.  
Noone knows for certain

You have weak hands.

Nothing is indicating that there is a better crypto alternative at the moment. Its by far the most mature, which is very important in a open source protocol technology. and with lightning network, its got incredible transaction time and cost

Maybe you would just buy it because it is then the most practical and trustworthy currency to use.   
Not to get rich

Lightning network doesnt work without a blockchain,

bitcoin can be pretty anonymous if you treat it right (dont connect your.name to.ur address), and lightning network will make it.more anon.
its also a issue being worked on
