yep. essentially LN built in
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:18:33
yeh i dont know about that 10-20% gains thing. most real traders ive talked to usually take profit at 2-3x
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:09:34
thats the martingale method but can fuck you because of bet limits or you dont have enough to double your bet. eventually you cant double your bet anymore and youre screwed
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:39:17
actually if even reached 1000 i wouldnt buy in because that would indicate some *serious* issues at that point. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:34:03
2x? thats all? youre doing it wrong if you only double up in 2018
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:10:44
ill take one knowledge please
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:56:53
in all seriousness it would probably be bitcoin cash that he handed out just based on the properties of each current chain compared with how he envisioned btc progressing
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:18:35
that would be like declaring your wallet a foreign account if you leave it in another country. i dont think they can go that far
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:56:12
i can buy ethereum and have it out in minutes. i can sell and have the cash wired in hours, 1 business day tops
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:33:16
guess "Apple" shoudnt have written open source code oh wait thats the whole point of this shit
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:38:05
why does it matter if bitcoin loses market share? why does there have to be only one "winning" crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:25:28
educate yourself on the crypto space. its both ignorant and dangerous to believe only bitcoin is a real coin
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:09:27
can you tell me why bch is inferior to btc right now?
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:46:38
u just described bitcoin. seriously 
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:10:35


except for the part where china can pretty consistently manipulate the price and wealthy investors can move the market
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:12:12
either way "its a monetary system that exists outside of the influence of politicians and corporations." is clearly false
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:13:59


which is totally contrary to the spirit of bitcoin. in that coin, do we *want* the etf approved. we are so excited about bitcoin blowing up maybe we are starting to get lax about its intended purpose
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:03:20
because if you somehow shoehorn bitcoin and blockchain tech into a problem we didnt really have then its automatically a great idea
@_date: 2017-02-17 13:55:25


isnt that what transaction fees and the blockchain do basically?
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:27:28
what you are saying boils down to "change can be difficult and unpleasant so we best avoid it" followed by petty personal attacks
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:40:25


thats literally one of the reasons we have these human rights cases in the first place
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:17:38
but probably not bitcoin. probably a blockchain designed specifically for smart contracts
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:03:20
that latest amendment is why i went from hopeful to almost certain of rejection. all the sudden they have to explain hard fork risk to the SEC and all the dirty laundry that might come with one? if I were already skeptical, the possibility of a hard fork fiasco would put me at a definite "no" until that issue and potential fallout has been more clearly defined and planned for. And on that note, why the hell are they slipping in a note about hard forks weeks before this deadline like its something they just learned about?
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:07:25
thats less than the amount op posted
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:56:23
if you go back a read an old journal, whats going to have more meaning, that X event happened in February, or that it happened on the 7th? thats how i see it
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:50:20


yeh. if if if. how long has the current debate been going on between the hard/soft fork for expanding the block size? 
and again, its the largest because it was the first. its had a gigantic head start. it may be the largest but that doesnt mean it offers the most possibilities. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:20:15
That will change in the near future. bitcion just has a head start and that doesnt make it superior. its going to be newer blockchains that really embody the possibilities of this technology. I dont see why there is so much resistance to this idea. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:53:50
im not a fucking troll I own $500 in btc (the most I can afford right now). im sorry if its not obvious to you, im not sure how its not. I dont feel the need to explain self evident concepts. This is the attitude Im talking about and its a big turn off in this sub. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:03:33
is this distinction significant? regardless of the actual implementation, miners essentially do "produce" bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:21:15
like you bought ALL your bitcoin at the top?
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:20:19
uh oh. time for a hard fork
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:51:43
i didnt say they compete. my point is that bitcoin is not necessary in a future that heavily utilizes blockchain technology 
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:38:51
Some of yall really need to reign in the speculation. Their website could go down for 2 seconds and there would be people saying "this is bullish for bitcoin right??",  "thats a good sign!", "it means they are preparing for the ETF approval!" etc
@_date: 2017-02-16 11:58:24
wow, thats actually true. thats a really weird concept
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:06:03


yeh except for the whole human rights thing
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:14:14
wouldnt the best bet be to just buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-17 13:57:13
in 5000 years bitcoin will be a note in the history books if we even still place monetary value on things
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:39:43
can someone explain what a hard fork is? I read the definition on the bitcoin wiki but it didnt clear anything up for me
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:21:16
theres always going to be people who lash out when their views are challenged. you just kind of roll your eyes or cringe
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:55:07
why would I not hold? why does criticism of bitcoin equate to thinking its terrible? 
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:29:38
how do people on this sub read an article like this but then say all other coins are shitcoins. its glaringly obvious that blockchain technology is going to be extremely important in the near future and its also as obvious that bitcoin is not the one that will be able to accommodate many of the things people will be seeking to do (unless yall are ready for some hard-ass forks)
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:46:35


no one is quite sure
@_date: 2017-02-27 15:41:58
I dont use bitcoin. I buy and hold. Why would I ever use bitcoin to buy something when if I wait X years, i could buy X more with it? I can buy whatever I need in USD and not miss out because my $5 bill can buy twice as much a year later. 
It is actively disadvantageous for me to use BTC for purchases. which frankly means at this point in time btc is failing at one of its core purposes

theres the fallacy. any innovation requires the consent of a majority of users
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:12:22
so why does this have such seemingly sinister implications?
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:09:38


At a basic level, they really *do* make the rules. By controlling what rule changes or additions are accepted, they control the rule book indirectly. While they dont directly hold anyones money, they do however hold the whole network and could theoretically prevent anyone from using their btc, transferring or selling.
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:44:10
or shorting its rejection. I read about the winklevoss' additional proposal for handling hard forks and it made me realize that the threat of hard forks alone would be enough for the SEC to deny the etf. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 12:28:54
I honestly dont see bitcoin ever being widely used for general transactions, that will probably be handled by a newer crypto while bitcoin remains in more of a backbone position. You invest in/hold wealth in btc, while using a different crypto for actual purchases. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:48:24

@_date: 2017-02-25 20:57:12

its red but every current bitcoin holder buys one so the ocean is packed with them and yachts are worthless
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:56:41
yeh I was pleasantly surprised to read that
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:10:34


I learned that a crypto can successfully fork, survive and become stronger
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:28:44
I feel like this business of possible hard forks would be enough reason for the ETF to be denied. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:35:14
actually I think it slow rise followed by massive drop. guess thats means etf deny?
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:20:58

holy guacamole thats crazy. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:48:25
yes exactly. its a baffling concept to people when you point out that their cash money is only worth something because we all agree it is. most people dont reflect that deeply on the workings of society 
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:04:31
People love to forget that centralization of hash power is literally built into bitcoin right now. its the end result of its hard coded protocols yet we act like its somehow not a part of bitcoin when its actually a direct result of its design.

grats on arguing a point that was never even brought up. I pointed out similarities in wealth distribution patterns, which I felt is ironic given bitcoins goals. I never said anything was unfairly split and I dont think Ive been robbed, not sure where you got that.
Contrary to your view, apparently, I think its a great opportunity for many people who would not otherwise be able to gain much wealth to be able to do so by investing in bitcoin. Of course, that requires having wealth to invest in the first place. Which means most people dont have any opportunity actually. 




i seriously dont know what youre talking about or why. I stated a fact. not sure how that warrants a rebuttal regardless of how erratic its content is. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:38:39
yet you  reply with an equally vapid tweet comment. way to make a point
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:23:02
you could equally say blame everyone else for not agreeing to go along with it. the attitude that its "their" fault is short sighted, naive and demonstrates a lack of understanding of what bitcoin really is - a true democracy, and not everyone is voting your way, like it or not. Bitcoin is the *wrong* place to be if you think in terms of "them" or "others"
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:15:58
I knew it would be immediately. I clicked on the comments and said "ok lets see what he actually said"

They must not have researched it very well
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:31:09


but then...


these are literally contradicting opinions. You want btc to be real and free or not? you cant downvote what *you* think is best with one hand and with the other hand support "pro-liberty use". what the heck do you think pro liberty use means? If you are downvoting other opinions, it means youve already decided what you think is right for bitcoin and therefore have betrayed the ideas you say you stood for in the first place. 


Take a moment to think about what you *really* believe, because you've stated quite a few contradictions. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:40:55
i would prefer to see it not at all for something where money is on the line. quite possibly yes it would be better in closed meetings because it would give less of an impression that bitcoin might self destruct at any moment
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:15:12
usually when I point out some kind of problem with btc I get called a FUDder and downvoted. Thats what happens when people pick something, invest themselves personally in it and no longer view it through an objective, reasonable lens. Its ... annoying and certainly not helpful for btc. People seem to think bitcoin is some kind of magic messiah that if only "Fudders" would leave it alone, it would hatch into a phoenix and fly to the moon on a wooden roller coaster.

at $250 we werent looking at an imminent fork and 10k wont happen unless a wild solution appears. its different now, like it or not

both 4 hours old so its a toss up
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:04:18
i go between both subs and this one is an echo chamber as well, just for the other side of the debate. not taking a side, just stating my observations

edit*  1:32 now
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:43:42
"It might take you 12 hours to send your btc unless you want to pay a bunch of fees, but its worth it. Also it might shatter into separate smaller currencies. But we are desperately trying to find a solution before its too late. But its cool." 
I support btc but damn if thats not the truth, atleast right now. Hopefully we can look back and say "holy guacamole we got through it without any splits, and btc is healthier than ever"
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:06:16
i am
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:50:22
why would a miner want to do something that lowers tx fees?
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:04:45
so basically the 1% control the flow of bitcoin. while "releasing" it to the the 99% they are also able to buy up any available btc. they could easily control the majority and sell only tiny bits in order to inflate the price actually 
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:51:05
next time dont remove the context. the rest of that sentence was *"or atleast identities, on the btc blockchain."* which is comepltely true. your address is equivalent to your identity on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:29:34
terrible advice. the impending fork is a major event for bitcoin, will heavily impact hodlers before during and after,  and telling someone not to worry until after its happened is irresponsible. 
Lenny I'm not quite sure about the specifics. I think whatever coins you have now basically split into two piles of equal amounts, it will just be harder to interact with the fork pile. It might be advisable to keep your coins of the exchanges and in a secure wallet (as is advisable normally) for the foreseeable future until this business has been resolved. Exchanges will likely suspend trading during a fork and your coins will be stuck. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:07:27
lots of people with enough money. one of the troubles with btc right now
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:13:26
problem lies in that many people read the headline and absorb it as a fact without even reading the article
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:05:55
sorry, heres the link
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:40:31
so top 1% control majority of btc just like top 1% control majority of wealth in real life
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:35:50
i... am a long term investor. Im actually not one of the people who spin/rationalize everything as positive for bitcoin. I often call that out when I see it. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:22:44
when you say the other side is trying to destroy bitcoin, it makes your side sound right and lets you put a label on the other opinions which helps you not have to consider them
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:02:00


yes, clearly ethereum is just not valuable. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:18:16
This honestly doesnt seem like a good time to buy. not trying to "FUD" (its pretty stupid to dismiss negative issues with bitcoin by applying a catchall label but anyway) with a hard fork looming on the horizon... why would you buy? Why wouldnt you wait until it looks like we might actually reach a solution? What advantage is there to buying *right now* versus waiting to see if any positive developments come along? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:27:05
this is actually a huge problem with the system right now that I havent seen addressed. if you want a "say" in bitcoin, you just have to pay for it basically by buying enough hash power
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:46:34
yeh because thats totally whats happened

yes im clearly trying to provide you with emotional support. Anyway, not sure what your point is. people seem to hate it when anything not suggesting bitcoin is the crytpo savior is posted 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:59:21
maybe I need to be more clear. in the beginning, a miner was any old joe with a common laptop. all people could participate. now, mining is an industry and carries with it a huge cost barrier that the average person can no longer surmount. this leads to a situation where control of btc is no longer in the hands of the average user, its now in the hands of the group that has enough money to control the hash power. is that clear?
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:53:10

it will go up eventually regardless of etf
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:43:28
just buy regularly. even if you buy now and the price dips, the price is still going to go up higher in the long term and you will still make a profit. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:42:44
theres a level of fanaticism with bitcoin that i find disturbing. right now im trading much of my btc into alts, especially ethereum. as it is, I asked myself today: "why would someone invest in btc right now as opposed to one of the other major cryptos?" the answer was: no reason. Imminent threat of hard fork, inability to handle large tx volumes and high fees make it a bad choice for new long term investors and average daily users alike. Maybe it magically solves its problems, but until then, there are *several* others eagerly lapping up the crumbs that fall from bitcoins table every time angry fists locked in feud slam down upon its aging surface, built from strong, ancient arbor yet clearly showing signs of stress and wear. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:20:21


lol what are we talking about the same bitcoin here? bitcoins volatility is pretty much a running joke right now. its better but it's almost like a feature at this stage in its life cycle

@_date: 2017-02-22 00:00:31
any current btc price chart ;)
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:53:57




so we lose the majority of miners. hash power is gone by presumably much more than 50%. Bitcoin txs *come to a halt*, txs have to wait multiple blocks, bitcoin commerce *stops*. You cant punish certain miners without punishing *all* miners. AKA *no one* has incentive to mine. the average honest person will be losing money every minute they keep their operation going.  


No... what? do you not understand what miners do? *there is no meaningful network without miners*. telling them to go fuck themselves is equivalent to shutting down bitcoin. and im not implying that anyway. Im saying anyone who owned btc or was thinking about it will see this and say "fuck no im not investing in something that was almost hijacked by a third party".


it doesnt matter what the fundamentals are. if a cartel owns the miners, then we are buying a mining cartels coin. thats the reality
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:12:10
im not sure it will.

I dont have a source. I guess you are right though. the tx fees and confirmation times would definitely indicate its not able to cope on its own.

well you could have checked the sub first and easily found the answer
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:56:21
what are you even talking about?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:12:53
grossest thing ive read lately.  grats
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:59:46
This is not the same as the normal ups and downs. This is a legitimate down and its not random. Dont say welcome to bitcoin, because no one new is coming here at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:36:51


Do you hear yourself? "only the chosen should guide btc. just think of all the good we could have done *if not for those NEW people*. bitcoin should be decentralized, but only after this particular group has guided it"
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:34:06
didnt those people die
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:13:01
maybe I should have said "flagrantly invasive"
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:22:01
thats how its suppose to be. this is a good thing
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:01:35
lol whats a sesame score

sorry. thats just what it looked like.

does this not make these transactions become more private and less public?
what is the message that is finally recorded into the public ledger?
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:41:45
I saw this. My buy order was at 1234.56, so I stopped to take a screenshot for yall but I always have to look up how to do it on a mac. anyway, by the time I had taken the screen shot this price had moved up :'( thanks guys
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:06:47
it was him!
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:44:04


another good point. im messin around using you like this but im serious in that those are legitimate points as to why btc is not a good currency right now
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:44:46
most people dont have that luxury
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:04:35
this was posted earlier as a comment and put more eloquently as well. way to pass it off as your own idea
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:31:14
this is a good thing for bitcoin. the last thing we need are more forces that would have an interest in controlling bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:59:36
sooooo what did he do to help prevent that if he if he knew this?
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:56:42
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:04:14
especially if they are behind bitcoins creation ;)
@_date: 2017-03-12 00:48:12
not sure why you took my comment as aggresive. i was explaining to you why you received negative feedback
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:58:43
his vision is becoming increasingly invasive and controlling, even grandiose and egomaniacal 
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:55:22
lose 20% only if he sold after the dip, which there would be no reason to do. even if he buys now, etf deny, btc dip, price will just come back up and he'll make money regardless. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:44:27
yep. was thinking about that earlier
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:57:13


is that really the level of delusion we have reached in this sub?
Healthiest market?? investors are fleeing like its the plague. There is an imminent hard fork and huge split in the community.
No other crypto solved scaling? Most other major cryptos are already able to scale to vastly larger proportions than bitcoin. Ethereum is rolling out Raiden and beating bitcoin to the punch with a scaling upgrade. 
While bitcoiners strangle the currency, the other cryptos are moving ahead. 
Yall need to WAKE. UP. 
Bitcoin is NOT DOING WELL. This delusional "everything is ok" shit is STRANGLING THIS COIN AND ITS COMMUNITY. Everyday I come on here and see "BU is evil" and "This is good for bitcoin!".
Im NOT hodling anymore and its a great decision. While bitcoin is floundering, ethereum is doing everything bitcoin should be doing and its not even meant to be a currency. 
Until yall stop screaming "ITS ALL GOOD" you arent going to be able to address the real, serious, grave issues constricting bitcoin. 
I dont know what to say but its a frustrating facepalm everytime I check this sub. It was this sub that helped me join the btc community, this sub that made me question bitcoin later on, and this sub that pushed me to bail out, and it was a good decision. If it looks like there will be a solution, I'll buy back in. In the meantime WAKE UP AND LOOK AROUND YOU. This sub is *literally* that dog sitting in the room on fire meme saying "this is fine."


the thing is, now there are alternative that look more promising and less likely to utterly implode
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:19:29
United Air States Force.  or atleast thats what I think everytime I see it. see other replies for better answers. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:20:59
This might be great though. Keep bitcoin a public coin not a private sector asset
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:38:10
it wasnt shown, it was assumed and then taken as fact and that "fact" used as evidence to support the beliefs people already had. I dont know what the truth of the matter is, buts thats what I witnessed from a neutral standpoint
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:41:21
the control the rule book because they decide what new rules are added by choosing to implement them or not
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:25:35
there seems to be less or very little censorship lately, and it seems there was a greater amount in the past. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:24:21
yes, the idea people have invested in is pointless, but not bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:16:47
The response was very clear - they will support as BTC whatever chain has the most support behind it. Thats the only legitimate response in this situation anyway. There is no one true bitcoin. BTC is only what most people agree it is. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:35:33
this is my favorite conspiracy theory that I made up but *could* be true: here goes. Satoshi is a made up individual in order to front btc which was invented by those trying to establish a new world order in a way that people would unknowingly but voluntarily support by putting their wealth in btc. BTC is actually controlled by this group (wouldnt be hard for a global super rich shadow group to control the majority of hash power) and they are using their influence to set up BTC as a new global currency. Once it has become so, they dont need to reveal themselves, but now control the global economy. basically, bitcoin gives the "new world order" a convenient way to control the world which has never existed before. 
*edit - actually, could anyone give a reason why it wouldnt be very possible for a super rich group to take control of bitcoin by controlling hashpower? as it is, there is a huge cost barrier to mining, which is one of the major problems right now,  and someone with enough money could easily establish themselves as the most hashpower, and set up different mining locations across the world, and join different mining pools but at the same time all be a part of the larger "shadow pool"
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:09:08
It seems to me that any real innovation with BTC is going to inherently compromise some of its original core values to some degree. I dont think this is avoidable if we really want to build upon bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:02:13
I think its interesting that people will still, even today, when it suits them use smoking pot as come kind of indicator of someones questionable nature. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:41:48
Its definitely not encouraging more people to adopt it

I feel uncomfortable with what basically amounts to a bribe if you support X side of this debate
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:16:03
then dont buy bitcoin before just buy it after??
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:14:35
bitcoin *wasnt supposed to need a second layer*. thats why its objectively *failing* at its entire purpose. thats exactly what im saying
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:26:09
no, I pointed out your hypocrisy. Did I make a statement and then immediately contradict myself? no
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:36:58
everyone i start to tell about bitcoin goes "oh drugs. do you buy drugs are you a drug dealer". Its so stupid and no matter what i say the fact that yes its used on darknet seems to be all the "evidence" they need that .... i dont even know what. so what if drugs are bought with it? have you heard of cash before??
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:34:02

since when in the history of wealth has that happened. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:10:59
I couldnt have come up with a better way to scare of new bitcoin adopters than telling them to read this thread
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:29:34
Are we actively trying to make bitcoin a shitty investment at this point?
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:41:12
what are TBs? i thought u were making a joke like spreading TDs, like VD. transaction diseases aka viruses aka holy shit could bitcoin tx be used to spread viruses?? no I know but what IF???
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:06:52


this was.... not what i expected
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:15:17


you make a good case for why bitcoin fails as a currency right now. in general, its much more valuable to hold it than to use it, especially when it could cost you 50 cents to buy something for 5 dollars, unless you want to wait 12 hours. weve got a long way to go, and a long way down if these solutions dont materialize faster
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:37:57
Hey, thats a good point. I would counter however that addresses are equivalent to people, or atleast identities, on the btc blockchain. and I would suggest that its probably neither intended nor positive that its that concentrated on those addresses regardless of exchange or person. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:08:50


key phrase is *if the miners would simply signal their readiness* which translates to: Segwit is NOT ready to go right now.

@_date: 2017-03-08 15:08:59
what have we done to displease Satoshi???
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:08:57
in that case the wealth concentration is even more pronounced because its likely most large holders will have several addresses while small holders will probably have just the one wallet. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:02:52


exactly. a terrible way to have to use something you intend to spend. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:00:17
possibly ethereum. or maybe even litcoin? ltc never seems to move, and I can only imagine it would get a boost from bitcoin deserters
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:58:22
unless it works better than original bitcoin in which case bitcoin will become the worthless coin
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:10:44
why wouldnt you pay with something like USD when bitcoin is likely to increase in value soon after youve traded it for something that wont?
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:38:17
we change the PoW and then... what? people stop processing txs? we punish the regular honest people who were mining? and then what, everyone else sees this attempted takeover and they continue to invest in btc? no, everyone pulls out and goes to the next biggest crypto that has somehow solved this issue. either their takeover succeeds, or it fails and BTC dies because people totally lose confidence in it. OR, the node users realize btc would die and allow the takeover in order not to shake confidence in btc. either way, its possible and *feasible* if a group is rich enough, and plenty are.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:59:34
wow. TIL the majority of addresses hold more than 10 coins. the most common is 10-100. lets think about what this means. the VAST majority of bitcoiners are storing wealth, not casual users for daily transactions
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:17:13
where do you think the answers you find on google come from in the first place? they come from forums like this where those questions have been already answered. If he wants an explanation rather than a textbook definition this is the place to ask it, and if everyone gave a snarky "just google it answer", there would be no answers on google
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:06:41
its ironic because satoshi advocated for what bcc just did, except he suggested we do it years ago before this kind of shit happened

it seems like customer support is *always* great at first for a new, decent company. then after they gain a comfortable base and profitability, customer service gets outsourced because it doesn't matter to them anymore. 
tl;dr good customer service at the beginning stages of a service establishing itself doesnt really mean anything

@_date: 2017-08-12 16:55:27
Well, honestly there is if you are thinking in terms of gain potential. The potential of $5 btc is astronomically higher than buying at 3 or 5k.
$5 btc to now is 760x gains.
at a price of $3800 with those gains btc would be almost $3m a coin. 
just 10x gains would put btc over 38,000 a coin, which is probably not gonna happen, atleast in the next year.
If you look carefully and do your research there are several possibilities for coins that *will* see 10x+ gains over the next year. 
Btc may be a solid investment, but its not where the greatest returns will be right now.
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:06:00
this applies to the LN as well
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:06:10
*begins to sweat*
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:43:53
of course. alt coins will boom after the btc pullback following the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:50
fuck no. its inconvenient, costs a fee and unless I buy more immediately to cover the btc i just spent, which makes it even more inconvenient, im going to lose gains. bitcoin = great store of value for the coming age of global crypto economics. terrible currency
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:05:09
bitcoin is digital gold and it will probably remain that way. a different crypto better suited for it will be a means for payments while bitcoin remains the store of value. not its intended purpose but thats how its working out
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:45:14
is there a reason that raising dollars instead of bitcoin then dollars isnt ok?
@_date: 2017-04-25 12:52:00
youre not broke when you own the money printing machine
@_date: 2017-04-26 01:00:56
honestly, yeah right now
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:49:29
You realize that you dont actually need 51% for a 51% attack right? it just makes it easier the higher your percent. The likelihood is that at even 40% other people will come on board just to maintain stability in the system. When faced with a forked coin which loses value or joining the "attack" with a chance the coin retains its value, the miner is going to join the %40 which then quickly becomes a vast majority of hash power, at which point it makes even less sense for a miner not to implement it. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:49:09


which part? the part where he had to clear up false information or the one where he said wire transfers were being blocked and they were going to court?

@_date: 2017-04-07 01:28:51
belonging naturally; essential.
have you seriously looked at ethereum? 
@_date: 2017-04-11 22:56:13
this sub is all about keeping bitcoin decentralized (one of the main arguments against BU) yet when a major corporation endorses your side of the issue, its suddenly a great thing. incoming justifications 
@_date: 2017-04-14 22:41:48


satoshi literally recognized this years ago a proposed that the block size be increased before it got too hard to change bitcoin
@_date: 2017-04-14 22:40:45
a high market cap means there arent major problems currently facing bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:57:44
yeh and the price of bitcoin is near 0 at that point as well. Any major coordinated attack like that would absolutely ruin all confidence in bitcoin. no one will touch it with a 10 foot pole when there are alternatives. Im honestly shocked the price is this high when we jsut discovered 70% of the hashrate can be shutoff by someone with malicious intent
@_date: 2017-04-20 23:30:50
who exactly is going to release these new improved dollars at a lower price and how? 
@_date: 2017-04-28 12:49:29
which is why its such a red flag
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:46:56
when I see an acronym I dont know.... I *look it up* and *learn what it means*
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:54:59
wow, so the success of other cryptos is due to "BU's altcoin pump", not any intrinsic value combined with bitcoins uncertainty. got it. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:01:59
coinbase is pretty easy to setup with a weekly limit of $100. You have to provide some personal information (dont remember what) but its probably the safest and easiest way right now. However I dont recommend them. Theres just not a great alternative for small quick purchases
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:27:03
really? you think people that trade professionally are watching 20% daily swings and ignoring it?
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:48:45
if we are still using the same PoW method for bitcoin mining by then it will probably be listed as one of the  contributors to climate change
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:18:51
whats an "economically relevant node"? And how does the bitcoin protocol differentiate between them? It doesnt.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:16:19
actually eth would be a better platform for something like that
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:06:49
you have to be pretty smart to pull that off against an established candidate like hillary
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:49:49
so basically there is consensus because everyone who doesnt agree gets put out of the community 
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:19:22
actually a good point
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:31:41
honestly when the video opened I thought its was going to be of him doing a belly slide down the hill.
this is a great video though. to me it speaks of cryptocurrency in general
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:47:05
so if this attack is possible at all... thats not very secure is it?
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:36:40
and they have ZERO reason to rock the boat
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:45:27
isnt that basically the foundational vision of bitcoin though?
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:16:56
so Bitcoin, but only after its adopted some major upgrades. which in all likelihood will have been accomplished by other coins first. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:02:50
what about all that capital gains tax
@_date: 2017-05-16 02:34:52
there will be an attempt at mass adoption, and it its current state it utterly fails and people flock elsewhere. bitcoin scales now or its not going to get the chance
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:37:45
yep. interested in buying back in if an ACTUAL scaling solution is reached and implemented, but in the meantime there is 1000x more to be made from alts
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:46:33
i have a feeling its not undervalued
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:55:10
yehhh thats not supposed to happen for many more years
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:58:26
if the coin you are using as currency isnt a secure store of value you woudlnt be using it
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:01:04
you wouldnt call network resistance to attack security?
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:41:00
why is it a scam exactly?
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:46:09
they arent sabotaging anything. bitcoin network runs based on the monetary incentive of miners. this is purely a function of the bitcoin protocol, baked in bit deep
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:50:03
the phasing out of mining is literally programmed in to ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:52:38
not if you post an altcoins accomplishment in a way that makes it look like bitcoin did it or its somehow actually part of the grand design for bitcoin
I kind of want to start calling it EgoCoin
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:15:27
because in all honesty bitcoin would make a really shitty currency to use for daily transactions. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:37:14
make a litecoin shirt shoot out every once in a while
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:51:07
you *might* be able to buy them. depends on if you can get your tx through the exchange. trollbox on polo is FULL of people asking where their btc is, why they havent received it etc
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:14:27
thats literally not possible
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:47:46
should the thousands of people who cant use bitcoin right now also fuck off? you know, the users?
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:48:24


there is no "them" in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:38:06
so basically it defeats the purpose of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:35:35
is that what you call trying to navigate a ship between two icebergs?
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:38:34
when bitcoin was only worth a few dollars thats a huge drop. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:13:39
yes please. holy guacamole just cause the fork already and get it done. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:51:27
calling ether a scam coin is tantamount to saying "I dont understand it"
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:38:00
at that point, why would they need to have bitcoin at all?
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:30:17
like raising the block size?
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:35:02


that is absolutely not true and its the reason this is such a delicate situation. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:37:22


circumstance aside, what is it about the bitcoin protocol specifically that makes it superior
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:11:46
i thought the point of bitcoin was to move away from these kinds of centralized services

wait... so in a bank run, you try to withdraw money but you cant because they dont have any on hand. in this scenario, you cant withdraw money because youve been blocked. how exactly is this better for us

this is a terrible article. alphabay got shut down, he got arrested and killed himself. he didnt steal and it wasnt some kind of magic internet justice that killed him

so how does bitcoin operate after the miners have been reduced to rubble?

I thought one of the main features of bitcoin was that all nodes were equal. it shouldnt matter who a node belongs to nor should you be able to know without them telling you. Why does it matter who wons the node that signals?

you basically just said bitcoin is the best because it has all the best things without proving how any of it is true. 


those blistering tx speeds and low fees right

if bitcoin actually implements a scaling solution it will shoot past the moon unquestionably. until it looks like that will happen, Im keeping my eth, but if it looks likely, at that point I would be willing to put some money back into btc

got em
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:18:58
this guy was worried about the scaling debate FOUR YEARS AGO??? and still literally nothing has been accomplished except for some promises

comments seem to gloss over the fact that the wallet choice will not magically make the confirmation become reasonable. I guess he should have paid I higher fee to use his own money

im not sure why you put investors in quotes, thats exactly what people are are trading ripple are. the coin itself doesnt really have value, it just happens to be popular for trading right now

i thought everyone here was freaking out about centralization? now its being embraced?
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:36:19
im curious what do people here expect will happen when people really start adopting bitcoin? you cant just pretend this is a fake crisis. in its current state if bitcoin takes off with mainstream support the network would grind to a halt and all those people would quickly find another coin or forget about it all together

they say billion, then million, then say price is over 3000. quality piece right there
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:38:17
you dont *need* to explain that. one of the main reasons bitcoin exists is to be without centralized authority. now we *want* exchanges vetting users who are supposed to be anonymous and we *want* them inspecting every bitcoin, to only allow deposits from users *they* trust and with coins that *they* decide are good?
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:26:23
that lags far behind the gains made by most other major coins. just a perspective check
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:07:35
If you want your burger while its hot, then yeah
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:17:19
whats the fee and time for the bitcoin to hit your wallet for one of these ATMs?
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:45:38
except this time its about a 50/50 split and each side hates each other

i get anxiety just showing someone a picture on my phone while firmly holding it. my anxiety spikes when they inevitably reach for the phone so they can look closer at the photo

someone needs to open their eyes
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:20:53
I heard it from french citizens
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:28:45


I honestly do not understand this sentiment here. all other coins are shitcoin... is that willful ignorance?
