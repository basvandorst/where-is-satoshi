because i put a nick name in the first name and nothing for the last. 
they said first i needed to change the phone number, blocked me 
asked me for the email i had the account in, then had me jump through hoops, including downloading their app and now i have to change my account name to my full legal name, provide my DL number, and now they want a passport i gave them all of that except for passport (has ssn on it) and they continue running me in circles

what is the best alternative to "sell" various cryptos other than coinbase? 
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:06:56
Definitely not a their, just trying to cash out my $5 and the close the account after this shitty service, I want a wallet with my own pass phrase now, xapo is clearly trying to steal Bitcoin from their clients over artificial means.

like xapo? because they stole my bitcoin...

You never gave me access to my account, so there was never a request to withdraw. 
You closed my account without authorization and without giving me the value of my account holding. 
You committed securities fraud in the state of California
So enough games, and enough of your Chinese employees trying to steal my identity. 
You can give me the value of my account via PayPal in USD. 
Or I can take you to small claims court and be the first person of several thousand to actually sue you for the fraud you're pulling.

There will always be people like xapo and coinbase Being and intermediary....they see the Bitcoin want to look like banks then close accounts and walk away with the Bitcoin ditto for wallets, security is just a farce

Right. That $0.01 that coinbase gave you when you signed up was $10 at one point

just tip doge coin? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:15:57
No worries, but I don't trust xapo with 100 bits, what makes them think I trust them with my social security number? Or a freaking scan of my passport..... it's probably going to some Indian in a customer service center who is going to use it for tax fraud when they get home!

Bitcoin isn't the preferred choice of currency for Japanese dogs, which is why I'm getting out of it and going all in on doge

10+% gain depending on your incom level and if it drops you to a lower tax bracket.
