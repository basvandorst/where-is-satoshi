One of those works both ways.

I have a mycelium on my phone with some bitcoins on it. How can I transfer those coins to my coinbase wallet? Is this possible? 
I read the instructions on coinbase.com but I do not really understand it :(
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:31:16
Hi everyone!
So I finally got verified on coinbase through gdax, i.e. i went to Gdax and started the verification process and at some point I received a message that some of the info on my ID document was not readable, etc. but the verification on coinbase.com went through ( I received an email) and I even added my debit card in there without any issues. However if I go to gdax now it still takes me to the verification process and I cannot choose ID document as a verification instrument at all. I thought that once I get verified on coinbase.com I get auto verified on Gdax also. When I log in to Gdax I have Deposit/Withdraw buttons but that's it.
Any ideas what happened and how to continue further?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:09:26

@_date: 2017-12-14 17:37:17
Yes, the latter.
I just used to do it with my mobile phone and Mycellium but I have transferred my coins on paper. 
I have printed out the QR code, so I will give it a try tonight :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:57:22
Thank you for the reply!
Ok so I will set up a paper wallet, scan its QR code via my mobile device and transfer everything to the paper wallet's Bitcoin Address if I understand it correctly.

Main purpose of XRP is to reduce fees cost in that sense the coin itself will never be worth much because the main idea is to have cheap fees and to have XRP as the means to achieve that + centralized, controlled and the last time I checked the creator still holds 50% of the total #
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:40
Yep. I have just created an address in coinbase(I forgot that part lul) I scanned it with my device and everything checks out.

Silly question - If I have all my bitcoin on paperwallet how I can put it on exchange and sell for USD?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:36:12
I concur!
Just remember to HODL no matter what!
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:59:33
Keep in mind that transfer fees (from your customer's wallet to your company's wallet) at the moment are pretty high. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:29:19
Most likely because SegWit. I purchased through ATM a few times and when i track the transaction I see the sending wallet starts with '3'. Additionally the transfers happened almost instantly. Pretty neat...
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:47:46
Yes. I have prepared. I have all my bitcoins on paper right now. I made two copies - one for myself and one for my family. I have already gave the second copy to my family and explained them what to do if something happens to me.

Great story and I am sorry for your wife and kid. Best of luck to you, friend :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:59:45
Hi! 
I have transferred my BTC into a paper wallet recently made on bitaddress.org. 
I have just noticed that bitaddress offers also BIP38 Encryption with a paraphrase. I haven't used that option though when I created the paper wallet. I have my private keys ofc but if I want to transfer to an exchange the BTC in a later point of time would that be a problem (not having BIP38)?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:41:49
The  bcash guys over there are happy for one thing mainly when it comes to bcash vs bitcoin and this is transaction speed and fees. I wonder what will happen when bitcoin catches up. Would be fun to see their responses :))

Thanks for the reply!
Well I live in Europe and in here there are quite a few Bitcoin ATMs. Some of those even work both ways, i.e. you can both put/withdraw cash for BTC.
What about an online wallet? What is a good recommendation? 
Sorry for the silly questions!

Hey! I am new here and been reading about bitcoin and other altcoins in the past two weeks! I am totally interested in investing some small sum of money (250$) just for starters.
Regarding this decision I have a few questions :
1)Pretty close to where I live there is a Bitcoin ATM. I can use that to purchase BTC with real money basically straight away and the BTC will go directly to my wallet. Has anyone ever done that? Is it safe? What to expect?
2)If I go with 1) what wallet would you recommend? 
3)Can I transfer BTC from my online wallet to let's say Coinbase and then turn BTC into $?
Thank you all!

Noob question regarding Mycelium as this is the wallet I have chosen to use. 
The first time I installed it on my mobile phone I have created a backup using the 12 word key. After the backup has been created I purchased some BTC from an ATM that ended up immediately on my Mycelium wallet. However the backup was created before the purchase of BTC. If I am to use another device and use the 12 word passkey will I end up with the same balance of BTC ? Of course after a each transaction (5 in total) the correspnding # of private keys were created as the wallet supports HD as far as I remember.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:36:23
I have purchased some bitcoin through a bitcoin ATM ~1wk ago and have set up a mycelium wallet on my mobile device. If I purchase now bitcoin on coinbase, can I transfer that bitcoin to my wallet? And if yes, how? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:59:15
Congrats man!!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:42:41
I have Mycelium on my phone and I am using that as my main wallet. However I would like to switch to a paper wallet. When I go to bitaddress I see the option to Generate addresses, however, on my Mycelium I have 6 private keys which means 6 addresses right? So if I am to transfer BTC from those 6 addresses on my paper wallet would I need one or six address on it (on the paper wallet) or just one would suffice? Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:48:25
I transferred my coins to a paperwallet a few days back with the idea to HODL for a long time. However I would wish to buy some more BTC. For this purpose I have my paper wallet's public address QR code scanned on a piece of paper, if i go to an ATM and buy some coins, there would be no issues right? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:40:49
HODL ofc! Enjoy the ride, man

This has been debunked as a myth on national television by officials that this is bs. Additionally the source of the story is a shady "news" website and the "journalists" working for that website come up with bs all the time. So yeah, I think I know. Just ask yourself how you "confiscate"so many bitcoins? Like I would I would sit on a pile of paper wallets waiting to be seized? Please, be real here...

@_date: 2018-03-17 09:37:06
Every dump of coins, in theory, should lead to better distribution of wealth considering there are enough buyers. The idea is to have people buying the coins dumped by those "select few". I would like to see this happening but considering the interest in btc is low, idk.
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:19:34
Hey! Where can I buy bitcoin from with debit card without any verification? I was purchasing from coinbase but there are some issues with my card saying that merchant is not supporting the transaction. Also I purchased from blockchain.info and I have no limits there either.

Paper wallet would be your safest bet :)
