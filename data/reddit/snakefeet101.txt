If you buy on an exchange and keep your bitcoin there then sell it on that exchange it will be instant.
If you buy then send your coins to your wallet then when you want to sell you will have to send your coins to the exchange to sell, you will have to wait sending to and from wallets.
Transaction times depend on how much of a few you pay.
Use segwit wallets and exchanges that use segwit if possible to speed things up and make things cheaper.
Key word - SEGWIT

I tend to learn from history to help me in the future, history I have learned tends to repeat itself time and time again but here's to the time it doesn't whenever that may be.
My position of wealth is not what makes me get up in the mornings I have things in my life that are my fuel for happines that doesn't involve currency of any form.
True wealth for me is seperating myself from the systematic machanical cogs of life that someone else turns while still enjoying what life has to offer.
Although I must admit I do enjoy a few materialistic things.
Good luck on the routes you follow.

One thing I don't understand is that we know an increase in blocksize will help instantly even if tempory and I know it's not a long term solution but it may turn out to be that in waiting for a long term solution it may never come?
Ok Segwit increases the blocksize but it needs people to do something (people are lazy, coinbase)
I suppose that's the only issue with decentralisation (takes time to vote)
I also beleive this is the only reason bcash has gone as far as it has in the short term.
I do think there comes a time to act and I think that time isn't that far away??

If were talking predictions I personally would like to see the USD price of bitcoin stay around the $6000 - $8000 range for all of next year too then rising into 2020. 
The focus on the technology rather than price would be better for bitcoin and work that would get done by the amazing devs in the background would be great. 
Not the norm i know but I’m in it for the idea of bitcoin not fiat, would i cash out if McAfee’s prediction came true?....depending on where bitcoin is in society it would be a very tough personal decision for me that at this time i honestly don’t know the answer.

I took it as with the big rises that bitcoin has had and the the amount of new customers coinbase has added to they're services as a way to make new customers aware of only spending what you can afford to lose.
I beleive some new coinbase customers will want to quickly put down a lot of they're income into bitcoin due to FOMO, I think coinbase are being respectful and responsible with they're statement.
Afterall they could of said buy buy buy and cash in, I don't beleive much will happen with regards to futures, but I do think the volume will go up and cause more volatility untill it eventually settles out but who cares I'm still amazed were above $5000 and have now witnessed how quickly we could reach new heights.

Depends on why your buying bitcoin and your plans. 
For me Yes i see it as a good time and if it drops through certain levels ill buy more, just the same if it rises and breaks through levels ill buy more.

People were saying the same thing on the way up to $10k. 
Read up on bitcoin learn about what is what it can achieve what the future could be and then look at what is happening around bitcoin right now and what is on the horizon. 
Then decide if you support bitcoin now that you understand it more and do you want to have skin in the game. 
You dont understand how you can own a fraction of bitcoin??
You don’t have to buy a kg of gold you can buy any weight you like, you can buy and accumulate varying weights over time to reach a total of 1kg if you wanted to. 
Your biggest weapon in this game is and always will be education without educating yourself on bitcoin you will eventually end up with a bag of REKT shitcoins

Satoshi was female and stayed anonymous originally because of her belief that others would make judgements on her being female and possibly see her opinions in a lesser way or maybe try and take over her idea, moving on she  realised that being the creator aswell as anonymous was a huge positive for bitcoin and foresaw that this is the only way bitcoin would make it as she foresaw many things i believe Satoshi was/is one of the brightest people on earth. 
Because she fully believes in bitcoin and the future it can bring she destroyed the private key ensuring that they could not be moved and the coins will remain as a kind of digital statue of herself as Satoshi, people claiming to be her she ultimately knows will fail due to lack of the simple verification needed (Satoshi herself possibly cannot even prove who she is anymore) making bitcoin stronger with every failed attempt. 
Satoshi has created undeniable digital truth. 
Maybe She knows that Satoshi being proved using her bitcoin as undeniable truth would only be a weakness of bitcoin, i believe Satoshi is very strong minded and fully believe that all methods of proving the persona has been destroyed by Satoshi herself and i believe this is the biggest sacrifice Satoshi has made for bitcoin to succeed. 
Do i think Satoshi is on social media, Yes although i doubt she is apart of CT (crypto twitter or similar). 
Being Satoshi is either extremely simple to prove or impossible. 
Anything in between is nothing but a distraction and a lie.

You mentioned the 5 bitcoin is your life savings?
If my life savings were in bitcoin i would personally be very nervous keeping it all in one wallet. 
If it was me i would buy a trezor and store a majority percentage on that as well as keeping some on the wallet you already have. 
One other thing that does interest me is creating a completely safe offline wallet using one opendime, breaking the seal to reveal the private key in a completely offline environment writing down the key for safe keeping then loading the wallet with bitcoin a pure offline cold wallet.  
Then again keeping my entire life savings in bitcoin would cause me to be nervous no matter which route i choose, I tip my hat to you good sir.

From what I understand BCH is rising because it is now more profitable than BTC.
BTC is dipping because it rose high very quick.

If you don't bind it will rise past what is now and don't think it will hit popular target such as $5000 USD $10,000 USD then don't enter if you do think it will reach them targets and beyond then you're certainly not too late. Buy and accumalte

It must be a hell of a lot of money. It's not very good when only a few rich investers can have a such a big impact on people's profits on any chain. It shows how fragile this whole thing is. 
Could they possibly cause such panic that people start to change and buy BCH.
if they are doing this then the current BCH price increase is a reflection of these ppl not "the public" shall we say buying.
And what BTC is left with will be a reflection of the users minus the BCH group, is this correct.

@_date: 2017-08-17 09:10:21
Buy your bitcoin from where you feel comfortable buying from (I use coinbase) and place it in a paper wallet or a hardware wallet like Trezor to HODL 
put it in a safe and place in the attic and set a reminder on your phone and anywhere else calendars etc.
Maybe when you check on it in years to come you might have a big smile.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:47:19

@_date: 2017-08-18 21:43:44
I hope you are right as I have no BCH. It is worrying that a group can have this much affect, it shows how fragile everything is.
The current price increase of BCH is a reflection of the group and not the every day users traders etc and BTC will be a reflections of all users and traders minus the BCH group is that correct?. 
I imagine this will cause a lot of panic. Would advise just to hold on through it all.

My prediction and thats all it is, is that it will go below $5k maybe 4.5k who knows?? 
This is just me thinking that not enough people are panicking thinking this is it... this is where bitcoin dies...
My reasoning for this is like everyone else’s I have no clue what will happen or when, maybe we stay bear for years to come maybe we won’t but one things for sure!!!

My investment strategy is simple, when the news and public figure heads say negative thing about bitcoin I wait a couple days then buy.
Wait 2 weeks and buy a bit more 
Then maybe 2 weeks later depending on original news stories I'll buy more. 
Then I watch all the positive news come out and wait and repeat.

Only I am not bear I am merely an observer that believes over time bitcoin is only going up. 
I don’t really care for what the price is today and when I buy I don’t really care if it’s at the top of a green candle or on the bottom of a red candle I’m not a trader and put in a certain amount every month. 
As for buy and sell signals (I don’t sell, or at least haven’t yet) I’d tend to go with when things are positive I’d sell and when things are negative I’ll buy, anything in between I’ll enjoy the ride. 
Would sell now, he’ll naw
Would I buy now, he’ll yea
At 20k I would have the same response as I will in 2020 at whatever the price is.

If you don’t own the private keys you don’t own the bitcoin FACT therefore for me there is 0 safety only trust. 
Move them to a hardware wallet or at least somewhere where you have the private keys (Samourai for Android) and keep them keys somewhere safe.

Rich Investers dumping a lot of money into it using recent events as fuel causes price to rise with many people buying with "moon" in mind thinking they won't see say $2600 again, once it reaches a certain amount the Rich Investers sell. 
It's a market that can be controlled (manipulated) a lot by people with a hell of a lot of money (millions) if you had that amount of money why not? The profits are huge.
Manipulation happens because where there's money to be made people will manipulate.
Of course this is all my opinion and I don't trade I only accumulate and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:29:45
We will be saying I wish it would go back down to 3k at some point.

You should always own your coins anyway but if your absolutely sure BCC will fail and you don't want what your entitled to then sure keep em in Coinbase.
I myself dont want to take the chance and also don't want  coinbase keeping my coins so I have have moved everything to my Trezor.
Each to their own
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:01:40
Ok so you and a group of freinds have multi millions to invest money no object you plan to put a ton of money into bitcoin timing it near a historic event in bitcoin (bip91) the candle stick goes sky high people are saying moon this moon that you buy again the candle sticks go higher the craze begins people buy making it rise further you and you freinds sell and cash in the profits and the weak hands sell too. Eventually you get to buy back cheaper. 
I can't say that it happens but in my opinion it does I doubt I'm the only one that can see that big whales can manipulate the market.
Look at when the investors sold and the market cap dropped, now it seems they've put their money back in, will they take it out again!
I'm not sure what your trying to get out of this, I buy on the dips and HODL for hopefully future profits.
You cannot deny the fact that a group of very wealthy people can manipulate the market to gain profits. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:13:27
I don't think so. If pending fails for whatever reason I believe you be refunded the BTC into your BTC wallet.
Hopefully someone can clarify this.

I'm only new here but I'm also paranoid. So the furthest I've gone is I've encrypted my private keys with a password protected PGP key and then I created a QR code with it and compressed the image to zip file with a password and then installed on 2 encrypted usb sticks.
I also plan tomorrow to create a couole credit card size (buiseness card) with the QR code on it that I'll probably end up lamanating. 
Like I said i am paranoid haha.
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:20:41

Both are manipulated in some cases 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:39:20
If you don't control your keys then the coins aren't yours.

Mycelium lets you sweep the paper the wallet (all the coins thats there) this is exactly how I did it too.
I also used the same website to create the paper wallet.
Once you've sweeped paper wallet it destroy it.
If you want to hold long term use a paper wallet or a hardware wallet, I now use Trezor.
Hope this helps

@_date: 2017-07-21 11:21:29
Your not leaving your love you just want to have a fling with fiat.
If you sell you take the chance of loosing if you believe it will rise in the timeframe you want it too and HODL and it does rise then you've won. If it doesn't rise you can continue to HODL till it does.
You can only lose if you sell in my eyes unless your a seasoned trader in this volatile world of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:39:00

I do think he ultimately made mistakes that led to his arrest.

Or for you mobile phone try Mycelium 
If you want to go one better for after august 1st get a hardware wallet called Trezor.
times vary but yesterday if you send BTC tomorrow it will be in your wallet shortly afterwards.
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:07:03
Am I right in thinking that the bip91 has serious bugs that they're working on now to correct. 
If this is released and not finnished wouldn't this be reflected in bitcoins value?
I'm hoping everything does go smooth and that the numbers mentioned here happen.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:12:51
It will definitely go up.
It could definitely go down come to think of it
It could also definitely stay roughly the same the too.
That's my opinion anyway.

@_date: 2017-07-29 10:32:14
When the split happens there's still the same amount of BTC so price will be the same regardless of the value of BCC, when ppl start trading BTC for BCC and vice versa that's when the price will go up or down for both coins.
I personally think with people cashing in altcoins for BTC to get the extra BCC to exchange back to altcoins we could see a BTC drop also BCC but also a lot of people I think will exchange BCC to BTC (I'll be one of them) which will cause an increase in price and that's not including any new Investers.
It'll be interesting to see what happens and how it all unfolds.

@_date: 2017-07-21 13:52:25
I spend a lot of time talking to friends about the same situation as above and it always is the same response at first "I can't afford 1 BTC" when I tell them you don't have to purchase 1 whole BTC and show them the process they get it. I've not had too many people that dont understand that 1BTC is broken down into smaller parts just like a £1 coin.
The second most popular they say is "it's too risky" which I do get but when they start small and the market jumps like yesterday they tend to get hooked and start really learning about it themselves. 
I'm no teacher and no preacher I'm a simple hodler that believes bitcoin will go far however if someone doesn't get what I'm trying to explain no matter how much I try and then they're not willing to look it up themselves on here Google YouTube or anywhere else I'm at a loss of what more I can do for them I've even shown people me purchasing small amounts (£20) but some just don't get it therefore in my eyes bitcoin isn't for them or they're not for bitcoin, Not yet anyway.
I know when it gets to the point where major companies shops retailers start accepting bitcoin and it starts to enter the world they live in they will end up wanting to know what this bitcoin is all about (maybe)

I prefer to buy on the dips and accumalte over time. Im lucky in that I don't need money right now and content in life. This is something for the future to me something to be apart of and something I believe in.
Wether it will come to fruition or not who knows.
I wish you the best of luck with your methods

They are free unless you want a hardware wallet.
Take a look at Electrum or Trezor for a hardware wallet

Why not try your luck at trying to turn it into more? 
That's if your ok with losing it.
If you can buy more then why not, in another years time I'm sure it'll look even better?

Probably the previous whales are now cashing in and waiting for this hard fork to be over with before they decide to invest again???

I use coinbase too. I entered my card details and got verified by sending my driving licence details.
I'm also from UK and buy BTC with GBP and coinbase also lets you sell too, the money goes into your gbl wallet.
If you want to move BTC from coinbase to say Electrum Trezor etc etc just go into BTC wallet on coinbase (mobile app) and press the plus icon (bottom left) and enter your wallet address that you want the coins to go to.
Or easier if you have a QR code go to BTC wallet in Coinbase and press the QR icon (top right).
Job Done

I'm glad you didn't put your money into it.
As far as I can see it's easy to buy - store and sell and it's as secure as you make it.
I'm new to bitcoin and want to put money into it that I am willing to basically gamble.
I wanted to have the most secure wallet so I went with Trezor.
If your willing to put 10k into it your gonna study everything and learn what's what.
If you don't believe in Bitcoins future just don't put your money into it no real need to make the effort to come here and slag something off you don't know about and haven't even placed anything into it let alone lost anything.
See you in 5 or 10years see who's gamble was worth it maybe you maybe not???

Probably bigger as it moves quicker but the rewards can be delicious
