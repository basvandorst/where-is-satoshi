Just want to mention that anything you get with bitcoin at O.co, you can only return for store credit. So make sure you really want it or find something as a backup if the initial purchase doesn't work out.

Where does it say that bitcoin was supposed to be next to free and be *the* micropayment solution? I thought the more important goals were around decentralization of power and getting out from a governmentally controlled debt-based system.

just wait. see: india quite recently.

They've had this on their screen for months, but weren't accepting until recently? When I saw it on the screen in mid-January I asked if they accepted BTC, but the barista said "not yet." 
Wondering if anyone has *actually paid* with BTC and been successful yet.

I also thought about this before I understood how the blockchain worked, but when you understand that it's the computing power of the network that validates the transactions and maintains the blockchain "ledger," you don't have many cycles left for much grid computing. Better to build a supercomputer and sell time in a traditional way as a service. Smarter people correct me if I'm wrong...
That said, with enough nodes even a small bit of power could scale into a bunch, depending on the distribution software.

Buy and hold.
BUY AND HOLD.

The thing is when enough people use it and they are paying attention to the same chart, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Or just get her something nice that she wants and at some point make sure to mention it was all made possible with bitcoin profits. Worked for me, now even she watches the price...

You mean Coinlab.

While this really does suck for them and their business, it's what happens when you have to interface with the traditional banking system. We are all too accustomed to immediate gratification, but think back to the last time your *bank* did something faster than you thought they would? The wait and delays are to prevent fraud and loss of capital, there's a bunch of ppl out there trying to initiate transfers and then pull the plug at the last minute hoping to steal btc. 
That said, there isn't enough transparency as to their limits and the exact times they reset, so there was probably a much better way to spin/prevent this from their end. Tough to run PR when you're putting out fires. Shoulda woulda coulda done an invite only slow rollout ala Mailbox. 
They could probably add a cash-deposit service but their sauce/reason for being is connecting your *bank* account and also need to hire a bunch. Coinbase is not for traders, it's for buy and holders who like the convenience of checking or savings to coinbase connections.

You mean the same guys who basically steal interest rates from people saving and go make trades like the London whale? Or that leak fed notes to bankers and lobbyists? I could go on...what is truly legitimate anymore? Bitcoin is legit in my book already.

$5/hr? No one should put up with the vitriol they've probably received via email for that paltry amount. Lets atleast get beyond legal minimum wage.

probably not an intentional scam, but they are not "on schedule" by about 8 months. saying "we'll ship in a couple weeks" since October is pretty disingenuous.

I recommend everyone interested in Bitcoin read Currency Wars by James Rickards. It will open your eyes to a bunch of stuff that isn't old but seems new because of the media spin (Financial Crises, currency debauchery, the Gold Standard and its similarity to limited supply of BTC). 
What global monetary policy needs is a brake on unlimited supply. Gold used to do that when currencies were pinned to it, but there are misguided excuses used to blame gold for the great depression, etc.

Came here to say the same thing. Also, have you seen the tragedy that is their UI? Do they *ever* stop advertising?

I mine with this card -f0 and the 5870 in my Mac Pro at -f90, total 1.5GH/s. 8 days -&gt; 1.1btc. I'm not really concerned with paying for it since I can sell it when the asics hit. My bet is that 1btc will be worth a lot more in 2 years and it doesn't matter right now.

Coinbase is not an exchange like mtgox. It's a slow way to buy and sell btc with your connected bank account(s).
