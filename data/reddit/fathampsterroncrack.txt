Is English your second language? I would highly recommend using some sort of writing service for your website. My foreign father does this for work. It would help polish your site. The ideas are there, but it is difficult to concentrate on the substance if it is not readable.

Man oh man. You are striking out all over the place. I don't litigate. I guess I don't expect much from a guy who needs to make money from free referral stocks.

This is pathetic how you're using an alternate on your own posts.

I am having a difficult time taking this article seriously with the grammatical errors throughout.

Haha survival of the fittest? I don't need to beg for free stocks all day, so I win that fight.

Haha this is obviously an alternate account. 2 months old and terrible grammar. Quit spamming this subreddit.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:01:52
Haha like everyone else just did?

Haha I definitely don't need a lecture on working hard. I'm an attorney. There's a difference between working hard and spamming referrals all day. But if calling it "helping others" helps you rationalize it, then cool. And get over yourself with telling people not to shadow post.

Wow. You've been spamming referral links all day. Talk about not worthy.

Totally speculative, but I think they did that as a publicity move since a lot of the NVIDIA bears say that NVIDIA is relying too heavily on crypto.
