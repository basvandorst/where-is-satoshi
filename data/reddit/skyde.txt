Correct but they would need to first buy bitcoin with USDT before transferring to GDAX.
If USDT imploded 1 USDT would not be worth 1 USD anymore so buying bitcoin with USDT would be hard.

anyone know where I can find a tutorial on how to setup mainnet node on my Mac?
I am a senior software engineer and can follow technical step (git checkout , compiling ..) but haven't found a tutorial explaining how to do the setup from scratch.

When you sell bitcoin on Coinbase or GDAX you get real money not tether. 
see: 
Coinbase stores all customer fiat currency (government-issued currency) in, custodial bank accounts, or in U.S. Treasuries.

Stay away from bitfinex.
Bitfinex counterfeit money by printing Tether USD.
- Nobody  can withdraw USD from Bitfinex.
- Nobody can withdraw USD from Tether.
- There was no audit showing Tether was backed by USD.

Anyone know why hitbtc and bitstamp are not available in Washington and New York States? Is it possible some state are trying to make bitcoin illegal?

in GDAX did you use "Bank Account" or "Bank wire" option ?
