I like the blurb it sounds like a crazy adventure no need to tone it down for the boring smothered souls in your community

The US dollar will hyperinflate, not if. We can’t take debt out forever. And the minute China becomes the reserve currency, it’s over.

This happened to me in 2017! Everybody acting like it’s your fault I hate these high and mighty responses. When I got an SAR I had done literally nothing but buy tea off the internet. Coinbase is an asshole company and I’m pretty sure they purposefully make it impossible to get your coins out bc I tried for months. I’m so so sorry for your loss OP

I got banned from Coinbase for purchasing jasmine tea. It’s not OPs fault, it’s Coinbases fault. They have a history of non existent customer support and confiscating coins

This is just not true. This has happened to me and many other for buying completely legal things rom legitimate websites. The first time I ever spent my coinbase coins on some tea they launched an SAR. Don’t act like it’s OPs fault when Coinbase has history of being assholes and effectively confiscating wallets

I hope you profit! But even if we don’t go up in value, fiat is gonna keep going down slowly

I disagree with your disagreement
