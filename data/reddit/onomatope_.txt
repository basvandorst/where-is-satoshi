You're comparing apples to bananas here. Call me when bitcoin's market cap exceeds a major fiat currency

Very poor macro-economic analysis. Controlled inflation is actually needed in order to grow as an economy.
Deflation, is actually a nightmare (ask the Japanese). You may think that it gives you more buying power (short term view) but it actually kills your buying power outside in foreign countries.
That's why you are happy when you can buy cheap stuff in asian countries for example...
Google deflation

You're correct :)

Am I the only one shocked by this ? On two points :
1) Privacy : of course we are all aware that bankers have acces to all transactions' history. But nobody wants to feel spied (more than correct word here) on that level (being contacted regarding one my transaction, even for "security mesure")
2) Freedom : unless it is strictly forbidden by your law's country (UK if i'm correct) to buy Bitcoin, this is a serious attack on your Freedom to do whatever the fuck you want with your money (within the law frame ofc).
For me this call seems as dillusional as if they were asking "What did you withdrew 500£ on monday ? We do not tolerate money laundering or drug purchase."
If it were me I would have switched bank instantly. And the fact that you have been in this bank for 15 years makes the situation even worse.
In an era where everything is customer-centric and where a client is as loyal to a company as Tiger Woods in a strip club, this is clearly a very poor customer relationship management on all levels.
The other day I had an hour conversation about cryptocurrencies (bitcoin mostly) with my banker. She didn't approve the whole digital coin thing but she clearly understood that it was something way more bigger than her and finished by aknowledging why people could find something conforting to have a decentralized currency. But most of all, she would never undermine my decision to invest where the fuck I want.
