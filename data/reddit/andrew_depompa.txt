Is it really that odd, that Airbnb does not want to associate itself with a currency that has been used to money launder, avoid taxes, and facilitate internet drug trade? There's a news article every month about a hacker stealing millions of BTC from some sucker's insecure Windows machine.
Airbnb is a company whose primary challenges are convincing a stranger on the internet to trust another stranger on the internet to sleep in their home, and convincing municipal governments that this is a good thing for everyone involved. Is it really so surprising that they don't want to be associated with us?

I come from a data analytics background :) I agree, any kind of analytics is valuable, but there's only so much you can do with the data you have.
This is the first I've heard of Zerocoin, and from the sound of it it sounds identical to a laundry, except it would be integrated into the BTC protocol and is free to use for anyone and wouldn't require trust of the laundering party. Sounds cool!

Haha, you know what I mean... Do it in a public meeting place, not in a dark alley. It's pretty easy for the cops to get involved when you are obviously under the duress of threatened violence. It's a lot harder to get away with something when they see your face.
If I were going to steal a million dollars, I would do it anonymously and over the internet.

It's also just as possible that you will find no blocks and earn no money. You're rolling three different hundred-million-sided dice and hoping they come up the same number. If they are, you win $3000. If not, well... good thing you can do it a couple hundred million times a second.

Don't be too suspicious, he's just trying to keep you from doing stupid things.
If you're old enough to remember trading before the internet, you had to have a stock broker to do any trades, and they'd charge $25-$50 per trade. They would also keep you from doing stupid things, like remind you that "MSFT" is Microsoft, and not "MS" (which is Morgan Stanley). They'd tell you to put in limit orders, not market orders. Things like that. Then inevitably you would invest in a stock that lost money, and human psychology makes you want to blame the broker, because you really don't want to blame yourself for anything (part of being a good trader is getting over your ego).
The guy is essentially functioning as a stock broker. He's making sure you put in the right account number in the right box, and making sure you really want to do this. The people he sees every day are stupid. They save their money in 1% savings accounts. They float debt from month to month on their credit card. They take out mortgages. He's just trying to help out.
**Don't take it personally** when he assumes you're dumb. He's trained to think everyone is dumb. He's trained to help you keep your money safe in the only way he knows how, which is in their bank's vaults.

Brilliant! I love how simple the design is. No electronics. Not even a metal minted coin (although i love casacious coins too, they're more of a collector's item).
While I can empathize with the obsession over having some way to ensure the printer doesn't still have access to the private key under the hologram, there really isn't any way. At some point, people are going to have to trust the manufacturer, and that brings us back to the same problem of centralized banking... however at least with this, the central bank does not have a monopoly on the manufacture of the currency.

Yeah, citizens and employers could register their account public keys with the government, so that they might enjoy the privilege of paying taxes, but as far as I can tell nobody has bothered.
Seeing how fast currency moves could possibly be interesting, but I doubt it's that valuable. There's no way to know if it's someone moving money from one hand to another, or if he's giving it to someone else. And when that fails, there are "[Mixing Services]( to further remove taint.

Bitcoin more than likely began outside of the US as well. The very first block that Satoshi Nakamoto mined contains a reference to news story about a United Kingdom bailout.
Bernanke is correct when he says the US probably doesn't have the authority to regulate Bitcoin. The US has the authority to regulate BTC/USD exchanges, of course.

@_date: 2013-08-22 20:14:33
And probably none of them were simple enough so that he (and most people) could understand. My explanation for it goes like this:
Bitcoin is actually a bank network, except instead of trusting your bank's word that they'll keep your money safe (e.g. Bank of Cyprus), and it's secured by using very strong cryptography. Where is the bank? It's a network of computers that anyone can join into. People in the network also "earn" a share of newly minted Bitcoin by using their computing power to verify transactions -- although it's not very much. Think of it as verifying and posting paper cheques, but those can take a few days to go through and sometimes bounce. These go through in about 10 minutes.
It takes the human element out of money. Instead of trusting that the Fed won't print too much money, it makes the money supply constant.

* A: Money laundering is illegal.
* B: Bitcoin can be used to facilitate laundering (just as hard cash can)
* C: The Bitcoin community's goal is to create a currency free of a central bank with the authority print more of it, and without the ability to arbitrarily seize it.
* D: The Bitcoin community does aim to facilitate illegal activities, nor does it want to give the public the impression that it condones it.
Public opinion is everything for the value of any currency. Increasing the legitimacy of Bitcoin increases its value among the public.

Exactly. Currency has no inherent value. Currency 2.0 is an apt name.
I like to think of it as Banking 2.0. Your privkey is your password to your account, you are allowed an unlimited number of accounts, and all transactions are free and permanent. 
When you compare Bitcoin to Gold, you quickly get responses like "but I can hold gold in my hand, it is tangible". I like to compare the Bitcoin network to a financial institution regulated by mathematics.

Except not really. You know money moves from one account to another, but you don't know who the owner of the source or destination accounts are (it could easily be the same person).
Think of it this way: You've got a bank vault filled with an infinite number of safe deposit boxes, and there's a hole in each box for people to put money in. Money can only be taken out of the box by having the key, and the only way to catch the guy with the key is to be there when he moves it to another box that may or may not also be his.
Another way to think about it: Yes, the ledger is completely public, but the "from" and the "to" lines don't exist. All you know is the amount of money being spent, but you don't know for what, by whom, to whom.
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:48:25
What causes the block difficulty to change? Is it a central authority, or a consensus made in the network of clients?
@_date: 2013-08-28 19:22:08
On Bitcoin transactions, you can add a "transaction fee" onto it, and whoever processes your transaction first gets that fee. Someone created a transaction manually and accidentally allocated 40% of a $65,000 transaction as the fee. Usually this is something like 0.1%.
This is probably because
* A: they were using a paperwallet (for added security), and manually creating a transaction
* B: they were testing their own Bitcoin software, and used real money instead of fake money. There's an alternate Bitcoin network for play money that has no value (and is much easier to mine).

This is a mistake, and your friends are right, but for the wrong reasons. You only need a good credit score to get a loan, which only really matters if you one day want a mortgage.
If you have the discipline to manage your money with a debit card and not get an overdraft, you should graduate yourself to a credit card. Most credit cards will give you 1% cash-back (in the form of points or airline miles).
Personally, I buy most of the things I buy on Amazon, so I have an [Amazon Visa]( which gives 3% back on purchases there. That's literally like 3% back on life.
**THE MOST IMPORTANT THING** is you don't want to float your debt for longer than 30 days. That's when the interest hits, and that's how you lose money. The mistake people make with credit cards is not getting one; it's that they let that debt snowball. The real winners are the ones who take advantage of the system.

In the history if the free market, cornering the market hasn't worked for many people. Are you suggesting that this time it will be different? Or that a momentary bubble will permanently annihilate all confidence in the market? There's no luck involved here, we can all see when someone is trying to manipulate the price, and we can all profit off of it.
If anything, using a billion dollars to buy, and then sell 10 million bitcoin is going to wind up generating a few million dollars in fees for the exchange, and nothing else.

I'd say the biggest barrier right now is consumer and business adoption of the currency as an every-day thing. Point of sale is clunky. It's not as simple as swiping a magnetic credit card. Something easier to use would be great, preferably something that doesn't require a cellphone.
What I *don't* want to see happen, is Amazon suddenly say they will soon* accept bitcoin, and me not have any. The day that happens is the day you'll see the USD/BTC exchange rate jump to $10,000.

I would actually say, for everyday transactions, most people use credit cards; and that's not even real money.
My thoughts are (and this is a big departure from the mainstream ideas that get passed around on this subreddit) that banks could easily switch over to BTC as their unit of measurement, and nothing would change. For physical "cash transfers", we could easily have the US government mint physical BTC coins, similar to Casascius coins. This effectively brings the role of government and money back to the Roman empire; gold coins were minted stamped to signify that the state "certifies" that this coin is the weight that's printed on it; they are no longer promissory notes.
