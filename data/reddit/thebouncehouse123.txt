That's the symbol for bitcoin though... although it takes past transaction history it's NOT bitcoin... they need to get a new symbol... because that's bullshit.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:21:30
If it's a different coin then why are they allowed to steal the currency symbol and name? Call it something else and say it's compatible with bitcoin... Seems like they're trying to scam people...
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:22:41
Is that BiTCoin or BiTcoin Cash?!?!?!? HALP!!!
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:45:54
unless you're selling bitcoin... which would require advertising...

I think murder charges are absolute horseshit man... doesn't change anything.

it doesn't??? because I've been thinking about getting one and need to know.

Yeah, enjoy getting prosecuted for a computer crime with truecrypt encrypted drives and using the "I forgot my password" line, you mook. You will have your finger nails pulled out or be left in prison until you remember it.

Hold your phone sideways genius...

You're one dumb mook for a guy with $200,000. I bet you remortgaged your home to get that...

I think you misspelled asset forfeiture abuse.

Also it's a new bitcoin trick, like the  19.99 vs 20.00 price tag, this makes it look cheaper!

Why would the hacker give a shit? Sure people could "find out" that it's all a scam and they don't get their files back, but people getting these viruses are outdated or just ignorant and I doubt they watch anything about technology in the news. Suddenly Grandma Philis is looking in the phonebook for a bitcoin broker, or Alchy Tim at the office who just fucked his whole network over is too busy getting drunk to give a shit about the damage he caused. Decrypting the files offers very little benefit to the ransomware guys.

It's hilarious how bad YOU are... but the advantage we have is being a particle in a pile of feces nobody wants to dig through to find a couple dollars of silver in your filesystem. The reason businesses are getting hit is because of their employees. Every system has a weakness, and tons of them were just leaked. (Even yours!!! OoOOoooOOoooooo)
Really though, here's a problem you can solve for homework: 100% eviscerate every cheater from a single game, past present and future, with a program that can be updated as many times as you want. The only catch is you HAVE to let people play the game. 
Should I even comment how "bad" you are at solving this problem?
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:34:30
Yeah, that's how viruses work. A terminal completely cut off from human interaction is the only one infected, no virus ever lies dormant to fool people, and viruses can't live after a new system wipe... okie.

The victims were never  going to get their data back...

The NSA have a bunch of people working at the NSA, and they infiltrate groups. The NSA moles realize nobody there can outprogram them, so they volunteer for the job. They program amazing ransomware and distribute it. Later some of the moles leak a ton of files by accessing them with a known enemy agent around, their worst adversary, themselves! And then they distribute it and use it to make even BETTER stuff, even though all of those leaks were made by them in the first place.

This is the dumbest advice I have  ever heard. Never THREATEN legal advice, you DO it... seriously, do not ever  take this person's legal advice because they have no idea what they're talking about.
