Yeah - unlucky side glue, let’s go with that....
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:05:52
Not a great answer. Most of it is factually incorrect. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:34:20
Get an accountant or enjoy the IRS riding your shit
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:15:29
Not surprising given the huge decline in transaction volume.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:17:42
You aren’t winning either. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:18:58
Sounds like your out of luck mate - now go get a job. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:52:47
Whatever you say
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:00:38
Still in development. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:39:47
Do yourself a favor and don’t get tax advice from Reddit but ask an accountant. You do it wrong and the amount you pay in penalties and tax interest could be sizable. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:19:06
I can’t say for certain without seeing how their systems are architected. I work on large scale web apps (hospital enterprise software) and scalability is always an issue especially when there is such a huge surge in activity that the system was never designed to handle. Could lead to errors, timeouts or transactions just not processing though from an end user perspective things seemed to go through. I can’t imagine how swamped their support teams are trying to investigate all these complaints 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:51:21
I asked my 7 year old son and 89 year old grandmother. They both do not. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:34:06
Welcome to the Matrix - should of taken the blue pill. 
Hope you get your monies back soon
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:26:02
Because crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:51:06
Well the reality is unless they get the lightning network figured out - the currency is unusable with these wait times and it would only get much much worse with widespread adoption 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:28:07
Safer bet maybe?  I’m curious as well. Just started reading about futures 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:27:57
I have been waiting for 4 days. If it doesn’t come back down to 14k (my price) then I am fine watching from the sidelines.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:48:31
I looked and couldn’t find many vendors at all that accept Litecoin...
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:43:25
Porn basically pioneered the online shopping cart back in the 90s. They are probably up to the task again 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:52:31
Correct, you won’t get Rich - not even close. Only those with large amounts to invest have hopes of getting rich unless bitcoin does go to 100k like some people think it will. Still even then, a $1000 investment only nets you like 6500. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:06:12
And a large upfront cost to open channels between individuals and vendors 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:49:09
You mean the speculation is booming. If I was a retailer I wouldn’t accept this right now given the volatility 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:33:38
It is going to take 30 days for settlement though and then another 40 days for bitcoin to actually make it through the network 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:06:15
Fees shorty - fees
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:07:25
Yeah you are right. Bitcoin is just like a natural disaster. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:10:51
Regardless of whose fault it is - these kinds of stories are more and more commonplace and will reflect poorly on bitcoin itself
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:27:06
Prob sometime next week, before the massive new year profit taking 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:35:06
I feel you but these are considerations that should have been made before borrowing money. Being in debt to someone for so much is a HUGE issue. Theoretically though you invested in a degree that society values and you can get a good job. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:27:13
I think his point though is people aren’t buying bitcoin to use it - they are only using it as an investment vehicle. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:22:51
Take laptop off of internet when not accessing wallet. Can’t get hacked if not online

@_date: 2017-12-11 04:52:48
It didn’t happen. The last thing I would be doing if I got that payday would be sitting in front of my PC on reddit bragging to strangers 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:36:25
It is legal. You did not read before you made the purchase 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:30:12
They are all on exchanges trying to sell before it hits 14k
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:50:33
Welcome to bitcoin. Where the fees are high and processing speed is non existent :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:15:45
I’ll just keep using credit cards where the sellers assume the fees. Unless of course vendors offer a bitcoin price for something vs a cash price. Then I think you can rationalize it
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:16:31
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:43:54
Wow, super!  Thanks for sharing!  Don’t forget to let Uncle Sam know!
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:46:53
Or these rich people who are in cash out
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:07:30
They used Tor I believe to hide their IP basically so you don’t know where the transfer is initiated from 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:50:38
I understand, but people aren’t going to stand by and wait if other companies come up with competing coins that are easy to use and end up getting adopted by merchants. It’s bitcoins game to lose, let’s put it that way. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:06:16
Sidebar?  I’m on mobile as I assume most are. Where is this sidebar you speak of?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:38:55
Would you sing “I’m a little tea pot”?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:24
Considering most crypto investors don’t frequent Reddit - I doubt this will have a huge impact. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:31:07
There won’t be bitcoin 100 years from now. Technology advances so rapidly that we can’t even invision what it would look like 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:17:04
That sounds good in theory but that hugely increases the size of the blockchain as a hole and the requirements for people to participate. Could lead to potential problems 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:25:25
Do the other places insures your funds (both your btc as well as any USD you have on there)?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:38:51
Perhaps consider purchasing disability insurance?  You are much more likely to be injured rather than killed. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:32:07
Mo money, mo problems
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:30:56
Wait for some negative event to occur that impacts speculation on bitcoin and there will be a substantial  dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:47:02
Maybe an exchange’s address...
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:39
Bring on the regulation! ;)
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:07:57
Just pay the taxes you own (declare as capital
Gains). The penalty + interest on undeclared gains will bite you in the ass when the IRS gets around to auditing your shit
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:49:36
When you deal with something that is completely unregulated, the fraudsters abound 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:47
People selling 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:26:12
Using bitcoin as a savings vehicle in lieu of actual savings is a terrible idea. What happens if you hit some unexpected hard times (get injured, lose your job, etc..) and that happens the same time but coin takes a nose dive?
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:24:51
If there is a huge run of volume like this, many people will not be able to buy/sell and transactions simple won’t go through at all
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:43:01
I know in the past lot of people used btc.com
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:27:17
They wouldn’t effectively be able to block it but just announcing the policy against bitcoin would deter the majority of citizens from going anywhere near Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:25:41
No. You still have wear and tear on the pc components and that isn’t negligible. Mining is very demanding on the hardware. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:52:28
Hackers. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:33:42
Could say the same for every coin out there. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:33:38
tickling that 17k mark - hoping it hits it and then corrects down to 14k so I can get in on this 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:50:18
easily achieveable?  No.  Minimal Risk - definitely no.  Nobody can say for certain the price will go up 30% in the new few weeks, otherwise everyone would buy in hugely.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:18:19
You know what they say about things being to good to be true, right?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:08:48
Sure. I’ll just cary a laptop with me everywhere I go. Sounds reasonable. Oh wait, no WiFi

Cool story bro

And some people are conspiracy theorists who think that companies are the evil empire of the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:22:09
I wondered about this myself. Granted I haven’t done the math but at what rate is the btc blockchain growing and at what point in the future would it be, say 3 TB?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:53:37
Are you concerned about North Korea missle/nuclear tests during the upcoming Winter Olympic Games?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:38:50
That is because bitcoin came first. Obviously. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:47:06
Agree. With there being a focus on crypto in general now I think the first one to prove their capabilities to perform, be secure and Garner industry adoption will end up on top. I don’t know that bitcoin is positioned to be that guy, even with the “soon” to be released LN
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:10:46
Very hard if you don’t have it scaled appropriate to handle high volumes (which they don’t)
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:55:06
I understand. Reading is hard for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:19:07
Isn’t the last bitcoin like 100 years out?  I won’t be here but I’m sure we will have a much better system by then.

@_date: 2017-12-20 12:22:38
I thought nobody answers the phones there though...
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:29:04
No. Not until you have the exchange send bitcoin to a wallet (and pay those fees) do you get the actual coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:05:20
You sound like such a cool dude....kappa
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:55:30
Because the blockchain is that much larger and requires more storage to run?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:17:37
The funny thing about investors moving from crypto to crypto is that the exchanges are the ones who profit the most. That have to be loving the speculative rollercoaster that is crypto. A huge cash cow for them.

@_date: 2017-12-14 05:52:01
I wouldn’t worry about exchanges. Worry more about the bandwidth needed to keep a bitcoin node operational. ISPs could detect that and shut you down if they wanted for the incredible high upload rates 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:03:43
If by all you mean everyone on reddit, then no
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:36:53
Except paper money is backed by the full force and trust of the US government. Pretty reliable the US isn’t going anywhere. Would you say the same about the Zimbabwe dollar?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:24:20
The limiting factor is how god awful slow it is to transfer funds around so you run the risk of the price differences not being what you hope for by the time the money got there 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:50
Tell that to the people who bought in at 17k
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:28:30
And with that - I’m out. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:06:19
It can’t be only bitcoin ever until it becomes stable value. In a future where it is a universal currency, fluctuations in price like we see now wouldn’t be happening. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:53:37
Probably because Newegg is aware the bitcoin price is on its way down and doesn’t want to lose money on the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:01:32
Live and learn. Welcome to bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:47
Pretty much like what happened with .com. Every one had a website and a tech company and you couldn’t go wrong investing in any of them - or so people thought. It is just a matter of time before it all comes crashing down. Just a question of which cryptos survive 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:22:06
Pretty much. It only has value at this point because people keep buying it. You effectively can’t buy anything easily with it 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:36:25

Once it gets to the point where lots of people get fucked or lose their savings, the government will step in to protect people from themselves. That seems to always be their cue. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:06:09
I’m just saying - while that formula is daunting now. Who is to say in 10 to 20 years there aren’t advances made to blow through them fairly “quickly”
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:29:49
Agreed.  Let it go....

If you can only choose one - college fund. Not only guaranteed growth but tax deductible contributions as well
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:06:28
930 AM EST I believe 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:14:28
But to the OPs point, that excludes the majority of people in the world. Most people can’t afford to front $100 for “future” payments. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:23:25
What do you want - more regulation and control around the trading of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:07:04
How is it a currency when it is virtually unable to be spent without huge fees?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:21:47
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:49:58
A real value add for society I’d say. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:32
 No. It will be worth less
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:22:21
Faster, cheaper and more efficient. The downside is the chances that the network becomes more centralized in the control of a few as opposed to bitcoin which is more decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:45:56
Given how many people ask the same questions about payments being stuck or other issues - I would imagine probably not much. Don’t need knowledge to invest though - just dolla dolla bills
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:25:12
Not if you live in Europe where taxes are high to fund things like education and universal healthcare. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:30:59
Can’t argue with convenience. Going to have to prove that it isn’t just comparable but also markedly better before mass adoption takes place. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:54:51
It remains to be seen. Most people 50s and older will likely never get into bitcoin unless it somehow
Becomes the only way to pay for goods/services. There has to be a major incentive for companies to adopt the payment and I don’t see us there yet. Maybe 5-10 years 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:20:07
What do you mean the vast holders of btc are people?  What else would they be?  Still the vast majority of btc is owned by a small percentage. Not unlike fiat currency....
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:07:52
You can if the systems are designed with redundancy in mind. I developed healthcare IT systems that require almost 100% uptime.  Architect the software in such a way that minimizes large patches of downtime to apply updates 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:49:50
You will probably be downvoted for even suggesting such heresy
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:50:38
No. That is what the futures are for. You can buy a short future contract which basically bets that bitcoin will be below a given price by a certain date. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:39
Better off using that to stream PUBG on Twitch instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:47:42
I know - I wasn't awake when it dipped that low :(
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:51:24
Do people still go into cash stations to pay?!  I did have to check for a card skimmer outside though :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:25:53
Wouldn’t that be based on the computing potential of today?  Who is to say there aren’t huge advances in computing that will increase the speed at which coins are mined - even if the difficulty is increased accordingly?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:27:38
Nobody is backing up anything. Theoretically they could be worth next to nothing when you wake up tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:38:31
That compound interest over the years plus the ridiculous gains from this year 20-30%. Also, start early in life - make it a priority. Some people will get rich quick but most will need to take the long, proven track
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:46:47
You can’t. You own bitcoin forever
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:04:49
Right - I imagine that is the obstacle, but what is to stop North Korea from harnessing their collective computing power to power push through the numbers?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:41:54
Would you send 16k to someone or some business you didn’t 100% trust?  No?  Well there you go. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:36:38
So only have to pay $30 instead of $40 per transaction?  Score!
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:26:19
7% of Australians who were polled. So what are we talking - like 0.0017% of world population?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:40:56
There in lies the issue. Until most things we spend money on accept bitcoin, it will not take off and risks crashing down at any moment 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:19:37
Already got out, sorry.

@_date: 2017-12-14 01:29:14
I feel you. I’m still paying back loans 14 years later. The interest rates were real low when I refinanced them some time back and the interest is tax deductible so it actually pays me more to invest my my 401k then pay the loan off right now. Best of luck to you!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:44:30

Never prioritize gambling over actual debt. Unless you enjoy the prospect of bankruptcy. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:26:10
There is some truth to this. I had an easier time buying things with bitcoin a year ago then I do now. The volatility has caused many vendors to back away 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:37:33
This is a basic explanation of the two concepts - pros and cons. The speed has to be priority imo or people won’t use it. People say LIghtning Network will fix it but I’m not confident - especially if people really believe widespread adoption of 10s of millions of transactions per day is the end goal. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:46:27
The odds of someone mistyping an address and it being an actual in use address are beyond astronomical.  While possible, it is beyond unlikely 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:02:42
At least they haven’t been hacked....yet. I’m staying put for now 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:16:30
You would probably be killed because you would effectively render many systems security useless since SHA-256 is a commonly used protocol for encryption

I’ll admit similarities in the fact that every regular dude on the street is hearing about “crypto” and is buying in to get rich. Just like what happened during the tech bubble. It will not be sustainable and lots of currencies will burst and lots of money will be lost

I am Satoshi. 
Sorry - been watching too much Walking Dead lately. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:29:02
Of course it is. It is way more risky as well
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:03:45
I am willing to bet even the average person doesn’t have an extra $100/month to throw into bitcoin. Hell, a large majority of Americans don’t have a savings account to cover 3 months living expense - but they got that crypto currency!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:40:42
The fuck you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:57:11
Look on the bright side - you are helping to push the price higher so the big holders of bit coin can make their millions. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:31:42
What reason?  The web server could be overloaded and the upload call simply fails. They are not scaled to handle the volume they currently have - which leads to all kinds of issues 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:37:03
I have no bitcoin and a good paying job that I enjoy. While I’m looking to get in sometime soon, if I don’t my life is no worse off for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:29:29
No idea. I’m here for the speculative bitcoin hype. I haven’t read into any of the underlying protocols or APIs and how to implement them. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:13:47
WHEN fees go up and transactions take too long?  You mean like right now when next to nobody is using Btc to buy anything anyways?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:33
It is pretty bad. Like fan boys arguing over which video game is better 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:10:10
You can’t as far as I know. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:41:14
I mean he has a point that something bad could happen with regards to regulation or hacking that could cause a catastrophic drop in price. The other stuff, ehh 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:05:00
I mean that 20.5k short future is looking better and better 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:30
Blockchain is revolutionary. Bitcoin is just an implementation of it and the first one at that. History has shown that rarely is the first one out of the gate the long term success

Get a tax accountant if dealing with decent amount of money. Not only will they make sure you do things legally but also advise you on how best to manage your funds to minimize your tax burden. Especially with the possibility of the new tax laws being passed by Congress this month.

You think every potential investor has nothing better to do than buy bitcoin futures on a Sunday night?  They are watching football. Tomorrow we’ll get a better sense for the volumes

No. The number of bitcoins is finite and non negotiable.

@_date: 2017-12-17 04:31:43
I imagine that is accurate. The average person on the street is not involved with bitcoin at this point and could probably care less. Maybe that changes in 5 years.

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:13
It’s not a company stock so it doesn’t play by the same rules.  This will change though. As it grows in popularity and shady shit continues to happen, the government will step in. These exchanges are doing the industry a disservice

Because futures sales have been relatively small maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:27:50
Depends on how scaled our and robust their web servers are. It seems like most exchanges lately are overwhelmed by the volume and aren’t scaled appropriately. Unfortunately it isn’t always a quick fix for them
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:44:56
Do you really see struggling economies like you mentioned (Zimbabwe, Venezuela, etc.) getting on board with bitcoin?  We have tech savvy teens and 20 year olds in the US who can’t manage to store BTC without losing it and we are expecting the average citizen of a 2nd world country to be able to manage their wealth in BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:46:32
I imagine 10-12k

After you setup a card they usually send two small charges to your card and you have to enter those first. Then after that, contact your card so they don’t decline your purchase as a fraudulent purchase. Then try again 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:50:55
Wait longer. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:15:12
I wouldn’t worry about it. You’ll be long dead when the last bit coin is mined 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:00:23
They can shut down the exchanges - effectively crushing the popularity but I don’t think they can prevent people from sending coin to each other. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:48:53
Probably because the process is not air tight and they are trying to protect against fraud
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:50:12
But that has been the response for months
And months. You can’t fault people for getting impatient when they literally have money riding on the success
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:57
Of course people who still hold btc are going to preach buying more. It is the only way you will make more money 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:13:08
Agreed. They will have all that bitcoin wealth and nobody to pass it on to

Probably 3.5% charged to the merchant 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:17:56
Except the second layer approach isn’t available and doesn’t seem to be in a rush to be implemented. The clock is ticking on bitcoin to prove they are reacting to the stresses on the system as a whole in a timely fashion

That is funny. Bet the government won’t be HODLing any of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:18:46
Are people actually using cloud services to mine bitcoin?  It seems prohibitively expensive given the amount of processing power required for mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:37:57
I’m looking forward to seeing what improvements can be realized. I bought 40 bucks worth of gas on my VISA at a brand new gas station and the transaction approved in literally a second. They will have to make some marked improvements before widespread adoption becomes a reality.

The question is what would Amazon’s incentive be to invest in such a thing?  They are making money hand over fist and aren’t really “missing out” on market share but not accepting crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:26:41
Reality though is that they will probably laugh at you and then wipe their tears away with 100 dollar bills. They have to be making money hand over fist over there
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:12:36
I agree. And the usability of bitcoin is just not there without it. Definitely overvalued in its current state. It could change so long as another coin doesn’t figure things out first and start getting market adoption 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:58:21
How much bigger you propose?  Bigger blocks means a much larger block chain and that larger chain has to be downloaded and running on PCs across the world for the system to work. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:07:45
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:54:13
You’d obviously get the value of the item you bought. If it was $80 regardless what you paid for it in, you would get $80 worth of that same currency back

Agree with proof of stake. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:23:50
It’s the millennial way ;)
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:47:36
Not sustainable without large investor buy in. If crypto starts being offered by the big investment bankers, then easily 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:35:51
You see what happens?!  Do you see what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass?!
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:22:38
Society has a whole will definitely not embrace this with the fees as they stand now.  What is my incentive to pay money up front just so I can buy things later?  Hell Visa will be in a better position to offer lower rates at that point. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:05:52
What happens if the paper wallet is lost or ruined in a pool accident?  Could the government reissue it?

You just used bitcoin. Have to wait a bit longer unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:47:55
Yeah, I’m out. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:06:32
There is no “share” of bitcoin. It isn’t a stock. It’s an asset class, so you own the actual percentage of a single coin (or multiple coins)
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:52
Only difference is a lot more people were invested this go around and prob a lot of people have a bad taste in their mouth (if they bought in at 17 or 18) and won’t be getting back in
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:49:40
Yes. Sell all your bitcoins so the price dips and I can get in
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:44:05
I feel u
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:29:48
If causing sleepless nights - clearly you cAnt afford to lose 5k (neither could I) and shouldn’t have invested it to begin with. Hope you get it sorted 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:34:17
It would be much different now because the number of people who would lose their shirts would be large. You know, those people who mortgaged their house or borrowed money to get in on the mania
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:23:15
No, you can use regular credit cards now 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:30:37
You instead have the reverse deflationary problem / where the wealthiest 1% could just hoard bitcoins since it is a finite supply. That doesn’t help the long term use case for bitcoin either.

That doesn’t appear to be happening anytime soon based on where they are with implementation at this point. They still have to iron out a lot of security concerns before it is ready for prime time 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:12:58
Your bitcoin isn’t backed by anything so if something happened at Coinbase and your coins were lost, you are fucked. This is why people suggest transferring coins out to your own wallet. I believe they are fdic insured for any USD you leave on the exchange, but that is it.

Of course they don’t care. They are making their fortunes and if the whole thing collapses, they’ll move on to the next 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:52:46
If you owned bitcoin you would say anything to defend it as well. It is called caring for your own self interests.
