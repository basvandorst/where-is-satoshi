Well, you can always have multiple identical ledgers/trezors. Stored in different locations. No one can access them without your password. If all gets broken or missing at the same time you can buy a new one and regenerate that with your seed.
That seed has to be stored somewhere as well. In a encrypted rar-file on a multiple USB-sticks, memory-cards or even on a offline PC.
The upside with using a HW-wallet imo instead of a paper-wallet is the ease of use. If I want to send coins to someone or pay for something I just plug it in and verify the transaction. physically on the ledger. No need to find the rar-file and decrypt it, copy the seed and open a wallet online.

Yes, but you'll never now if a keylogger will start-up in the background even in safe-mode. Then when it reconnects to Internet later on it might send the any information collected.
Keyloggers are the scariest thing. You can never be 100% safe with anything of course. But keep you applications on you computer you use to decrypt your keys to a mininum. And make sure you always have updated OS, applications, antivirus and firmware.
The only way to by safe from keyloggers is to setup a HW-wallet like Ledger or Trezor.

Not a bad idea from my perspective. RAR-files from v.6 uses SHA256bit encryption. As long as you keep the password to at least 12 chars and use some random characters here and there to avoid any brutforce attempts.
Your weakest point would be if someone installed a key logger on your computer.
