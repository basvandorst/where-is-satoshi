Why do you think it would be free in the first place? Of course there are going to be fees collected by lightning nodes, and those fees will be in line with similar assets like money markets and savings deposits. The difference is that the system is more decentralized and that anyone can operate a lightning node.

That's completely wrong; by that logic you can never refill a multisig wallet or even create a channel in the first place.

That isn't entirely true; you don't know coinbase isn't pocketing the difference between whatever fee they're actually paying the miners and what they are advertising as the fee.

That's the fucking point I'm trying to make. OP didn't really mean 100% uptime like google; I didn't really mean 100% uptime like google, and your smartass "100% uptime is impossible lol" comment is at best not constructive at all and at worst FUD discouraging people from running their own node. The whole idea of 100% uptime being impossible is part of why 99.9% reliability is industry standard for saying 100% uptime; and it never EVEN MATTERED because the lightning network doesn't lock your bitcoins away if the counterparty loses internet.

Because BTC is the gateway from fiat to shitcoins. Let's say your shitcoin is worth 1000 satoshi, if Bitcoin goes up $1000 then your shitcoin is now worth $0.01 more, just because 1000 satoshi is now worth $0.01 more.
That, combined with the fact that bitcoin is the main gateway and because 99% of shitcoins are bitcoin clones, is why shitcoins are slightly more volatile but highly correlated with BTCUSD.
edit: There's also a phenomenon you can read about in Taleb's Black Swan book. The basic idea is that during major market moves all assets become more correlated; e.g. when China bans Bitcoin, the market figures they're banning shitcoin as well, and so both crash, whereas during "normal" market activity, shitcoin partnering with Microsoft or Bitcoin being taken off steam are not likely to cause correlated price movement.

Right, like when the intended recipient receives the first transmission of 0.1 BTC from Joe, who received 0.1 BTC from me, which means Joe's balance is once again at the original 0.1 BTC, so we can repeat the whole process to transfer 0.2 BTC from me to intended recipient with Joe never needing more than 0.1 BTC.
Since you're obviously a troglodyte, let's do this with gold bars instead.
Alice wants to give Carol 2 gold bars, but the only middleman between them is Joe, who only has 1 gold bar.
Alice commits to giving Joe 1 gold bar as soon as Carol receives one gold bar, which Joe can prove by producing a signed note from Carol. Now Joe has his gold bar, Carol has 1/2 gold bars, and Alice has sent one of two gold bars.
Now do it again. Joe still has his 1 gold bar, Carol has received 2/2 gold bars, and the transactions are done.
Bcashies are too stupid to into math, which is why they want bigger blocks to play with.

opening more than one channel with an offline wallet doesn't solve the problem, the channel is still down because the counterparty wallet cannot sign new transactions in the channel.
Why would the transaction price for on-chain transactions decrease? If the average user is willing to pay the current price of 316 satoshi per byte, why would the average user willingly lock away funds in the lightning network unless the on-chain fees are above 316 satoshi per byte? The lightning network is for scaling up the network, not so that existing users can bypass the fee market for on-chain transactions. It's unlikely on-chain fees will ever go down unless the bitcoin network isn't growing.

It may require channel factories to be implemented, but you'll be able to deposit your BTC from cold storage/exchange to a lightning wallet and pay your rent without having to deposit multiple payments worth.
edit: you probably won't save anything in fees like this though, because each deposit requires an on-chain transaction unless its already in the lightning network. However, as more of the transaction volume moves to the lightning network and are conducted completely off-chain, the on-chain transaction fees will decline, all else equal.

What you're basically talking about is trading bitcoin and it's probably the number one thing people actually do with it right now, because it's relatively difficult to spend at major retailers.
Let's take today's price history for an example, all times are CST because that's where I'm at.
This morning at 12:00 AM the price had just dropped from 13800 to 13150; let's say you decided that was the low point of the day and decided to buy there, and you would have just now sold at 14150. To buy back the same amount of BTC you just sold, you're now going to have to pay 14545 because it kept going up after 14150. Let's say instead you were greedy and held on instead, now you're up but if the price drops in 5 hours when Korea wakes up, you're going to kick yourself for not getting out at 14545.
On top of that, each time you trade you pay a ~1% commission on the total value of the trade to your exchange, which means each time you go back and forth between BTC and fiat at the same price, you actually lose a small bit of value.
Finally, what happens when you sell high thinking you've made out like a bandit on your $2k price increase and then the "big pump" starts when bitcoin goes up 30% in 24 hours; you've fundamentally screwed yourself because now you have to buy in at an ATH and you get less BTC than you had before.
The above is why the HODL meme is popular, because so many people have been burned trying to time their sells, or worse shorting, and realized if you believe in BTC long-term it's often easier (on both the wallet and area stress level) to just hodl. That's also why people are so snarky when you ask this question; you're reminding them of their nasty losses.
edit: also if you are a successful trader, you have to pay short-term capital gains tax on your winnings, which means uncle sam takes 25-30% of all the hard work you put in staring at price charts all day.

Nobody knows for sure yet, but it will probably be close to zero at the beginning while the network has an abundance of capacity, similar to how initially Bitcoin had zero fees. At this point, the only real use of bitcoin for the majority of people holding it is trading or holding; with the addition of the lightning network people will finally be able to "save" bitcoin similar to how proof-of-stake coins reward people for keeping coins in a wallet for a lengthy period of time. We're all waiting for more businesses to accept bitcoin so it can actually be used as a currency again, and when that happens the lightning network fees will rise similarly to how bitcoins fees have risen recently.

You are fucking FUD even if you don't realize it, because you are either not a native english speaker or you're just too autistic to communicate effectively.

@_date: 2018-01-15 18:01:50


You never did that; you've only created and moved your own goal post for 100% uptime as an impossible standard. By that logic, the answer to OP's question is "no, it is impossible to run a lightning node with 100% uptime"
Functionally, that's not true, a single person with a desktop computer and residential internet connection can probably be up 95-99.9% of the time, which is good enough for the lightning network.
*The reason* it's good enough for the lightning network is because your funds are not locked away, at worst you can broadcast the closing transaction to reclaim the last channel state, and the lightning network will likely have multiple redundant paths for any given transaction, meaning even if one particular node goes down the network can re-route relatively easily.
TL;DR - the lightning network has redundancy so individual node uptime doesn't matter

I love you delusional cashies. Can't even stay over 500 txn per block, i.e. 1 txn per sec, and it's certainly not been rising over the last month (except for the predictable cashie flippening attempts at bitcoin difficulty adjustments)


Right, the destination is the trash can. Seriously, what the hell are you even trying to say.


That's true about nearly every transaction in any asset class except fiat USD cash. People are willing to use credit cards at 24% interest rates, do you really think a 1% transaction fee is a dealbreaker? Also, transaction fees are not clearly expressed in percents, because bitcoin transactions are not based on the value being moved but the space being used. If you want to move $4, $40, or $4000 with 1 input and 1 output the fee is practically the same, but if you want to send $400 to 1 person or $4 to 100 people the fee is vastly different. Satoshi/byte is a much better metric for fee estimation, but bcashies don't like being honest in the first place.

Fuck Roger Ver; you can't *be* CEO of Bitcoin. That's why Satoshi told us "Minister you, Satoshi"
*The meme comes from one of the times someone tried to figure out who the real Satoshi Nakamoto was. The tracks led the investigators to the front door of an older Japanese gentleman in Kyoto. There was considerable media attention, including reporters camping out in front of his house,and waiting for him to come out, to shout questions at him, but the old man denied being Satoshi and refused to talk to the media or the legion of hangers-on gathering around his house. Every day he went to work, the crowd would yell "Mister Satoshi, Mister Satoshi!!!", trying to get his attention. So one day, he got really frustrated, and yelled back a jumbled engrish "Minister YOU, Satoshi!" (meaning something like "I'm not Satoshi, you fucking nerds, how about YOU'RE Mr. Satoshi!" and this was the only thing he said on the topic. Witnesses of the outburst took it as some sort of an Evangelical statement, akin to Jesus's sermon on the mount, with a touch of Tolstoy's "The Kingdom of God is Within You" thrown in. The common interpretation was that the man was saying, in effect: "I may or may not be Satoshi Nakamoto, but that is irrelevant, because we each have Satoshi Nakamoto within our hearts, and so our search for salvation begins, and ends, inside." From that point on, the phrase was repeated again and again, bolstered by the fact that the old man died that day in a tragic car accident. That's really it. When people post this meme, they are essentially saying: "Don't worry about your troubles (gainz, etc.) because the peace you seek is within you already."*

The last January that wasn't range-bound was in 2013 when BTC rose from 13 to 25 dollars.
I don't think it has anything to do with the time of the year, but the basic price action of BTC over the last 9 years has been long periods of stable equilibrium punctuated by rapid price action upward

The same can be said about cash itself; and it's simply untrue to say the majority of BTC transactions are criminal or related to criminal enterprise. The internet was only for porn 10 years ago.


Only if you think effective monetary policy is a bunch of suits deciding how much less your bank account should be worth each year. 2-4% inflation is a wealth tax and nothing more.

It's 1 satoshi per txn through the lightning network right now.
How to run your own lightning network node:
[Here are MacOS instructions]( You'll need to change the value for testnet from 1 to 0 to be on mainnet.
[Linux instructions](
All you need is a desktop or laptop, some knowledge of command-line (great time to learn why bitcoin is special, it's the first money with a command-line), and a few hours (or days depending on your internet connection). Don't use your main wallet and only experiment with what you're willing to lose, the developers expressly warn users about trying the lightning network on mainnet.
Connect to some of the [existing mainnet lightning nodes](

Then why does bcash get to pretend? People transact more with dogecoin than bcash; dogecoin is a better medium of exchange.


The bitcoin blockchain is the most secure payment system in the world. You have to pay for that security; especially when it hasn't even been 10 years since bitcoin came into existence. As bitcoin is adopted and the rate of inflation goes down, people will figure out solutions to the high fees problem, most likely by using the blockchain as a settlement layer, i.e. exactly what the lightning network proposes to do.


Because it's monopoly money until you attract a significant hash rate, and good luck doing that when you're not willing to pay fees for miners to hash your coffee transactions.

Yes; there's pretty substantial risk to mining bitcoin, just like holding bitcoin. You cannot mine alternative coins except those which are SHA-256, of which bitcoin has and will probably continue to always be the most profitable to mine.


Mining is actually a bit more stable than holding bitcoin, because if the price of bitcoin falls for an extended period of time the difficulty adjusts downwards as hash rate leaves, which results in your earning more bitcoin per kWh you spend.


If that happens, bitcoins will probably be worthless soon after and a new crypto will take it's place.


It's difficult to say, but I've been mining with 2 s9 antminers since April 2017 when BTC was ~$1500 per coin, and I have steadily made between $300-700 per month per miner, which corresponds very well to the price of the miners as well (when I bought my s9s they were 2k each). I am a huge proponent of mining, especially small mining operations like 1-3 miners, because it decentralizes and secures the network, is a great source of side income, and is even more stable than buying and holding BTC. My only gripe with it is that the best hardware is from bitmain, and they have a monopoly. Hopefully that will change soon.


No such calculator as far as I've seen; if I were you I would get one to begin with (maybe even a used one) and then scale up.

The best part about this is that if bcash were in any way a meritorious project and actually a substitute for spending bitcoin; bcash would immediately become the lightning network of fast cash payments we're looking for. The sad fact of the matter is the market as a whole thinks less of bcash than it does of fucking ripple. bcash is a useless short-sighted piece of shit fork that did nothing other than create useless division in a consensus-driven economy, and it did so purely so Roger Ver could add an extra zero to his middle finger he so desperately wants to show to everyone else. If you can't recognize an underdeveloped manchild when you see one, you deserve all the bcash you can hold.

It's not that hard to run a node with 100% uptime; if you're running the bitcoin.org wallet (bitcoin core) and have more than 8 connections to the network you're running a full node. Otherwise you just need to forward the BTC port 8333 to your node's IP address.
From what I understand your BTC can't be "stuck" on a friend's computer; either you'll have committed it to funding the channel, which is analogous to a savings account in that you earn interest (fees) but withdrawing has a penalty (you pay the closing transaction fee), but you can close the channel at any time to withdraw your BTC.
The mempool is likely to be full forever; and that's not a bad thing - the mempool is the auction market for blockchain space, if the mempool suddenly cleared it would mean nobody wants to use bitcoin any more.
Why is a 100% uptime hub automatically centralized? Am I a bank because I run a full node? The main criticism of centralized hubs centers around a few channels having huge amounts of BTC locked in them to route the majority of transactions; that's unlikely to happen because overfunding a channel is like having $100k in a 0% savings account. It's not a good use of your money. Second, anybody can put whatever small amount of BTC in a similarly routed channel and pull half the fees, which means they are earning 2x the return on capital. Finally, any individual can run a lightning network node 100% of the time if they have stable internet on a laptop, smartphone, or desktop.

It's a big txn; part of the way mining pools select transactions to hash is based on the size of the transaction relative to its fee. Since this txn is 10 kb, even though the fee is pretty high it's a relatively less favorable txn to hash for a mining pool.
I wouldn't worry though; it'll probably confirm in the next few days especially if the fee market and price stay in the current range.
If you look at the chart your txn is in the 100-140 sat range, the dark blue. It's not unlikely that it will be confirmed in the next 24-48 hours unless monday morning on the 8th brings a large amount of 140+ sat/b txns. As the dark blue section at 140 sat/b gets cleared up, it becomes more and more likely that your txn will get hashed into a block, and once it's in a block it will get confirmed after 5 more.

GreenAddress uses segwit addresses, so in that case it is both from and to a segwit address. The problem with the above image is that those fees are not realistic at all and the suggested fee will probably get the transaction stuck in limbo for days, and frankly a $1 transaction does not belong on the goddamn BTC mainnet blockchain. It's not 2010; why the fuck do people expect to use BTC for microtransactions? You can't even transact $1 with fucking VISA; use BCH or LTC for microtransactions or stop being poor. Bitcoin has the most secure payment network in the world and fucking tweens are trying to use it to trade their lunch money and pokemon cards.

The value of bitcoin is the underlying mining because the hash rate secures the network by burning electricity; bitcoin is essentially a form of storing electricity as abstract value.
That's why proof of stake alone coins are useless, because nothing is stopping endless forks that cause inflation. With bitcoin, even if you fork it unless you are able to attract equivalent hash rate the fork will never be worth more, and on top of that the deflationary nature of the bitcoin protocol makes it so that unless fees replace the block reward, miners will cease to invest electricity and the network value will collapse. Blockchain is not at all an efficient method of maintaining a transaction ledger, but it is an incredibly secure form of maintaining a transaction ledger. The bitcoin network is a decentralized secure transaction protocol to move bitcoin, a currency backed by the electricity invested in securing the network.
The way I explain it to kids is that it's money backed by sunlight. You can't "store" sunlight, but you can convert it into food and use that as money. Bitcoin is like that, only it never goes bad and is very easy to measure and keep track of because of the blockchain.

The above video is quite topical if you've got some time to spare.
As far as ELI5, let's say your talent/ideas/labor/capital is worth some amount of value to everyone else. "Money", whatever that is, is ideally the perfect proxy for expressing that value to other people, and for other people to express their valuation of you to you. Simply put, if you are a PhD chemical engineer and you interview at a company that offers you $5/hour, you're going to say fuck off because you know the market values your time more than that. At the same time, if the company offers you $5000/hour, you're going to sign no questions asked because that is the best use of your time, and the market will in turn question the company because they're clearly overpaying.
Now let's introduce the "friction" - taxes, artificial and real supply constraints, and practicality. 
Right now, every dollar you make is taxed by the sovereign authority issuing the currency, meaning you essentially are paying a fee for participating in their system. In addition to that, there is friction in terms of fees for using the dollars you make, i.e. if you want credit you need to participate in the banking system and borrow dollars (ever wonder why you can't build credit by having a bigger bank account balance and you have to borrow and pay interest?), and then the powers that be deem you worthy of receiving digits credited to your net worth. After all that, anything you "own" has taxes payable on it - if you own real estate, you essentially are leasing it from the gov't for your property taxes; if you own a car, you are essentially leasing the permission to drive it from your auto insurer and car loan financier; if you own shit in your house you bought with a credit card you lease it from the repo man in exchange for timely payments of your debt.
**SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS**
Let's suppose you're done with taxes and want to retire from the world on your off-grid post-apocalyptic prepper utopia. You're still roped in, because of property taxes, and any way you earn income to pay property taxes leads to income taxes; meanwhile, anything you want to purchase leads to sales taxes, and any time you turn any investment you make into dollars, i.e. the proxy for value, you also owe capital gains taxes. We already covered taxes, so for the purposes of supply constraints let's assume you've either got enough profitability to cover taxes and then some, or you're Al Capone. 
Either way, you're still stuck - because the powers that be (I use this because both the public sector government and the "private" sector banks and insurance companies are involved) have pre-determined what is easily available / permitted to use, and what kind of permits you'll need to get in order to be compliant - if you're not compliant, you're a criminal, and thus all your "ill-gotten" income is forfeit.
To put this into a concrete example, let's use the recent example of a bitcoin mining operation combined with an organic farm. 
Assuming you grow surplus fish and veggies, let's assume you sell them for bitcoins to the community, and that you power the bitcoin mining operation through photovoltaic panels (for tax purposes); also assume you're an American because I am, and America is the best so fuck you.
First, your investment in solar PV panels generates a 30% investment tax credit which you can take against the earnings of the farm and bitcoin miners. Supposing you get 20 s9 antminers (worth about $130k) and the solar panels to run them 24/7 plus the batteries and inverters required to do so (assume $100k) and the related accessories regarding aquaculture and aquaponics, i.e. fish tanks, PVC piping, aquarium-safe radiators for pumping the heated mineral oil from cooling the miners, salable fingerlings, e.g. tilapia, and salable greens, e.g. lettuce, arugula, etc., (assume $70k), you would be able to generate $18,658.40 per month in profit even if you just gave away your fresh fish and greens. Why isn't anyone doing this? Because to do so requires you to pay the state to approve your solar panel assembly, approve your grid-tie inverter system, approve any structural changes to any building you have involving placing solar panels on rooftops, and allow you to even claim bitcoin mining revenue as income. Curiously, in Texas you're allowed to sell food you grow and fish you aquaculture (assuming it's closed loop) with minimal permitting. Those permits are artificial supply constraints, and they impede development just as much as ignorance, if not more (people will read the above, perhaps think about acting upon it, and then be daunted by the amount of permits and legal advice they need to pay to act upon it).
Bitcoin is a giant fuck you to that system. I can't really tell you what Bitcoin is/will be because that's still up in the air, but I think everyone in crypto is essentially making the bet that whatever crypto will become, it's almost guaranteed to be better than the above.

Sure; let Amazon frequently close channels if they have to; they'll also have to sell their bitcoin immediately for fiat because Amazon doesn't want to maintain Bitcoin on it's balance sheet. Amazon can also keep channels, i.e. multisig wallets, open with their own balance as long as the customer has some minimal amount of BTC and is willing to refill periodically when they make purchases.
And this is entirely speculative when the network isn't even at 20% segwit adoption; mostly because of nasty gremlins like cuckbase, bitmain, and roger ver.

It makes a tremendous difference if for a constant hash rate the majority of miners are using 7nm chips that do 10 TH/s for 300 watts vs 16nm antminer s9s that do 13 TH/s for 1300 watts.
If people were so concerned about the electricity usage of bitcoin, then the price of electricity should rise. It's not, because the world doesn't have a global grid and cheap electricity in Iceland can't be exported to Manhattan. It's already not profitable to mine with CPUs and GPUs because of how inefficiently it converts kWh to GH/s, the same thing will happen to older model ASICs.

You might want to look into buying mining rigs or hash rate contracts; that way you'll be able to earn BTC per day by investing the bitcoins you have while keeping the positive exposure to upwards price action. It'll also help pay for your monthly expenses; and is more reliable than trading for income.
edit: To put it in perspective; you could get 3 antminer s9s for about $22k including power supplies, etc. and that would be about $2100 per month in BTC after paying for electricity assuming $0.10-0.12 per kWh, you still have $18k worth of BTC to diversify amongst shitcoins (but why would you, just hold your BTC and set up a lightning node when you feel comfy with the level of development).

Txn fees are not as simple as a % of the txn value; sending 400, 4, or .004 BTC use approximately the same amount of data if the number of inputs and outputs is the same, which means the txn fee will be about the same.


Sounds like GreenAddress is a pretty shitty wallet, but to each his own. The Bitcoin Core wallet 0.16 is supposed to have segwit GUI and is due for May 2018; and people are going to have to adjust to changing conditions. If you need to spend BTC for daily expenses, consider switching to LTC or bcash; otherwise if you're just investing for a long-term hold it's literally 1 transaction from the counterparty you bought it from to your storage wallet. The fees are what the fees are, complaining they're too high is the path to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to bcash. It also mistakes the primary purpose of Bitcoin to be a cheap payment network rather than a secure payment network.

You have to put up the money to spend in a multisig wallet; it's essentially 100% secured credit. That's still "locked up", because to move it back to a single sig wallet requires an on-chain txn.


No; the incentive to adopt segwit is to avoid the high fees. As fees are growing, more people are adopting segwit to avoid paying high fees, but if fees stop growing or shrink, the incentive to adopt segwit disappears. Same with the lightning network.


Probably, but because the security of the blockchain is what allows for the subsequent payment layers, the cost to run the blockchain and security required will need to increase, which means on-chain fees will need to increase.

Only because it's difficult to spend bitcoin. What happens when instead of leaving the Bitcoin/crypto ecosystem, you can just directly spend your BTC for your daily purchases?

Wrong. I bought my S9's thinking the blocksize would be 1MB and people would have to compete. That's the premise they were sold to me under. To have it suddenly change is pretty fucking dirty, especially because Jihan only takes bcash now.


Lightning network is lightning network; mainnet is mainnet. The security of mainnet is what backs the lightning network; whereas shitcoin forks that try to steal hash rate are a direct threat to that security.

I think the developer focus for bitcoin right now is more towards internet commerce and micropayments, and you simply can't do those in fiat.
For example, if I want to buy a $0.05 news article or tip a reddit post, I can't do that with fiat. If I charge $0.05 per hour for watching my stream, people would have to watch for more than 24 hours straight to warrant a MasterCard transaction. There's an entire economy untapped that Bitcoin can bring valuation to without even competing with fiat, and at the same time make many people earn bitcoin to spend even if they never invested in buying bitcoin in the first place, similar to how professional miners have to spend bitcoin now on electricity, internet, etc.
Futures markets and ETFs will also stabilize BTC as they allow more people to freely trade it, which increases market liquidity and makes it harder for the price to move substantially without news.

Like u/longlang said, watch Andreas.
Bitcoin is a p2p protocol like Bittorrent. The difference is that rather than transfer portions of files through p2p routing, the bitcoin protocol transfers "bitcoins" themselves.
Bitcoins are a content type that have a predictable rate of release specified in the protocol itself, which eventually caps at 21 million bitcoins in ~2140. By the late 2030s, the rate of inflation from bitcoin block rewards, the way they are released, will be less than 1%.
Block rewards are one of the incentives for nodes/miners to maintain the network - if you successfully mathematically hash the transactions, i.e. one bitcoin address sending some amount of bitcoin to another, you are rewarded for your effort with the market-rate fee for hashing transactions as well as the block reward. This is what keeps the network secure and online.
What good is said network? Firstly, it is the world's most secure payment system - nobody in the world can decide to ignore or reverse your transactions; and nobody can deny you your ability to transact (except by taking your internet access itself). Secondly, it's immensely more powerful as a money, because it has 10^-8 units of precision and is completely digital, meaning it's theoretically possible to tip a person a penny for an informative reddit post. That opens up sectors of the economy we never thought could be monetized. Finally, it's decentralized and deflationary, meaning it helps the little guy who squirrels away some BTC more than anyone else. The opposite would be US fiat, where if you leave 9 cents in your bank account you probably won't walk away with a few billion in a thousand years from interest - with BTC, that happens.

There is nothing in economic theory that says inflation or deflation is inherently good or bad and if all parties were rational actors they would adjust their forecasting by the predictable inflation/deflation rate.


Ok. You can pray to the big "G" all you want but that's doesn't mean they'll grant your wish.


Look buddy; at the end of the day all the "massive electricity" the BTC network consumes is coming from hydroelectric dams that are connected to ghost towns or geothermal energy in Iceland; the bitcoin network has every incentive in the world to find and tap sources of electricity that are low cost. In fact, the bitcoin network has even more incentive to do so that the government you worship, because the bitcoin network is motivated by dollars and cents and not votes. The most profitable use of electricity right now is bitcoin mining and if you don't think that's spurred innovation in clean tech and renewable energy, you're living under a rock.


That's the point; creating an artificial threat of making your money worth less in the future is not a sustainable nor desirable policy. Fostering growth for the sake of growth is like encouraging cancer because new cells are born.

The reward for mining is both the block reward, which are the new bitcoins, and the fees for the transactions in the block. After all 21 million coins are mined through block rewards, the only payment for the miners will be the fees for transactions in the blocks that are mined. This is why artificially lowering fees by increasing the block size through a hard fork is basically stealing from Peter to pay Paul; fees play an important part in rewarding miners for the electricity spent securing the network.
This is also not apparent depending on the pool you mine at; I've recently switched from F2Pool, which did not pay out fees, to slushpool, which pays both the block reward and the fees to the miners in the pool. It's turned out to be about 12% more profitable to mine with slushpool as a result.

If you get the bitcoin.org wallet, which I believe is also what you will get if you compile the official bitcoin core repository wallet, you'll see it will take about a day or two for your wallet to sync with the network. That's the blockchain, and it's a few hundred gigabytes of data all the way from the genesis block to the last block found (about 500.5k so far).
Bitcoin is really fun and interesting, but pace yourself. People get burned because they get so excited they borrow money to buy bitcoin or speculate on alt. coins or both. The correct perspective is to realize that bitcoin is essentially in beta until all 21 million coins are brought into existence, and that it is a technology that will fundamentally change human existence. Those kind of things take a long time to materialize; to put it in perspective 30 years ago nobody knew what an app or smartphone even were. There are people walking around you right now that remember that time if you ask them about it, yet they are now seamlessly integrated into our smartphone culture. It hasn't even been 10 years since the genesis block; so by 2039 when the nocoiners are considered dinosaurs you'll be considered "an early adopter".
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:53:35
Those unused lost coins still take up space on the blockchain tracking the 21 million total coins the protocol allows for; the incentive for people to run software that recirculates unused coins is that they get paid those coins as block rewards or fees for running a lightning network node. Eventually a hard fork that allows for that is going to come about simply because of the lost value in maintaining balances for coins that are never going to be recovered from the landfill the hard drive is in.

Right but the difference between central banking systems and Bitcoin is that we as peers agree to the terms of the protocol we're using, rather than agreeing as subjects to the terms that the central bank issues.
If we as a group come to the consensus that there are so many lost bitcoins that it forms a substantial fraction of the 21 million the protocol originally authorized, why is it so wrong to ask people to vouch in some fashion that they are still in possession of the bitcoins they hold? As long as it doesn't require expenditure on the part of the holder, I don't see why anyone would object.
edit: I expect this is the gambit behind the new "s2x" hard fork, in that they will hard fork some of Satoshi's coins on the s2x chain and pay those as the dividends they are claiming to be giving out. I don't think that's entirely legitimate, but that's the beauty of the blockchain. We vote with our hash rate.

I imagine at some point in the future the protocol will add a function like "proof of authority" which requires the holder of the Bitcoin to maintain proof that they aren't lost, and those bitcoins which are "provably" lost will be introduced back to the network as block rewards or fees for lightning network nodes. Bitcoin is basically in beta until 99% of the coins are released around 2025, and like all other betas there are problems.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:54:26
Short answer: no.
Long answer: The transaction fees for a mainnet on-chain transaction are probably never going to go down. You are paying for the world's most secure payment system to process your transaction, so naturally the fees are going to be high and you aren't going to want to use that level of security to purchase a $3 coffee.
The next revolution in the Bitcoin space is going to be the lightning network, which will be a slightly less secure layer that allows you to transact against the BTC you have on the mainnet blockchain with the insurance that you can commit the transaction to the blockchain for security. In the mean time, you can avoid paying high fees by converting your spending money from BTC to BCH, LTC, ETH, etc.

Welcome to Bitcoin; it's a hell of a ride.
You should not leave your BTC on Coinbase. I have no experience using blockchain.info's wallet (and you should make it a point to distinguish blockchain.info from the blockchain in the future), but the way I store BTC is to have a computer with the bitcoin.org wallet installed and send BTC to that wallet address. Keeping BTC on an exchange or online wallet leaves you vulnerable in the case of server outages or fishy accounting. For example, many people lost BTC when Magic The Gathering Online eXchange went bankrupt because they left their BTC on the exchange rather than keeping it on their own personal wallet.
Mining Bitcoin requires specialized hardware called ASICs which you can buy on Amazon.com. I have two Antminer S9s and mine with slushpool. There are also ways to purchase contracts with BTC that pay out over time in BTC, but those are always less profitable than mining yourself provided you have cheap electricity.
Andreas Antonopoulos is a very eloquent speaker on Bitcoin and I would recommend his Youtube channel as a great starting resource, it is called aantonop.
edit: you should try and minimize the number of transactions you perform because fees are very high right now. For example, if I were just getting into the bitcoin space I would set aside some fixed number of US dollars I was willing to part with per week. My friend quit smoking by setting aside his cigarette money and buying BTC on Coinbase instead, about $150 per week. That way, if the price goes up, you get less BTC but what you have bought is worth more; if the price goes down you get more BTC and lower the average cost per BTC of your stack. By 2030 when 99% of BTC are mined into existence, your BTC holdings will be worth more than your retirement account, or John McAfee will eat his dick.

From what I understand about how the DAA difficulty adjustment algorithm for BCH works, it rapidly adjusts to miners switching to the BCH chain. That causes the difficulty for BCH miners to rise very quickly, and as a consequence mining BCH becomes less and less profitable. This cycle has been going on repeatedly for quite some time and has essentially worked out to "peg" the difficulty of BCH to BTC while approximately 10% of global hash rate mines BCH and the rest sticks on the main chain, and when the BTC difficulty is about to adjust the fluctuation in profitability of mining, along with some marketing and trading shenanigans, causes the BCH/BTC price to fluctuate dramatically.
