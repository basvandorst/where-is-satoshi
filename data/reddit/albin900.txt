I really loved the Lightning Network, just because it was using Bitcoin as the Layer 1. 
However I realised that we cannot just cling to a crypto because we like it, it lead me to find Nano which solves literally all problems for Bitcoin. No fees, instant confirmation, 7000 TPS, much more decentralized etc...
Check it out!

0.002$/kWh that's insane...
@_date: 2019-06-08 12:32:53
But then you will stand in line waiting for your tx to confirm, and because you paid a too low fee you will miss the game ��
@_date: 2019-06-08 21:53:42
Well I am in no way complaining about that
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:35:03
Bought $nano on binance

About the green argument
It's annoying that people say it's green, that "renewable energy" could've instead been used for powering off some coal power plants.
@_date: 2019-06-08 15:43:32
Sure, but is reasonable that BTC is using the amount of electricity it is right now, for doing just a couple of TX/s? PoS seems like a much better option
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:24:44
In theory yes. Practically probably not. Since payments can happend between two peers directly we can't ever know the exact amount. 
I would however like to some some stats. Maybe routing nodes could publish anonymous statistics on routing tx # and amount. Would be interesting to see the growth!
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:09:11
This is impossible to say really. It all depends on tx size. Technically speaking there could be an unlimited amount. I could send money between me and a friend unlimited times without any fees if i had a direct channel. This wouldn't affect the network in any way other than our channel. I could also send thousands of transactions to someone I don't have direct channel. If they later sent the money back it would restore both their channel, channels in the middle and my channel. Which would allow for even more transactions. It's therefore impossible to say an exact figure!

2 - Cool idea! That's exactly what LN was created for!
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:05:14
Currently you just don't :P (JK ofc I have no idea what I am talking about)
@_date: 2019-02-13 12:10:57
Don't forget that you need to put bitcoins on the node for it to be able to route payments! Managing channels is also something time consuming.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:19:07
Oh that's dope!⚡
@_date: 2019-06-08 12:28:28
Yeah cause Lightning Network is super user-friendly...

Haha that's like saying that 1 kg of lead weights more than 1 kg of cotton
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:38:20
Sadly that's where it falls short. It's many times more complicated to set it up, atleast for non custodial wallets. There are however custodial wallets that are very user-friendly.
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:15:31
LN is in many ways much more secure than the normal internet so I don't think it's a fair comparison. Intermediate nodes doesn't know neither the sender or receiver. Internet nodes on the other hand knows sender, receiver and contents...
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:14:35
Isn't there a similar movie already called Dark Net or something? I think I saw it on Netflix.
@_date: 2019-06-08 15:51:03
Well yeah, but I am not sure what your point is. I am talking about the channels themselves not what applications you can build with them (layer 3)
@_date: 2019-06-08 15:18:35
Yeah, I absolutely agree with you. But a Layer 3 would still have to adhere to Layer 2s rules. For example Breez wallet. It's totally amazing from a user perspective, you don't even know it's using Lightning Network and it's still non custodial. But what happends when an user wants to receive a bigger payment than the incoming balance? Should it then open a new channel in the background and require the user to wait 10 minutes, tell the user that it's not possible, etc? These things makes it a bit difficult to work with on a third layer.
But maybe this will be solved in a good way to make it super userfriendly. And that will ofc be a good day, even if I don't endorse the LN because of it's properties.
Disclaimer: I was previously very interested of LN, and I am still running a LN gambling site but I think it's not the way to go, because of many reasons. The biggest being the energy usage of BTCs mining.

@_date: 2019-02-13 13:19:00
Yes that's the first step. You then need to open "channels" to other nodes. And in these channels you lock bitcoins in to be able to trade them freely between you and the other node. Opening more channels increases the chances of you routing a payment for someone. But you can never route a payment larger than the channel size itself.

I am not the one who posted this acticle! Just sharing it here! To my knowledge the owner of LNBIG nodes is still unknown? If anyone had more information I'd be happy to hear it!
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:48:36
Isn't that kinda dumb? What if someone else finds a block before you broadcast?
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:52:45
Mimble Wimble isn't really a 2nd layer since it's directly implemented in the protocol. Lightning Network is a 2nd layer since it doesn't *really* change the base protocol. (It does but minimally).

I am owner of the LNBIG nodes. One month ago i changed fees as 0.005% + 0.5 satoshies base fee for all 20 nodes. A month later, today, i run lncli feereport at all nodes and i made the sum of all "month_fee_sum" values in satoshi from this report.
The sum of all month_fee_sum values is from 29 December 2018 to 29 January 2019 is:
166312 Satoshies It's 0,00166312 BTC or $5.74 at the current bitcoin rate... :)
I signed last lines by LNBIG LND-01 node. You can check yourself that this text is signed by 0390b5d4492dc2f5318e5233ab2cebf6d48914881a33ef6a9c6bcdbb433ad986d0 node :

What change made it "cost exponentially more" to spam the chain? And it doesn't make much sense that someone would spam the chain at 10+$/tx?
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:47:03
But what about fees? When bitcoin was valued at 20k$ last year, fees were unrealistically high... At 100k, it would likely be a magnitude worse...
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:59:30
When you want to trade bitcoins within the LN network you need to send the bitcoins to a specific "channel". The bitcoins are frozen in the channel until you decide to disconnect the channel. So total number of frozen bitcoins are the total number of bitcoins people have put into their channels.

I have created a Coinflipping site on LN (testnet for now). Check it out!

Visit the info page for lntipbot, you can withdraw it to your own wallet using an "invoice".

If you want simplicity I would recommend Coinbase Commerce. They have embeddable buttons and also a great API. And completely free!
