is there a place to see how many transactions are unconfirmed right now?
thank you

You need to know your private keys.
My first thought was that as well. How can I benefit on both chains? I later understand that two chains will be a huge trouble for bitcoin. So your concern should be that. 
Having two chains doesn't mean double coins but split value.

every other bitcoin is a copy of bitcoin with extra feature(s) that bitcoin does not have.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:17:37
why do you want to have bitcoin before the fork?
@_date: 2016-11-04 12:52:22
Governments will use their own blockchains. 
Why would a bank institute with millions of clients not use its own private blockchain and use bitcoin?!

there are other cryptos that protect privacy and provide anonymity.

thank you.
Yes I recently studied monero and its technology is really praiseworthy.

awesome work!

it's all about the volume. The volume is way bigger now, every day and that means bitcoin is used for paying and being paid.
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:51:27
I see. Well it was needed for trading; just wanted to be sure I don't pay more for no reason.

First up your quality and support and then introduce businesses accounts.
- A very dissatisfied customer.
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:01:34
but 
1) in the email this is mentioned: "If you are receiving this email, this means that you have an unverified cardholder account with us. If you have submitted your documents to be verified, this means that your documents have been rejected by Visa."
and 
2) I cannot make a purchase or withdraw from the ATM anymore.
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:53:26
Thank you for the reply.
I would love to cancel that pending transaction and have the BTC back so that I can proceed with using another service like localbitcoins until all is resolved.
Should I contact support for that?
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:41:23
Thank you.
I also deleted the trustpilot 1 star review as with the support so far it does not represent reality.
Thanks again.

Hi Bitwala,
Thanks for your reply. I want to point out some things so that no other users experience similar inconveniences as you will get your quality of service at a higher level.


I as a user/client know that I submitted my documents and were approved. I have a screenshot showing this on your website and two emails verifying that both my documents went through fine. Now if on the background there are other things going on then I am not familiar with and I should not be let to believe that everything is fine and load my account. I am in need of this money right now and I have a family that depends on me. Holding my money for a certain amount of time puts me in stress. What should I tell my landlord when he is around asking for rent?
Instead if I was informed earlier I would use another service until all was clear with bitwala. 


I want to be in control of my funds any time. When I was told I was verified at first I then went forward with loading my account. That means ***I was in a wrong assumption by your service that I was in control of my funds when I was not.***


I also replied back. ***My proof of address was not older than 3 months.*** I have sent you my proof of address before March 11th 2017 with a document that was dated in February 2017. I have proof of the email I received by you that I was now verified.
I hope you understand that I am put in a difficult position and that is why i wrote everywhere about it. I am indeed, in need of these funds yesterday but instead I will have them locked for the next week or two. I know mistakes and errors can happen but please do the best you can to speed this process up.
