If that statistic is true, that means 90% of all BTC users keep their coins in exchanges.   When you consider that many BTC holders own multiple addresses, that would imply 95%+ of users are storing in exchanges.
I hope to god those 95% learn to get their coins out of centralized exchanges.  Hackers, insider embezzlers, power hungry governments. History shows this will end badly.

If even 2-3% of the populations wraps their head around this sophisticated scheme the central bankers put together to commit theft on a grand scale, they're in deep shit. 
Their reign on the flow of information is starting to get away from them. Everyone can share ideas freely online now.   And it circumvents their control on the topics and ideas that get discussed and pumped out to the masses like on network TV already. 
I suspect their net neutrality bill is one attempt to seize back control of that information flow.   Cut off the little guys posting blogging and chatting.  Consolidate where the masses can get their online information to a handful of media sources they control.

twfry is just throwing an estimate based on current BTC prices.   Capitalism and free markets will ultimately determine the transaction fee costs in the future.  The miners will be in a business competition with one another to find the right balance of fee vs mining rig overhead costs.

You bring up a point I've been wondering about too.  Loans.  
How does the wealth distribution play out over time when you have a finite amount of currency?  Does bitcoin ultimately break us from the pyramid shaped wealth distribution?  Do the rich still keep getting richer?
From a supply standpoint, bitcoin roughly follows gold but with the added trait of being infinitely divisible.   So my thought for figuring out how the wealth distribution will play out in the future, is to look to past civilizations when gold was the standard.   
Are there any historians or economists here that could chime in on how wealth distribution played out in the past when the world was using gold and not paper?

Yep, you pretty much got it.
The bankers buying or selling the bonds are from "central banks" and also are shareholders in the Federal Reserve.


It's worse than doubling it.   With "fractional reserve banking" the banks like Wells Fargo, Chase, Bank of America, etc, can loan out 9:1 ratio.  So if you deposit $100, they can have $1000 lent out.  In reality, banks have hundreds of millions of dollars deposited, which means they can lend out billions of dollars.
So if you take out a loan for, say, a $300,000 house, the bank creates that money out of thin air on their computers.  AND... the bank gets to put a lien on your house.  Meaning if you don't pay the bank their monthly payments PLUS interest, they get to repossess your house.  
You see how messed up this system is now?  You're paying principal plus interest on money the banks created out of thin air.  
...and people bitch about bitcoin being a virtual currency.  Bitcoin has got nothing on these banking con artists and their virtual U.S. dollar currency.

If bitcoin overcomes all the issues, it's not unreasonable to think it'll go to 10k or 100k.  If there were no risk issues, bitcoin would already be priced in at 100k.

But the people's concerns regarding control are legitimate.  We know from history that any kind of centralized power and control of anything, much less money, will be abused.   Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Sure, the mining pool operators have no incentive to torpedo faith in bitcoin now.  But what if those centralized mining pools are compromised by other interests.  Perhaps a government or competing corporation or organized crime organization might want to take down bitcoin.  
**Where would ill wishers of bitcoin attack?**  The area of most centralization.  That centralized point could be the exchanges, it could be the ASIC mining manufacturers, or in our example, it could be the owners of the mining pools.  
**How would they attack the miners?**  Many ways.  They could *hack* the pool owners' systems.  An outside group could *bribe* the pool owners by offering them more wealth than they're making mining.    An entity could *threaten, harass, or blackmail* mining pool owners.  This threat could take the form of legal action, or in some countries, physical violence to the mining pool owners and their families.  
TL;DR  The 51% issue needs to be closely monitored by bitcoin stakeholders.

Good question.  I'm not sure how the Winklivi plan to break down the shares.  I believe they hold 200,000 BTN.  And they could split the shares any number of ways.  They could do a 1:1 ratio and issue 200,000 shares.  They could have each share represent 0.1 BTN which equals 2,000,000 shares.  Or they could break it down even smaller.
I'm sure they could add more bitcoins on top of their 200,000 too, but not sure on that.

Well short term, a new exchange opening in a certain region opens the market up to more buyers that want to get into bitcoin.  This should, in theory, drive the overall price of bitcoin up.
For example, there's a Mexican exchange opening in the next few days.  We'll see if the bitcoin price spikes upwards because of this opening.
Long term, yes, more exchanges will stabilize the hour-to-hour price swing volatility as you'll collectively have more buyers and sellers across the globe.

Right, but I see the author's point.  Once you introduce lending (usury) into the equation, you're going to end up in a situation where the lenders end up with a net accumulation of bitcoins over time.   The current Federal Reserve and fractional banking system right now takes the rape of the common man to new heights.  But even on a purely gold standard, you historically had a class of gold owners that would lend (with interest) to those without gold.   
I'm not sure the solution, other than for people not to live beyond their means by taking out loans.  But I know in reality, this won't happen.  It's just human nature to accumulate and monopolize any scarce resource.  That resource could be gold, silver, telecom and cable, oil, media,  or bitcoin.

As long as the U.S. and most Europe have bread and circuses, the public at large will buy into the mainstream media view of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt they associate with bitcoin/cryptocurrencies.    
In the short term, countries like Argentina, Greece, Turkey, Venezuela, etc are going to be where the FUD tactics will have minimal psychological effects on the locals.  These unstable countries are already getting screwed over by their banking masters and watching their life savings wither away on a catastrophic scale.
As a first world citizen, I don't expect cryptocurrencies will win many first world battles over the next couple years.  The restrictions, licensing, regulation, and bans are going to be brutal.  The central banks wouldn't have it any other way.
But losing battles doesn't mean the war is lost.  Our entire fiat system is a house of cards about to collapse.

I'd say of all the risks, a competing crypocurrency is the biggest risk.  But as you said, in order to overtake bitcoin, it would have to be more than better.  It would have to solve what I see as the biggest weakness of bitcoin.  Fungibility.  The fact that transactions can be traced through the blockchain.

When you backup to paper, make sure you use BIP38 format, which backs up your private key encrypted with a password that you create.  Otherwise, anyone who finds your piece of paper has your bitcoin. 
In addition to physical paper, I recommend buying a pack of cheap USB sticks and copy your encrypted private key over to those USB sticks.  That way you have both the paper and digital backups.  
Story your USB+paper copies in different physical locations.  Maybe one hidden in your house.  Another copy over at a family members house, etc.  If you end up buying more bitcoin, or the value of bitcoin goes way up, consider putting a USB+paper backup in a safety deposit box.

no idea, but you'd probably need really expensive servers for holding databases of customer trade info.  as well as servers to handle high volume trading too.

Also, bitcoin is growing exponentially so have servers, bandwidth, and manpower  to handle logarithmic growth.   In other words, you could go from 100 customers, to 1000, to 10,000, to 100,000 in months.

Here's where the Bitcoin protocol can save the day.  If third party CAs like Verisign, Comodo or GoDaddy are assumed compromised by the NSA, a distributed decentralized network could track and verify ownership of certificates.  Essentially the blockchain becomes the Certificate Authority.
I know the Bitcoin network has the capability to handle this through "colored coins".  So maybe certificate authenticity can be verified on the existing bitcoin network.  
Or maybe it makes more sense for an entirely separate and parallel blockchain network be built for certificate verification purposes.

I like that you're thinking of new ideas, but I see a couple flaws.
-The strength and confidence in the transaction is because of the verification difficulty.  At one minute,  how much can you trust it as being truly verified?
-A one minute block is still going to be take 1400 terahashes per second given current proof-of-work difficulty for the bitcoin network.  Far out of reach for even ASIC miners not in a pool.
-Lastly, how would the 1-minute miners be paid for using their computing, internet, and electricity resources?
I'm a big fan of the p2pool idea where you don't have a centralized miner in control of the whole pool.  P2pool still needs some work to be done to improve ease of use, but it looks like there's people working on it as we speak.

I agree.  The competing altcoins are built off the Bitcoin blockchain model.  Any flaws in Bitcoin will also effect the altcoins as well.  
There are a couple weaknesses in Bitcoin/altcoins that could allow a competitor to overtake Bitcoin if they're solved.  
First, the network control of 51% miner issue is going to loom over bitcoin.  Is it possible a software solution could be found to solve this issue?
Second, the transactions are indirectly traceable to individuals.   For example, [this]( reddit bitcoin whale was hunted down by a bitcoin buyer.  The buyer seemed well intentioned in this case.  But what if it was a violent thief? Or a government?  Huge flaw IMO.  I know that there's "mixers" that shroud the bitcoin ownership, but I'm skeptical that sophisticated analysis tools won't be able power past the mixers. Is there a way to build a blockchain that provides more anonymity of transactions?  If someone solves that issue, people will flock to the new coin.

Well the amount of bitcoin being released by mining is 25 coins every 9-10 minutes.  The number of freshly minted/mined coins is not dependent on the mining difficulty at all.  For example, you could double the mining hashing power, and still, 25 coins every 10 minutes.

The number of transactions that can be processed is actually limited by the current 1MB size per block.  Not the number of miners.  It's a known issue that will hold back bitcoin from scaling to transaction levels like Visa.  But there are plans in the pike to expand the block size.

-Traditional bank robberies will decline but home robberies where the robbers break in and points a gun at you or a family members face until you provide your private keys will be a thing.

Anyone who controls a large portion of a finite resource like bitcoin, gold, silver, worries me.  Usury (lending with interest) is one of my fears of bitcoin getting destroyed.  
In Roman times, when gold was used as money, bankers would leverage their wealth to accumulate more gold.  They'd loan out an ounce of gold and get re-payed back their original gold ounce, plus some extra gold on top of that as interest.   This created a net flow of gold into the bankers' pockets.

I hear what you're saying.  I'm sure there's still tons of gold on earth.  It may be buried miles deep in the earths crust, and may be super expensive to get to, but at least it's still there.  Bitcoin will be 100% drained by 2140.
My logic tells me that the lenders of bitcoin will have a net accumulation of bitcoin over time.  They loan out a bitcoin and expect, say, 1.05 btn payed back over time. So that .05 has to come from the bitcoin economy and to the banker.  It doesn't seem like a big %, but over time the bankers will own, say, 10% of the total bitcoins in existence.  A few years later they own 12%.  A few years after that 14%, then 16%, etc.   I could see in 50 years they'd own the majority of bitcoins in existence.  Then we'd be back to square one with 1% of the population controlling most the wealth.

It depends how the proof-of-work is done for mining.  Bitcoin mining is moving away from CPU/GPU and is being dominated by ASIC miners.  These ASIC miners are custom built to perform Bitcoin mining.  Specifically SHA-256 hashing to mine blocks.  
If a new alt-coin comes out, it most likely will use a different proof-of-work mechanism than bitcoin.  This would render all that super fast expensive ASIC bitcoin gear useless.

Rainbow tables can crack it.  But even then, it could take a while to crack.  Depending how long/complex the password was.  
I'm guessing that the hacker gained access to OPs computer via the Teamviewer program.  The hacker either grabbed the password with a keylogger program when OP accessed his funds, or perhaps OP had an older un-encrypted backup copy of his wallet.dat on his computer or inside his email program.

Our friendly congressman is implementing classic psychology on the masses.   The bankers/government's ultimate goal is to implement massive and controlling regulations over bitcoin.  But first they have to threaten the banning extreme.  
That way the public minds will be more accepting of the coming "compromise" of heavy regulation.  
@_date: 2014-01-26 04:38:00
I have to side with you on this one OP.  I was reflecting on the exact same things you mentioned.  These guys don't fuck around.    
Given their past actions, I'm predicting some nasty play by the central bankers (owners of governments).   Besides the obvious regulation and controls, are there other unconventional attacks they're willing to do?  Will suddenly a "scandal" break involving the members of the Bitcoin Foundation?  Will some mysterious "hacker" group attack the bitcoin mining network using a false flag?  
Makes me worried.  Bitcoin isn't like Napster attacking some big corporate record labels.  This is an attack on the most powerful men in the world.

Well the big question is how *bad* will the global crisis be?  
Will the global crisis gradually slip into big inflation over a period of months?  I could see more people migrating to bitcoin in that scenario.
Or will the global crises hit fast and hard?  In this scenario, the wheels of commerce will seize up.  Basic necessities like food and medicine will stop flowing.   Hysteria will set in.  Walmarts, Krogers, Safeways, Lowes, and Home Depots will be bum rushed and likely mob looted.  
Forget Bitcoin in the hard-and-fast global collapse scenario.  Who knows if the Internet will even remain functioning during this time period.  The public will flock to more pressing assets in a global crisis.  Food, water filters, tools, property, guns.  The population at large will trust gold and silver more than bitcoin to conduct commerce.
The good news is that after every economic collapse there is a recovery.   The public at large will become very un-trusting of government fiat.  Cryptocurrencies have a great long-term outlook for rebuilding the global economy.

Yes, some people think that bitcoin will bring this equality to the world.  And that may be true to some extent.  Bitcoin will open up a whole other world of economy and banking, particularly to third world countries.   But historically, there will be a class system.   I don't believe this new digital money will ever change that.  Anytime you have human greed, there's going to be the have and the have-nots. 
But it's just not gold that lends itself to a class system.  Our current monetary system creates a class system.  Watch: [here](

Totally agree.  I think the average bitcoin enthusiast completely underestimates the power these bankers have.   Central bankers are solidly fused to government to the point that they have, I believe,  more power than the President or Prime Minister.   When you have that much influence over government, you have at your bidding legions way way more powerful than what the RIAA or MPAA brought to bear on mp3s and torrents.   Bitcoin has yet to feel the full fury of the worlds most powerful men having their power threatened.

I could see it getting adopted.    
Couple of issues and questions.  Would bitcoins be awarded in the game much like gold is rewarded to WoW players?  If so, where would the real-world source of bitcoins come from?  Would the software developer act as a bank?  If so, how  would your business model work to ensure you took in more bitcoin than gave out?
Also, hackers historically go nuts in online games.  Add a highly liquid currency like bitcoin to the mix and you're going to see hackers on steroids.  Your code would have to be rock solid.  Any mistake, flaw, or glitch in the game could be financially devastating.
Anyways.  I like the idea, just curious how some of these hurdles will be dealt with.

True.  But I think the big takeaway from Andreas' message is not bitcoin itself, but the invention of bitcoin.  This idea of a distributed ledger/accounting system that's controlled by no government, bank, or centralized corrupting entity.  
I totally back bitcoin, but I also realize it may just be Myspace or Napster.  If the hackers, scammers, banks, and government regulators attack bitcoin out of existence, the child of bitcoin will evolve from bitcoin's weaknesses and will emerge from the flames even stronger.

You need to watch the video at least 2-3 times to grasp it.  The Federal Reserve system is *purposely* complex.  The Fed wouldn't be able to scam the American public if it were easy to understand.  
Basically, Americans have to pay interest (taxes) on money that was created out of thin air.  Stop and really think about the idiocy of that for a second.  Someone (the Fed) makes up some funny money AND... AND... we pay interest on that totally fake created made up money over years.

Don't put in more than you're willing to lose.  Cryptocurrencies are going to be 100% part of our future.  Bitcoin has a great head start, but it's not a 100% guaranteed investment.  As a lot of people have mentioned, it's either going to go to zero, or to the moon.
I'm in a similar situation as you so I'm putting 10-20% per month into BTC.  In addition, I'm putting another 10% into gold and silver as a hedge from a global financial collapse that I'm convinced is coming in the next few years.

It's claimed that "paper" gold is oversold.  Numbers vary wildly, but some think that for every ounce of gold, there exists 100 pieces of paper with overlapping dibs on that same ounce.  
If this sounds fraudulent, that's because it is.  But people rarely bother to audit and check that the physical gold backing their paper is actually there.  
If the claims are true, it will be physically impossible to keep contractual agreements of physical delivery if the time ever came.  
Google around a bit on the subject if you're more interested in it.

1.  Not sure what you're getting at by pointing out "exclusivity".
   
2. There's definitely going to be a war in the next couple years against those that control the current money vs bitcoin.  Most western countries will use law in the form of litigation, acts, licences, taxes, audits as weapons to wage this upcoming battle.  In some less stable countries, the controllers of currency/power will resort to bullets.  Will these incumbent powers win?  I don't believe these powers can stop bitcon, but they can certainly delay its growth by a few years.
3. Stability and trade volume are just a time to adoption issue.  Bitcoins market capitalization currently stands at around $11 Billion.  Pretty much a drop in the bucket for the world economy.  So if you're asking if remittances are useful *now*, then you're correct, they're not.  But 2 or three years down road?  yes.
4.  In my view, gold isn't so much an investment as an insurance policy.  Even if a fiat like the British Pound, Euro, or U.S. dollar were to collapse, the gold would still hold value.  But bitcoin is unlike gold in that it is a *medium of exchange* unlike anything we've seen.  You can basically hand cash to anyone in the world almost instantly.

There will be day traders that do [arbitrage]( between the Wilkilvi's ETF and the other exchanges throughout the world.   So say the price of the Wilkilvi's ETF was trading at $2,000-per-BTC, and BTC-E was trading at $800,  buying and selling would occur between the exchanges until the prices balanced out.  Say that balance was met at $1500 across the ETF and all exchanges.
On a side note of exchanges, I believe that by the time the Winklevi's ETF gets approved and up and running, there will be much more robust exchanges in operation besides Bitstamp, BTC-E, Mt. Gox, etc.

What app are you using?  On many wallet apps you can manually set the transaction fee you're willing to pay.  The miners can set whatever minimum transaction fee they want.  Some miners have the minimum fee set to zero, so your transaction fee *might* get processed into the blockchain if one of these low/zero fee miners includes your transaction into a successful block they mine.

Even if the bitcoin experiment ultimately fails, I've learned a lot more about money in the last year than I learned in my lifetime prior.  I'm never going to go in debt again so long as I can help it.
I think I'm going to invest more in bitcoin, while keeping an eye out for emerging cryptocurrencies that may solve bitcoin's deficiencies, such as the fact that all bitcoin transactions are completely public and traceable.  
I also plan to put a small portion of my income in gold, silver, or other such physical assets as an insurance policy in case cryptocurrencies get destroyed by government, or the Intenet temporarily shuts down if we experience Great Depression II.

Bitcoin is worldwide, so lets set that fact aside a moment.  If you just focus on the U.S. GDP you might have an general idea.  The U.S. produces around fifteen trillion in goods and services per year.  $15,000,000,000,000.     All the bitcoins currently mined to date are worth around eight billion. $8,000,000,000.     Or stated another way, 0.05% of U.S. GDP.    
If bitcoin can increase from 0.05% to 0.5% of U.S. GDP, the price would be worth $6,000-$7,000 per bitcoin.   
But right now it's priced in at what people perceive the value to be.  There are risks to bitcoin and it's success isn't guaranteed.
[Here's]( a list of risks to bitcoin I came up with in a thread a while back.

If you could derive the private key from the vanity pubic key easily, it would mean bitcoin was broken at it's core.

Ok, so help me out here.  Let's switch that perspective to the end users/client-side point of view.  Let's say I'm connecting to the bitcoin network on a mobile device to make a purchase.  Let's also say that there's a war of miners occurring where half of them have decided to change software to mine beyond 21million BTN, and half the bitcoin mining network remains on the old software.   
In that scenario, which of the two groups of miners would my mobile device connect to and choose to trust?   The old software crew, or the new?  
EDIT: nevermind, I'm tired.  I think you explained it.  But this give me another question.  If any changes to the bitcoin miners occurs, does that mean all end user devices will also require an upgrade too?

These type of scams have been around since the Internet.  I like the call them "heartstring pulling" scams.  
This whole fiasco has me thinking.  The "it's only 3 or 4 cents" view is going to usher in a new era of microtransaction scammers.  Sure it's only a few pennies.  But holy hell, think what's going to happen when the mainstream world has bitcoin.  What happens when a scammer can pull on the heart strings of millions of eyeballs in a higher traffic area of the Internet?  In a future with bitcoin, I could make millions crafting a sob story on reddit about my cat.
A few penny tips X a couple thousand tips = a worthwhile payday.
What makes scamming in the bitcoin era particularly nasty, is that people who have had their heartstrings pulled are going to be reactive.  They're going to be emotionally charged.  And most importantly, they're going to be able to give quickly on impulse.   You're not going to get the cool-off thinking and rationalization time you'd get if you had to donate with paypal or something.
After all, it's only a few cents.

You bring up a good point.  People underestimate the power of the central banksters.  They have access to militaries, spy agencies, media outlets to control the publics thoughts.  They can topple governments.  
Those clever manipulative bastards can bring a whole world of hurt to those who threaten their throne.      
But at the same time, the bankers are underestimating cryptocurrencies.  Every time they covertly or overtly attack bitcoin, they're evolving the crypto technology forward and strengthening it.  Central banksters will be the reason decentralized exchanges become perfected over the next few years.  Central banksters are the reason mixers and anonymousness of transactions will be perfected in the next few years.

As the user adoption of Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency for that matter) increases, it devalues the dollar.  Possibly even to the point of tipping the US Dollar into collapse.  
But as mentioned by wbic16, ten years is a long time so I lot of weird things could happen.  For one, governments captained by big central banks have a tendency to fiercely and brutally defend their currency.   Look what happened to Qaddafi in Libya or Hussein in Iraq when they tried to move off the U.S. dollar standard for conducting their oil trade.

If you were able to time travel this 4000AD quantum computer back here to 2014AD, you'd be able to control well over 99% of the network.   You'd be essentially solo mining, and you'd be getting awarded 25 bitcoin every 10 minutes just to yourself.

The merchants get charged the fees.  Plus they can have their transactions reversed... sometimes months down the road.  
Merchants hate credit cards.  The only reason they use them is because customers demand it.  Customers don't like to carry lots of cash on them.   Customers also like the peace of mind of knowing that if their credit card is stolen, they're not stuck with the bill.
Bitcoin flips the script and puts the burden back on you, the buyer.  This is going to be a hard adjustment to make for people living most their lives with credit cards.  There's things like escrow coming in the pike to lower buyer risk though.  Also, consumers are going to start paying super close attention to business reputation.  As a business, it's going to take a lot of work to build of a trusting relationship with buyers/customers.

Explain mining clearly.
I'm sure confusion at the concept of mining and this concept of the creating money out of thin digital air will come up.
Please, please make it clear to everyone that the bitcoin miners are the the heart and soul of the bitcoin infrastructure.     They provide the transaction ledger of who owns what bitcoins.  Explain to people that Bank of America, Chase, and Visa, etc, have giant computer datacenters to house centralized bank account information.  The miners perform this same function, except they're de-centralized; anyone on the planet can run a miner.   
Explain that this distributed banking infrastructure isn't free.  It takes manpower, computers, internet, and electricity to keep the bitcoin miners/network running.  In order for this infrastructure to be built, miners have to be paid.  Their reward is mined bitcoin.  
I'm sure you can probably take the gist of the above info on miners and condense it more eloquently than I did since I'm sure you'll have limited T.V. time to get your point across.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:50:07
You're correct.  There's no advantage over credit cards right now.  The vendors should be offering discounts on their products for using bitcoin.  But the early adopter vendors have no competition right now plus they have to still pay fees to Bitpay and Coinbase for converting bitcoin--&gt;$dollars. 
As goods and services market gets more competitive, I expect vendors will be forced to discount their prices for using bitcoins.  
*caveat emptor*

Yes, a software patch could be released to extend it.  But all the miners would have to agree to the software change.  The likelihood of agreeing to a major change like that is slim to none.
If only some of the miners agreed, you'd end up with two different forks, which would essentially make the bitcoin version with no 21 million cap an alt coin.
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:19:09
That's actually not quite correct.  Only a small fraction of the the bitcoins out there are put up for sale.  Most of the bitcoins are either lost, or are being hoarded by people.   So you can't simply multiply total coins by price-per-coin to figure out how much fiat has been payed in total.  
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:47:49


That's incorrect.  In the mid 90's, the media and public were generally very skeptical of the Internet.  By the late 90's, sure, people went nuts over anything Internet, World Wide Web, and Information Super Highway.     "Instantly went nuts" is a stretch of the truth however.

From a pure definition of velocity, you're correct.  The same amount of bitcoins could support higher demand. But justgimmieaname was interested in how velocity ties into market cap (bitcoin price).  
The only scenario where the velocity of bitcoin increases in any economic useful way is if significantly more people adopt it.  That means more vendors accepting it to provide goods and services and more consumers to purchase those goods and services.  That means more consumers will need to get their hands on Bitcoin.  Therefore demand will go up.   And price will go up.
@_date: 2014-01-06 14:40:16
I was thinking about the future of crime that bitcoin will cause.  Throughout history, we've had armed robbers willing to take extreme risks for bank heists located in very public places.
If you're a criminal, and you can trace back through the blockchain that someone has 100, 1,000, 10,000 coins, you can kick in the door to the bitcoin owner's home and point a gun at their head.  From the robbers perspective, they can make off with more money than a traditional bank heist with much less risk to themselves.

I think you meant bitcoin's *successor*. 
I'm guessing two main areas for crypto's will be shored up.      
-Wallet security.  Probably hardware wallets, but perhaps something off-the-wall no one's thought of yet.     
-DNS for bitcoin addresses.  QR codes are not really good for the general public for doing business.  If you want to send bitcoin to McDonalds, Starbucks, Amazon or whoever, you want a way to verify that those coins are really going to them and not some hacker's QR code. I think namecoin is trying to address this, but who knows if they'll win out.

Younger generations can afford to play the game a little looser as they have plenty of time to rebound if the bitcoin experiment turns sour.

While bitcoin has been mostly solid and stable, saying it's ran 8 years with "no downtime" isn't quite precise.   
In August of 2010 a bug was exploited that allowed 92,000,000 BTC to be instantly created.  To put this in perspective, only ~16,000,000 BTC should ever be created.
A hardfork and rollback requiring miner downtime was required to fix the bug.

Short term, your friend is probably correct about an impending crash.  Bitcoin goes through these spurts of mania as new discoverers of bitcoin flock in. And then crashes after the euphoria runs its course.

You're correct more people will hold on tightly and think twice before selling.
But there's always going to be folks that will sell coins into the market regardless.  
Here are a few reasons I can think of that coins work their way out of storage regardless of future bitcoin price upside:
-Bitcoin rich.  Some folks have seen enough exponential gains that they will feel comfortable enough with their gains to buy themselves or their families something nice.  Vacations, housing, Lambos, etc.   For some, that means only selling off a small fraction of their bitcoin.  But to the rest of us, it's a lot.
-Miners.   A lot of miners generating bitcoin have to cover their equipment and electricity expenses and are forced to convert some of their bitcoin into fiat to pay their bills
-Divorcees.    There have been numerous tales of bitcoin holders getting divorced.  In the U.S. judicial system anyway, the spouse gets half.   Often the spouse will take their half and immediately cash in.
-Thieves.   A lot of bitcoins have been obtain their btc through good old fashioned high seas looting.  Exchange hacks, ransomware, bitcoin copy/paste malware, extortion, etc, etc.  Those thieves are more likely to try to cash out and live the good life.
-Family emergencies.   Unexpected medical bills, foreclosures, etc, etc.

Coinbase is a classic example of "regulatory capture". 
The regulatory barriers for a competitor to enter the crypto currency exchange market are so steep, that no one can compete with them. 
Tons of KYC/AML regulations. "Money Transmitter" licenses for all 50 US States.  Plus who know what else.  Maybe dealing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) too?
The New York Stock Exchange is also one of the early investors. So Coinbase had some insider connections to get kickstarted.

Perhaps a good way to filter out those too young to purchase btc as well as couples that would purchase btc as a team would be to use total households instead of absolute population. 
In the US that's about 125 million households vs the total US population of about 350 million. Not sure how the population to household ratio holds for other countries. But figure your pool of potential bitcoin buyers needs to be divided by at least 3 or 4. 
As far as the elderly, I'd be shocked if even 1% of the world population currently over the age of 50 ever gets onboard the crypto train. They've got way too much invested trading away far too many moments of their lives working for fiat.

Well on the one hand, the bitcoin address situation is as you described. An individual will often control multiple addresses. 
But on the other hand, you have scenarios where large quantities of people will share one address. 
You see this address sharing commonly on exchanges.  Some single  address will be sitting there with like 20,000 coins. Yet all those coins are in cold storage representing the holding of thousands of their customers. 
So I guess the conclusion is that it's very difficult to track down how many folks actually own bitcoin.

There's still a lot of risk involved in bitcoin.  There's the government interference factor as throwahoy mentioned.

There's a chance a competing cryptocurrency offers a better design causing people bail on bitcoin.

I wonder if there'd be a software solution to this problem.  
On the one hand the puzzle difficulty for solving a block needs to scale up so that new bitcoins don't get mined too fast.   But that creates a situation where only very wealthy organizations and groups with banks of supercomputers can compete in the mining arms race.  The powerful groups that control these supercomputers would control bitcoin and could, in theory, modify the bitcoin code to their advantage.  
Can a solution for cryptocurrency be solved that allows less powerful machines like user desktops back as viable contributors like in the early days?

If the government/corporations decided to get into the mining game, they'd be competing with all other miners across the globe.  From what I understand, that government/corporate entity would need to control 51% or more of the processing power to take it over.

hope to god you're right.  people are saying they'll send you the "high risk account" spiel if the price goes up.
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:01:36
Right, but if they're cheap and effecient, wouldn't wealthier miners simple buy more of these cheap devices to outpace the competition that has the cheaper gear?

It actually breaks down to 1.1% of the people owning about 75% of all the bitcoins.

Finding weaknesses in the encryptions is the way most people assume a flaw in bitcoin will be found.   But there are other places bitcoin could fail.  
Perhaps the bitcoin network doesn't scale and implodes under it's own weight.  Right now it can only process 1MB of transactions every 10 minutes.  No where close to VISA or Mastercard.  I know the miners have plans to expand that 1MB limit, but perhaps that ends up causing other issues and a catastrophic failure to the system.  
Maybe other attacks on the miners will be found that destroy the bitcoin network.  Who knows what exploit could be found.
The bottom line is that if a fatal design flaw in bitcoin is found, that fatal flaw will be corrected and a new cryptocurrency will step up to take bitcoin's place.

Don't invest anything you expect to get back.  There's some gold-fever nuts out there mortgaging their houses, pumping their 401ks, and other nut moves trying to get rich quick from bitcoin.  Only invest expendable money.  If bitcoin crashes and burns, suck it up and move on with life.  If it hits, woohoo for you.

I doubt it.  I doubt most the guys in power in China even realize how world changing this is gonna be.  To them, anyone trying to start a currency within their borders is a threat to be destroyed.  The U.S. will do the same thing soon i suspect.  But with the U.S., things take a lot longer because the law moves slow.

one of those 1.1% guys decides to cash in on a bunch at once, the market will be flooded with bitcoins and the price will drop.  If they were manipulative, they could purposely cause a price crash like what happened in with the China incident recently.  People would be sent selling in panic.  Then the 1.1% could come back in and rebuy up the bitcoins while they're low.
Dickwad 1%ers pull BS like this on the stock market all the time.

The youtube link elusive provided is really awesome.  If you have the time, I highly recommend you watch it all the way through.  The speaker, Andreas Antonopoulos, does an excellent job of lightly explaining the technical side behind it.  He also has a really clear vision of the future of distributed crytocurrencies like bitcoin.  When you finish you'll be like "Holy shit, that's why the price of bitcoin is going nuts... this is going shake the world".

I put in my first Coinbase purchase earlier today for 1BTN  It says there's a 6-DAY! waiting period.  I went through a extensive process to verify with Coinbase.  They now have my name, address, bank account and routing number, cell phone number.  They have enough info to steal my identity now.  
I had no idea it would take this long.  I have a feeling if the price shoots up, they won't honor the $490/coin price and if the price goes way down (to say $200), they'll process the 1BTC at the higher $490 price.  Seems like a lose-lose situation for, me, the Coinbase consumer.  
If I knew it took this long to process the purchase, I would have never made the purchase.  I can't cancel the transaction.  I have butterflies in my stomach and feel sick.  These next six days are gonna suck.

They part I'm most excited about is that it'll get a bunch of people who don't trust each other to reach a consensus on who owns particular stocks and bonds.  That to me is mind blowing.

This does scare me.  As more capital is poured into bitcoin, the juicier the mining pools are. He who controls the money, controls the power.  If I were an evil James Bond villain, control of the mining pool would be my goal.

Andreas Antonopoulos is predicting that the world's first TRILLION-are is going to come from that 2% bitcoin elite.

Here's a nasty scenario I see.  Feel free to counter-point:
I see some big risks for Bitcoin in the years ahead.  Right now, at least 99.99% of currency is tied up in fiat.  To make the switch to bitcoin, that fiat will have to be converted into bitcoin.  This creates a choke point that can be attacked by governments.
Sure, big governments can't control bitcoin directly, but they can certainly control/regulate/enforce the flow of their fiat into bitcoin.  The governments will tweak the laws and regs so that only their rich banking cartel buddies can legally provide services in the exchange from fiat-&gt;bitcoin.  They'll be raking in huge exchange fees all the while accumulating massive bitcoin wealth for themselves.   Over time, the very corrupt bankers that citizens are trying to flee from will control most of the bitcoin in the end. 
TL;DR: Banking cartels current fiat power will allow them to control bitcoin.

If Bitcoin becomes a major currency, everyone and their brother is going to be scratching and clawing for a piece of the pie.   You're going to see some dirty plays in the next couple years.  People trying to monopolize the ASICs plants in Asia, big corporate banks sleeping with politicians to get laws passed so only they can legally operate fiat&lt;-&gt;bitcoin exchanges, bribes and threats to mining guild operators. 
I think your concerns for telcos to pull stunts is a legitimate one.  I don't think telcos will ban bitcoin per-se, but rather they'll try to find a way to get their hooks in it so they get their cut.   Perhaps by charging their own fees to move bitcoin traffic across the Internet.
I have high hopes that this new digital money will bring out the best in people.  But at the same time, it's also going to bring out the worst in people too.
