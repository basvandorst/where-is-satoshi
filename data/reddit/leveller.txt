Fuck you dude - nobody in the parliament is even thinking/knows about bitcoin. What's it to do with UPA/NDA/AAP?!
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:18:55

What about reliability?
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:40:39


You got to be kidding me. If I were the Central Bank of a country like India, I would do the same no matter how many bitcoins I might be personally collecting for myself.
Stop saying that the RBI is corrupt without giving any definite proof/sources.

So I can buy bitcoin using Paypal here?
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:27:59
Have you bought from buysellbitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:33:20
I doubt their reliability.
The central bank of India (aka RBI) has kept mum on bitcoins uptil now. I went to my bank in the morning to transfer funds to Bitstamp and they refused for this reason. They told me we'll do it but if tomorrow RBI freezes your account dont come running to us.
Sucker didn;t even know what bitcoin was. It was Citibank btw.
