Upvoting. 
The simple fact that Bitcoin Cash mongers who drank Roger Ver's Kool-Aid are pettily downvoting this is evidence that this PSA is spot on and why this shit needs to be said.

Ha. More like $50 a day - on a good day that is - scalping multiple times a day trying to time the market, definitely not a sustainable strategy, it takes a long time and moving a lot of currency around in order to get just a bit of profit and I sure as hell don't know what I'm doing, a lot of it is just luck and rolling the dice looking at the candles hoping they'll go where I want. One day I cash my profits at the end of the day only to see the price of BTC went up when I get up in the morning, the other day I leave my position in BTC when I go to bed and wake up to a massive dip so I'm left holding my bag for days on a row before i can get back in the game. Haha.
I only trade fiat vs BTC (or ETH or LTC but most of the time their rate follows BTC's very closely so it's all the same), trading crypto pairs is too complex for me, need to learn the basics first haha.
It's been a great learning experience but now I'd really like to acquire good fundamentals and open multiple positions, set stop orders, know how much % to look for in each trade, how much fiat or crypto to place in each trade to achieve my desired profit %, etc, etc, etc...
Disclaimer: I believe TA is mostly bunk and I'm skeptical of anyone who claims otherwise.
Yeah, I was asking MlAintheMlA (I'm sorry I still don't know how Reddit works lol) but i'm happy to talk to you too, thx for replying :D

Hi there 
I realize this is a bit old now but are you still doing the same thing now the market is bearish? Would you be willing to elaborate a bit more on your strategy? I can't get anywhere near $200 daily profit moving around 1k-1.5k! Or is it 5k that you use? I'm confused

Nothing in "drinking the kool-aid" implies people are paid to do so. You have the wrong analogy.
Moreso, these peddlers shill for themselves. Do you know what a vested interest is? Because I can ELI5 if you need me to.
