The housing bubble was caused by tons of poorly underwritten bad loans. It popped because that's what bubbles do. Derivative failures were just icing on the cake. A derivative is just that--derivative--and it can't drive the price of the underlying.

Who is going to be the counterparty to that naked short? If I'm buying from them, I'm going to be pretty unhappy when they fail to deliver the bitcoins. (Naked shorting means you don't borrow the underlying to actually sell it. It can't be done on a real commodities market)

Maybe I'm missing something. Doesn't the concept of colored coins require some kind of centralized ledger that delineates exactly what asset each colored coin represents? Couldn't it then be a very simple task to implement some kind of daily clearing activity which secondarily tracks transactions of colored coins on the block chain and immediately exposes fraud? And at that point, would it not be fairly simple to correct the problem outside the colored coin system and issue a new colored coin? 
Few assets with title evidence are owned anonymously, except for Bitcoin itself, and even then it's theoretically possible to track ownership through the blockchain. 
The only case where I see an attack being a problem is with double spending to steal bitcoin itself - although once the problem is exposed, the entire system will  collapse and value will drop to zero, thus rendering such an attack useless. Of course a clever attacker can find a way to immediately convert the stolen coins for value, but once the attack happens, it's a serious race against the clock. One would think that it would be even more useless to try to do this to steal land, because everyone will immediately know who you are and what you stole.

In order to make a colored coin system work, some issuing agent needs to recognize the colored coin. So don't they need to keep their own book as to what exactly a colored coin represents? If I pay you a million dollars for a colored coin representing title to a condo in Manhattan, how do I verify whether you actually hold that particular coin? Moreover, what can I do with that coin when I receive it? Perhaps you can program the door lock to only open if it receives the right colored coin, but of course this programming is subject to manipulation as you stated earlier. What happens if the coin is lost? Surely there must be some kind of backup system to avoid the rise of condo vacancy on the island. 
Similarly, bitcoin only has value if people are willing to pay money for it. Should all buyers go away tomorrow, your coins will have no value. In a way, the combined power of exchanges and local sellers are an oligarchical "central authority" that sets the price of Bitcoin arbitrarily (of course we know that it's more complicated than that, but at least it is a system subject to manipulation). The only reason that bitcoin itself looks different is because every coin is fungible. This kind of power would be far more visible if only a single organization in the world were willing to buy or sell Bitcoin for money.

Right, which is why there needs to be safeguards in place to prevent major losses in this case. I would argue that if such an event were to happen, the system would destabilize and collapse, and we'd revert back to excel spreadsheets and central authorities. The only way the 51% attack really is dangerous is if someone could conduct one without anyone ever finding out.

The exact same problem exists in land titles currently. A deed is nothing more than evidence of a transaction between the grantor and the grantee - it's not a bearer bond or a bank note. 
The most common fraud problem is when a seller grants the property to two grantees in succession and produces two deeds to two different people (kind of like a double spend ) . The problem is solved by recording the deed in public record which prevents the second purchaser from claiming title. There are some other rules, but the general rule is whoever records first wins. The analogue in the Bitcoin world would recognize the first-in-time transaction only (and have some kind of secondary confirmation process that kicks out the "fraud" coins and replaces them with new ones.)

Chinese investors are responsible for bidding up US real estate, among countless other asset classes. The money is sourced from what most reasonable people would characterize as ill-gotten gains from various manipulative finance structures in China, the largest of which is their stock market itself. 
When that hot money disappears, prices will slump, if not outright crash, thus exposing just how weak true demand has been in the last seven years. Luxury markets like San Francisco and Miami are going to experience a very large correction.

If Mt. Gox lent its offline reserves to others while maintaining a float to cover the average daily withdrawals, it would become a fractional reserve bank. 
Banks don't need to be able to print their own notes to engage in fractional reserve banking. The ability to do so only accelerates the multiplier process. From a balance sheet perspective, a bitcoin bank can and will increase the number of outstanding bitcoin--a bank depositor and a borrower will double-count the same bitcoin as assets. Of course, total liabilities will increase, which is why we are concerned with debt crises.

Well, the RRR isn't relevant if the bank writes bad loans purposely. The problem is that the Fed really doesn't care if a bank writes a bad loan, mostly because everyone is doing it. Ideally, a bank should be audited constantly by its customers. During the free banking era, country banks knew that if they did not submit to audit by the city banks, their banknotes would fall precipitously in value because the city banks would not honor them at par value.

The issue goes deeper than this. It's an irregularity caused by double-entry accounting. When I lend you money, I credit (reduce) my cash on hand, and debit (increase) another asset called "loan receivable," and my total asset position has not changed. When you take delivery of the cash, you debit cash and credit loans payable. The overall system net equity has not changed, but now we both count the same cash twice in our assets: you have my cash, and I now have an asset called a "loan."
The only way to keep FRB under control is to monitor the bank's solvency on a regular basis to make certain that they do not make bad loans. In the free-banking era of 1835-1860, banking networks and "reserve banks" spontaneously formed to perform this service for the public, requiring banks to submit to audits before they would exchange their banknotes. Nowadays, the fox is running the henhouse as the Federal Reserve, whose responsibility it is to monitor bank solvency, is run by representatives from those banks. Most of today's banks have no equity as a result of the 2008 crisis.

 Let's assume that the bitcoin market behaves like other markets. Psychological impulses basically dominate the ebb and flow of market trends. Those people out there with millions of buy orders might be sellers tomorrow if the price starts heading down. 
While there may be people out there with legitimate standing sell or buy orders, I think it's more of an attempt to manipulate attitudes about the price, as yours has been.

Forex traders and arbitrageurs keep the market stable by providing liquidity. I know that runs contrary to the 6-o'clock-news-version of speculators, but the people with money in Bitcoin are ripping people off way more in a market where the bid-ask spread is more than 1 point than it would be in a Wall Street-type environment where the spread would be closer to 0.0001.

I don't believe it's the case. Floor traders with 25+ years' experience preach this same mantra. It didn't matter if someone had a standing order to buy every contract at 2 points below the bid. Orders change too quickly to make a difference.

@_date: 2013-03-21 19:14:12
I'm going to be honest. I've studied technical analysis for many years, and the first time I heard "walls" being discussed was with reference to bitcoin. In futures, options and stock trading, we were always told that order sizes really don't make much difference because orders get revised and deleted very quickly when the market moves.
Bid/ask spreads are much more significant -- when this gets wide, it indicates a big market move about to happen because either the bulls or the bears are about to capitulate -- and they might even cancel their outstanding orders.

Generally speaking, governments point guns at you and threaten to throw you in jail if you do not pay them a tax of X amount of USD/GBP/BTC/etc. 
The bitcoin economy doesn't have a government/bank-owned printing press with which to invent money to "stimulate" the economy--this is its inherent advantage. The currency structure does not necessarily prevent standard taxation.
