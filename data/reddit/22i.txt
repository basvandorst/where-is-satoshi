Ubuntu should stop throwing donation ads in my face. I've donated before, I don't really have a good reason to do it again. Sorry this isn't completely relevant to the thread.

The past couple days I've been playing on BitVegas, and I've realized how addicting it is, even though I've only played with Play Money. The issue with online gambling is you get pulled in with pretty much unlimited access to your money.

I tried it, and seem to have not recieved my $10 gift card I ordered. This is after 7 confirms on the transaction. I don't know if I screwed something up, but hopefully my gift card will be there in the morning.

My thing with money is that someone's money is their money. No one else should decide what happens with it.

What do you expect? People who mine bitcoins only do it for money.

Discovering I had 0.25 BTC two weeks ago cause my I stupidly used the same password for a bunch of different sites including Deepbit and got an email asking to confirm a change to my wallet address.

I agree completely.

If you aren't going to tip, then don't go out to eat. Plain and simple. Cooking at home is much cheaper.

No but that's not what OP is referring to. OP is referring to only leaving Bitcoin, which happened to them.

Thank you!

It's harder to get Bitcoin into fiat than getting fiat into fiat. Also, you sound like a fucking douchebag who shouldn't go out to eat ever. Many people who work in food are often working their way through education.

You're over the age of thirty right?

Nvidia is the best choice for folding. Radeon does way worse at it, not sure how much worse as I haven't looked at numbers, but this seems to be the general consensus. The other thing is that the people who are mining BTC are really only doing it for profit, and folding actually costs money to do.

In the US, waiters/waitresses basically make enough to pay taxes and that's it. The rest is tips.

I really want to try this, I haven't heard of it before. Thanks for the post.
