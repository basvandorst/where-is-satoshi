Nice try, but most of your points are either false or moot. Care to back up your statements with sources? I'd love to be proven wrong. Also, missed my last 2 points but they were late edits.

Look at the historical 24hr volume for ethereum vs bitcoin on coinmarketcap. Sometimes ethereum comes close to bitcoin's, but there's really no contest here. Your statement is blatantly false.


That's one attack. Bitcoin has survived hundreds over almost a decade. Your point is moot.


False. Every crypto exchange has bitcoin. Most have ethereum, but there are many services that are bitcoin only, or don't accept ethereum. Purse.io and bitify come to mind, but there are many others. Name a crypto exchange that doesn't accept bitcoin deposits.


I sent a $0.20 segwit tx a few days ago that got confirmed instantly. Your assumption is based on a falsehood. 


False. If you wanted to move tens or hundreds of millions of dollars into an investment, would you want the one with a proven track record, or the hot new thing that sounds great but has yet to be tested?


Active development is hard to quantify, but it's pretty well known that the best and most experienced devs work on bitcoin. Ethereum also has very active development. But Cardano? Come on.
Thanks for wasting my time.

Here's a followup question:
Q: if I want to continuously hold some coins for spending with LN merchants, what's the best practice as a sovereign user? Run a LN daemon and open a payment channel with myself? I want to basically have a wallet that is already set up so I can send to LN merchants without interacting with the blockchain.

Any narrative that hurts BTC is beneficial for bcash. Large holders of bcash have a financial incentive to hurt bitcoin in any way possible. One of those ways is to spam with mempool to make bitcoin transactions expensive. If you're a large miner, you'll recover most of those fees anyway, and potentially more since everyone is forced to pay high fees that you get.

I was opposed to the 2x hard fork because core didn't support it, and there was basically no development in non-core repos supporting the fork. Had it passed, we would have essentially fired core, one of the most valuable parts of this project. The 2x software was untested buggy trash.
I'm starting to come around on a blocksize increase. If core supported doubling blocks (or halving the block time), I would be on board. It's pretty apparent that segwit and LN will take some time (years) to roll out. I think at this point, not doing some sort of conservative blocksize increase will do more harm than good. Yes there's bandwidth and node centralization issues that need to be addressed. Will more harm to bitcoin result from a small increase in node centralization, or high fees pushing out more mainstream users? The answer intuitively seems to be in favor of a blocksize increase. But I haven't run an in depth analysis.
Keep in mind that I say these things as an old school BIP148 UASF'er. Fuck bcash.

Take me as an example. I've traded alts through 4 bubbles. I only hodl BTC. If I still held those alts, I would have very, very little crypto wealth today. Namecoin, dogecoin, primecoin, mintcoin, blackcoin, whitecoin, protoshares/bitshares, steem, ethereum, ETC, BTC forks. Most were innovative for their time. All were coins that I traded and profited from. LTC is really the only one that still has some decent BTC value today.
Alts are a vehicle to take BTC from those that don't understand this. The tech is great blah blah blah. Doesn't matter, the whales make the waves and cash out when normies buy in.
I honest to god don't even look at alt/USD prices when trading, only alt/btc ratios. Most new alt traders only talk about alt/USD prices. They don't realize the game they are playing.

You should load up on alts then. There are a few good ones with high network capacity. Bitshares has blocks every 3 seconds, and can purportedly handle [100k transactions per second]( Steemit is based on bitshares tech, and can handle similar amounts of traffic. I've been using litecoin to cheaply handle small tx's very successfully.
Here's the reality check though. Lightning will come out in 2018 and solve BTC scalability. Until then, billionaires are going to load up on BTC, and not give a single fuck about a $5-$100 tx fee. Its the network and the brand, man.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:28:06
Not true, if an alt tanks on the BTC ratio when you are holding it, you just lost some BTC value. If you keep some BTC on the lightning network, you cannot lose buying power relative to BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-14 04:22:07
For small amounts you'll buy coins already on the LN, or someone will send you lightning coins. If coinbase has 1000 BTC, they can open a 1000BTC payment channel and send LN coins  to a large number of people without paying additional miner fees. So you can buy 0.00001 BTC from them and it will already be on the lightning network. Once LN is in vogue, new users won't buy layer 1 bitcoin anymore because fees will be too high.
Otherwise, some amount will be eaten by fees when opening the payment channel.
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:30:12
Eh, counterparty has it's own problems. Trying to cram smart contract data into the BTC blockchain isn't the smartest idea. Any kind of mempool spike and your use case is priced out. ETH regularly has huge fee spikes and ETH even has much higher throughput than the BTC chain.
Rootstock is currently running a merge mined chain that boasts 100 tps. This is nowhere near enough throughput for a heavily used global smart contract platform. Storing sinple transaction data on chain is expensive enough when there is fee competition. I'm imagining the final form for specialized smart contracts will end up in layer 2 or layer 3 bitcoin.

Hadn't thought of this before, point taken. There would be more damage from this attack than I implied. Although arguably, the network would still be mostly intact, and since my funds are neither high value or slow moving, I am personally much less vulnerable.
And upon further consideration theymos is technically correct.  There is no mathematical proof that cryptography is secure. But considering the complexity of a 256-bit hash and even atoms in our universe, it follows that that the resources required to forge a practical second preimage attack algorithm is so great that it might as well be impossible. That's where my confidence stems from. Although I will admit that this is more intuition than anything mathematically concrete.

Yes. In a fully mature cryptocurrency marketplace, we will have the option to spend any number cryptocurrencies. Why would we send bitcoin and wait a 10 minutes+ for a single confirmation when we can get 10 confirms in 5 minutes through the mintcoin/blackcoin/etc. blockchains? 
While it is true that we can see transactions propagate through the bitcoin network in real time, it is much more secure to accept mintcoin after 4 confirms than it is to accept bitcoin at 0 confirmations. Once the infrastructure and liquidity is in place, fast confirming coins will be the de facto standard in point of sale transactions. Bitcoin will still be useful as a store of value and a base cryptocurrency.

There really isnt that much congestion compared to the peak in late 2017 (there was a spam attack and all time high cryptocurrency interest, $20-$80 fees).
An extra $0.30 on a $500 transaction isn't very much. Just make sure your customer pays a decent fee, and if he doesn't, make sure to wait for confirmation before supplying your goods/services. Even with a super low fee (2 satoshi/byte, around $0.01) you shouldn't wait longer than a couple weeks for a confirmation.

It doesn't matter where you send from, confirmation takes the same time sending from any wallet (assuming the same fee is used).
It should take on average 10 minutes for a confirmation if the appropriate fee is paid. It could be longer if they dont pay a high enough fee. But you will be able to see the unconfirmed transaction immediately on any block explorer.

Edit: if you wait for at least 1 confirmation, he cannot reverse the transaction to scam you.

SHA256 ASICs are caught up to modern microprocessor development. Bitmain already has 12nm ASICs and Samung and others are coming out with 8nm ASICs soon. If you get a Solar + ASIC heating setup today, I'd wager you'd ROI very quickly and be hash competitive for at least 3-4 years. Your BTC earnings will continually decrease but the BTC price will increase to compensate. And you can always upgrade your ASICs down the road.
GPU miners are also an option if you dont mind dumping shitcoins on semi-shady exchanges.

Long story short, miners include transactions with the highest fee/byte first. So there is a fee competition between users trying to get their transaction included in a block (aka confirmed). There is a bit of network congestion right now, so a low $0.02 fee might take a few days to get confirmed. If someone spends $0.30 on their tx fee, it'll get confirmed next block.
I use this tool to monitor mempool congestion when setting my fees. A bit unintuitive at first but the data is all there.

Your post is a bit misleading. The security of a transaction (how hard it would be to fake a double spend) can be measured in how many hashes were needed to generate the confirmations on the transaction. 
TX security = (network hash rate)\*(number of confirmations)\*(average block interval)
Obviously, litecoin (SCRYPT) and bitcoin (SHA-256) use different hashing algorithms so hashes are not really equivalent. And the average block interval is always changing. But accept these simplifications for ease in explanation.
Bitcoin has a higher hash rate so you are getting more security per confirmation. But litecoin has a faster block interval, so you get more confirmations quicker. Here's the part about your post which is misleading. A litecoin confirmation is decidedly less secure than a bitcoin confirmation. But both BTC and LTC have a 1mb block limit. Since LTC's block rate is 2.5 minutes to bitcoins 10 minutes, there are 4 times as many 1mb blocks being made. This gives litecoin effectively 4x the throughput of the bitcoin network.

For the sake of what you're talking about here, the minimum fee you can give use today (and still provide a non-zero fee) is 1 satoshi. As u/tmornini noted, at $1M coins, 1 satoshi is 1 cent. So the absolute minimum fee would be zero, or 1 cent and increasing with 1 cent granularity.

I bought an $0.80 steam game on G2A today using bitcoin. They use bitpay to process transactions and my tx was accepted in less than a second from my mycelium wallet. In comparison, the damn CC chip reader things take at least 5 seconds.
I paid a $0.12 fee which is high for an $0.80 tx. But if I were sending $100 it would be about 0.1%.
It's expected that in the future the lightning network will minimize on-chain transactions, greatly reducing fees and making grocery store purchases more feasible.

Smart miners, just like whales, don't want to see big red candles when they sell. If they place limit sells rather than market selling, not only will they pay less in fees, but also avoid slippage in price.
There is a large incentive for miners to sell more slowly to prevent dumps and get more cash for their BTC in this illiquid market especially given how thin the margins for miners are.
The big red candles happen when demand at a certain price dries up, or supply overwhelms demand at a certain price. Usually this is from market manipulation from whales, but it can also happen organically.
You are making assumptions about miners dumping their coins that are simply not true.

There probably is very little financial incentive for you to make the switch as bitcoin users are fairly rare and lightning network users are even rarer.
But if you have the time and the enthusiasm to support the ideological foundations that bitcoin was built on (financial sovereignty) then BTCpay is a fantastic option compared to a centralized solution like coinbase. LN is currently in the sort of chicken before the egg adoption phase. More merchants accepting lightning payments will help it reach a critical mass.

Nullc, thank you for taking the time to respond to my post. There are no gods or kings in bitcoin, but in my mind you and few other core devs are as close as it gets. I have a lot of respect for you; so to have you of all people reply to my post is a great honor, and has forced me to reconsider my statement.
But I must stand by what I have said. You're right that bitcoin would not go quietly into the night if SHA256 is broken. There would be a great amount of FUD, infighting, turmoil, parties attempting to wrest control,  you name it. The technical problems this would create for you personally would be immense. But for me as a long term holder, it would just be another blip on the radar. The markets would crash and recover, and bitcoin the protocol would recover stronger than ever having passed another test.
For people entering the market now and people holding short term positions, there is an incredibly small (but still finite) risk that bitcoin cryptography could be broken. And this could affect them greatly financially. But for a long term holder like me, that risk does not exist due to the bitcoin protocol's anti-fragility.

Bitshares encompasses a decentralized asset exchange they call DEX. It is totally decentralized and stored on the bitshares blockchain. You can create an asset (analogous to an ETH ICO) by burning bitshares. Current cost to make a new asset is a few hundred dollars worth of BTS.

Logged in to post this since I felt so strongly.
I hate the shilling and misinformation coming out of as much as the next guy, but you can't deny that is correct. Bitcoin is a decentralized organization. Domain names which are registered via ICANN aren't quite malleable enough to fit the form of a decentralized organization. Certainly, the ideals of bitcoin and information about bitcoin can go on a website. But *Bitcoin* can't own a website since at the end of the day, it is just a group of people administering the website. Bitcoin includes everyone, and we can't all be expected to administer the website. Semantics, anyway...


This is a pretty shameful statement. I understand your beliefs. There's no denying that bitcoin.com is an attack on bitcoin. But your agenda blinds you and that makes you almost as bad as the bcash trolls. Think a little bit the next time you try to censor someone.

@_date: 2017-11-30 08:05:03


After having read this, I automatically stopped reading and dismissed your arguments. You obviously don't know enough about how cryptography works to be making any kind of judgements on bitcoin. The complexity of SHA-256 is so high that, even if you found an elegant mathematical solution, solving the solution is still infeasible due to its complexity. That's check.
And even if SHA-256 is broken through some other hack, we can just change the algorithm from SHA-256 to an algorithm that isn't broken. Check mate.
I would suggest you learn how [SHA-256 works]( to better understand what I am saying. That's 11 minutes of running code. Unbelievable amounts of complexity in a single operation, and bitcoin uses double-SHA256 for most things if I'm not mistaken.

Good to see that finally implemented! Satoshi mentioned blockchain pruning in his original whitepaper
[Page 4 of the whitepaper:](




it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,
transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do
not need to be stored.
A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are
generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in

Pretty good summary except for one thing. The BU unlimited crowd is mostly paid shills working for Jihan Wu, CEO of Bitmain the largest producer of ASIC mining chips. Jihan doesn't want segwit, since it would expose his use of ASICBOOST, which allows him to increase mining efficiency significantly. He has denied this even though the evidence is clear. BU supporters at this point are either paid shills or people not dumb enough to read past Jihans lies.

You should know that Segwit isn't being blocked because of technical skepticism. Segwit has been running on testnet for a long time now without problems. It's being blocked because bitmain's asicminers are exploiting asicboost and segwit is incompatible with covert asicboost.
All the personal attacks, shilling, and general bullshittery is because Jihan doesn't want to lose his asicboost. Everything else is just noise to cover up this fact.

People get really butthurt here about security. They'll tell you to run a full node and get a trezor. IMO for a new user that is totally unnecessary unless you are transacting more than say $200.
If you're just getting $20 or some small payments, a wallet on your mobile phone will give you good enough security so you can get a taste of what this is all about. Search bitcoin wallet on your mobile phones app store, get a high rated one (preferably one that's not by bitcoin.com), and make a wallet. Backup your seed phrase to a physical piece of paper and you're off to the races. 
Once you do that, if you PM me your public key I'll send you some small amount of btc :)
That'll be enough to get your feet wet so you can begin to understand how this stuff works. Good luck!

It's the first mover advantage and a few other things. Bitcoin is a more "sound money" than the other shitcoins. We know it's distribution (21M coins), there wasn't a premine (satoshi's coins don't count as they are most likely lost), and early doubt of the technology created a very diverse and widespread distribution of the initial coins.
Meanwhile ETH for example had a huge premine with devs still holding a massive amount, and is inflationary with no set cap (yet).
No one can deviate from bitcoin's 21M coin spec without creating an altcoin (unless they own 51%+ of hashpower, which is basically impossible at this point). We've experienced Bitcoin's resistance to change first hand with the segwit/Jihan shitstorm last year. Meanwhile, shitcoin dev teams can modify their code to change supply at their whim, create new premines, invalidate coins, etc.
Also bitcoin has the best devs. Pieter Wuille is a god-tier coder, and there are many more that work exclusively on BTC. These guys continue to push the envelope and consistently produce high-quality software.

They apparently stopped updating their repos to keep people from cloning the code and removing ads. It works, but I wouldn't use it for more than a hot wallet for a small amount of funds for that reason.

1. Core is a loosely defined decentralized organization of developers from all around the world. Anyone can contribute to Core.
2. Bitmain is blocking SegWit to reap the benefits of ASICBoost and higher tx fees. Their implementation of bitcoin (bitcoin unlimited and emergent consensus) is [extremely buggy](
So either you've been fooled by blood-sucking Chinese miners, or you're a paid shill (there are a lot of them around here).
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:38:12
txid? I'm betting your fee was too low. If you don't pay a high enough fee, other transactions with higher fees get prioritized and your transaction goes to the bottom of the list, so to speak.

Alright guys, this is our chance. BIP 149 isn't going to activate until July 2018. We can't wait that long. Every day without SegWit is increased tx fees, friction, and more ASICBOOST gains in Jihan's pocket. Imagine how many miners he will have in 2018. There's no way we will be able to UASF then. If we go down that road it will force a POW change which will be arguably more destructive.
I don't have any mining equipment but I will support the BIP148 UASF in every way I can.
1. Running a BIP148 full node now until the deploy date. I will compile and run binaries, not just signal. [Guide here](
2. Upvote UASF posts and raise awareness. This includes commenting here and in other places to educate about and rally for BIP148.
There are also other ways to get involved: by tweeting and reaching out to miners and exchanges we can garner support for BIP148 and end Jihan Wu's reign of terror! BIP148! UASF NOW!

Every transaction has a unique txid. Since the bitcoin blockchain is public, if you post the txid we can use it to see your transaction and its properties (I'm mainly interested in the fee amount). The txid for your transaction should be listed somewhere in your wallet.  
@_date: 2016-05-23 18:35:36

Core is not the same as blockstream (many different people and organizations contribute to core, not just blockstream). Bitcoin unlimited is buggy software, and the core scaling solution (segwit) is being blocked by the chinese miner pushing bitcoin unlimited (see Jihan Wu and Asicboost).

Hey, not sure. Your transaction was [not broadcast to the network]( You might try resending it. Your BTC from this tx should not have left your wallet but you may have to reload your wallet software.

It was more of a "cold wallet" since funds could supposedly be transferred automatically to the hot wallet. That's not a cold wallet to me. Coinbase is light years ahead in their security. I would argue that coinbase security is safer than your average user's fat fingers. Grandma should not be in charge of her private key. It's much safer to have coinbase hold these coins for her because the chances of her fucking up somewhere are quite high. However, if you are technically adept, holding your own coins as an n of m paper wallet in multiple safes is *marginally* more secure.
But like you said, people can do what they want :)

Lost a bit, and then recouped enough to break even! Deposits and withdrawals work perfect, congrats on your launch.

There are a few trading subs. Notably:
Careful trading. Most newbies lose all their money before learning that holding generally works more reliably than trading (myself included, lol). Some advice: put some in cold storage that you never touch. Have a small trading stash that you would still be ok, even if you get liquidated. Set clear targets and stop losses, and stick to them. Manage your bankroll. Good luck.

I don't know about selling, but have you thought about melting it into bullets to kill werewolves and take their treasure?

thanks for the dank bot, that should pay for some ln withdrawals

I'd love to give the bot a spin.
Cheers OP

It's going to be a breath of fresh air without all the shills. Although lately they seemed to have died down somewhat. There was a month or 2 there where the shills were like 50-70% of all the posts. It was maddening. That said, I think this guy is probably just a troll.

If you're waiting for an ACH, those aren't your Bitcoin yet, so you're not responsible for those BTC yet. As long as your other coins are all off exchanges ��
Anyone else a fan of mental gymnastics?

Here's some sats towards that exercise bike

I like to keep my AMD 290X miners below 80C. 85C is okay, but you can assume they will last a very long time below 80C. 
I burned out an old card (AMD HD6950) mining consistently above 90C. Learned my lesson there.
YMMV with nVidia cards, but silicon is silicon. Keep that shit below 85 if you want it to last a while.
Also I'm assuming you're mining ETH or ETC since they are currently the most profitable coins. If you're mining BTC with a GPU, you might as well be lighting money on fire.
EDIT: Read about nicehash. Just mine ETH and sell for BTC, you'll make more money.

I've traveled all over the lower 48 and poloniex doesn't seem to mind. This is in the last 8 months. Might be careful if you are trying to login from a prohibited state though (Washington), although it shouldn't matter too much since they only care about residency.

BTCPay is a great idea because it is built with LN payments in mind. You probably have your favourite alt, but on-chain payments, BTC, ETH, or otherwise, just aren't feasible once large sections of the population start transacting with crypto.
If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry

Not your keys, not your coins. They do this because the tax authorities want to make sure they are getting their cut.
If you had the keys, you could send to whoever you goddamn pleased. That's why BTC independence day this January 3rd is so symbolically important. Control your keys, and you dont have to bow down to these cunts.

Nobody has mentioned it, so I'll chime in. Short of getting a hardware wallet like ledger, paper wallets are your best bet.
I like [this open source wallet generator]( a lot. Source code is [here](
And make sure to choose segwit or segwit (bech32) to save on fees.
Print a couple copies of your paper wallet and put them in plastic bags somewhere safe. Withdraw with your favorite QR code reading android/ios wallet when the time comes.
Merry Christmas and happy bitcoining my atheist guy/gal.
Edit: make sure you read the beginners guide and security tips on the left bar. These tips will help keep you from losing your coins, and are good tips to keep in mind even if you go a different route than paper wallets.
