Also asked them a few days ago...very much looking forward to this, got a special project coming up that I'd like to share with this community

Let me add: so far I couldn't find a good solution to handle bitcoin pre-orders. I communicated with [Celery]( Bitcoin integration is on their radar but not production ready yet. However if you can prove your contribution of roughly €19 value (estimated by the time of manufacturing, worldwide shipping included) by sending a message signed by your address, I will send a copy for sure.

I wrote my story [here]( with these prices I made more money now from 2011 btc donations than all my records sales combined...(edit: from labels, physical, everything)

:) tried to hook it up on coinDL but they're slow...i'll send any of them on a pay what you want basis, just email me (you can [sign a message with your btc sending address](

^ I put an address there a few days ago, it's not related. The point of this is different though. People who invested some significant amounts even in the last days surely made more profit.
Let's put it this way - the donations I received weren't much, but now it's worth more than what I owed on rent at the time. In theory, I could use it to move to a cheaper country in Europe and live for 5-6 months and focus on creating music. Maybe I'll do that. Either way it stays in or goes towards funding the music. That's the beauty of the whole thing.

I haven't had an address on my site, just set up one recently there when I got back into BTC. The donations came through separate services.
Edit: 
Check this out, one example, experimenting back late 2011
