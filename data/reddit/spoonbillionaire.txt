No kangaroo ever gets killed for their hide, they are all killed for the cull with a high powered bullet to the head. No ouch. The hide is a tertiary waste product which would otherwise rot in the bush.

Correct!! The fur of the brushtail possum which decimates forests in NZ is also very unique as it has a hollow structure. Yarn spun from a blend of wool and possum fur is claimed to be at least twice as warm as pure wool.

As far as I can see it basically is done on a per transaction basis. The buyer contacts me once the sale is put through to initiate the bitcoin transaction. It's pretty rudimentary but at least it's there as an option. Just choose 'other' at checkout.

Those products are a result of bovine farming too, which destroys vast expanses of native ecosystems and is being expanded all the time. Kangaroos live in the wild and are not farmed. they are hunted to a quota because their numbers are unsustainable due to crop farming creating tremendous breeding grounds through land clearing. The leather is lighter, stronger and more resistant to wear than any other leather on earth, and it's recovered from waste.

A fellow scrotum fan!! They are magnificent but I'm only a consumer not a producer unfortunately. I've seen some beautiful roo scrotes in my time, if I can find a perfect specimen I'll let you know!!

Kangaroos are killed as they are a pest in Australia. The skin is collected and turned into leather as it would otherwise go to waste. There are a lot of misconceptions about kangaroo leather just like there are misconceptions about bitcoin.
