3. Close short position
4. Leave private keys easily accessible, "Oops, you got me!"
5. Once they leave disappointed, buy back in.

Microtransactions are a solution in search of a problem. We already have a tried and tested platform in the form of credit cards. It's fast, convenient, idiot proof, and already has mass-adoption. Consumers get points for using them and have the resources of a megacorporation at their disposal to ensure that merchants have to make good on their sale. The absolute best case scenario is that merchants might start offering a 3% discount for paying in cash/crypto.  
Aside from a theoretical store of value, where blockchain transactions really shine is in international trade where you get crushed on exchange rates and bank transfer fees. Paypal and Venmo sort of work but are relatively expensive. If bitcoin can get a handle on the volatility issue, it would be an excellent medium to buy things across borders.

Yes, it sucks for the merchants, but its excellent for consumers. The only way consumers are going to prefer to use bitcoin is if they are offered a significant discount, because there are no other advantages. But there are plenty of downsides like lack of charge protection, no points back, the relative complexity of use, and tax event headaches.

I seem to recall receiving a bitcoin tip many years ago but I have no idea how to find it, and I never claimed it. Is there a straightforward way to find it?

But why would you ever agree to lend money for less in the first place? Seems like you'd be better off just holding the cash.
