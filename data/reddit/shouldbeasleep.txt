No, as soon as that set amount goes through the limit is lifted. So you spend that $800 something through the ACH method, whenever that money is moved from your bank and the bitcoin deposited into your account the limit is lifted. I didn't check my bank account to see when my funds were withdrawn I just saw the money in coinbase and my limit lifted.

Ah yeah I had to do the same. Now after that you've got to wait x amount of days. I'm at a 27 day wait

Funding your USD wallet gives you the highest immediate limit. Otherwise you'll just have to request to have the limits raised. I'm thinking the highest checking account limit that you can immediately get to is like 5k. But you have to provide documentation

Yeah you can raise it up. Look around your accounts page or on the buy page. It should say "x of weekly limit remaining" and there should be a link to increase it. You have to provide social security number, drivers license, address, ect. to get it raised higher

I understand and agree. Offline storage is a no brainer.  I haven't bought yet, still trying to figure out how i would move the coins from coinbase to a cold storage method

Yeah I've been reading up about it this morning. The 1:1 split seems like it wouldn't be bad, just sell the B2X coins right away and pocket the cash. But I'm still trying to read and figure out if it actually is that easy.

Right, sorry. The keys. Generating the keys. There's so much i want to ask but posting from my phone is a pain in the ass. Guess it'll have to wait till after work

Thanks! I really appreciate the openness. I expected to be bombarded with "read the wiki idiot"
