I would just put a disclaimer when checking out with Bitcoin as a payment method that refunds will be given via Bitcoin at the current equivalent exchange rate in USD and make them check a box.
This is a great concern though since I can see how this would be a sticking point with some people who like having credit card companies for chargebacks on large ticket items.
My thought is that with Bitcoin the retailer/seller has control of the returns process due to the whole irrevocability thing.
We use Coinbase and are verified, so if we needed to add Bitcoins to refund someone it would take a day plus 10 minutes (still faster than a Credit card refund)
@_date: 2014-12-26 05:59:50

The problem is people who want to take advantage of this deal who don't already own bitcoin can't do so since Coinbase takes so long to get setup. Hopefully circle fixes this.
If we can get the people over at Slickdeals on board, then Newegg will probably keep offering deals like this and consumer adoption will grow as well. That being said this is a really good price on PS4, sad I missed the Xbox one deal.

Looks like just they are testing it right now, but this would be absolutely huge. It makes sense for Intuit to add this to their CC processing services and will give them a huge advantage in that space.

Bitcoin will be more advantageous for merchants initially. Expect the savings to eventually be passed on to the consumer.
Merchants should be able to offer a 1-2% discount at a minimum and still come out ahead.
Tigerdirect recently did 20 dollars off 100 dollar or more Bitcoin purchases. That money came out of their own cost savings. It probably has a lot to do with the fact they don't have to worry about fraud which costs retailers billions every year.

Raise takes 15% off the purchase price, I am guessing fold is much more efficient (no chargebacks or processing fees) since they take Bitcoin. Fold also probably buys in bulk, since they are the ones selling the cards not 3rd parties.
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:35:06
Absolutely. They take a small fee to serve as the intermediary.

@_date: 2016-02-21 19:25:36
It's because in the USA, pretty much any decent credit card gets 1-2% in points or cash back, so I guess Paypal doesn't make a distinction between EU and USA customers. Since EU customers don't get these incentives due to the Cap on processing fees.
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:21:13
Also he only provided this his code to insiders, Antminer was sold to us plebs as the only competitive home miner. This is an aside from blocking the overwhelming majority of people who want segwit.

At least he actually left. He has skills so he moved on to another project. Investors like Ver don’t have any skill so they invest in altcoins and attack Bitcoin 24/7.

I PM'ed you but someone had a theory that it was a padding error caused in between version .0.5.14 and .0.5.15
I am having the same AES error, it could be that it is a small typo when you entered it or the padding error, unfortunately I can't get .0.5.14 any longer. The bottom of this Github thread gives the guys theory.

Gemini has a really thin order book. That could be a blessing though, I had some really low buy orders at Buttercoin when  they were a thing, someone did a market sell wiped out the order book and I picked up ~2 90 dollar bitcoins.
With those amounts the order book is not a huge deal.

I lost a good amount due to Vinnys proclamation that Bitcoin was headed to 800. I made it back on Litecoin. After the fact he mentioned he started trading alts as well. Don't know bout that guy anymore.

Because they don't pay the transaction fees and in the case of Overstock they hold some of the Bitcoin which has made them a huge amount of passive income.

Ugh, at least last year Newegg offered some Bitcoin exclusive deals, this year all I see is a landing page with an email request box. 
I wish vendors just accepted Bitcoin and passed a portion of the savings on to the consumer, like Overstock, Cardcash and other vendors said they would, so we could just shop as per usual on Black Friday. /rant.

They're trying to pump Dash, as is Roger, they don't care about Bitcoin. "Heart of the resistance" my ass. They had some woman on two weeks ago who told them Roger said he's lying to people all the time and he doesn't care, they're sellouts.

To me, it wasn't exactly positive. The author basically bashed GBTC. Claimed Bitcoin is easily replaceable and failed to mention that people might want exposure to the tax savings of a retirement account. 
He also claimed it is extremely volatile, which, even some pop starlet pointed out wasn't the case during Brexit. It's understandable that he probably doesn't visit everyday.
