Exactly, they won't have it all at once, but I still can't see the long term ROI.  I mean they must have a reason, but what is that based on?

Insurance is kind of an odd thing here because Bitcoin is not considered currency in the US so FDIC / CUNA would not be relevant.  It would be a policy covering property and the assessment would be based on the risk.  Therefore if it is more secure (yet potentially more difficult to access) then the insurance rates would be lower.
Xapo has a good institutional wallet system.  Is it good for consumers?  Maybe, maybe not.  Time will tell.

Agreed.  That is the odd part.  I see the expenses but not the revenue.  You may have the only key right there: Marketing.  $40Million makes a splash and they probably have side investments that will benefit.

If it was obvious then multiple people would not have asked.  Obviously missing their target market if they are looking to get Bitcoin newbies as it appears.

The site YOU referenced says that the transaction volume is: $46,482,617.94 not $60M.
If they do 10% of ALL transactions then that is $4.6M but that is just the transactions so if their fees are 4% (which there are not charging fees, they are only charging $15 for each card and no fees) then you get about $6.7M a year gross if they are actually able to account for 10% of ALL Bitcoin transactions.  If one figures that their margin is 50% then that is $3.35M a year or over a hundred years for their expected return of 10:1.
Try being nicer, it helps with this thing humans like to do called dialogue.

Yes I noticed that right away.  You actually have to do some digging to see what CoinJar is.  Then when you do find out it is still rather ambiguous.

Agreed. It is going to take time. As one who owns a company that is releasing a virtual card here soon, there is a lot that goes into it that people simply don't understand.
1) you have to develop a system that works with the current closed system
2) you are bound by the existing system's rules and fees
3) at the same time you have to develop in such a way that you can move to exchange methods of the future seamlessly as the market for a Bitcoin card is simply not enough to make a living off of
I can almost guarantee you that xapo is losing money on this just to gain market share.

Only saw the first set of fees and they were on par with cnx. I think the first product is a fiat conversion virtual card that is like 2.50 + some percentage (2% maybe) to fill.  The next step from that is the refillable cards (gprs) which will be about the same I assume. 
The direct debit cards which are a few months off - probably about the same time xapo launches in the US - didn't have a fee schedule yet but I do know that they are going slow based on what works at each level. I believe the main reason for this is to determine the best side chain to implement.
The movement on these things has to be slow to stay in compliance and to be honest visa is not hip to it all just yet. Rushing implementation is a sure way to get black listed.
And it is a U.S. based company ... for now.

Don't worry alternatives are coming. Though nothing will be perfect and it will take time to get it 100% right it will get there eventually.
There is another company launching soon that is taking it a bit slower and has zero investors other than its owners.
Can't disclose the name yet but it will have secure wallets (with deep freeze storage better than xapo) and virtual cards at release with a physical card soon thereafter.  
I am only saying this because I get to try the prototype this week sometime.
Xapo is fine, they just tried to release too much too soon. That happens. People need time to adjust to new ideas, new fees, etc.

I don't know.  We have been working on a similar product with zero money.  The hard part is the intermediaries as banks will not touch funds from bitcoin sources.  That said, I think what we are doing is currently not as functional (and only in alpha -though we have done a proof of concept and have all of the legal bits in place) but we may wind up being the poor man's alternative.
The key is not what process is being used but how easy it is to use.  That is what is going to put bitcoin in the mainstream.  How easy is it to get and how easy is it to use?

Totally agree with you. That ad gave me a headache. The person that directed it should be put into a locked room and forced to watch it over and over again.
