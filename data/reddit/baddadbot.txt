Hi wondering if that's why. it also saved me tho lol. looks like gemini is 500/day and cash app is 2500 for the first month after you create an account, but apparently it goes up somewhat the more time you have it. so like 3k + 500/day max investment through non sketchy places instantly as far as i can tell., I'm dad.
