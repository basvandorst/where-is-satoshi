The "leftist" reactions were almost exactly the same back then as now. What age are you if I may ask? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:54:06
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:23:06
Supercool! Thanks for this answer!!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:04:22
Back then people were claiming he would start WW3, Bruce Springsteen threatened to leave the country...  Same shit different president.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:37:27
:-) Yeah!!! 
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:32:45
I still don't see how value is taken from the wrong people.. Can you explain?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:06:14
That's what they said about Reagan
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:33:13
easily tracable
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:05:51
I thought it was common knowlegde.. Ill look it up
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:07:52
Nope.. more on how the previous poster sees that happening. Most of their wealth is not in the sock drawer in dollars. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:36:48
I will hold you responsible for debacle then! :-P
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:36:46
Heheh.. I want to start using the real thing.. Did testnet ages ago.

Most value is in property (housing, shares in a company, etc. etc.) And that will not change by switching currency type.

Did they stole it from the Dutch?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:49:37


What? You are not leftist!!! :-) That is the biggest difference between left and right... Leftist is bigger government involvement.. Right is free market.. point. Liberals are not leftists!!! Not right as well.. It is not a left-rigth wing thing.

@_date: 2018-01-04 15:52:35
Pay back time no doubt yes.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:19:27
LN looks promising but some mathematicians have burned it down already as well.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:23:23
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:41:48
Still traceable, bitcoin mixers don't work.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:50:16
That was the best thing that could have happened to bitcoin.  A lot of people and organisations (98%+) came to that settlement. A group of about 2% people decided to f**k with the 98%.  Now it will end badly unless LN will be active and used.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:13:04


Calling it AI doesn't make it AI.

Trade it where? On what exchange?
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:11:24
OMG you are right.. They have no KYC.. Amazing.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:01:10

@_date: 2017-12-27 12:16:23
Is there already a way to use this for real? Or just only testnets?
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:57:11
Nearly free?
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:47:16
Is this the real network or the test network?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:46:33
thumbs up! :-)
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:15:51
I would love 100k price swings tho :-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:45:23
i agree
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:32:46
It can be a workaround for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:50:46
you just won more
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:28:35
Does it show the private key??
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:55:41
That.. And you can get bitcoin up to 1 million with just 1$ and two people.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:28:07
Isn't going short in Bitcoin futures the same as shouting "It's a bubble!!" from the sideline?
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:09:03
Surely zero fee exists. You can put 0 fee. (some wallets don't offer this options it seems) You just have to hope some miner will become empathic and include your zero fee transaction in a block. Or wait until the mempool is empty.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:57:15
What is fungible and why is it important.. I dont understand google result
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:04:50
I think they will send you a QR code.. and you click yes. You have to have money in a channel upfront tho. Which makes it a bit sucky as you will still have to pay the $20 fee to get it there, you can send more money but it will be locked for a certain number of days. I personally think we still need bigger blocks as well on bitcoin. High fees indicate backlog for miners. And someone will always be last in line even if fees are 5000$.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:04:18
I bought the peak at 430$ :-(
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:54:14
Will the blocksize decrease once we will hardly use it?
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:14:49
You are probably projecting 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:55:30
Can you do something for the people in Venezuela? I seriously doubt bitcoin is helping them. We need to send food. What is the cost of a charter plane? Anyone?

I get a Civilization feeling with the switch to a new system and where we get a couple of turns anarchy..
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:11:35
technically.. not politically.. :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:31:45
TBH I am less worried, it seems selling 1000 hardly affects the price. At least no big price drops. I also don't have issue with price suppression to avoid overheating. It will go up anyway in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:56:48
yeah right.. first part.. second part... super
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:42:43

If you start buying in at that price and want a 1000, price will go up fast. We all HODL.

It will not be there... It is off chain right. Or am I missing your point?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:17:44
Something else. My ideal world.. Taxes are needed. Fact of life. But.. Let's not pay income tax.. or wealth tax.. Just VAT. Sooooo much easier.  Has to be done globally tho. Superfair. The more you waste/use the more you pay. If you don't want to pay a lot of tax.. save on spending. Good for the world. (I am not a greenie hehe)
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:27:36
If I was f**ed like that I would not either.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:06:42

@_date: 2017-12-27 12:50:03
"Soon, I am quite certain that we will refer as locked to those outputs that are NOT in channels"
I was starting to think the same thing.

@_date: 2017-12-27 17:07:55
Or less
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:00:20
We still need bigger blocks to lower fees indeed.

Don't try zero fee.. I waited a week once.. Just wait for the mempool to go down..  thinking
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:08:02
interesting.. but i have no clue if it is true.. can anyone confirm?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:08:06
So if you own 100k you have to add 4k as income and pay 30-50% tax on it
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:50:54
It was only X2 for this round..  So that word "constantly" would be a weird answer to my question. They could have gone with X2 and then lightning.. And if centralization would be an issue reverse the X2 when lightning was ready.

one or two beers generally makes your access to memory better.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:47:08
Shitty thing is.. As long as there is congestion some transactions will takes weeks. No matter the fee. Someone is always last in line.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:15:27
When more people own bitcoin there is no reason for big price swings... They will decrease.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:37:49
Crypto noob! lololol
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:02:50
same question! :-)
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:52:48
Miners are not doing their best..  They are just doing 1 block per ~10 minutes. As they should!  ..Bitcoin is unusable so less people do transactions. That is causing it
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:04:36
We can ICO ourselves.. I don't see a problem there. But I am not an economist. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:11:50
when the value you own grows to 200k you have to add 8k to your income and pay 40-50% tax of 8k
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:42:31
Miners also mine for block reward. Fee is extra because there are too many transactions waiting. Miners seem to mine Bitcoin Cash as well, without or little fee. I think I used Multibit wallet when I sent the transaction with 0 fee. If I send money from myself to myself I don't need quick confirmation. I trust myself. I use low or no fee. It just takes ages. (On bitcoin :-( )
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:02:13
HLOD on!!!!
@_date: 2018-09-19 16:58:46
Is it? Do I have to something else? It still shows as version 160200
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:17:54
This is from what I understand so far.. But I don't see lightning network as a bad thing yet.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:16:20
The only demand there is now is the increase in value for BTC and other crypto's
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:28:26
Propaganda.. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:52:26
Do we need that whole bitcoin thing then? :-P
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:24:05
Why not make it 512Kb then???? To make it more decentralised? Is 1MB the super duper sweet spot?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:59:13
ouch.. US sucks for that lol... Here capital gains are not taxed.. just the capital  is taxed
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:24:23
Yes.. you are right..  I downvoted myself :-)
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:23:42
It needs a "make invoice" option!!! :-) So I can transfer from one iphone to another.
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:52:50
It looks like my sync was only taking a few minutes? Is that possible?
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:52:20
Went shopping and now all is ok. I am guessing the time for opening a channel requires a few block confirmations? The sync did not take long at all.
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:58:47
I have received funds from the faucet, and an open channel..
But I can't "pay invoice" yet. Is that becasue of the sync?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:07:46
Lightning network seems every easy to use.. Maybe we will have 512 KB blocks soon again.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:40:39

@_date: 2019-02-12 23:37:13
What exactly is good news?
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:25:09
Blockchain... Blockchain can potentially crush Bitcoin. (Other currencies among them.)
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:23:51
No it is not.
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:32:59
I assume you all exist..
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:09:33
why? (management summary pls)
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:26:04
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:27:21
My prediction is: At 10k it will fall back to 6k.. and then move to 15k
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:08:39
Dont think so
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:17:12
price increase ok, but speed is scary... also adoption pls pls
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:09:27
And then there were altcoins... &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:22:10
That is exactly what I don't understand.. If it would not have impact long term..And technically not a problem. Why not just implement it anyway 2-3 years ago? Just to keep one Bitcoin because I think that would have prevented the bcash fork..  ? It would have kept both parties happy and more technical improvents could be done later.. One of them possibly downscale the blocksize again if that would help.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:06:20
Your logic is totaly deranged.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:56:14
HODL.. even when it dies. I have other HODL crypto's. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:38:58
I think new coiners should HODL and old coiners should spend and beg everywhere to accept bitcoin. That is good for all and also good for adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:16:38
So nothing wrong with S2X without bugs? I never understood the fuss
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:54:45
Wouldn't it be better to hodl them?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:01:14
Why would they sell off?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:07:51
I was always wondering what held bitcoin back.. So no..
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:15:25
not me

@_date: 2018-03-05 13:18:39
That's about the same people said to me in march 2017 when I predicted 20k in 2017
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:08:02
Depends on when LN will become available. But 50K should be possible.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:24:24
Yes he is. So am I. (At least that is my theory :-) )
Giving discount will increase your number of customers and increase BTC price WAY WAY more than when people just HODL.
It will push new people into BTC because they prefer discount over fiat without discount. And the retailer is faster on his way to the moon.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:28:05
I consider this fakenews.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:55:13
No It is not the guess.. My guess is way less.. But.. I would not be surprised if it would go to 200k. I was pretty amazed by the 1200% increase in 2017. And with LN on the corner that is a good catalyst.
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:22:11
I assume at some point retailers will give 25-50% discount when paid with bitcoin and then the ball starts rolling..
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:56:51
Good start anyway :-)
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:36:02
I don't think it works that way..
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:43:38
Well that is all fine but the most important thing is that it will draw more people into BTC who want discount which will drive the BTC acceptation and price up more than without discount.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:24:58
I predicted this mid 80's :-)  I have no proof though haha
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:02:59
Is there any economic reason we need banks for something other than store of value/payment system? (which can be replaced by crypto currencies) Am I missing something? Anyone with an economics background who can answer?
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:18:12
I couldn't say it better.  But that is what I meant.  Thanks :-)
And when retailers give discount, people will want bitcoin to pay with. etc etc hence the ball starts rolling.. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:33:18
Girl... you thought he was a man....
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:39:45
bitcoin version 0.16 failed? O my..   
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:08:49
I would not be surprised if it goes 200k+ this year though. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:07:25
I think it's more a lesser of two evils thing.
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:52:59
on the other hand... look at the piccie ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:53:33
The more hodlers the merrier...
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:01:54
If so Bitcoin has no purpose and should die..
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:43:47
The rest of the moms probably don't even know what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:09:54
Actually.. The idea sucks as there is no additional incentive for the retailer who starts giving discount. Ah well..
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:38:09
Normally stocks start at wall street, then the buying spree spreads out to the normal people. But in Bitcoin it started with nerds, then their colleagues now their moms but wall street is just getting in so no popping yet
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:35:09
Well.. I don't see it that way..
