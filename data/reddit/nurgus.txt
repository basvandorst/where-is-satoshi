I'm just curious about what you mean. Are you talking local drug dealer, internet or what?

How is it easier to get prescription drugs here than anywhere else? Why would most of us even know about that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:40:36
Dollars, euros etc.

We're living in the greatest age of exploration there's ever been. We're plumbing the depths of reality like never before.
Get your thumb out of your arse and join in.

Basically the first world with a few tiny exceptions. And 'murica.

Judging by other comments, you get what you pay for?

If they've made it to 2018 without knowing what a computer is then they're probably a lost cause.

I think maybe cut your losses and don't bother trying to explain bitcoin to them.

I have savings in pounds sterling and bitcoin. What's the difference?
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:19:32
Savings accounts in the UK have fuck all interest right now. Someone could easily create a bitcoin savings account with interest tomorrow if they felt like it because it's just another currency.

How on earth would any casino make money fairly?

You can only take it back if they don't take it first.

Why would a website going down affect my Bitcoin stash ?
@_date: 2019-10-11 09:24:42
In the UK I can get a terminal for £100 upfront, 1.75% per transaction and no monthly or per transaction fees. 
Or rates less than 1% with a monthly payment.
0.35 and 3.5% is ridiculous.

Running a physical exchange is much more expensive than online, it's obviously going to carry overheads.

Also no security worries with cards. Bank note can be forged or robbed. Card payments are in the bank already.

I run a retail business in the UK. We take zero risk on face to face card payments if we follow the recommended procedures.
I haven't had a single chargeback upheld against me in all my years of business.
Mail order is a different conversation.
@_date: 2019-02-03 15:18:05
I made this. 
@_date: 2019-04-23 00:08:03
That doesn't sound right. Got a source?
*Edit: Huh. Swimming pool is a bit small but not by as much as I imagined.*

ITT: People who don't realise that a discount for paying in a different currency without specifying an exchange rate is meaningless.
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:38:22
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:32:50
Oh, hey didn't realise you were into bitcoin.
That makes it 8.
@_date: 2018-12-13 12:40:07
OH MY GOD,  FRANCE! wait, why are we shouting ?
@_date: 2018-12-13 12:38:28
BTC, Beer, Tea or Coffee ?
@_date: 2018-12-13 12:36:33
What? You have to pay 25%?
@_date: 2018-12-13 12:37:21
20% discount to use another currency makes no sense if the bar is setting the exchange rate.
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:15:49
Me too. "I wish I'd bought at the dip" says no one, ever,  during a dip.
