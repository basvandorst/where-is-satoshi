$5? Really? It wouldn't be an issue if it were $5.
I just got a quote that it would be $3k to accelerate a transaction....

Ha. Really? Why is Ethereum so large then?
Tech + distribution = a market. Not tech alone.

I didn’t say it was good...

This was my point.
In the case of Eth, some tech + clever distribution = market.

Interesting. Is this LDA?

I have this in the post.
I do doubt that they would walk away though. I would be better to be a piece of infrastructure in the cryptocurrency that can take a % of all transactions than to cut and run with the $50m in reserves.

Exactly. Especially for a 7% return.

I talk about this at the bottom of the post.

Are you trying to pull out ETH? They shut their ETH node down a few days ago, so maybe its still down.
