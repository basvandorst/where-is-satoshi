That TRON one made me lol.
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:36:48
Nothing really.
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:11:32
If this is the mentality of the sub Ive lost all hope.
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:54:10
The amount of upvotes this bullshit post has shows the current mentality of the market. We're in for one hell of a crash.
@_date: 2018-09-17 09:04:37
Maybe it really is time to use r/btc
@_date: 2018-08-02 18:05:48
I'll never understand you bcash users mindset. Its always about something something closer to original whitepaper something something co exsist.
 If your coin is called Bitcoin random name generator and you can tell the world that it is the original bitcoin although it couldnt use its original name.. You're on the same level as the anti-vaccinators. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 04:27:08
rekted rektum.
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:40:21
Its post like this that show we're going to dip again.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:23:15
So you're a nobody.
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:08:30
That dudes face. He looks so defeated. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:39:48
lol us dollar topping extremely likely.

6th theory.
@_date: 2018-08-04 04:30:00
Everyone seems to be pretty greedy these few months.
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:21:19
We get that the profit was in the same period of time.
Has binance cashed out the profit though? Or is their profit still in terms of crypto?
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:38:23
Never invest money that you need. Nobody knows if the market is going to go up or down. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:37:57

Incase you guys didnt know OP is a bitcoin cash Advocate. The amount of upvotes here is retarded.

Hello. Its real and working today.

Which means bitcoin will never hit 1 million dollars by 2020.
@_date: 2018-06-07 05:03:48
I actually want Bitcoin to increase blocksizes slightly just as a big fuck you to bcash.
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:13:58
no it wont.
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:52:56
there is no such thing as bitcoin core.
@_date: 2018-06-17 10:15:56
We're back.
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:44:31
Anger stage.

You know we can see your account history right? Stop trying to promote your garbage coin all day.

Why would it be Irreparably Damage?
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:00:53
lol bitcoin hotline. Anyone going to break it to him?
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:54:11
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:02:18
People sell when they notice people like you in the market.
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:06:10
We probably wont see a drop below 6k. Triple Bottom.
Then again..
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:57:47
Bitcoin Stable coin.

@_date: 2018-06-18 18:49:05
Yes? Because it solves them problems of hyper inflated currencies?
@_date: 2019-08-08 08:32:21
Damn, those sure are some high fees.
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:47:28
I wish. =(
@_date: 2019-08-20 02:37:13
@_date: 2019-08-19 06:15:35
Oh, it could definitely fail. Lots of intelligent people have made many mistakes.  
Buy what you can with a strategy and stick with it. Just be careful.
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:37:43
Stop it please. Its already dead! Queue Simpson's meme. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:49:02
Not that great of an event but nice exposure.

"This has never happened to me and I've been using coinbase for YEARS.m. I don't know what everyone else is complaining about. Their just spreading FUD." /s
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:20:57
How about you stop trying to scam people with your shitcoin. Eh its okay. No one is that stupid anyway. Looks like all your post don't get enough attention anyway.
@_date: 2018-06-20 11:23:02
If this isnt relatively stable.. I dont think you want to know when things get volatile.. 
@_date: 2019-08-05 05:52:17
The amount of shitpost on this sub is too damn high.
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:45:32
Doesn't matter how high your rates are if no one is buying from your overpriced ATM.
I can get it cheaper with my phone.
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:55:45
Don't know if you're trolling or just a little off. Everyone here has already told you that bitcoin.com is a fake website.
Use bitcoin.org
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:26:53
This is how the headline actually reads.. 
Real estate is preferred to bitcoin for investments by nearly 80%.
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:49:41
Oh yes, it's very profitable for the gas station to have the machine there. Not very profitable for the ATM owner though.
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:50:41
So is your computer and so is Bitcoin. Point is?
@_date: 2019-06-01 14:53:07
The thing about such attacks is that you can see them coming from a mile away. The coin with the lesser hash rate are always attacked first. Mainly because it will be a lot more profitable. Which is mostly what these attacks are for anyway. Profit.
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:44:53
Now I'm getting even more bearish...
@_date: 2019-06-01 06:40:51
Oh damn. You guys are really next level.
@_date: 2019-06-01 03:13:59
They actually don't.
@_date: 2019-06-01 04:30:49
Name me one blockchain right now that is slower than Bitcoin? In the top 20.
Denying the problem won't make Bitcoin better.
@_date: 2019-06-01 06:28:49
Yeah I thought so. I don't care about these maxilist. Or about bcash. But damn these people saying that these fees are good are the root of the problem.
@_date: 2019-06-01 03:18:13
Guys, I don't like BCH as much as the next guy. But if you think these fees aren't a problem, you aren't good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:48:39
There are countries where you don't need to pay Capital gains.
@_date: 2019-06-01 03:15:09
It would still send for cheaper on any other blockchain. Bitcoin has the highest fees on any blockchain.
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:12:54
Technically.. they are both great for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-01 12:29:51
If you're going to be brainwashed all your life then that's on you.
@_date: 2019-06-01 04:50:29
Right so ETH, LTC and BCH are all not decentralized. Alright I get it. Let's just pay the high fees then.
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:18:32
The whole sub right here.
@_date: 2019-06-01 12:45:07
Safe from being usable right now as well. Dude I love Bitcoin. But tell me with a straight face these confirmation times and fees are worth it.
@_date: 2019-04-29 02:23:39
Why are they paying in ETH?
@_date: 2019-04-14 04:25:13
Probably not. It would have been much much easier for one of them to slip up if it was a group of people.
@_date: 2019-04-13 04:58:03
Can the real Satoshi, please stand up.
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:38:06
MySpace. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:51:36
Just the student loans.
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:06:34
Dont think money means much to him at this point. He's like looking for validation from his friends and followers. Which is unfortunatly being overshadowed.
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:28:00
Under what circumstances is there a need for emergency bitcoin? And that it could not be purchased by themselves.
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:29:18
What's Bitcoin core?
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:38:15
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:26:54
I feel sorry for the guy. At every turn he's just being completely destroyed. At this point he just wants some recognition, nothing else matters more to him. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 01:57:00
Huh. My cat just told me the same thing! 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:41:06
Cause the truth is, most people arent holding. It's just a meme.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:53:39
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:41:25
Can someone give me 7000 USD too?
@_date: 2018-02-18 11:33:33
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:16:54
Cause there isnt a clear explaination. Traders are scared and are no longer willing to risk it putting their foot forward.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:45:36
Wait... You're serious.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:48:46
So.. you have no values? 
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:25:15
No 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:04:30
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:45:00
I'm very sure he never sold any of his Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:48:43
I don't think OP understands what "lambo" means in this context..
But if you want to buy an actually Lambo, go ahead and buy an actual Lambo.
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:29:07
Thats usually what corrections are.
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:55:53
What correction?
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:07:02
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:14:35
Actually true. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:14:59
Pee on them for dominance.
