What happens if 5% becomes 50% of your assets?
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:46:40
Ha, 1031s asshat, have fun with those.

As dumb as it is, violence feels good to people who lose out. Crabby peeps.

His party's new tax plan is going to rape the shit out of crypto exchanges. Get the lube ready boys, trump will fuck you all in the ass and kill you in the process.

at the two year mark then we can say if any of this is going to be true. For now, enjoy Obama/republican policies. Thus far, you now have to report your crypto trades under 1031s and you no longer have a neutral internet where they can throttle the fuck out of it. So those two you can thank trump for. Eating shit is fun right?
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:41:46
yeah, and now you have to report 1031s for crypto sales. Eat a dick dude.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:43:27
and you all are going to jail for tax evasion under this new tax law. Eat a dick with 1031s baby.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:40:11
report your 1031s asshat, do it! Your government demands it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:29:28
That's what folks say usually to give some cognitive dissonance to whats happening to them... you silly silly person.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:36:12
1031 BABY WOO YEAH! TRUMP FUCK US PLEASE OH GOD PLEASE!
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:40:21
Not Gary Johnson... fucking moron
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:47:57
1031s wooo yeah!
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:20:24
I suppose any political party could enact such a thing. Just so happens to be republican?
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:39:16
1031s BABY YEAH!! WOOOO REPUBLICAN FUCKING US IN THE ASS WOOOO!!!!

They'd have to use cash instead

If anyone understood the tech behind bitcoin they would see this as the dumbest idea possible.

One point to bring up is when alternate energy does become profitable, we can burn as much as we like. Lately that seems to be the case as time goes on.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:48:21
Also to be clear, this is not a jab at bitcoin in any sense. Block chain technology might be the only way to create absolute non-repudiation of transactions along with transparency in a world that is riddled with corruption. It can lead to sovereignty in the face of such issues.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:31:54
I agree with the ancillary waste produced by the financial industry. A counter point might be that the waste on GPU production and ASICS could be an equal footing. Also the numbers on how much energy consumption a visa transaction produces isn't looking at the full picture I'd presume.
