I'm not looking for investment advice, or confirmation of my thoughts, I'm looking to glean what other people think about the near-term future of Bitcoin. It's like asking people what their gut-instinct says, you wouldn't blindly follow their advice, but you might try to understand the reasons behind why they gave that answer.
