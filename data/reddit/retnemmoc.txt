Yeah I was thinking that too.  That's why I asked if it worked with any other bitcoin wallet.  
They need full access to "connect you to the cloudbased mining server" then they will let you change the password.

I didn't say it was elaborate, I'm just used to much lower effort scams. Also I don't get spam on reddit, but maybe im lucky.

Because there are strong anti-doxing rules on reddit but they only apply to the good guys.  He used a month old account with no history.  I've had this account for ages.  I'm covering my own ass and not risking it for some silly spammer.

Hi all, a little background info.  I have never been subbed to this subreddit and rarely mention bitcoin in my posts.  I got this reddit message today and was excited I was making friends for a moment.  Then this conversation ensued...
All usernames/emails have been censored to protect the guilty but I have flagged the message as spam and will send the info the the admins.
Anyone know how this scam works?  I'm assuming it has something to do the the account they set up for you on blockchain?
Either way, mad props to this guy for sticking with me for so long.  I thought the entire purpose of scams were low effort high reward. This guy is doing it wrong.
**Edit:** I didn't post his user account, gmail, or malicious website because what's the point?  They will just make another one.  Reddit has strict doxxing rules and I gotta cover my own ass. If anyone or mods want his email you can contact me.  I don't see the point though.  scammers gonna scam. 
I just thought it was funny and wanted to share. Maybe if someone else later on searches for reddit bitcoin scam, they will see this post as an example.

Except you don't send him money.  You just put bitcoin in a wallet that you ostensibly control.  Somehow it gets magically linked to a cloud based mining system and then more magic happens and you get 30% ROI weekly.

Are you literally trying to scam in a scam post?
