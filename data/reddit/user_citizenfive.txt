If, for example, you live in the United States, and an EMP is dropped, you won't be able to get a couple computers and make the internet again and access your bitcoin.
Instead, you'll be fighting for your survival.
Gold MIGHT have value in a grid down scenario, but as people say, you can't eat gold. A potato may be worth more than an ounce of gold in this situation if it's the difference between whether you starve to death or not.
Guns, ammo, land (to grow your own good), food (beans, potatoes, rice, pasta), gold, silver, and yes... bitcoin (and monero ;) )

My recommendations:
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose
Use coinbase to buy bitcoin (since you're already familiar with it)
Send it to a wallet which you control the private keys for ( electrum is a trusted one)
Sit back and relax

Search up local Bitcoin ATMs and see which ones offer a selling option.
coinatmradar.com may prove useful
Make an account on an exchange. (Kraken may be an option). 
Send the btc to the exchange 
Switch the btc to your currency of choice
Send that currency to your bank

If you sweep the private key of any paper wallet, doesn't that automatically make it vulnerable to someone who can analyze the blockchain? 
@_date: 2019-03-29 19:28:20
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose
Don't keep your coins on an exchange
Crypto is very volatile so don't panic sell
It may be better suited for a long term investment 
@_date: 2019-11-04 06:08:06
Diversify bro,
Gold is a decent option since it has one of the best track records
(But don't keep it at the bank  )
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:40:05
Are you saying it's okay to reuse a paper wallet after sweeping it?

Not sure what loT is. When I say smart grid, I mean to say all the houses across the country which will, if have not already, be connected with each other via smart meters. A hack could result in everyone losing control of their power at once. A small example is in an episode of mr robot. When the main characters hack a house and make the tenant leave because the smart house went haywire.

You make a fair point about real estate and it's price,
However, I still believe an EMP will effect bitcoin as a store of value... subjectively from a geographic perspective.
If there was an EMP in the US, the blockchain will still be up an running in other countries who were not hit, however, for the people in united states that held bitcoin, they'll no longer have access to it. Thus for these people, gold would be something worth having. 
And yes, if a person were to move to another country, they could have there bitcoin back, but after an EMP, that would be very unlikely.

Don't we have an idea of how many are lost?  I heard only about 33% of bitcoin was moved post BCH fork, which leads us to assume approximately 66% are lost (from the amount that's have currently been mined)
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:07:37
It's been a long time coming 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:50:50
If we're being realistic, an EMP or solar flare or WWIII does have the potential to make the grid go down, and thus take the blockchain with it. 
If this happens, gold and silver (and especially guns/ammo) will have an extremely high value, whereas bitcoin will not be around. 
For this reason, I personally believe it's a good idea to diversify, and invest in decentralized cryptos, precious metals, guns, and land... and knowledge about survival skills, because knowledge stays with you wherever you go.
Just my opinion 
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:53:36
That's very possible. I'm assuming though that a majority of the ones that I believe are lost, are not belonging to holders... which are the ones I'm curious about, in regards to their future.

There are several tests you can do yourself to test the gold. One that comes to mind off the top of my head is an acid test. There are others which you can easily search for online or find videos for.

When survival becomes the most important thing, food and security (ie. Guns/ammo) will be more valuable.
