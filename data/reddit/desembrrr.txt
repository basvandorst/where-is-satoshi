bitcoin is my favorite,and satoshi is my hero,im just saying about what i have learned,see and hear,i know bitcoin can adapt when needed,these things should be discussed sooner than later because bitcoin is democratic and that process is the slow part

staking is normally about 1-5% based over 1 yr,so it would take long time for any particular hodlr to get any massive gains over the rest

eeeek! an expert,you mean one of those creature that cant climb out of a box to know where they are or see any the big picture ;)

bitcoin should adopt the best of what the altcoins have shown i think,it could be a matter of survival,POS rewards node runners coins in the form of staking,bitcoin wont be very cool if only the rich run the system,why would regular people use some tool of the rich?

psychological barrier of not many could ever be able to afford even just 1 bitcoin is a BIG problem for bitcoin,they dont want to forever deal with 0.0000blahblahblah

but in crypto we have 1500 or more choices and no one to stop people from choosing

there is many forms of POS but i think bitcoin could tweak its own style,we see today that bitcoin will be only controlled by the rich simply because of the current mining process,with POS it takes the POWER away from the rich,sure big hodlrs can earn more coins,but that matters not if they have no brains in how they spend them,its not how much you make,its how you spend it

someone could make the perfect hardfork at any moment,then you would miss out

i propose a change to bitcoin to make it better x10,000 with a switch to some form of POS.previously discussed here: that already covers some of the points

still people will always not feel good if they cant be a part of the system because it too expensive to mine and pay for electricity only the rich can be miners and have a say in how it run
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:22:11
i think theoritacly lightning can still be used on POS meaning transaction fast and cheap 
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:16:59
waste not,want not,today even people pay to much for household eletricity also it is another factor that drive regular people away from mining just the electrical cost not to mention add in expensive equipment

miners have lots of power in the POW 1 example is all they have to do is stop mining one coin and mine another,also these miner locations are easily discoverable compared to some POS node only consuming about 5 watts.25,000 coins staked at 5% would equal max 1250 coins gained in 1 year but that if the owner never did anything with the coins,but staked coins also provide more stability regarding price,the owner of 25,000 coins is a massive investment and i would say rare,if the owner spends his profit on servants and wine,np thats what rich people do

yes,either bitcoin or bcash is sluggly,they take turns i notice this,waiting 10-20 mins is too long compared to POS,you can tell me why POS does not secure the network? and why POS nodes have no skin in the game? for when i come back tomorrow,but i have to go now,ttyl discussions are always good,we both get wiser
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:03:33
x10,000 is same thing as move decimal point right? but what about the massive energy consumption problem and expensive equipment and no incentive to run a node,POS solves all those right?
