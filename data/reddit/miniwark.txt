Just for the record see :

The main problem i see with Wikimedia not accepting Bitcoins, is than some peoples are opening unofficial donations pages and addresses for the foundation. There is one from BitPay and one from a bitcointalk user, perhaps even more here and here. In this cases, BitPay and the bitcointalk user seem legit, but not accepting Bitcoin leave an open place for scammers impersonating the foundation.
There is no need to officially endorse Bitcoin during donations campaign and on the super tip-toed donations pages. An official Bitcoin address in one little corner of an obscure wikimedia page would be largely enough.




Be careful, this address is now public, people may continue to send Bitcoins donations to you even after a few days... You will probably need to regularly check this address from time to time.
For example, see the history of the FFS donation address -&gt; 
There was a time when they did not endorse Bitcoin and have removed the Bitcoin address from their official pages (from [june 2011]( to [may 2013]( But the address was already public, and Bitcoins donations have continued during this two years.
Your address is not a Wikimedia official one, and people here understand than your are testing so you will probably not receive so much. But, surprises may happen.
Fun fact : 
Someone have played with [this wallet]( who illustrate the Wikipedia article about Bitcoins. This is strange because the private key is also on the file. See :

They even have setup a Bitcoin-&gt;Wikipedia donation page since 2012 :

The videos are available [here]( and [here]( A full text transcript will be available in one week.

In any case it's definitively too early to say than 'The French are next to join'. it's just a senate audition. French Senate is not as powerful as the US one. 
They are just asking for informations, this is not a political move. Political move, if any, must come from the Government or the National Assembly.
In fact, for now, as i see it, it's probably just lobing from Paymium (bitcoin-central.net) to secure their business as an exchange.

A french article about it : 
The three people are accused of 3 things :
- illegal banking
- illegal online betting platform
- unreported employment
For the first one, judge will have a hard time, because Bitcoins have no legal status in France as a money. The banking regulations is very strict in France, and bank need to register to the state if exchanging money. But Bitcoin is not considered a legal money by the French law. One of the last [statement about Bitcoins from the Banque de France]( state than *"le bitcoin ne peut pas être qualifié de monnaie ayant cours légal"* witch mean than Bitcon is not considered as a money in the sense of the law. (If the trading site also allow to directly exchange Dollars to Euros, then it's another history). I am very curious of what will happen on this part of the prosecution, but i think it will be dropped or probably changed to something lighter like "unregistered commerce". 
The second one is the really serious one and it's not completely Bitcoin related. In France online betting sites need an agreement from a special authority : The [ARJEL]( But one more time, betting need to be done in "legal" money...
For the third one, informations are not clear. But, if i understand wheel it's not about moonlighting, it's probably more a registry regulation stuff. Like if your are a bank or a betting site your are supposed to report yourself to the corresponding registry associations. For example betting sites, need to register to the ARJEL and for the exchange stuff to the [ORIAS]( This one depend on the result of the other ones.
In any case, whatever happen, this prosecution will be interesting because it will set a jurisprudence for Bitcoin exchanges in France.

Apart from Bitspam, any European based exchange who accept SEPA transfer is ok. [Bitcoin.de]( for example or the french based [bitcoin-central.net](

Well i am not sure about this. From what i see their main online activity seem to have been to exchange Bitcoins for Ukash, Paysafecard and PerfectMoney cards (at Bitspamp price + fees).
They indeed, buy Bitcoins too, but it seems they where using LocalBitcoins (in cash/OKPAY) and WesternUnion for this. The question is then, is it illegal to buy Bitcoins, witch is not a money by law in France ? Any commerce can deal with Euros. A second hand commerce like CashConverters deal with Euros too, but they do not need to register as a bank (but it need to register as a commerce).
Anyway, their site was probably shady. I would certainly not have used it, but i am still curious of what will happen before the court. What the police claim to the journalists, and what the judges decide later can be very different...

* From the Trezor last news they say than they have problems producing the plastic cases : 
* As an alternative there is the BitSafe project witch descent from someone42 Arduino work. It was available on BitMit from Alten :
It seem than BufferFly Labs are planing to sell their version of BitSafe (in two weeks) :
You can built it yourself since Alten did not seems to sell it anymore :
Both projects are Open Source :
So if your are in a hurry just fork ?

An interesting comment coming from a competitor which the exchange have been hacked in the past and was managing Instawallet...
It's nice to read the "fine print" in the ToS but looking for past history is interesting too!
Anyway i do not think than the topic here is about Bitstamp itself but more about the supposedly Bitcoin friendliness of Unicredit Slovenia.

What is the point of a donation fund ?
I was thinking than Hal Finney have already many Bitcoins.
He even have speak about his Bitcoin heritage :

Thanks for the reply. But one of the issue, is it's at last the third time that this happen.  *Errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum*.

- Did the card will communicate / track stuff with your own servers ?

Seem than it use Bitpay : "Accept payments in bitcoin, via a Bitpay merchant account"
@_date: 2013-07-03 09:49:35
They said than they will not refund before July 11th on the Instawallet page :

Maybe the idea is good but ... the actual end of the listing show than the execution is not very professional. It may soon become another spam list.

* The price of Trezor was choice month ago when BTC was around 125 $. You are right, 200 $ is actually a lot for a wallet, but it's the price for the people who want to have it first. I think than the price will probably go down when the production finally begin (or if the BTC price stabilize).
* Trezor is announced to be open Hardware. The hardware sources are not released yet, but i hope than the developers will keep their promise. In that case, if you find Trezor too costly you will be able to build it yourself. See the announcement [here]( Actually, only some parts of the code are available on [Github]( I do not think than Yubikey is Open Hardware.
* For the Raspberry Pi comments, and just as a reminder there is a Trezor Raspberry Pi shield too.  Its a shield for developers, not really for end users. Anyway, if we need to add a Raspberry Pi between the computer and a Yubikey it's mean than there is a missing feature somewhere. 
* Trezor is not the only available open hardware wallet. There is also the [BitSafe]( who is already available on BitMit at 75 $. It's cheaper and the hardware sources are already [available]( if you want to build it yourself. BitSafe development seems to be inactive for now, but it's an already available. Sure, than compared to BitSafe, Trezor is the winer in term of marketing.

Apparently it's possible do it by using a BitPay special page:
Maybe if they receive large amount from this source, they will considerate accepting BTC.

Nice and fair review, thanks !

I have just give a quick look on it. design is nice and clean. Just a few remarks:
* if your are planing "worldwide usage" then remove the "UK" references. Worldwide users outside UK may just think "than not for me".
* the same goes for the default currency. If it's a Bitcoin store, then why the default currency is the pound sterling ?
* many categories are empty (for now), maybe just hide them until there is something in them to avoid user frustrations trying all of them. I hope for you than they will be filled, but this may make fly potential users until then.
* the "Everything Else" category would be better placed at then end of the list instead of the middle.
* There is a "my account" dropdown menu with "lost password" and "escrow claim" available even for non logged users. Just replace it by a login/register button for non logged users.
* On my Firefox the search box seem misplaced
* Are you accepting only BTC payment? if yes then add a tool or a FAQ to explain where to get/buy some. (or add a service to buy them inside the store)

[Seeks]( &amp; [YaCy]( are already on the field. What are the advantages to use Faroo over them ?
