Well... I am not sure, but it should update dynamically.

I believe this kind of technology will never be able to be fully developed in a country like China. This is about freedom and spontaneous events by the people for the people. It's like trying to immitate our democracy system (like they do in many Eastern countries) or implementing a distorted ultra-regulated version of our free market economy...  As long as Blockchain is concerned, it may work for a while, but in essence... it will be just like a failed replica.

It's like that case with a Russian dude with a similar lawsuit. He has filed it in a Moscow court... Even the Judges there are laughting.

Thank you for your reply.
They have videos almost everyday and also Morning News Reports.
Usually you can also find those weekly news reports as well (sometimes they just make regular News Reports on Fridays, instead of these Summaries).
Thanks again!

Hey there guys. I'm just sharing with you a side story covered by the BitnewsToday. Venezuela's El Petro may be appearently be funded by Russia or China. I think this might be some anti-West thing, but who knows...

Those guys like to follow trends. That's all. You follow and capitalize on it.

Some say that the markets may soon have a near-death experience due to all the stuff going on. Mt.Gox's case, hedge funds, crazy buyers... At any moment, these guys may feel insecure and flood the markets. But I personally believe that this will be a "near-death" experience, meaning, prices will go down, but the cryptos themselves, will not die

Couldn't agree more.

This is a News Report. Check the whole video or the description on youtube. It contains news about BTC, ICOs and also altcoins. The main topic was ETH, but there's also some BTC stuff in there

I'm just helping a friend of mine with his YT stuff... He's just talking about some crazy prediction some guys made. No one can actually trust these traditional market players/"experts". BTC is a different kind of asset, so... graphs and math models are not so suitable for it.

Well... now Redditor for 2 weeks!

Well... considering today's techniques it's pretty possible for them to recover the data. I've seen guys recovering data from explosions and severely damaged hardware.

Well... that's actually what the guys at IBM said. And this is just a general term for the Blockchain market cap, not one Blockchain in particular.
