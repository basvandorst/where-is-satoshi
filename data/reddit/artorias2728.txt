Coinbase and GDAX both crashed for me

This happened to me last time it dropped below 10k, super annoying

Thanks, don't know why I couldn't figure this out.

I had my funds in an Electrum Wallet during the split. I have sent all my BTC to a new Electrum Wallet with a new seed for security purposes and installed Electron Cash on a different computer as well. So now I have a new wallet with my BTC, a supposedly "empty" wallet in Electrum with my BCC, and an empty Electron Cash Wallet, where I need the BCC to go to in order to get it on an exchange. So, how do I send over my BCC from Electrum to Electron Cash? I'm not seeing any receiving keys or any place to input my seed in Electron Cash.
Edit: I see a receiving address in Electron Cash, but I can't make a request as I can't tell how much BCC I have in my "empty" Electrum Wallet.

So it's just taking longer than usual? I'm starting to get paranoid it's been lost in the void lol.

I really hope it drops this much, but I am starting to think it won't drop as much as I want it to. Even sub 5k I'll be happy, sub 4k and I'll cream my pants.

Thanks for the info

I did the same and I am happy I did! A little worried that the price may drop again in the next week or so, but I'm just going to keep buying as it falls and hope for the best if that happens. Sub 2k would scare the shit out of me but I also love me some cheap BTC.

I don't think you'll feel as bad if you hold what you bought for a few months. (Hopefully)
Edit: I say this as a 4650 buyer :(

Stealing this comment from someone else:
This is the biggest misconception about crypto-currencies.
There is no barrier.
1 "milli-bitcoin" / "millibit" (mBTC) is worth $5.
1 "bit" / "micro-bitcoin" (uBTC) is worth $0.005
You can buy any denomination and enjoy gains because profit is determined by percentage increase, no matter how much you put in.
Imagine 1 millibit going from $5 to $100? $1000?
Do you really think you're late to this?
If Bitcoin becomes anything successful, it requires mass adoption.
Everyone reading this is still in the 1% of this adoption curve.

When are these forks occurring? not until November right? Anyone know specific dates?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:56:46
What leads you to believe this will be the case?
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:18:20
Why not both?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:47:41
The joke went right over your head dude.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:55:35
I think it's a good choice. I was feeling the same as you a few months back and I decided to just put in 100 dollars each week. I couldn't be happier with the returns I've gotten so far!

Limit sell order at 5600 just got filled. This is crazy.

Not so much that now is better or worse than before, but that if you really believe this asset will increase in value over time, you'll still make money no matter how much you put in at a percentage rate. No one knows for certain, but I doubt we will see the crazy 1000x value increase that's happened since the start of this currency, but if you look at the yearly or even bi-annual charts for bitcoin price, you'll see its still rising at a great rate for an investment. Then again, no one knows how long the upward trend will continue, or where it will peak at.

Coinbase, but it does have it's issues, especially starting up with all the identity verification stuff, that was annoying.

Wow you are a business student in college just like 1000000s of other kids. You must be super smart!
