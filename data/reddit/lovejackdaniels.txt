One doesn’t pay taxes on revenue but on pre tax income. Broadly speaking, The pre tax income is revenue - costs during the accounting year. Now, the company here can argue 30m as actual loss. So your costs go up by 30m or your pre tax income goes down by 30m.
P.S. normal costs during the year would be salaries to staff, exorbitant salary which owner pays to himself, rent, third party services, electricity, capital expenditures such as buying servers (depreciation amount in this case) etc

Yo. 30m tax means 100m pre tax income. If 30m hack, then pre tax is 70m. They still have to pay 30% tax on 70m

Me neither. I am not an accountant by profession. So don’t know the exact rules governing S.Korea. Maybe, they can assign a probability to loss amount per the accounting rules. So, if the company thinks, there is a 50 percent chances of never recovering it, they will book 15m as additional costs. Next year, they can reassess the probability. If they magically recover the amount, then they will have to declare it and pay taxes on entire 30m.
P.S. think 30m loss as asset writeoff on balance sheet. This flows straight through profit and loss account.

Is there a way to find, how many bitcoins were sold in each of the last 7 days?
Is there a way to find how many bitcoins were sold at market prices (not limit prices) over the last few days?
