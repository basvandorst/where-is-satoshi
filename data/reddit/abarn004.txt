9% may seem outrageous to some, but a bargain to others. May I suggest Coinbase or Circle - fee's are 1% however you need a bank account or debit card. This ATM only accepts cash - there are a lot more costs and hurdles involved with doing so...at least in Florida.

Awesome service. Used it myself and bought bitcoin with a credit card within minutes. Some may not fancy the whole login with your social account thing, but I could care less about giving my linkedin or g+...or even fb for that mattter. Better than having to upload a drivers license or passport or utility bill.
Great job guys!

Awesome to see this go from theory to concept. Heard about this in a talk once before I think from Mike Hearn or another core dev maybe a year or so ago. I can totally imagine a coffee shop printing a code on their receipt if you buy a coffee and you can use the code to get free wifi for an hour and every hour after that is 25 cents in btc or if you don't buy anything and just want to hang out, it's 25 cents per hour. 
This would be impossible with a credit card...most current wifi pay models want you to buy a whole day for $15 or something like that like at airports or in flight wifi or at a hotel. This is going to be a killer app in the coming years.

Not the owner. Owner is a friend that now hosts bitcoin meet ups for us local Miami bitcoin enthusiasts. As for chargeback stats, here's some info from a website I saw after doing a quick search: 
The owner has told me that sometimes people who come in and order wine and hundreds in food and bring a large group, but then use a stolen credit card and then a week later he gets owned by Visa or MC. It's a nightmare for restaurants when that happens.

@_date: 2014-10-18 14:00:29
Reid's answer is very pragmatic...there isn't an absolute necessity to accept bitcoin yet especially this early and waiting to accept bitcoin isn't going to cost them much because it would take minimal effort and cost to do so when the time is right. At the end of the day they would just be converting btc to dollars and causing further downward price pressure. Further, massive early adoption is more risky for Bitcoin than for Evernote because the more companies jump on this early, the higher the stakes get if something goes wrong...we are still debating blocksize increases and waiting for sidechains...I personally don't mind if companies like evernote take their time and dip into the water one toe at a time.
What is noteworthy however, is the tone of the conversation...a year ago most would have scoffed or laughed at the idea of bitcoin as a payment mechanism...instead it's becoming more of a "eventually we will accept it" type of response.

I'm not sorry for your loss and the market doesn't care. Your post is flawed in so many ways and as much as I want to feed into your trolling ways, I simply don't have the time to address the short term over-generalization of the ridiculous arguments you make. 
Bitcoin is as close to a efficient free market as it gets and you just learned that you're not smarter than the market. Rather than blame yourself for being an irrational investor, you call out "everyone" else for being "irrational and constantly mispricing something". So now your rational for selling? Will you make another post 6 months from now or a year form now if Bitcoin goes back up that you made a mistake? HONEY BADGER DON'T GIVE A FUCK...sell your bitcoins and grovel to your overlords you simpleton throwaway troll....I will pick them up at today's price and tomorrow's price because the market is smarter than me and instead of getting mad at the market, I will personally put my faith in the technology as a long term promise, not a short term get rich scheme.

Then why hasn't segwit activated? Or why hasn't bitcoin forked? The reason is because Mining is decentralized more today than 3 years ago. It's hard AF to get miners to agree because it's so decentralized which is a good thing. Maybe you weren't here during the CEX.io days....

It only sucks if you don't seem credible and you don't know how to survive cross examination. A good expert takes complicated situations and presents them in a easy to understand fashion for a jury. Bad expert witnesses will get tripped up by a attorney in cross because they cater to their master rather than hodl their opinion in a higher tier and come off credible, unbiased and easy to understand. It also helps to know what standard your state uses when understanding how to qualify an expert: Daubert or Frye. Florida switched to Daubert 2 years ago.

This post by Fred doesnt really take a position. I feel like I wasted 10 minutes of my life reading it. It's a critique of Bitcoin while pumping ethereum and hedging himself along the way. It's a blog post with empty opinions. The reality is that this post comes off the heels of coinbase rushing eth to their exchange because Gemini got all the attention first.  Furthermore, their exchange was taking a shit today. 
Exchanges don't care which coin wins, they will sell you any coin that the next teenager invents because they make money either way. 
Also, Fred still doesn't know who uses Bitcoin. There is more speculation going on in eth than btc right now. Bitcoin's killer app IS 
its store of value. Why does DAO matter? Is it because it crowd funded 150 million eth from children? Companies that have raised way more from much more sophisticated investors have failed miserably. How come  the DAO is the only 'app' ethereum disciples can reference? I'm going to bed, this was such a pump piece. Fred, I applaud your ability to make a fuck ton of money off of crypto teenie boppers, however this post was complete crap.

Possibly...this is more about awareness than anything...as well as giving the Miami enthusiasts a regular place to drink for cheap! :)

Last time I checked Kendall was Miami. So is Hialeah... As well as down town, the beach, pinecrest, homestead, south miami, coral gables, north Miami....the list goes on buddy...never seen a "Metro" Miami on a map...that's deceiving as fuck.

More like 10-15%. Fractional reserve economy.

Yes it will be 10% off forever on any purchase with btc. Happy hours are once a month for now. I'm sure he will do something special for the conference...maybe catering for the event?

In the long term it will be a great investment if bitcoin really makes it to the mainstream. I assume u bought a combo of cointerrras/neptunes - if so  when everything arrives maybe you'll push 5-8 coins out a day or less depending on the difficulty by the time you get everything. I expect the diff to be around 5-10 billion by end of March. 
Maybe you can provide more info on what equipment you bought and expected delivery date - it would help a lot with some projections. Also post this to @_date: 2013-12-27 07:14:34
Yes they will. Ask for Michel (he's a dude)

People tend to spend as their wealth increases to capitalize on gains. Personally I don't sell my bitcoins, so I like to spend a couple of them from time as the price increases. Buy low, spend high ;). I spotted a few of my friends who don't have btc who came to learn more and also support the event.

You should!

I'll try to remember - I will try to do a followup post in a few weeks after the filming of the food show

The link to their website is: 
It's really good by the way. Support your local honey farmers!

I do realize like anyone else who is familiar with the current state of bitcoin that the currency aspect hasn't reached a mass consumer level...that's not to say it won't either - did you see the bitpay metrics from bitcoin black friday this year compared to last year? As far as the media noticing, have you looked at the mainstream media reporting of bitcoin 6 months ago compared to today? I can't watch bloomberg today without counting at least 10 or more mentions of bitcoin - this was practically non-existent 6 months ago.

A decent amount probably 50 + comfortably. If everyone likes it tonight, maybe we can make it out new meet up spot!
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:03:21
It def will be a regular thing. 10% off always for btc...50% off for btc happy hours once a month for now. Things can ways change, but the owner is a big supporter of btc. The food is excellent btw!
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:21:09
Probably until midnight.

It's probably the best alternative to sweeteners or sugar. Just a teaspoon a day is very "beeneficial".

Haha! Neither, but bar rescue is def one of my fav shows ever. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:07:44
