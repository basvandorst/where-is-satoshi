Coinbase has been accused of insider trading because some people knew Bitcoin Cash was coming, and most didn't. There was no public announcement of the well timed pump and dump that coincided with this last major correction. They may be more or less at fault than we feel, but we feel like we were fucked with. I'm now watching the carea crash from Gemini instead.

Congrats. I'm in a similar spot at the moment. Debating selling to pay off all of my debt (car, student loans, and credit cards) and start back close to zero...

Hold on and you'll be fine. It will be scary, but long term you're going to be ok. I've watched half of my worth disappear a few times.

Thus is what we need! Easier ways to spend our coins. We're all pretty well versed in acquiring, transferring, and storing them.

I was verified in under 36 hours at Gemini and have had no issues other than brief shut downs for maintenance. And honestly, the shut downs I've experience over the last few weeks are forgettable compared to what I'd gone through with Coinbase. I jumped ship months ago and haven't looked back. Nothing but good word from me about Gemini. I'm looking forward to them adding additional currencies.

Makes sense. Thank you.

That's why I'm here asking these questions. I don't fully understand the fork. I don't want my coins to become useless after I've been touting bitcoin as a relatively stable digital currency. The fact that so much instability is caused by developers that can't agree makes bitcoin a scarier currency than anything we're used to using.

Excellent explanation. Thank you.

So now that we've reached the fork are "bitcoins" and "bitcoinxt" coins being mined separately? Will the supply of bitcoins increase at a slower rate as a result of miners devoting more time/power to mining bitcoinxt? How does this impact things like bitcoin atm's and infrastructure that have started to pop up worldwide for bitcoin?
What I'm understanding is that the price is falling due to uncertainty now, not actually because bitcoin is obsolete.

Thank you. You addressed most of my concerns really well. What is the best way to keep track of what clients are mining what and where we are relative to that 75% mark? I guess I'm just looking for the most effective ways to monitor our current market. If xt ends up being the way to go I'd like to obviously switch earlier rather than later but I also don't want to panic sell my bitcoin because that's rarely the best option in a volatile market. Thanks again for taking the time to reply.

Thank you for taking the time to reply even after being aggressively downvoted for having a strong opinion. I'd rather see the extreme opinions on either side of a debate, along with the moderate views, and form my own opinion anyway. You've been very helpful.
