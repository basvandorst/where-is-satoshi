Whenever my ego needs stroking I go back and read the responses I received by calling bitcoin a bubble back in November / December

They were getting a proper audit done, then they *fired the auditors because they were being too thorough*. They then got a 'statement of funds' or some bollocks from a law firm and passed it off as being equal to an audit, which it absolutely is not.

Yes. Bitcoin is a terrible currency right now and the price and growth rate doesn't reflect its extremely limited real-world usage.
The skyrocketing price is based entirely on speculation as everyone piles in with the dream of doubling their money in a week, not off the actual growth of it as a useful asset.

Correct, I own no bitcoin. 
But just because I don't own bitcoin and think it's a speculative bubble fit to burst in spectacular fashion doesn't mean that I'm shilling for an altcoin, which you seem to be implying. I just think the demand for bitcoin is being driven by the promise of free money and has little relation to its actual use or adoption.

What is the point in these posts? I've been reading about all kinds of rapidly approaching 'bounces' or 'bull runs' or 'insert positive phrase here' since January.
Articles like this provide nothing useful. The sites are just harvesting clicks from depressed hodlers who are deep in the red and desperate for some sort of encouragement while they keep praying the albatross around their neck will soon make them a millionaire.
