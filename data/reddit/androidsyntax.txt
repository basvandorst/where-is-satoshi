Bitpay recently changed to only providing you with a bitcoin payment protocol address (BIP70), you will need to use a wallet that supports it. If your using a hardware wallet you can use ELectrum.

Also OP if your going to dl it make sure to check the signatures of the zip to make sure they match, generating addresses this way is really for more advanced users which is why I suggested electrum but make it a habit to check sigs of all software relating to bitcoin.

Bitcoin and crypto currency’s are risky investments, mining has become beyond the reach of most, to turn a profit you will need to invest lots of money in equipment and energy cost and you still might not turn a profit. If you plan to invest in and hold Bitcoin my advice would be to start small and learn how to use a wallet to send and receive payments, I would start by buying a hardware wallet, either a Trezor or Ledger this will secure it against getting hacked but there are still risks involved with being your own bank. Check out some of Andreas Antonopoulos videos to get started

You could use Coinbase and their wallet I guess but don’t you have btc in Virwox?
If your on Android there’s Smaurai wallet 
And iOS there’s Green Address wallet. 
Since you seem new to this it’s probably best to stick to Coinbase for now for buying btc but please read up and learn as much as you can, a simple mistake can end up in you losing your Bitcoin.

Trezor and Ledger are both hardware wallets available for around $90 and well worth the added expense unless you’re only holding very small amounts. Don’t rely on a 3rd party to hold your coins because they control your coins not you.

It’s best not to use Virwox as a wallet to pay for things, there can be delays when withdrawing from exchanges and you will also have difficulty getting a refund if you send from an address you don’t control. Withdraw your BTC to a wallet on your computer or phone first, then pay the coinpayments invoice.

As points out if the price drops you can write off the tax as a loss but it’s trending up at the moment but that didn’t mean too much, things can change quickly, and the volatility could end up costing you. For something under 11k it could work well but then you have the other 60k or so to figure out what to do with. Might also be worth asking in Edit: so yes I think as soon as you cash out you pay tax but only on the gains but talk to an adviser on what to do as you might fall foul of the law either in the U.K. or Korea and end up with your accounts frozen while they run a bunch of checks on you and the money.

Why don’t you try one of the crypto trading simulators to get a feel for what’s involved, maybe someone here can recommend one as I’ve not used any but my advice would be to avoid trading it’s a lot like gambling you’ll most likely do better just buying and holding.
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:33:22
When you go to cash out in the U.K. you will need to pay capital gains tax, you do however get a 11k allowance per tax year. So this probably isn’t the best way unless you intend to hold the Bitcoin and cash out gradually.

@_date: 2019-04-17 22:23:07
Bitrefill works great but I wish they were more transparent with their prices, they don’t show you the exchange rate in local currency for one, only in Bitcoin which it seems is to deliberately obscure the mark up their adding above the marked price of the card. I stopped getting my top up from them because it was over 20% more expensive than the marked price for my network but I did notice other networks weren’t so expensive. 
I’ve got no problem paying a little for the great service they provide but show me how much it is, don’t make me have to calculate your prices against the exchange rate to find out.
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:45:56
Sure some top ups for example will, if the marked price is say €10 cost you €10 in BTC, but have a look at Netflix, a €15 card costs €17.93 in BTC but that’s not shown, I don’t have a problem with them adding a mark up, I just have a problem with them not showing you what it is. They provide a great service though and them taking on lightning so early was great to see.

@_date: 2018-02-18 11:40:15
I think it’s best to contact the exchange, unless you’ve placed a limit order by accident, which would mean it only places the buy order when it reaches a set price.

@_date: 2017-09-29 13:16:15
It's seems what ever wallet you use right now there will be someone saying there's a reason not to. It depends on what you need it for I guess, do you need it to be for multiple cryptos or just bitcoin, does it need to be open source and cross platform? There are lots of things to consider, it's no wonder that new users are so confused about what to use. 
If you can afford it my advice would be to get one of the hardware wallets. if it's only for small amounts then I wouldn't worry to much, just do a little research first and pick one that suits your needs.  
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:18:14
For large amounts like that it would probably be best to use an OTC service.

If you intend to pay invoices via bitpay you’re going to need electrum or one of the supported wallets or something to convert their shitty implementation of only using bip70 address format as Ledger doesn’t support this via their app :/

If a copy of the blockchain were to be stored here and we get hit with a EMP due to a massive sun storm it would probably be safe but I think bitcoin would be the last of our worries, the world would be in utter chaos but I guess this would also be an opportunity for bitcoin to flourish when it comes time to rebuild.

There's buyreggae.com in Germany, there having a bitcoin Friday 10% off, I also asked rwdfwd.com if they would and they said they would look into it, might be worth asking them again they seemed open to the idea.

Not sure it looks any better with the symbol, but it might help to lessen the confusion, anyone know how I add this to my fonts library on osx?

Sell some low value stuff on bitmit, I have a bunch of stuff on there and every now and again I get a sale but don't expect a quick turn over, it seems to pick up when there's a spike in price and there's the added benefit of the cash you spend on postage get paid in bitcoin.

At this rate the networks will become self aware like Skynet, I wonder who would it attack first?

You should write the movie script, Arnie can play the part of your dealer.

I love the optimism of this sub, I want it to succeed just as much as everybody else but bitcoin has some major hurdles to get over before it reaches its potential, just remember never to risk more than you can afford to lose.

Your right, I’m not from the U.S the first time i heard it was in the movie, counln’t find a source for the qoute but i did find this strange [wiki page]( with some zen of sarcasm quotes, one i thought appropriate: A closed mouth gathers no foot.

A screenshot is easily doctored but you never know, maybe he got that transaction fee that guy entered wrong, can’ t remember how much it was though.
