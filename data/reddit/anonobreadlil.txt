Agreed, and because I agree with your position that payment mechanisms need only be *good enough* rather than perfect that I see no problem whatsoever with depositing $300 on the Venmo of payment channels for low value payment processing. You're guaranteed your money back if a hub goes down - so I'm just not worried about it. While LN isn't *perfect* per se, it certainly will cover at least 80% of the use case of low value instantaneous Bitcoin payments with near zero fee.
It isn't perfect, and there will always be some hoops to jump through, but it's *good enough*.
I fully acknowledge people often turn their noses at the idea that [Bitcoin is really a base layer of money rather than a payment system](






... but Bitcoin will be tremendously successful if more people understand [the differences between payment and settlement](

Wouldn't it still be useful as a currency if, to gain access to fast and cheap transactions, you had to deposit $300 worth of BTC in a particular open source client side Bitcoin wallet? Think Venmo of payment channels.

For the average user not concerned about privacy when BTC hits $5000 it's not something they want to do.
But I would urge users to take a second look at full node wallets because it could easily become the case that privacy is essential to you in the future. You may not want to take even the slightest risk of broadcasting your addresses to the public in ten years. It's actually possible for you to get locked in to a wallet like Electrum which forces you to become dependent on connecting to a remote server whether or not you want to.
As a middle ground, some SPV wallets let you directly connect to a full node, which really should be a standard feature. At a bare minimum, I would only recommend using either SPV wallets which allow this, or a full node wallet - which are increasingly likely to allow for running under lite settings as another form of middle ground.

While 2 of 3 escrow certainly ends the wild west of direct P2P payments, and while I wouldn't describe the process itself as *untenable* - with a ton of work it could be made very much doable for ordinary people - multisig seems much more well-adapted to distributed fund management and multisig cold storage than it does to mass market commerce.
I say this because 2-of-3 multisig esrow transactions require you to fund the multisig address, which is an extra step that requires a fee and negotiation with the other party, plus additional waiting for the confirmation. It's just not a whole lot of fun. And regardless of how streamlined you can make it, I still don't see how to apply that approach to a one-step checkout e.g. Expedia. Not even the classic OpenBazaar - which is the *ideal* multisig transaction platform - is guaranteed to be a mainstream hit - although I certainly want to see it in action before forming an opinion.
Now, if we could do threshold signatures atop an "Authorize.net of payment channels" or a "Venmo of payment channels" type solution - that solves the two biggest shortcomings of blockchain multisig transactions. Make the 2 of 3 escrow instant and zero cost, and it's going to be infinitely easier to use.


If you mean Ethereum style contracts, I'm just not seeing why that can't be done on sidechains or voting pools. I would only change my tune if you can show me a smart contract that creates a *true bearer instrument* - one as rock solid as BTC that can be held in cold storage. Barring that, I'm just going to point you to sidechains and voting pools, because there's just no need for it to happen on the main blockchain.

OP, do you consider a $5 taco an oppressive force that makes tacos optimized for rich people? Because that's basically what you're saying about $5 BTC fees in a world where most people use the Venmo of payment channels to make daily purchases. Even for a $100 transaction, $5 fee is 5%. Hardly unaffordable. But such oppressive!
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:27:30
When I say "Venmo for payment channels", I mean Venmo completely reimagined from the ground up as a decentralized client side Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:51:42


You're way overthinking this. **If 700,000,000 people adopt Bitcoin tomorrow, what do you do?**
Are we to increase the block size so high that we lose all decentralization?
Or are you at least willing to admit Venmo of payment channels or PayPal of voting pools beat the alternative?
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:01:22
Satoshi was just another person with an unproven idea in 2010. When an entrepreneur like that is confronted with harsh criticism - "but how does Bitcoin scale??!" - he's not going to condemn his own product. Anyone would've done the same in his position, "Bitcoin scales very well, all the way to VISA levels". What else do you expect him to say? That this will never work?
@_date: 2015-12-17 01:09:22
If the Venmo of payment channels isn't good enough for you *today*, then what do you expect to do in the future if Bitcoin is a success? Do you understand that regardless of how many people "DEMAND" using the blockchain, they won't all fit in, even under BIP101?
Hence if you're complaining about Venmo of payment channels now, you'd be complaining just as loudly in the future assuming Bitcoin is a success. So how about we set the right expectations? Is that really so much to ask?

But you're buying lunch with a disinflationary civil asset forfeiture proof digital gold, and it is for no other reason worthwhile to pay for stuff with it but to grow the network effect of this digital gold.
You don't NEED to pay for lunch out of cold storage to impress people. If anything, the Venmo of payment channels will be faster, cheaper, better looking and more technically impressive.


True, but block times are an [Exponential distribution]( and you can't ever know for certain if your transaction will confirm quickly. In addition, fees will never be predictable because they're based not just on the latent demand but on the byte size of your transaction! You have absolutely zero control for the most part over how big your transaction is, so you'll never know how much you need to pay to move an amount of BTC regardless.
For a picture perfect payment system, you need the Venmo of payment
Bitcoin is important because it's a base money.






I keep repeating this link because it's an extremely worthwhile read. Please tell me you've read it: 
Finally, have you heard the phrase "**Fast, Cheap, Quality - pick 2**"? Guess what - that applies perfectly to the blockchain. If you want fast and quality - using the blockchain - you pay the higher price. If you want to pay with BTC fast and cheap, then what's so bad about the Venmo to payment channels? Doesn't that give you fast and cheap transactions, albeit at a reduced level of security? If anything goes wrong, you get a *full refund* minus the miners fee.

If you don't mind me asking - what are you using Bitcoin *for* then?
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:12:04


The price hit $1100 years ago. Notice the visible discrepancy between price and ecosystem maturity? That's because for most people Bitcoin consists of two things
1. Do I have the coins in cold storage?
2. Do I have the coins on an exchange where I can liquidate for fiat profits?
This describes upwards of 90% of all BTC being held today. It's in cold storage savings or on an exchange for profit taking. Contrary to popular belief, you don't actually need gigablocks to support this paradigm, and it's THIS paradigm that provably resulted in $1100 prices - *years* ago.


Honestly, who really needs BIP70? Is this going to make or break my use case of cold storage, and moving from cold storage to and from exchanges? Because if not, why would you be surprised that other people don't care.
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:55:01


Why's that?


Here's what happens: it takes longer and costs more to get full blockchain writes confirmed, which will always remain true no matter what the block size is. Block times are an Exponential distribution, so you can never count on a quick confirmation no matter what you try, and it will always be cheaper and faster to use a dedicated payment platform like LN again regardless of block size.


The LN authors estimate 70,000,000 people can use Bitcoin at 8MB blocks if just half of them rely on LN for their daily low value payment processing. And considering Streamium.io and Joystream are already using payment channels pre-LN for low value payment processing, I really do believe it's highly feasible.
In addition, LN will be quite a bit more private for your daily payments than a globally replicated blockchain. I feel it's a mistake to look to ring signatures and CoinJoin to provide the be-all end-all of anonymity, when for example a fantastic way to mix coins has FOR YEARS been on centralized shared wallets
- Step 1: deposit coins
- Step 2: wait a bit
- Step 3: withdraw fresh new coins
And if you think you can mix coins effectively on JoinMarket, I agree - but what happens when you can do joins instantly and zero fee over LN? We'll be comparing market solutions on joins per second capacity, supercharging Bitcoin's privacy and fungibility.
But if block size grows *too large* and primarily Corporations run the full nodes in datacenters while ordinary people are left out in the cold, that devalues the entire Bitcoin ecosystem by removing the individual's ability to act as a true peer on the network. Hence block size increases should be a last resort - not a first step.
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:25:43
Yet, block size can't be increased so much that Bitcoin's decentralization is allowed to die. Are you at least willing to admit that? If not, you're missing the point.
This is my  complaint with big blockers. You all really *do* need to at least admit that big blocks kill Bitcoin's decentralization when overdone. We, the investors of Bitcoin and the largest holders, are simply not going to allow scores of users who don't even understand why Bitcoin is valuable in the first place, to deface the very purpose of Bitcoin over some abstract objections they claim to have over using the Venmo of payment channels. You'll get a full refund if anything goes wrong, and for crying out loud, nobody invests in Bitcoin for the low fees. That's a **myth**.
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:29:33
That's my point. You don't pay $3 on chain - use Venmo of payment channels.
You pretend like "that's oppression" when for a $100 or up purchase it's perfectly reasonable.
@_date: 2015-12-13 19:03:29


Do you suggest ordinary people won't invest in BTC because of pendantry about how Bitcoin is really a settlement network not a payment network? Explain how that one works if you would.
Hint: It's extremely far fetched to think ordinary people will either invest or not invest depending on whether they need to deposit $300 in Venmo of payment channels in order to buy coffees with their investment.


As much as I love reading six year old posts by the system's creator, they're six year old posts - and I have a very hard time believing the system's creator would think anything but highly of LN and sidechains.
@_date: 2015-12-16 18:31:45
I'm sorry - did you consider selling all your BTC during the stress tests? If the stress tests were such an "economic disaster", who suffered for it? People sending peanuts for pennies? Explain why those people can't be on Venmo for payment channels.
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:21:40
The blockchain wasn't designed to coddle you at Starbucks. Dedicated payment platforms like a Venmo for payment channels are going to infinitely more user friendly than any blockchain will ever be.

If 700,000,000 new users come in tomorrow, you'll have to choose between sending them all to Coinbase, or promoting the use of the Venmo of payment channels or PayPal of voting pools. Block size can't be increased so much that Bitcoin's decentralization is allowed to die, because at that level of destruction Bitcoin is just VISA but more expensive.


You know what they say ... welcome to Bitcoin, motherfucker.
@_date: 2015-12-13 03:27:10


Is on-chain low value payment processing so vital in importance as to preclude a "Venmo of payment channels" from relieving at least some of those pressures?
And smart contracts are more of a moonshot than Bitcoin. Why do we need to bend over backwards to accomodate them on the main blockchain? Are 2WP sidechains *that crappy*?
The software for this may not be implemented, but neither is the hardware available today to reasonably accomodate gigablocks. Nor can anyone convince me the positive feedback loop fed network effect of Bitcoin on the wider cryptocurrency markets do anything but guarantee Bitcoin's success because regardless of the blockchain fee, for it to rise, many more people would have to demand using Bitcoin - which is at least as good for Bitcoin as big blocks filling up.
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:27:39


Eventually could mean quite literally *months* of waiting. How is that in any way comforting or expected behavior?
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:38:01
Does mass adoption of 2-way pegged sidechains raise the market price of BTC?
Thought so troll.
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:53:00
Low value payment processors are a dime a dozen. Incidentally, where are all the businesses being built on full blockchain write based low value payment processing? Streamium.io and JoyStream are both using payment channels *already* pre-LN to target that market.
Now let's consider smart property, smart assets and Bitcoin 2.0 in general - which I've been saying for months is the real reason why we're having this debate. Guess what, not only do these projects have no users, they're not even a good fit for a blockchain in the first place. Consider a smart property apartment lease. Who cares that it's in your Bitcoin wallet if the landlord can take you to court and the court overturns the blockchain? Why even have the blockchain if the blockchain's consensus isn't final?
Go find me a true bearer instrument besides BTC that works on a blockchain and can gain millions of users. I promise I'll STFU and publicly apologize.
Lacking that evidence, it would be downright shameful to give up a single *ounce* of decentralization to cater to these special interests. Low value payment processing is already being covered with payment channels and it's not the end of the world. Bitcoin 2.0 is a joke with no users.
It's a plain horrible decision to cater to projects that have no users and that are a poor fit for what a blockchain does in the first place, especially since most people are here for the cold storage or exchange-based fiat profit taking.
