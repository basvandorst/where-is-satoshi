Internet is typically only available in public hotspots and it can be very expensive ($1.50 per hour). And it's not really censored from what I remember in my stay there.

People actually come (usually from outside of the country) with USB drives full of random shit that you can buy - you can definitely get porn and new movies in Cuba for not that many pesos

Yah- Im in Mexico and it's growing here. But it's still one of those fringe ideas that everyone agrees has potential but no one is actually willing to use. X__X

energy prices would go up?
So should we buy oil, invest in solar, and go all in on coal stocks?

I literally went there tonight to try to get a meal with bitcoin...says they accept it right on the table placement, but finished the meal and they said they couldn't take bitcoin.   
Really disappointing - and of course they don't take CC either so I had to borrow a few pesitos from my friend (who also wanted to pay in BTC)   
Like, it's great that they have it as an option (sometimes) but what's not great is businesses accepting or refusing to accept it on a whim.

I was just there today - they wouldn't accept BTC or Ethereum payments.

it's owned by some really friendly Italian dudes - they got back to me and apologized and stuff....just bummed that they didn't offer it while i was there
