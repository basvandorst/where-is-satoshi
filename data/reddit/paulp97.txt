Not in 2014 and it’s less bitcoin every time

Because the government wants to stick their big fat nose in everything

People had the same idea when it was 10-20k, look where they are now
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:18:56
You should focus on your own future more and take profits instead of worrying about the future of bitcoin

And what’s 1-2 dollars of bitcoin gonna do? It can go from 3,000 to 100,000 and you’ll have like what? 50 bucks?

Most people here use it as an investment but the fact that their investments are down now they’re just playing it off as “I believe in the tech, ima keep hodling”
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:10:02
The fact that the majority of the general public got burned by bitcoin and crypto

Takes way less to drop bitcoin from 1,000 to ~100 rather than from 20,000 to ~3000
The percentage isn’t the same but the price movement is more extreme and requires much more volatility. Who knows when we will see that kinda volume again
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:27:45
Larger percentages don’t mean jack when the price movement was on a colossally different scale you absolute duck
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:33:43
Last I checked bitcoin can move 2 ways..
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:05:22
Go on your computer, download a vpn, install blue stacks (android emulator for computers), download Coinbase and voila (I think, not sure if this works)

Are you stupid? A lotto ticket costs 1-2 dollars not 3,500+
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:00:20
Lol you’re making this post because you said instead of buying lotto tickets you should just buy bitcoin.
I said lotto tickets are 1-2 dollars and bitcoin is 3500+
You then said “you don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin you can buy portions” acting as if I didn’t know that
Buying a portion of bitcoin for 5 dollars won’t do shit for you in the long run even if it’s 1 million per bitcoin because you only have like .0001 of it
But yeah, keep comparing lottery tickets to bitcoin

The bitcoin whales dumped all their bitcoin at 15k+ lol

You’re the smartest person I’ve seen on this reddit so far
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:38:27
More like a lot of crappy dust lmfao..

Buying 1 bitcoin at 1,000 and 1 bitcoin at 20,000 are 2 completely different prices in terms of percentage. To buy bitcoin at 1,000, you double your money when it hits 2,000. Not bad and seemingly not much compared to the price action everyone saw last year
When you buy bitcoin at 20,000, you don’t double up until 40,000.. so yes, price of entry is very important when dealing with percentages as a whole
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:15:17
Did you tell yourself that when it went from 20,000 to 15,000?
@_date: 2018-12-11 07:11:26
Then you must be new to this
