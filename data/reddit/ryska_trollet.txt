And I agree, it's a shame that people still trust banks and fractional reserves even tho nearly everyone got screwed over by that scam when they lost their gold back in 1929. If banks starts to hold cryptocurrency the history will repeat itself, only this time with crypto as reserve instead of gold.
But hey, maybe dumb people will learn the hard way this time, once they realize that everyone who secured their own keys ends up just fine after the financial crisis.

Not really, most people have been taught for decades to blindly trust banks with their fiat money. It's gonna take years to decades before they can trust themselves and feel comfortable securing their own private keys. 
This is theoretically a great step in terms of adoption, no matter what happens next. If the banks does their job and secure the keys properly it's great for people who doesn't know how to secure their private keys. 
If banks does a shitty job and repeat the gold disaster during 1929 a lot of people will loose faith in banks once they realize their bank held crypto is lost forever, but everyone with personal wallets didn't loose a single satoshi. Most people would probably move over to personal crypto wallets after such event instead of bend over and get f\*cked by the banks a third time due to their fractional reserve system that obviously fails once everyone wants to withdraw at the same time.

I think the target audience are people who have never used crypto yet, want to start but doesn't know how it works rather than people who are already in. Just keep your private wallet and make sure it doesn't connects to your identity and you'll be fine.

Sure why not, then we proceed by disable your VISA card, then we shut down your bank account, then we ban all cash because only criminals use cash anyway. Be careful what you wish for kid.
