What? You know there are completely different types of Lawnmower's right? Riding mower, Push mower, Electric Mower, Diesel Mower. Not sure you understand your own point there. Apple is just an object, same as Lawnmower.
How are some more examples for you: 
Just to list a few.

% gain/loss is one of the stats that they show but there are also a lot more. 
You can see that across a bunch of different time frames, see graphs of how well your portfolio is performing against this new "Lawnmower Index" that they created, how well your portfolio is performing against other common investments like gold,oil, US stocks etc, see asset specific statistics, history for all your buys and sells, asset specific news / resources, real time price information. 
Theres honestly just a lot of information and they have packaged it in a super clean way, highly recommended.

Does Apple have anything to do with selling actual apples? Or Target having anything to do with selling targets? 
Please don't change the name, I think it is what makes you guys unique in this space!

Both great apps, I find myself basically only using those two for investing nowadays. Did you see that Lawnmower just released a new update? It feels pretty similar to Robinhood now.
