Sounds to me very reasonable. Good point. Those more advanced on their hobby-horse should remember that they cannot succeed without new bitcoin users who, by definition almost, seek knowledge on the practical side of the issue about say where to get bitcoin, how to use it etc. It is easy to say that they should google first for the information they want but if you don't know about some thing or another (hard to find) you get nowhere. For example: "How do I make that icon in xxx application to save my password..." etc...etc...
One should also remember that there is no clear-cut division between newbies oldbies. Someone may be a newbe in one issue and oldbe in another one.
I think it would be good to have a some kind of facility within this section where you could mark a simple question conspicuously so that everyone would know that the writer is seeking help with a particular issue no matter how small or insignificant seeming. A question mark alone is not sufficient because ordinary entries often have them also. Perhaps some sort of icon which you could pop by selecting it. The moderators and other users could then scan the questions and from time to time and give some advice without any F--k words or LOLs. To keep the community growing.

According to very recent Fitch report: "Bitcoin is smaller than Guatemala’s Quetzal, with a capitalization of $6.75bn in late February. Bitcoin is even smaller today, with a market cap of just $5.6bn." So any country that wholeheartedly embraces bitcoin can have a great impact on it. The value of bitcoin is not in the number of current Chinese users alone but in its future potential. When you think of it, the value can be the same whether the number of buyers/sellers is 1 billion or 10 0000. As long as it is becoming more desirable according to its potential

Yes, you're not far - certainly sounds like fiat - but instead of "too big to go bust" I advocate "too small to go bust" by my compensation scheme. It is the smallholders who determine the fate of bitcoin. How they react will determine the fate of speculators as well as the whole industry formed around bitcoin.

Interesting. I just read in another more recent thread that there will be changes among the foundation members. Perhaps it should be purged. Public, Ricardian, oversight with everything transparent?

I cannot give any advice only tell you what I will do. I will start buying before the beginning of next week, probably already tomorrow. I bought some when the price was around US 550. My technique is simple. When the price has gone down enough and there is a loss on the earlier investment I buy more at some stage well below the previous investment. That way when the prices go up I will get the earlier investment back twice as fast than just by waiting. If the same thing repeats itself I will also repeat the same thing.
You can think of it this way also. All of us I suppose have some ready cash on a personal bank account, some less some more.  For me, the amount was the same 5 years ago and it will be the same after 5 years. But when I look at the balance after 5 years, the interest earned is close to 0. So if you have a steady balance which remains unchanged you can afford to invest in bitcoin and wait for 5 years or more if necessary. Makes no difference. But I got a funny feeling that after another 5 years my bitcoins will have earned more than the bank's 0 percent. Perhaps even after 5 weeks. 
Of course one can make money whether the price goes up or down by harvesting the hourly bumps in price as the daytraders do. That however requires full-time commitment. 
So I guess the situation is trickiest for those who invest on the top of the wave fearing to be left behind and then selling when the panic sets in. Day traders can always make a buck and so can the long-term investors.

I guess this is what the Reddit CEO referred at. Yishan Wong heavily criticized Bitcoin evangelists on the very site he runs, calling out the hysteria that can fill Bitcoin forums there. I agree with it but I don't included Krawisz articles under this critizism. Just commenting on what you and others point out above this issue. Krawisz articles are well-thought, although a bit optimistic for the taste of many. I like his use of metaphors especially. You need to be able to speculate with your thoughts as well as with your money.
Still remember planet Nibiru and bitcoins a year ago? 
The story continues. According to the latest video on YouTube  the missing Malaysian plane was captured by the Niburians. On the board of it a murky character with a stolen patent and stashed somewhere on the plane 400 million US dollars - in bitcoins, of course. The video is in Spanish - so I decided to produce this short resumen.

PBOCK in its recent statements incidates that Chinese authorities will start treating Bitcoin as a **commodity**, thus making it difficult for buyers to obtain it in mainland China through bank transactions. Chinese already have in place a scheme by which this can be circumvented as far as other commodities are concerned. I am confident that bitcoin can be plugged or is being plugged in that scheme also, to allow Chinese better control of the **yuan exchange rate**.
Other commodities, iron ore, gold etc. are traded in Chinese offshore-inshore trade in a fashion which allows the goods stay outside China while the value circulates electronically between the China mainland and the offshore (cyberspace actually – the goods do not move anywhere) and the speculators can also make huge profits by circulating their phantom goods up to 10 times between the mainland and offshore, taking cheap dollar loans offshore and changing the dollars into higher-interest paying yuan loans onshore and pocketing the difference as long as the Credit Line period by the Chinese Central Bank for a particular good is valid. It is a Triangular scheme, a fairly complicated one, of which zerohedge gives a host of details in this  and its other more recent articles.
I am sorry about repeating my previous message elsewhere, but I have some experience in collaborating with one trade involving metals for a power plant and can see the potential. It all depends on Chinese will manipulate their commodities trade in the future.

They only need to make one basic calculation: multiply 1 billion (inhabitants in China) with the number of bitcoins available. For that basic math they can use the good old-fashioned Abacus  , the rest of the scheme is a bit more complicated to keep the hobbyist outside. Just check the volumes of Huobi and other Chinese exchanges and compare them with those elsewhere. What Chinese authorities do, I think, is rationable and defensible from their viewpoint. Just check the Chinese commodities speculation scheme and you can see that bitcoin can be plugged in there.

I hope you followed the logic behind my explanation. I don't worry about loosing 20% in a short run as I look forward earning much more - as I have done in the past. I don't pretend always winning and I don't believe anyone who tells me having never lost anything - like a "warrior" boasting about his exploits without being able to demonstrate a scratch on his skin. Anyway, it's great fun and not very expensive really. Imagine how much an MBA would cost - here you can learn the same with much less cost.
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:41:25
in which way? I am really honestly interested in hearing your opinion. I am advocating something but interested hearing also what is behind your grudge against the foundation?
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:20:51
The article fonfirms what I said in my previous post just a while ago - for Chinese, bitcoin being treated as a commodity will be a great opportunity: 
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:19:56
I would certainly be interested of hearing what is the "point" of bitcoin for you? To put my point more succinctly: bitcoin will succeed only if the great masses start using it. If they get scared away by the losses, that will reduce bitcoin's value and the hoarders would suffer as well. I think each one should look at their self-interest. As far as bitcoin is concerned, I am not suggesting that there is anything intrisically wrong with it.  But we need to manipulate its environment to a certain degree to make the ecosystem viable
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:17:42
China's authorities can easily meet this challenge by declaring a zero-children policy. To make it effective will take several years and will cause a lot of argumentation like this bitcoin thread. At the end, they will notice that the world has changed, and the policy must change too before it in fact has been applied properly.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:59:06
Once the information that bitcoin from now on will be treated as a commodity in China, it won't take long until that bit of information will be used to its full potential. You can buy any types of commodities with Yuan with great tax benefits. I hope bitcoin is going to stay as commodity there. You can also sell commodities. You can set up a triangular scheme which will multiply your gains. One needs to make a switch from a currency trader to commodities.

That's kind of summarizes the whole point of this discussion. Thanks for your decisive insight.
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:13:28
I just re-read my own proposal and I found it brilliant. I shouldn't perhaps have let the cat out of the bag - I think I will create an exchange based on those principles I advocate. The smallholders (registered, of course) would be assured of no loss of bitcoins. I can live without hoarders if they do not turn up. But I know some will. Keep on feeding MtGox if you wish. Going to sleep now for even better ideas- thanks for useful comments.

Learn first to differentiate between bitcoin and batcoin. Never mind batcoin is going up strong right now.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:40:58
China would do very well keeping its options open and bitcoin alive among other things, When the US 7 trillion IOUs crash on their lap, they need not only one but several alternatives. Yuan is not for everyone's taste. I think around April 7-8 they need to take stock of the developments. The forthcoming currency war's first stage might take a year or more and the preparations for it should have started not now but in good time last year already.

I know a quite a few places where you can get a bitcoin with iPhone if that helps.

How about:
Bitcoin customer found dead,
Last night an unknown bitcoin customer was found dead on the Cape Town dockyard. Police suspects suicide. When his computer was checked, 3.12 bitcoins were found in the wallet and evidence of some recent payment. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:38:19
False hope, I am afraid. But you still have time for few days. Once the Chinese holiday week ends they will flock to BTC-e (to buy) unless Huobo et al get their act together before that. Prices will start rising rapidly after April 5th - April 7th would be my bet.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:48:02
Correct me if I am wrong. Chinese authorities assert that bitcoin is a **commodity**. So the same rules should apply to bitcoin as to any other commodities. You import commodities to China, through offshore trade with its kinks, and pay with yuan. If you don't have that money, you can go to the Central Bank of China and they will graciously supply you with a Credit Line which you can use during certain period of time to buy that particular commodity as many times as you choose. Unless the rules have changed recently, that is. This is the way Yuan rate is controlled, not by international conferences or announcements. Please, correct me if I am wrong, especially if there has been recent changes in the commodities law in China.
