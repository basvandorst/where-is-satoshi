I bought my 2016 Nissan Skyline GT-R using Bitcoin (entirely). The seller accepted it, however he said he would not keep it, and instead transfer it to cash. I agree, it most likely will become a niche currency to purchase expensive things with... easy and cheap
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:22:33
I agree, time to step things up!

Being an Australian Citizen and understanding the market economics, we definitely entail all prerequisites for a system recession. This conservative Government holds the key to displaying the tip of the iceberg to the world. These next few years are going to become very tough for the working class. Buy Bitcoin, Short the Banks!

Time to take some profits? Haha, chart does look ultra parabolic

I remember seeing a middle-aged guy reading up on the Nano Ledger S wallet while at the Skytower Starbucks in Tokyo early 2018. There’s certainly a lot of interest in crypto in Japan/asia

Yeah, nah... That’s not how it works...

Since you know so much, what’s his ‘agenda’? It’s hard to place belief in anyone or anything, but what I know is that this man has released the dark, ugly truth and allowed the public with an insight into all the atrocities and inhumane shit that certain elitist countries/governments have collectively perpetuated to gain benefit. He’s not benefitting one bit from his actions, rather, his life is probably hell. But what he did was necessary for freedom on every level. Good on him - Shame on you for not understanding.

Lol, you’ll be going down with the rest of the brainwashed world with an ignorant attitude like that. Good luck buddy.

Without whistleblowers whom seek justice by exposing the heinous crimes committed by entities, corporations and governments, we’re all just living, obeying and accepting our suppression. Be grateful for his actions.

Damn inexperienced Cage Operators... Wojak only just started working at Amazon today! Had to regain his losses from scam CUM Coin. 
Maybe this was another ploy from one of the Bogdanoffs

Not the most practical car in this age, but would be fun for a cruise on the occasion for sure! I use to have a Datsun 240z sport coupe. It was fairly small, being only 2 seat, but the nose stuck out like Pinocchio and you'd have to do gym just to gain forearm strength to drive it. Old cars are the best

You can almost buy everything using Digital Currencies like Bitcoin. I was considering buying a new AMG Merc last month using BTC. To my amaze the dealer was willing to accept my offer even though he hadn't any experience with a Bitcoin transaction. This is a great indication to me. No matter the price volatility, acceptance is growing widely and rapidly, so why cash out when you can pay for things much easier in crypto?

Holding is for people who 1.) See potential and want to support/use this tech rather then be a fiat slave  2.) Aren't a trader 3.) Have patience
