Are directly mined bitcoins an "unrealized gain"?
Just wondering if mining is taxed, or simply converting to fiat is taxed.

1.) suggest you include a time-stamp for when the transaction was submitted.
2.)Also you may want to include a timer that measures the time between the transaction being submitted and the transaction being confirmed (x) times.
3.) Add a $ symbol to the number being displayed over the number pad.  It will make the display more intuitive for cashiers and customers alike. (it also just looks better)
here's a picture of what my suggestions might look like:

Current regulatory standards for currency are based on transactions.  There is a tax every time a sum of money is moved.  (income tax, sales tax, estate tax).  
Bitcoin systematically resists this type of regulation because there is no definitive way to "prove"(with definitive and complete certainty) the amount of bitcoin an individual owns/transacts unless the individual provides the information.  Even in a self-reporting situation, individuals can under-report their holdings and evade taxes.
I see the future of bitcoin regulation moving towards businesses and exchanges since it would be easier to detect fraud in an audit.

Funny, but false premise.  mtgox was an exchange.  Once you deposit your coins in an exchange, they (the exchange) have control of your coins.
I hope most of the bitcoin community uses a wallet with secure private keys.  I could be wrong though.

yep you understood.  I did a broadcast to all my buddies living nearby.

OP, this post led to research that ended up in real life donations to my wallet.  Give me your BTC address and I'll send you half as a thank you.

That's how I learned about bitcoin!  Nowadays I find myself answering the questions instead of asking them.

Just wanted to say thanks for your comment.  I hope it reminds people that one beauty of the bitcoin experiment is that *you control your currency*.
