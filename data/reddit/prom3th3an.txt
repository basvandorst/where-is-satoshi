How much did they charge in fees when you bought the bitcoin in the first place?
@_date: 2015-06-02 03:58:15
Why not just make the miners wait 100 blocks before they get rewarded?
@_date: 2015-06-27 05:22:31
So it's basically a multisig with the receiver as one of the signatories?
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:54:17
Well yeah, you can't really expect a fossil fuel to fossilize when the stuff it's made from is still alive.
@_date: 2015-06-25 01:31:59
Because the wiiiings don't last long enough?
@_date: 2015-06-02 03:56:16
So instead of choosing the longest chain, choose the one with the greatest total difficulty?
@_date: 2015-06-16 08:14:14
Yeah, but if nobody's enforcing the law, who's to say "thou shalt not steal" IS the law? Some radical anarchocommunists will say claiming property and trying to keep it away from a thief who needs it is against the moral and "natural" law.
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:35:16
Yes it does -- no regulation = no law for it to be against.
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:48:40
Would the real bitcoin please stand up?
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:16:15
No, because only white people are expected to spend more on their kids' food and healthcare than what child labour pays.

At least with stocks, you only lose to the house in a bear market instead of all the time.

Maybe the client will hire you as a financial advisor.
@_date: 2014-12-06 16:18:57
So who's doing the mining, and what are they spending the block rewards on?
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:49:04
At least props don't have to do anything.

I, for one, will not buy *any* imports online that ship to the US (my actual home country by this time next month) or Canada (where I'm temporarily living with my dad), until I *know* what the customs and tariff costs are gonna add up to.
@_date: 2014-12-06 08:29:06
If his friends can use Reddit for themselves instead of having their dads do it, why can't he?
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:32:57
Customers want to know what the import tax will cost them. Who's going to tell them if you the seller don't?
@_date: 2014-12-06 16:07:39
Idea: the "bank" never pays out money except when someone lands on (not just passes) Go, which is when they've mined a block. And each block is worth less than the last.
And maybe give each player *several* tokens to roll around the board, each one a unit of mining hardware. You can buy more, but sometimes they'll turn out to be from Butterfly Labs and you'll lose them.
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:37:45
AFAICT, the closest thing Bitcoin has to an intrinsic value is the demand to use it for large transactions (not speculative investments or their payouts, but conversion to goods, services or fiat money) with a given frequency. If people want to make X $Y transactions per day using Bitcoin, and the average user takes Z days to cash out his or her Bitcoins for filthy fiat, then Bitcoin *needs* a market cap of at least $XY/Z to accommodate them, and those with less than $XY worth of Bitcoin and a payment to make will have an incentive to buy until the price increases. So Bitcoin will be worth a lot more in the future if it continues to be used for laundering, than if it gets relegated to a micropayment system.
@_date: 2014-11-03 09:46:38
And if everyone does like a half-competent stock broker and switches to limit orders, the exchanges will run even slower because they can't fit the order book in RAM anymore.

But a mining reward doesn't come from an address anyway -- it's an amount that didn't exist before. (Unless the pool of not-yet-existent bitcoins somehow has an address.)
@_date: 2015-05-30 02:48:56
So immature coins are coins that followed only 1 or 2 transactions from the mining pool (as a block reward, not as a transaction fee) to the merchant, which makes them unspendable... how?
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:45:09
What's an immature coin? So much for 1BTC = 1BTC...

The layout may have to change functionally as well, just like how Facebook Scrabble clones have to move the bonus squares.
@_date: 2014-12-06 04:51:52
Yes it does; if I buy something that's already in my own country then I know there'll be no tariffs. And if I buy e.g. from Newegg, then I can be sure they've already paid for the import.
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:21:03
I'm not sure whether bitcoin was actually designed to deflate. Maybe someone neglected to factor in that bitcoins would leave the economy due to erased wallets etc., and also assumed that Internet usage and/or the global "real economy" (which is basically the world population times the usefulness of what the average hour of labour makes) would reach a plateau much sooner than it did.
@_date: 2014-09-23 00:41:43
No, Doctor, I wanted a place to plug a flash drive *into* my brain...

You mean you don't *want* them to make it yours? :-þ
@_date: 2015-05-30 02:57:59
Newly minted coins do have a lineage, if we track "future block rewards" as a wallet-like account that happens to have no key or address. (Which has the advantage of letting us treat coins as a conserved quantity like energy or carbon.)
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:02:29
But aren't they canceled out by gaining the coins from previously rejected blocks? Doesn't everyone have exactly one chain that they accept, at all times, and switch to a chain that's at least as long?
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:04:46
Does that mean one has to switch to a shorter chain if the two have diverged in difficulty?
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:26:22
But is it possible for fewer coins to be in existence on the free-world chain than on the Chinese chain?
@_date: 2015-05-20 03:49:28
So you're going to charge more than half my micropayment budget as a transaction fee, but then give most of that to the power company instead of your shareholders.

The non-Windows builds probably still are, and those who care about that kind of nitpick tend not to use Windows.

How would I do it if I were starting with a non-random-but-hard-to-guess source like, say, the last email my mom sent me?

Don't worry, by the time that happens they'll be so cheap that a few lower middle income people can buy all of them.

I'm guessing the cafe owners weren't being paid by the transaction.
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:29:39
A start would be a transaction that was only valid if the recipient signed for it within a few hours.

And whoever was pushing it would be effectively campaigning for election to run a *gasp* central bank.

Although the only such reserved numbers are 0x1a0a ("USB-IF") and 0x6666 ("prototype"), you're probably also safe using 0xf055 because that's what other USB-IF resisters seem to be settling on, and you can hope that enough such people will do so to deter the USB-IF from assigning it. Vires in numeris?

Way less bureaucratic, but just as ineffective. When you reinvent the wheel, half the time you come up with a square.

Some computers will probably survive a nuclear war; it's just that they'll be centralized in bunkers, which will mean almost everyone's "last mile" (which will probably be tens or hundreds of miles long) is sneakernet.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:51:03
Wouldn't a more standards-compliant solution be to set the vendor ID to zero or a reserved value, so that your device isn't explicitly claiming to be from a specific registered vendor at all?
@_date: 2015-05-30 02:53:25
Wait, how would coins disappear? Doesn't the accepted block chain always contain at least as many blocks -- and therefore show at least as many coins in existence -- as the rejected ones that passed their checksums?

Can't be -- too much customization needed for each specific suspect, and wouldn't be worthwhile to build a template just for Madoff-level investment fraudsters.

Isn't the change output easily recognized as the one that goes to the input address (assuming there is only one, but the existence of multisig wallets should make that assumption safe) and is less than the sum of that address's inputs?

Federal licensing would be cheaper, because you wouldn't have to go through it 50 times just for the US. So much for "states' rights" eh Dr. Paul?
@_date: 2015-04-19 23:33:25
Those would be some pretty big blocks. Good chance of ending up orphaned by the blocks without movies. Maybe we could have a coin that gave a bonus for first-release pirated media, but how would the computers know it was real and in demand?
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:10:32
Maybe redesigning it to have multiple interconnected blockchains, so that there could be a steady reward for a larger number of miners, instead of each unpooled mining ASIC essentially becoming a lotto ticket.

Wait, when did it become illegal to manipulate a market that has no regulators?
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:05:26


Only because they're expecting to amortize the R&amp;D *before* they put it on the mass market.

To be fair, FDIC coverage becomes a lot more confusing in certain situations (e.g. the co-owner of a joint account dies, and the bank fails while the estate is in probate).
