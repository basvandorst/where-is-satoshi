That should be used in more bitcoin adverts

Also if for some reason you invert the order you assemble the grouped letters in but keep the pairings, you get Motonaka Toshisa.

TBH I think this is going to be the transition phase to full acceptance.  There are older people who will never be able to learn it, because of being too stubborn or whatever, and the fractional-crypto hybrid will be the best they can do till generations move on.

It means he's gon hold his bitcoin above his head over a cliff.
@_date: 2018-09-16 00:49:41
I have a feeling they'll try to do federal 'bitcoin notes' and do fractional reserve lending, with the fed 'holding' the bitcoins for people too dumb to figure out how to do it themselves. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 00:42:58
I mean, compared to 2012 is feels pretty moonish.  I think the issue is moving targets depending on when someone got interested in bitcoin or something.  
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:33:23
I feel like they should zoom out to show the USD shaking its cane at BTC riding the coaster going "DERN KIDS GET OFF MY LAWN" or something.
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:00:45
I think we're slowly building our own crypto-anarchy information markets via things like this!  Keep it up!
@_date: 2015-06-15 02:19:45
Thanks!  
I'm being vague with regards to what the business would be because it's actually several different businesses that I'm considering starting and I'm too lazy to list through all of them when asking a question.  Cereal entrepreneurship for the win! :P
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:16:23
lol that last part where the author is basically like "Well, maybe people who use bitcoin aren't terrorists but WHAT ABOUT RACISTS"
@_date: 2018-09-08 03:11:17
Time to find an alternative then.
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:13:53
What... is this humor you speak of?
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:25:55
Now kiss.
@_date: 2018-08-19 21:10:39
I mean, can't we just put bitcoin QR codes on our sites and skirt around patreon all together?
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:35:32
Yea, and I think this kid is being made an example of.  "How DARE you try to avoid us fucking you out of what you've earned."
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:24:03
Wait, it had wifi trackers and such installed on it?  That's pretty scummy.  But also, didn't none of the people actually meet the criteria yet for the reward?
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:30:54
Bop it.
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:52:08
Yea, so like, what every single person using bitcoin has done.  I think they're trying to scare people way from bitcoin with this, and slander the poor kid as some kind of uncaring psychopath that doesn't care about their wonderful godsent laws.
@_date: 2016-03-06 23:16:20
Yea, this article seems a little too much like blatant anti-bitcoin propaganda.  I dont know why that'd be target towards an area where people actually know how currency and bitcoins work.. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 22:27:29
That kid looks more 9 than 19.  Though, that might be why he needs the Dr. Octo suit.
@_date: 2019-03-02 00:22:37
Huh, I wouldn't have screwed with those demographics too much if I had put my data in.  Only the "identify as male" part.
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:14:13
Easy to steal?  Does she not know what encryption is?
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:45:41
I mean, my wallet has been encrypted and backed up in multiple places for so long that I might be wrong, but I thought a password was REQUIRED at the very least.
@_date: 2017-01-17 06:02:22
What's funny is I wanted to do something similar, but I was afraid Id be my only customer. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:09:51
I'm unfamiliar with this person.  Can I ask... WHY he would have done this?  It seems odd to have attacked emergency services.
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:35:27
I... I think this fits with D&amp;D lore about why dragons hoard too.  Where they need to consume a specific value of materials before they can die of old age.  Just eating a flash drive that has the private keys on it might work I guess if its the only copy they have of it.
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:55:44
Wait... you mean you're not?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:47:52
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:57:29
I always thought of it as something more strange atonal music made by a hipster in a bar in boston. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:20:20
All of them.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:24:48
I can't seem to find any information on if it's pre-built to do proxy stuff, so I'll assume it doesn't.  That'd be a nice feature to have so you dont have to play with proxies manually.
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:22:36
I mean, unless you're a bank like HSBC and you got to just pay a fine and keep breaking the KYC regulations with impunity when actually specifically helping drug cartels.
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:57:56
Yea, they're NOT going to out compete bitcoin.  I think what a 'successful state' will do is probably rip people off that dont understand bitcoin but are interested by starting to mint bitcoin notes.  There are going to be PLENTY of people that will buy greenback 2.0 thinking 'its backed by bitcoin so I own bitcoin!' only to have the currency inflated out of existence since it's not actually owning bitcoin yourself.
@_date: 2019-04-14 05:41:51
That's how I lost my eye.
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:10:50
Or they'll arrest you for breaching KYC regulations for having exchanged 4 dollars worth of bitcoin without spending thousands of dollars in doing background checks.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:56:36
Yes.  It seems so.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:51:30
Hmm, Im not sure if I agree with him.  As a biologist, diversification is just taking advantage of emergent systems and the true nature of reality.  The nature I'm talking about is the fact that there is always going to be an information problem.  Regardless of how well you know your field, there will always be things you cannot predict.  In biology, it means things like weather, introduction of invasive species, new adaptations that compete so much better.  Putting all your resources into one thing would be like having complete control over a species of finch and saying "THESE TWO ARE OBVIOUSLY THE BEST EVER, AND SHOULD BE THE ONLY GENOTYPES WE HAVE!"   It might work in the short term, but the second the environment changes you're screwed.  Instead, it'd probably be better to alternate or split resources from a more philosophical level.  Have the majority of a species (or your wallet) in what you think is the best, and then diversify the rest.  Which is why, from a philosophical not mathematical view, even genes that are detrimental to survival don't go away, because evolution can't 'predict' if they will one day be useful or not, and can't 'predict' if changes in the ecosystem will occur.  
@_date: 2019-01-11 08:21:30
Huh, same for me now that I checked.  Weird...
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:37:24
Oh pretty neat!
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:15:33
Or in December when its like 90k, and even the following Jan when it drops down to half its price at 45k.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:11:14
lolol good luck South Korea.
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:30:21
You've got to be... KIDding me.  :V  *gets thrown off a cliff*
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:25:08
And the article makes it seem like the miners are doing it on purpose too.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:52:48
This will probably happen during the first few months of 2019.  And by 2020 we will be crying at a drop down to 800k from its all time high of 1.8 mil.  I mean, I'm probably exaggerating, but for some reason it feels like it always jumps towards the start of a new year, then falls down to about a third of its all time new high, but is still almost orders of magnitude higher than the prior years.
@_date: 2016-10-26 01:06:22
Probably icey.  
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:52:15
I bet when it drops down to 2100 and stabilizes there, the news will have stories about how bitcoin crashed and everyone should avoid it forever even with a net doubling in price.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:38:45
@_date: 2016-07-30 18:34:03
Is there an alternative without the KCY/AML annoyance? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:33:09
I love this attitude!  I might try doing day investing, traveling back and forth between dogecoin and bitcoin as exchange rates change.
