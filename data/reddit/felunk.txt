i'll be buying chump change all the way down with you brother just in case of a spike...but looking for a value low which needs to be where it was last year...never forget the overall increase when investing and the last time it "went to the moon"....it'll hold it's new low value for a long time before the next big run up so you'll have plenty of time to get in.

LOL....i know you are so what am I!?  They are one and the same bra.  
Pyramid scheme: those in first make most of the profits of a  business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products or services.
Tell me how that differs from BTC?  You get alot of BTC, pump up it's worth by HODLing and saying how "revolutionary" it is(which it's not as it can't even function in real world applications in volume)...then when it shoots up to $20k you dump it, ez money....ever wonder why BTC conferences don't take BTC to attend, and you have to pay with credit/cash????  Because BTC doesn't work, plain and simple....
Keep telling your self it'll be ok and i'll throw you some fiat currancy when i see you on a sleeping on a sidewalk bench in a few years.  As I am 100% confident BTC will be &lt;$100 in the near future.

Pump and Dump is NOT inflation...wait till you see &lt;$1000 btc then you can start seeing it's true value versus fiat.

Got to use something EVERYONE agrees on has a value for goods and services....BTC is no different in that regard and many agreeing to use alt currencies instead that are better than BTC.....So many crypto currencies better than bitcoin, heck credit cards are already much better.  Not sure if you were paying attention but the BTC network pretty much imploded when the price was pumped...$25+ transaction fees....good luck handling black Friday with that.  Face it BTC is a pyramid scheme scam and you fell for it.
