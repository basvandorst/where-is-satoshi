There is no solving of mathematical problems in Bitcoin.  Miners basically just make trillions upon trillions of guesses (the work) at picking a 256bit number and if it randomly happens to meet certain strict criteria and they beat all other competitors they get a block reward and add their block to the chain. This guessing 'work' that miners are doing all over the world is what secures the blockchain against hacking.

It's more like a volatile currency than a stock. Think of it like buying and selling Rubles.  Market timing/ Day trading is risky. Statistically you are more likely to lose money just like gambling since even if you are right half the time, you still have to pay trading fees.

Elliptic curve cryptography is vulnerable to quantum computing. Hashing is not.  Therefore providing a public address (receiving bitcoin) would not compromise the private key since the public address is a hash.

"For Bitcoin to work, the proof-of-work that miners do must have the following properties:
Easy to verify solutions
Hard to find solutions
Difficulty of finding solutions can be precisely quantified
Provably inseparable from the block it secures
Cryptographic hash functions like SHA256 satisfy these four properties. I don't think automated theorem proving fits the bill because, as far as I'm aware, there is no way to prove how difficult it was to find the theorem that you proved. General purpose grid computing, like BOINC, doesn't fit the easy-to-verify requirement, at least in the context of Bitcoin. (In fact, I think this is an active area of research in grid computing, called the "cheating problem".)
If there is some proof-of-work scheme that satisfies these three properties and also has some useful computation as a side-effect, that would be interesting. I'm not aware of any."

My question assumes a government wants to do this.  For instance maybe it feels the cat is already out of the bag on criminal use since Bitcoin exists but at least it could have some control over transactions by controlling the servers (for example by blocking transactions from certain IP addresses). That control (and also the promotion of its currency as an e-currency solution) is what would justify the server cost. Once verified, transactions would be irreversible.

The transaction would not appear if the funds are not there. Theoretically I suppose a hacker with access to your mobile wallet could execute a double spend after you made a purchase but in that case he might as well just steal your bitcoins. Also for a customer to attempt a double spend he would need a special wallet (script) which would formulate the merchant transaction in one way (for example with no transaction fee) and the self pay transaction in another way more likely to be accepted by a miner.  Standard wallets do no permit this.
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:36:33
The reason there will probably only ever be 21 million bitcoins produced is that is what the (open source) Bitcoin algorithm specifies. Any change would require a majority of the miners (currently approx. 60,000) that secure the blockchain to switch to a new algorithm.

So a guy pays for a big gulp with Bitcoin and then walks out of the store and immediately sends the same bitcoins to himself? Assuming a different node received the 2nd transaction, there would be a 50/50 chance the merchant would not receive payment. Instead why not just walk out of the store with the big gulp without paying? Either way it's theft. You can't go back to the store ever again and if there was a store camera you might get arrested either way.

The only way to compensate the miners is with transaction fees.  Therefore transferring a "colored coin" representing a land title or 1000 shares of Apple stock, for example, would only require a small transaction fee.

Yes you can copy a private key as many times as you want just like a house key. But it doesn't change the amount of bitcoins that the key (password) controls.
I think you may be considering that if you save a bunch of addresses along with their private keys that you might be able to check back later and see if someone else is also using any of those addresses and steal their bitcoins? This won't happen because there are so many different possible private keys they will not be duplicated by someone else.

I didn't say it would cost $600 million for the government to mount a 51% attack. It might cost more or less than that amount. Regardless, now Bitcoin transactions are frozen. So we change the POW algorithm and the government mounts a 51% attack on that chain for less cost, etc.

A Bitcoin address is a public key (like an email address) that allows you to receive bitcoins and there is a corresponding private key (like a password) that permits you to spend bitcoins. You can reuse a public address since your private key is kept secret by the network and not revealed when you spend bitcoins. You cannot copy bitcoins since each one is kept track of on the Bitcoin ledger (blockchain).

It would be easiest enough for a bank to 'convert' fiat into an equal amount of its own cryptocurrency but regulators would not permit peer to peer transfer of this cryptocurrency since it would violate KYC and AML regulations.

It might be bad for Bitcoin since centralized crypotocurrencies could have the same advantage of peer to peer value transfer with the added benefits of quicker less expensive transactions and less volatility (since most people don't care about decentralization as an end in itself).

That's correct. Miners start mining for a new block as soon as the previous block is received before transaction can be added to the block. This is a minute or 2 of "dead time" while the block filled with transactions is created.  If the miner happens to get lucky and guess a solution quickly then an "empty" block is added to the blockchain. If not the miner starts mining the "full" block instead. These quickly added empty blocks do not slow down overall transaction processing.

It's not about risk. Both BTC and cash are bearer instruments (there's no such thing as phony BTC). The reason there is a premium for BTC is BTC is harder to acquire than cash and there is less liquidity locally than on an exchange.

Because of arbitrarily small block size. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 05:31:05
The miner takes a bunch of data (which includes the previous block hash, a list of one or more transactions and a variable) which it performs a hash function on, which results in a random looking 256 bit number. If that number is not smaller than the target number then the miner changes the variable and tries again.  
The target number is adjusted about every 2 weeks so that it is small enough that it takes all the mining power in the world about 10 minutes for someone to find a low enough hash result.

Flex caps punish miners who increase block size by making it more difficult for them to find blocks,  again artificially restricting the block size. What would be better is a dynamic max block size that increases along with Moore's law to maintain security and permit on chain scaling.

“It Will Take Two or Three Years Before all Exchanges Are Shut Down in China”
Cindy23Sep 11, 2017, 19:25
in Regulation 1 0 311
Note: Xiao Lei, writer of this article, is a well-known financial commentator and a digital currency researcher.
China Securities Journal and Caixin reported last weekend that regulatory agencies are likely to ban all digital currency exchanges, including leading bitcoin exchanges such as BTCChina, Huobi and OkCoin.
Both China Securities Journal and Caixin are credible news sources. China Securities Journal is a subsidiary of Xinhua News Agency, and one of its missions is to propagandize relevant policies and guidelines concerning economy, finance and securities.
The “mysterious” man mentioned in the news is probably a person who attended the panel discussion on how to impose regulation on the bitcoin economy held in Beijing last week. And the regulatory authority mentioned in the news is a special leading group set up ad hoc last year to manage and control Internet financial risks.
Attached to the State Council, the leading group implements the State Council’s policies to encourage valuable innovations in internet finance and establish long-term mechanism monitoring and crack down any illegal financial activities.
The Group believes that the hot bitcoin market is one of the root causes of the craze of cryptocurrencies and ICOs market. In other words, bitcoin market shall be regulated first before regulations be imposed on the ICOs market.
Secondly, the Group points that since one can buy any portion of a bitcoin, which is similar to dividing security interest. As such, bitcoin transactions are by their very nature illegal securities activities.
Thirdly, the Group clarifies that bitcoin is no blockchain, neither are bitcoin exchanges.
The three statements explain why the group think it is necessary to ban bitcoin exchanges. They want the market get a glimpse of upcoming regulations first and see how the market will react.
Furthermore, the Group notes that digital exchanges are not useful for technical development. Instead, they leave room for crimes to raise fund illegally. And bitcoin exchanges have done nothing to help grow real economy.
Some local governments are supportive of regulatory sandboxes that industrial players have been asking for. But the Group says that “there should be no green-lights”. As to the investment threshold, the Group believes that market risks would be decreased if threshold to be increased, but it will not avoid financial risks and social risks. In addition, if they recognize the legitimacy of digital currencies, they have to endorse them.
In a word, the Group denies all of the prerequisites for exchanges to operate.
Here I’m going to talk a little bit about how to carry out regulations.
The PBoC has the right to determine the nature of many currency and finance services; but it only notices risks and offers suggestions when many departments are involved. The announcement on Sept 4th is actually providing legal basis for the Group.
Though the Group is unanimous that bitcoin exchanges must be regulated, it depends on local governments when carrying out specific rules. Simply, local governments determine to shut down bitcoin exchanges or not. As major exchanges are all based in Beijing, it’s important to analyze Beijing’s policies first.
According to the regulatory document released by the Beijing leading group that is more specific and strict than that of the PBOC,
 all platforms must stop services between CNY and tokens/virtual currencies.
 platforms shall not provide pricing or serve as information intermediary for tokens or virtual currencies. If the terms are strictly implemented, all bitcoin exchanges should be shut down.
If the document only means to ban ICO tokens, then these platforms would simply transform to bitcoin exchanges. Even worse, if the big three are allowed to operate, then why other exchanges can’t considering no one in the industry has a license? Therefore, I assume the document is not only made to regulate ICOs, but to provide basis to supervise bitcoin exchanges.
As local governments, they will only be more tough when the responsibility fall on their shoulders.
What’s next?
As for major exchanges, they have done some job in account registration and anti-money laundering. Besides, they are relatively legitimate since they have been interacting with the PBOC. And daily transaction volumes of major exchanges surpass over 100 billion CNY. If they were banned altogether, it might bring about tremendous social insecurity. But regulatory authorities could start with limiting new registration and CNY deposit to reduce trade volumes and end up banning all exchanges. This would not be done overnight, probably will take two or three years.
Disclaimer: I personally don’t agree that bitcoin exchanges shall all be banned.

BEIJING—Chinese authorities plan to shut down domestic bitcoin exchanges, delivering a final blow to a once-thriving industry of commercial trading for virtual currencies, which took off inside the mainland four years ago.
The country’s central bank has led a draft of instructions that would ban Chinese platforms from providing virtual currency trading services, according to people familiar with the matter. The move comes after months of scrutiny by Beijing, including a ban last week in China on initial coin offerings, a kind of fundraising via virtual currencies.
Regulators in China have been investigating the domestic market for bitcoin and other virtual currencies since the beginning of the year. For a while, officials considered enacting antimoney-laundering rules on exchanges, even circulating a draft of such rules for them to follow.
But the stakes for Beijing grew as prices of virtual currencies like bitcoin soared, adding to the risk of further speculation by domestic investors. Analysts and investors say one reason bitcoin prices rose last year was that Chinese people began using the asset as a way to bet that the value of the yuan would fall. Virtual currencies in theory can allow holders to bypass the traditional banking system to move money outside of China’s capital-controlled borders.
The People’s Bank of China didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Officials from the central bank, cyberspace administration and banking, securities and other regulatory bodies considered various options for months but ultimately came to a consensus to shut down virtual currency exchanges, said the people.
“Too much disorder was naturally a basic reason” for the ban, said one of the people. The price of one bitcoin traded at around $4,279 Monday morning in Beijing, down 16% from its record on Sept. 1. 
Trading volumes have already plummeted in China, with authorities stepping up efforts to rein in exchanges. Analysts say more activity is moving underground, where individuals can send virtual currencies to each other using private addresses, which serve like safe-deposit boxes.
The people said that regulators will likely to have to tolerate noncommercial trading of virtual currencies. “The government also doesn’t have the power to control” that, said one person.
Two of the China’s largest domestic bitcoin exchanges, Huobi and BTCC, said over the weekend that regulators haven’t asked them to shut down, even as speculation grows. “We’re still awaiting formal notification from regulators,” said BTCC Chief Executive Bobby Lee. “It’s obviously a sensitive time period.”
A Huobi spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the firm’s press release. Another domestic exchange, OKCoin, didn’t respond to request for comment.

@_date: 2015-09-13 15:53:47
Assuming Szabo is correct that the key distinguishing feature of Bitcoin is automated security which permits censorship resistant transactions one can boil down the block size argument to risk of double spending. As max block size increases mining becomes more costly which decreases network security and increases the risk of a double spend attack. However, if max block size is not increased and confirmation times increase (or become more costly due to transaction fees) there is also an increased risk of double spending. Slower and more expensive transaction confirmations would also result in decreased utilization which would lower the value of bitcoin which would make mining more costly and decrease mining security.

No need to worry. When transaction processing suffers enough as a result of stress tests/spam attacks along with the inevitable increase in valid transactions over time, the value of bitcoin will drop enough to scare the miners into accepting a BIP that raises the max block size limit.  I believe the Chinese mining pools which represent over 60% of hash power have already agreed in principle to raise to 8MB. So the writing is on the wall. The rest is just fine print...

Whenever a  permissionless blockchain use case depends on an external legacy system functionality (whether it’s an exchange or registrar or oracle) it always exposes that use case to the regulations and whims and limitations of that legacy system.
Using “watermarked” tokens to track ownership of “real world” assets will not work within the current legacy system for the reasons described in the paper.
 
However, imagine a para-legacy system where two or more parties agree ahead of time to waive their legacy rights (for example when parties agree to mediation) and instead agree that the “watermarked” token is the definitive and final determinant of ownership of an asset. They may decide that all the caveats listed in the paper regarding settlement finality, attack susceptibility, etc. are nevertheless better than the current (Bernie Madoff, subprime mortage, HFT, judge dependent) system. Now imagine if one of those parties was a country like Honduras and the asset was a land title.

"Bitcoin uses a democratic system for determining which blockchain to use. Because the puzzle uses both the previous entry in the blockchain and the new block to add, the number of attempts towards solving the puzzle will act as a vote for a particular blockchain. The blockchain with the most votes will obviously be the correct one, since most users agree on its contents. The number of attempts is found using the mathematical probability for solving the puzzle. If an attacker wanted to use his version of the blockchain, it would be very unlikely for him or her to out-compute other users[6][7]."
That is not an accurate description. Instead:
Participants verify the contents of each block (to confirm each transaction is valid) and also to confirm a correct solution to the 'proof of work' has been found for the block before it is added to the previous chain of blocks.  In the event that a second correct proof of work block is found before the 'first' block is broadcast throughout the entire network, each part of the network will assume it's own block is the correct one until the next correct proof of work block is found at which point the longer chain is considered the correct chain and the other block on the shorter chain is orphaned (it is deleted from the blockchain and its transaction are added back to the list of unconfirmed transactions).

Your idealism about blockchain is naive.
Also it's not the blockchain per se that provides decentralized trust.  Its proof of work. Moreover the only asset you can transfer using this type of decentralized network is a digital asset or token. You cannot use it to transfer a physical asset without implementing a trusted centralized custodian.

The only reason it's considered low risk is that Bitcoin usage in general is small.  Going forward we need to get over the idea that sending encrypted money or encrypted information is a crime.  Punish the crime itself not the privacy.

If the use cases involve micro transactions won't both parties have to be running on the 21 inc. network?

Whenever there is competition for resources a small percentage will always gain an advantage. If you try to redistribute resources in a free market system wealth  will eventually revert back to a Pareto distribution.

Banks only create cash when they loan money but even if they did create unlimited cash that would only cause the cash to lose value. It doesn't create wealth.  Bitcoin would remain scarce and therefore it wouldn't matter how much money they printed.

"...The original code for Bitcoin was designed to produce a fixed amount. Its popularity has meant the digital currency is coming to its limit faster than many expected.
Among Bitcoin's core engineers there is a division about how to fix this problem.
One group advocates doubling the size of the "blocks" in Bitcoin, something that could help, but may be short-term. Another group advocates rewriting its underlying protocols to have far more blocks - a solution that would make old Bitcoins incompatible with the new ones..."

If they double their mining equipment the cost of equipment and electricity is doubled in order to mine the same amount of bitcoins they were mining before the halving which will no longer be profitable for some miners. Imagine if gold suddenly became twice as difficult/expensive to mine. This assumes no change in network hash rate.

Blocks are added to the blockchain approx. every 10 minutes regardless of how many transactions are in the block. There is always at least one transaction in each block (the "coinbase" transaction which gives the miner the bitcoin reward for finding the new block (currently 12.5 btc).

The goal should be equality of opportunity not equality of wealth. In a free market in general smarter people and harder working people or people with smarter and harder working parents will acquire more wealth. Bitcoin is just a tool that facilitates wealth preservation.  
The free market is what drives creation of wealth in the first place. If you just distribute all wealth equally there is no motivation to be productive or create wealth (tragedy of the commons). If you want to see what happens if you redistribute wealth back to society look at Venezuela. 
Wealth inequality is not a perfect outcome but unfortunately it is the best possible outcome. Ultimately you can either have wealth inequality or no wealth at all.

The target could be smaller than a small target or bigger than a big target. Or it could be a small middle range. It just has to be a small enough range of hashes that it takes 10 min on average for all the miners in the world to make one correct 'guess' within that adjustably small range.
