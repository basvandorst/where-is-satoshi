Hey, wonderful to hear you've backed it.  I think April is realistic.  I've deliberately set the target funding quite high to ensure that we can actually get it done and out on time.  
In terms of playtesting we did a lot internally and then also with multiple groups of strangers outside and in a boardgaming cafe.  The economics aren't perfect yet - coins tend to hit the max and min too often, so we need to balance things with the action cards.  It's interesting to work out.  
The mining challenges are also the part that I'm least keen on.  I'm thinking about replacing it with a printed 'mining pad' that has things like puzzles in it that people have to work through.  
Ultimately, and honestly, I put a lot of time and money into it so far and in the end I felt we'd reached a point where if there's demand then we should be able to tell.  If there's no demand at this point then there's no point in ploughing more time and resource into it.  But I'm hopeful that there will be.  
I'm not a boardgame expert - and marketing definitely isn't my forté.  Feel free to post it anywhere that you think might have interest!

I'm out too... on the beer, and I'll be paying the bill with BTC like I do every week (Anker bar, Budapest).  The past few months has been like a magic beer glass that just refills itself every week after I drank it.
