Why? You're just putting money into the hands of miners. I know you could say the same for credit cards but it's less money and it comes with benefits. If you want to promote crypto at least support one that works.

I don't understand why the bitcoin.com forum is on btc info page as well as bitcoin talk. There is no forum on bch page. Really makes no sense at all.

Always use your credit card when buying on line, you get protection if the company fails to deliver or some other problem. No idea why you would want to use any other type of payment on line unless you're dealing in drugs.

Yeah, b-cash gets a lot of hate from people who hold bitcoin. Why hate a coin which is practically the same but works and doesn't need segwit/lightning. 
Still, if you're going to buy something online then I'm afraid credit cards are still the best solution. Downvote away!!!

Since the banks don't own anything yet, and they're not stupid, I can't see why they want to buy it now when it's hyper-inflated. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:42:24
At least this one does something useful!
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:07:43
Because some companies now check back on the blockchain to see if the bitcoin was ever stolen. If it has they might not want it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:44:56
but you might get paid by bitcoin stolen in the past. In effect you are laundering money as they will get your car and be able to sell it for cash to someone else.
Don't sell items with bitcoin. It's not safe.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:15:43
That might be later this week then!

90% of users think Bitcoin will increase in value.
Coincidence or not?
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:04:20
It's polite to say you have a financial interest in something when giving advice. Otherwise one might assume he was just hyping the price.

Red flags on this company. Evidence Below:
1. Quote "We just launched one of our most requested features"
You claim to sell gold, and yet, your customers don't ask for trading features, they ask "How can I refer customers to you and get commission?" Yeah right.
2.Within seconds of your post someone replies and says what a great idea. (
Nothing to do with you I bet.
Don't even get me started on how scammy your site is.
Suggest you change it to say.
"Give me your Bitcoin suckers"

Do you mean not to click the link.
Clicking on my new mail icon opens everything, ain't no way i no whats there without opening it is there?
Anyway, I just reported the user as spam and blocked him when I saw the link.

London taxi drivers are too intelligent to want to take a payment that would result in less money for them.
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:40:21
a) Waiting for confirmation takes time. Time=money.
b) Not many cabs take credit cards, where they do they charge extra
c) Taxi's like cash as they often get to keep the change,
d) Practically nobody would use it.
So apart from that it's a great idea
@_date: 2016-01-27 01:05:08
Pyramid scam

So what? As the definition in the post says its narrow money converted to usd .If it's already in usd then it doesn't need to be converted.

This guy has some bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:54:12
I must be too thick then
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:37:24
Yeah, but went to the pub and they wanted five dollars transaction fee and I still had to wait 10 minutes to get served. Apparently the new thing is this thing like paper where you hand it over and just get server instantly for no extra charge. Check it out, it'd going to be massive.

Treat Kraken like EA.
ideally don't use it and never go back

How the hell does a virtual currency that is supposed to replace banks take days to confirm a transaction still be worth $6k?

In the article it says the police tweeted the pic as a warning to others. WTF!

Bitcoin went up a tiny bit. Tomorrow it might go up.
Or it might go down.

There's a great meme for 2k.
Maybe get to see it again in June?
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:49:30
I've been hearing this story for years. Still not happened though has it? Fortunately for you it looks like most governments will regulate enough to protect idiots like yourself from becoming more delusional.
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:53:09
I said maybe. But we will def see 2k at some point.

Are you trying to fight a war with people that don't exist?
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:04:57
Well that's a can of worms. Do you mean:
a) Valuable as in I can sell it to someone else for more money than I Paid for it.
b) Valuable because it's going to change the world.
I vote a).
 Sorry had to edit as reddit seems to have lost the plot formatting original post

The banks don't want your coins they want your dollars. You gave your dollars to someone else who probably put them in his bank. You've been left with something worth less than a tulip.
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:17:42
My bad, mean Reddit accepting these adverts for obvious scams not the reddit admins of individual groups like this. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:34:18
I never said I was smart, how did you assume that would be the case? Ahh, penny dropped.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:41:44
Well done, wish I'd done the same. I've learnt from the experience that just because something is all hype and no substance doesn't stop people from buying into it. Lesson learnt for me. However, long term btc has no value.
 By 2020, probably but I never thought this come back could have happened. However, 4 years ago only a few percent of the population new what bitcoin was, I think everyone has now so next rise can't rely on new people coming in to build momentum. So yeah, probably not.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:16:22
Lets face it, you can't buy coffee with it can you?
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:39:58
Imagine how long it would take to play monopoly with bitcoins. Plus everyone would go bust with the transaction fees leaving a Chinese miner as the winner.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:01:05
Only 21 million. Nah, we get a few new coins added every day, each bringing another 20 million a day to the pot. If anyone could explain why the first one to the pot is worth more than the second I'd like to hear it? I mean the first currency in the world was what? And what's that worth now (Not as a piece of history mind!)
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:48:30
Only people that want bitcoins are people that think they can sell them for more in the future. 
And idiots.
Which are you?
