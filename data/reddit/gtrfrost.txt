Good on you dude. I know how you feel having had two password related dramas. Turned out it was not me forgetting my password but blockchain.info says there is an error decrypting password when the password is correct. I think it is a bug around session ids or something. Again I know how you feel. You have to take alot of precautions with bitcoin accounts, more than an email account..

I hope the "low cost labor" get payed in bitcoin

so just let it happen and let everybody evolve to the influence of bot trades. Remember bots can buy and sell to them selves and can totally dictate the price. Max Keiser pointed the out with silver manipulation where the closing price was miraculously the same for 3 days in a row..
It looked like the person operating the bots forgot to change the values, probably on sick leave..

As someone who cleans bots from reports for a living i would suggest that each account is only allowed X numbers of trades per minute. It wont stop distributed bots but it will bring a little pain for them to work around it.

If people can talk about technical ways try to solve the problem eg trotting or captcha why is it not ok to talk about a pricing solution?

I remember thinking i should pod the bot miners in Eve that spam the mine fields, but then i would be the criminal who gets hunted down. You cant pod bitcoin bots :(

It seems to me that the immediate bounce back in price is due to residual buy orders from set and forget traders.

alot of people are now in the process of typing in their passwords to blockchain right now.
I suggest that you use an on screen keyboard and enter in your password with a mouse. To mitigate the risk of key logging malware.

build an anti bot bot to invert the scam trades
