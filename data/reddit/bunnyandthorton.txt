have you ever thought the price of gold is manipulated because central banks do it to buy up gold?

and erik is invested in bitcoin. what's the problem?
@_date: 2018-11-14 08:06:10
it is created from nothing, and it's utility can be replicated ad infinitum through the creation of alternate cryptos. what exactly makes it rare and unique if its utility can be replicated?
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:22:12
And what is stopping the duplication of bitcoin-technology? You're essentially just saying that bitcoin is good because it's popular. gotcha.... so what happens when it's no longer popular (because people realize that there isn't anything inherently valuable and scarce about something that can be replicated)? the only thing driving it's popularity is speculation, it's the first horse in the race. that's it. that's the "value" of bitcoin, nothing more.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:47:11
yeah but it's still based on technology, and technology can be recreated.

the fed balance sheets are the hyperinflation
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:25:13
if the value of bitcoin had been going down for 10 years, would you all still be as enthusiastic about it? it seems to me everybody cares about bitcoin because they are looking to make money on it eventually, which means it's just a speculative asset and not "money".
@_date: 2018-11-14 08:15:47
it's a technology, therefore it can be replicated. there goes the "deflation" aspect.
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:16:33
Other minerals and elements serve specific functions, there is only a limited supply of each in the earth's crust. As it stands we are unable to reproduce each element and mineral...whereas with blockchain technology, an unlimited number of units can be created and replicated. After all, it's just technology, it's not anything unique and unable to be reproduced. Unless you are claiming that we are incapable of recreating technology?

wow, to go through all that effort for such a "useless" piece of metal. why not put that energy toward mining bitcoins? LOL

more gold in our lives will make us all wealthier, a crashed comet full of gold will not devalue our love and uses for gold.

so you'd rather him not support what he believes in?

because of speculation, because it's popular and they think it'll get even more popular. \*\*nobody owns bitcoin solely for the sake of owning it.\*\*
\&gt;  The point is that Bitcoin happens to be the winner right now.
and that does not mean it's inherently valuable, it's just a speculative asset.
\&gt; The mere existence of Silver does not make Gold worthless.
that is an unrelated point, because both of them represent wealth and the more wealth there is, the wealthier we all are. bitcoin, however, is based on imaginary number crunching that doesn't actually serve any utility because it can be replicated ad infinitum.

all of those "positives" you just listed for bitcoin can apply to any other technology that mimics bitcoin. therefore, the utility of bitcoin isn't really scarce overall because alternatives can be utilized, because you should know that one of the definitions of money is scarcity. granted bitcoin is the lead horse in the race, but i'm not saying bitcoin isn't useful at all, i'm just saying the price is WAY WAY overvalued for the utility you get from bitcoin itself, therefore it is more of a speculative asset (that also serves a function). the price WILL come down overtime as my viewpoint spreads and people come to realize that technology for imaginary number crunching isn't scarce overall.
\&gt; The value of gold is also speculative. What the hell am I going to do  with gold other than trade it with people who also assign it some  arbitrary value?
gold meets all definitions of money, it is tangible, it is "unhackable", it is forever, it is cherished by all cultures around the world, it has properties that are useful and beneficial to the human condition.

i have a problem with people lauding the "currency of the future" for it's supposed "utility" and "unique" traits, when all they're really doing is hoping to make a quick buck (or hoping to recover their losses if they bought when it was 20k). why can't people be honest with themselves and just call it a speculative asset, and furthermore, call themselves speculators?
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:32:49
there is literally zero barriers to entry in creating a line of code, unlike something like Amazon or Walmart--that is not a valid analogy. because there is always a readily available copycat, why should you spend so much money on Bitcoin when you can have more currency with a cheaper alternative?
\&gt;the network
so bitcoin itself isn't valuable, it's the network....got it. so what happens once most people stop speculating on and spending so much money mining bitcoin and realize that nothing inherently gives it value? how many people actually hold bitcoins just because they value them itself, instead of for the things they can purchase in a few years  "once it takes off and becomes a worldwide currency"? most of the "value" is built on speculation, not of fundamentals.
altavista was the first search engine, but do we still use that? hell, do people still use yahoo? things change over time, just because it was the first big player doesn't mean it's going to last over time. that is VERY short sighted, and like i said, not based on fundamentals.
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:50:13
At this point in the game, can we all agree that most of the valuation behind Bitcoin is in speculation? Be honest with yourselves, why do you hold bitcoins? Do you hold it because you value the utility of Bitcoin itself, or do you hold it because you think you can make money selling it at a later date? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:41:20
all bitcoiners think the price is goind to the moon, all the time.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:36:24
stop wasting your money with bitcoin and start investing your money in something actually productive.
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:00:56
excellent refutation. you have convinced me of my erroneous thinking.
\- do you all hold bitcoin because you objectively value it?
\- or do you simply hold it hoping the price will go up in the future, so you can sell it to a "greater fool".
be honest with yourselves. your cognitive dissonance is only making the bitcoin correction more painful.
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:02:42
ha, how ironic. give me tangible stuff that gets shit done over imaginary speculative assets any day.
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:13:08
your logic would be sound if bitcoin was built on fundamental solid economics, but all it really has going for it is being the "first" big crypto (and the speculation around it). it touts itself as having built-in deflation, but if other cryptos can be created which have the same features, then there goes the deflation because you now have the amount of bitcoin + X currency in circulation, plus why spend your money on bitcoin when you can get more currency units from the newer crypto? i know, i know, the "trust" aspect of bitcoin because it's bigger, but think about it, if there is always a copycat that can be created once the big-name crypto gets too expensive, then you're always going to have speculation going on, it's not based on any solid fundamental belief in the currency itself.
