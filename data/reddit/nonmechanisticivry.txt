You won't need to buy another drive until 2034.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:57:24
It's guaranteed.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:51:19
Are you saying there are better stores-of-value?
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:20:26
These new features could destroy coins through bugs. Putting the ecosystem at risk. A true store of value coin would never change anything.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:58:45
If changing the protocol is bad, then why are we adding SegWit and Lightning?
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:31:43
Price matters, because Bitcoin is a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:37:18
Why haven't you sold it already?
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:26:06
Any hard fork of the Genesis Block chain is a Bitcoin.

"Check out this alternate Bitcoin group" 
"lol brigade"

1 GB this year, larger to support peak demand. Lightning for micropayments.

Sign the comment you're reading now with a public key that was used in 2011, or you're full of shit.

But Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation of Bitcoin. Nothing changes without the reference implementation changing.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:53:15
Middlemen are always more expensive than direct transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:26:28
Everyone deserves a 0 risk store of value. That's bitcoin. 
Checking account? Fees, fake duplicate accounts (BoA), loss of privacy, and a thousand more cuts.
EU printed money to save countries with unbalanced budgets. Bitcoin doesn't print money.
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:45:44
You'll never know if you can go through with 500 sat/byte. By the time you send your transaction, there may be more than one block's worth at 1% more fee. Then you'll go through all the work of Replace-By-Fee, or paying a transaction accelerator mining service.
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:33:00
Yeah, Bitcoin is better off alone.
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:48:17
If you know how to destroy it, then you know how to strengthen it.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:04:29
Micropayments are sub-cent, not a coffee.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:51:50
Your hostile mistranslation of my original post was mistranslated twice, to the point where I don't know what your point is.
Lightning channels are only economical for direct microtransaction payments; anything else is too risky and expensive.
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:01:03
The supply of Bitcoins-the-network is infinite. We all get to choose how many bitcoins we want. I also want 21 million. Then we group together with others who agree with what we consider ideal money.
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:57:17
We do. We choose whichever Bitcoin Network that we find valuable. We can't stop anyone from duplicating Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:13:48
That's the point of bitcoin. If it's not the world reserve money, then it's not worth anything at all.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:20:20
On the other hand, in a fee crisis like past December, you won't be able to move to an exchange and sell on sudden bad news.
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:42:48
What happens when everyone wants their bitcoin settled at once, in a crisis?
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:48:27
Nah, nodes get to decide what is worth them relaying. The free market will adapt to the true costs of broadcast &amp; verify &amp; store. Lightning channels work well for microtransactions when you already know who you are paying.
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:42:30
Well, let them experiment. I won't use it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:08:29
Hours? With the future of money?
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:00:21
My mobile wallet doesn't support RBF, I have to export the private keys. Or if I used Ledger, I may not have selected 'replaceable fee'. It's a pain point for users.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:15:12
When it was $1k to $5k, fees were affordable. When it was $20k and the blockchain was nearly seized, it was very difficult to use. Money that can't be moved when you need it is bad money.
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:23:32
Should a crisis occur, the fee market escalates in a bidding war. Fees are most unpredictable when it's most critical that they be predictable.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:12:32
Loans denominated in bitcoin, in ventures that earn bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:05:21
Bitcoin is always exactly bitcoin, and there are cold hardware wallets.
Banks are rotten slave masters.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:52:42
Not if the blocks are full - then you have to win the fee bidding war.
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:51:07
Doesn't matter if they can't use it when they need it.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:15:12
With routed payments, you do have to have a channel open, and open channels open all the way to receiver. You need to stay online, in case one of those channels closes (settles to the blockchain).
With a direct lightning channel, you still need to stay online, but there is more incentive for the receiver and sender to work together to accomplish the full transaction - more profit than an insignificant fee. This also solves the routing problem.
It also makes sense for micropayments - you'll lock up some amount of money with a service provider, and then pay per usage, closed periodically.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:31:27
To what? That takes a hard fork, it won't be Bitcoin any more.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:49:26
Watchtowers can't defend you (without giving them your private key), and can't be free. It may be more profitable to trick you into trusting a watchtower, so that your channel is an easier mark.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:15:45
Nah, I wish I had bitcoin on an exchange so I could have sold it at $20k.
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:03:16
Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:54:35
It wasn't prudent to do so even with $35 median fees.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:11:55
Yup. 0% monetary inflation.
Why would anyone choose to hold a money that loses value over time? It's a no-brainer, everyone has their self interest.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:53:05
Banks will have capital for loans, no matter what money they use.
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:48:04
Bitcoin Cash probably will have majority consensus and the largest total chainwork someday soon.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:18:01
I read your other posts. What motivates you? Didn't hodl, still a wage slave?
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:31:45
Not for long, given the inability to settle transactions rapidly.
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:43:09
Actually, a huge portion of original Bitcoiners want to see the block size increased. We are taking Bitcoin in that direction.
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:32:06
Consensus can change.
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:43:56
You can have good money and have 0% inflation. 0.00000001 resolution today, and extendable in the future.
