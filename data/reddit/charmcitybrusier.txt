Judges can still take factors like that in sentencing if there is enough evidence to show that he was involved with hiring hits.

US Code technically allows for the [death penalty for drug dealers]( It requires 600 times the amount of drugs that would trigger a 5 five year mandatory minimum. In order to trigger the death penalty it would take 60,000 plants or kilos of Marihuana, 60 Kilos of Heroin, 300 kilos of powered cocaine, 16.8 kilos of cocaine base, or 600 grams of LSD. Meth and PCP mandatory minimums vary based on the mixture, the more pure they are the more fucked a defendant would be.
My point in case I'm not clear is that the rule of law technically allows the President to seek the death penalty for large scale drug trafficking. Although despite being a law for over two decades I'm unaware of any serious attempt to put a non-homicidal drug dealer to death.

One underrated aspect of his case is that one of the main DEA agents that investigated him, Carl Mark Force IV got a 6 and a half year sentence for [stealing]( from Ross. Shit needs to be made into a movie.

Nope, it used to be a 100-1 disparity now it is a 18-1 disparity.

I find Ross's story interesting so I'm going to comment on it. If that makes me a troll that's fine with me

I don't think it's right but come on, it doesn't take a genius to know that selling a shiton of hard drugs in this country could easily mean LWOP.

Dudes a total criminal who got caught redhanded running a massive criminal enterprise.

When he sells illegal weapons and tries to order a hit online.

Running a massive drug operation is an extremely serious crime.

Judges can sometimes still factor things like that in for sentencing and in Ross's case the Judge did.
