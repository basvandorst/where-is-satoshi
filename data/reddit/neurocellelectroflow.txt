they'll still have that $30,000, its just down the road it wont worth so much - everybody in cryptospace realize that (just see the history to check that fact). its very essence of crypto - to fight inflation

I'm pretty sure you can get at least 10 decent but promiscuous non-inflatable chicks for 1 Bitcoin.
Not for very long, but for enough time.

a) you need stuff: cloth, food,place to live etc. it all costs money.
but yeah, if you'll put them away without inflation you don't have to worry about it loosing it's buying ability over time like currency with arbitrary inflation does  
b) "tomorrow" doesn't literally mean tomorrow. you just spend some and earn some by working.
c) "anti-inflation" doesn't mean money will be worth more tomorrow, it means they wont cost less
d)  &gt;economy would ground to a halt 
with near zero inflation and near zero deflation it wouldn't, not because of low inflation anyway
e) at this point cryptocurrency doesn't work as intended due to relatively low outspread and resulting high volatility

There are no sense in robbery at all.
We need outsmart them all, not rob them all. I deem only that as fair.
And maybe robbing the robbers (who may or may not be rich) to restore status quo.
But yeah, radical socialists prefer robbery to smarts. If you cant think you always just do some stupid stuff.
