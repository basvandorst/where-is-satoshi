You can get private companies, not banks, that maintain safety deposit boxes - not that’s there’s any logical difference between those two things, but it seems people definitely have an issue with banks specifically.
Putting all that to one side. What do you recommend as an alternative? Somewhere in your own house, where it’s more subject to robbery, being burnt in a fire, lost in a flood/tornado? Or do you just bury it somewhere and hope no one finds it?

Out of interest, I’ve no idea as I don’t have a will. Who holds a copy of your will? Why are they more trustworthy than a bank?

Do Coinbase charge any fees for sending BTC to another wallet (outside of network fees)? I thought they only charged for fiat on/off.

I trust my memory to remember where/how I hid it less than I’d trust a safety deposit box! I’m sure there are some complex ways I could do it without having to trust my memory. But then two safety deposit boxes in independent companies/banks seems a reasonably safe option.

Now do the same for the way down...

Interesting. So transaction energy of “normal” currency will go down massively, whereas crypto will stay roughly static? 
@_date: 2019-07-20 16:12:50
This is excellent information. Couldn’t agree more.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:46:45
For number (3), what about the energy of each transaction? I read somewhere that crypto currencies require a lot more energy per transaction so that, if they were to become popular enough, the energy requirements of the world would massively increase due to the vast number of transactions that occur every second.

Yeah, of course - bonds pay a yield. But I’m literally asking about cash, cash. It shows up on the asset side of the balance sheet, doesn’t (necessarily) pay a yield, therefore - by your definition - it’s speculation. I’m just trying to clarify if that’s what you mean and, if not, why not?
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:41:16
I’d quite like one of those, please.

Given that the vast majority of money is created by private banks, most of that money was never issued by a government in the first place. 
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:01:58
Well yeah, I get that too. But my point is more that “this terminology” - e.g. asset, yield - have very specific financial definitions that seemed incongruous with what you were saying. So I was checking I hadn’t misunderstood something - but if you’re just using financial language in a slightly loose way then fair enough. But that does kind of make what you said a little... imprecise.

Cash is speculation, then?

Portugal is lovely, and very varied from the North to the South. Water’s a little cold being on the Atlantic, but food is top quality and very reasonable. The only main decision is country or city.

Probably right. The logistic curve is a common approximation to a wide range of growth processes.

Pretty much exactly the same as me. Also then put 50 % into alts after doing research and hearing so much about diversifying - which has held its value but has more than halved in Satoshis. Dumbass. Even if alt season comes I now realise I have to have near perfect timing to get the sort of profit out of it I would have had had I just left it all in BTC and enjoyed the ride.
@_date: 2019-09-01 10:41:48
I don’t get the drug lord analogy, no matter how much is lost like that, inflation and printing more cash will eventually make it an insignificant and replaceable amount. That’s nothing like the bitcoin situation.

Only if you’re expecting an instantaneous price reaction - and if you’re assuming that price is decided by the purchaser knowing the exact liquid supply of the thing they’re buying. In reality the price reaction is non-instantaneous and is a result of more people competing to buy a reduced supply - they don’t even need to know that the supply is reduced, just the next time they try to buy there are more people trying to buy per dollar available than there was before. Naturally this drives up the price. They might not even realise that has happened. No one needs to know circulation amounts.
Going back to my 10 valuable items analogy. If the first person buys 7, the other 9 people may not have even known there were ten in the first place. They just find themselves in a situation where it’s 9 people competing for 3 items and the price goes up.

Strictly speaking, exchanges aren’t the only place to trade fiat for cryptocurrency. Having said that, as you note, it would be a lot harder and inhibit/prevent mass adoption. 
Of course, that assumes no one votes in politicians who then legalise it again. I’m not saying that would happen, just that it’s a possibility.
@_date: 2019-09-20 22:02:28
Wow, not sure where the attitude has come from but let me try and jump in and address your points. The whole supply and demand thing is really talking about liquid supply. To all intents and purposes burying dollars - enough of them - would increase the price of dollars relative to another currency. At least if the Fed didn’t decide to print more to compensate. 
Look at it this way. Let’s say there are 10 people and I own 10 valuable items. I decide I’m happy to part with them all at the same time for $1000 each. If all 10 people come to my door and agree to buy 1 each then they all pay the $1000 and that’s it. But if someone gets there first and buys 7, the other 9 people have to fight over 3 of them. Now. If those people are prepared to pay more than the $1000 asking price, they’ll start offering more and I’ll effectively auction off the remaining 3 items for much more than $1000 each. (Note, this analogy is related to a famous Harvard business school question.)
Coming back to your buried dollars - yes the price of them would go up if the Fed didn’t print more and you buried a significant amount. Because suddenly there’s less available to people who want to buy them, and so they’ll likely pay more for them. Similarly, if you then dig them up, the price would go down again. 
This is the same with lost BTC - except now you’ve buried it somewhere that’s absolutely impossible for anyone else to find. So the remaining BTC are permanently worth more due to this decreased *liquid* supply.
Edit: typos. Plus - note hodlers do the same thing. If someone holds a lot of BTC then that’s like they’ve buried them and everyone else has to compete over less - hence price goes up. If that person suddenly tries to sell them then the price goes down. A lot and quickly. Their option is to try to sell them really quickly before the market can react and the price drops too much, or they can trickle them out into the market and hope more buyers come into the market than BTC they’re “liberating”. This is one reason why diamond production is so drip fed - to control the supply.

Which is why I said the answer to the question is yes, and the follow up question is how slow/quick it happens?
@_date: 2019-09-07 22:39:58
Wrong correlation. The meaningful one would be *the more expensive the stone...*, it just happens that size and price usually go hand in hand. In this case, I’d say OP probably has a 99th percentile size cock.
@_date: 2019-09-03 06:51:28
Anyone have any views on the *buy support* metric by [
@_date: 2019-09-01 10:40:27
It doesn’t matter how rare or how small the losses are, for a finite supply of anything, if there’s a non-zero probability of some of that thing being lost, eventually most and then all will be lost. 
The answer to the question, therefore, is an emphatic yes. The next question is, how slow/quick will this happen and can it be dealt with *when* it happens?
@_date: 2019-09-20 23:08:20


And it gains in value when the Fed reduces its supply. 
In both cases burying and digging up cash would have the same effect - if you could do it at a big enough scale. 
I would say yes your reasoning is flawed, though I think it’s understandable why. Especially because you’re right - crypto is full of nonsense BS! Just it’s not BS in this particular case. 
Price is actually a very complicated thing as psychology matters too. Going back to the Fed example - there’s a very quick price reaction when they announce they’re doing QE. Because they’ve announced a change in supply and so people react to that because they’re trained in economics of supply and demand! It’s a bit self-fulfilling.
But actually it is a real effect too. Let’s say the Fed, if they did it secretly, the same effect would happen, just not as quickly. There would be an increase in the supply of dollars and therefore there would be less competition for them; and therefore price would drop. People might then be able to second guess it and go “aha, the Fed has printed more dollars because I’ve noticed the price has dropped and it’s easy to buy!”  But equally it might be because demand has dropped for some unknown reason. 
Part of the game of the Fed is the announcement as well as the policy has an impact that they desire. But the policy without the announcement still has an influence - even if no one realises it has happened. 
It really is a real thing - price is the result of the demand for something balanced with the supply of that thing - even if the supply is not known (plus people’s weird psychology too, of course). Merely the fact that the competition for the thing exists, and that that is a function of supply (assuming demand is constant) means that hodling the thing will increase its price, and vice versa, due to the affect that has in supply and hence competition.
Here’s another BTC specific example. You’ve probably seen the sudden plunges in price and then the sudden recovered that happen? If you look at the volumes and the block explorer - you’ll see it one whale deliberately dumping a load of BTC, that floods the market and lowering the price, then suddenly buying it back at a lower price - making a nice profit out of the process. No one needs to know the total circulation at that point, all they do is find that suddenly there’s more available to buy and at lower prices.
It works the other way, if a whale suddenly buys up a huge load - and then holds it - the price will go up because suddenly the order book on (say) Coinbase has less asks than it had before. There’s still as many people bidding so they find they have to up their bids due to the increased competition. But no one needs to know that that has happened- they just log in one day and the order book suddenly looks weighted to the bid side.

I haven’t, and wouldn’t, do the calculation - it’s your business. I’m just pointing out that, with the info you’ve left in, it’s not a tricky calculation - if you’re happy with that then fair enough, but no point masking  any of it. If not, maybe delete and repost with the number in the centre of the green box hidden. You just need to show it’s green! Trying to help you, here.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:45:37
There’s no point hiding the spent and amount you bought if you’re going to show the profit and the date you bought. We can use the current price to work everything else out.
