Depends on whether he wants to conceal the Bitcoin addresses he has control of; knowing the recipient address, amount, and timeframe, we can determine which addresses the funds were previously sent to which means that we can plausibly tie those to his Reddit persona.

Why did you (poorly) erase the QR code, and yet leave the Bitcoin address fully intact?

Um, you can use CCs with the tap-to-pay feature in the Android app.

It's also possible that you're looking at one snippet in an attempt to describe how the overall software behaves.  Did you look at the code that actually sends a block in response to a getdata?
    // Send block from disk
    CBlock block;
    ReadBlockFromDisk(block, (*mi).second);
    if (inv.type == MSG_BLOCK)
        pfrom-&gt;PushMessage("block", block);
    else ...
Note that the return from ReadBlockFromDisk() is not checked.  If the read fails then this code will proceed with a block object containing invalid (zeroed) data.  What happens from that point is not well-defined; the software could certainly crash as a result.
Just because *the particular code you looked at* checks if a block exists does *not* mean that all of the code is checking!

Note that this does mean that POS hardware would need to be upgraded with new software and hardware (cameras to read QR codes).  It's a great idea, but the cost of implementation (including cashier training) is not negligible.  There would have to be some incentive for companies to consider doing this.

While that might be an acceptable stopgap, it should not be a long-term solution.  Anyone within sight of the QR code might be able to sweep the coins, for example.  If someone else gets to the coins before you do then you have no way to prove it either.

Not at all.  Something as simple as upgrading the compiler almost certainly would result in different output.  Compiling the same thing at a different time of day may even result in different output (build timestamps are frequently included in embedded version information).

It's not a new law, it's a clarification on the application of existing tax law.

It looks like the duplicate SPF record has been fixed, but the postmaster mailbox still does not exist.
