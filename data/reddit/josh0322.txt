Mine went through in minutes. Confirmed three times within an hour or two. Don't be stingy with fees at a time like this.

Glad to see this kind of discussion. 
I'm toying with the idea of selling half of my HODLINGS to lock in some gains. I'm "only" at about +1,300% right now

Just started listening to BTC podcasts actually. The Bitcoin Podcast has been the most interesting to me. They have a series of shows called "onramping with Dee" that are good for n00bs

Use it like you use USD or whatever your local currency is

How do you mean?

You absolutely do pay fees. Many merchants charge consumers directly for using card, if not they just build it into the cost of the products you buy every day.

Fine... Make it EZ

Depends what you want bitcoin to be. If you want to make some money now but don't care about bitcoin longevity or legitimacy as a currency, then trade. If you think bitcoin is a viable currency of the future, use it as a currency, store some wealth in it and use it to buy stuff.

We're going to the moon, that's what's going on
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:15:26
Could also reach $0
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:13:51
To hodl means to hodl. Not sure where "how long is too long" comes in to play

Gemini is pretty easy to use

Means "hold". As in, don't sell

Worst case scenario is $0, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:10:35
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:41:53
on the blockchain
@_date: 2017-09-12 05:02:26
Wait isn't that the only point??

@_date: 2017-10-23 07:02:00
Only buy what you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:53:53
It's now or never
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:32:52
Buy now or forever hold your peace

On this topic, if theoretical BTC were kept in an Electrum wallet at the time of the BCC fork do those coins become BOTH BTC AND BCC
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:52:10
I prefer it

If you're really "hodling" then there's nothing you're waiting for...
