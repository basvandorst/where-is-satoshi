Every body want me to sign a message with PGP. I know what I am doing. I am not in a hurry to get the Nobel Prize. Ted Nelson tempted me in 2013. Vaghwan Chaudhry now doing his best to unmask me.  I will prove myself to the media and Bitcoin Community after the real life Bitcoin Drama move on to Chapter 16.
