Yes please! I no longer user unencrypted paper wallets, but this site is fancy-ass... 
@_date: 2013-08-03 00:59:37
Thanks! Is it open source? I hope so, it'd be great to have the rules determining the average open source. (sure, they might be straightforward, but still better to see it and share it.)
I'd love it if we would all start to see a more representative number all over the place.

True, the punch is easiest. I suspect this method might be cheaper, _plus_ the QR codes can handle up to 30% loss of data and still be readable. The simple punch or manually engraved method can't do that... 
(Well, I guess it could if you just duplicated the values a bunch of times.)
@_date: 2013-10-16 21:50:14
Why can't it be changed? Is it intrinsic in the math or simply a business rule in the code? If it's a business rule, then why couldn't it be changed?
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:04:09
Yeah, its only 0% for now. But it'll only go up to 1%, which is pretty low.

I made a stainless steel wallet.

Just how "baked in" is the 21M BTC limit? Is it just an `if` in the source or is it somehow integral to the math?
If its just a check in the source then, if it turns out more BTC actually _is_ needed, a change could be made to all the clients to enable more to be mined. (Of course, enough users would have to agree to the change, but I'd have to believe that if it was _really_ needed then folks would accept the change.)

No, it scanned just fine. (See video) 
The quality issue with the address was that I ironed too hard. Even that scanned just fine. The QR codes are generated with the highest level error correction. 
It's not fool proof, but it's also not very exotic or difficult.

Oh! You should index the contents from Project Gutenberg as well as wikipedia...

Ok, so I decided to leave him a couple of bucks USD and a paper wallet with 0.05 BTC. 
So far this morning all he and his younger sister have talked about is the Bitcoin! :) 
(We will go to the store today and spend the cash, any hints for what he can buy with his BTC?)
@_date: 2013-08-15 11:51:37
So why are we using the bitcoin blockchain for this instead of, the namecoin blockchain? It seems namecoin would be more appropriate. 
@_date: 2013-08-03 01:34:27
Of course, then you'd be exposing the private key...
For long-term cold-storage its probably pretty important to keep that private! We need DIY accessible methods for this stuff.
@_date: 2013-09-28 22:17:26
I'm really excited to see this happening! Thanks guys! I hope to make this my main wallet when it's wise to use it.

seongyupyoo, this is pretty awesome! I'm finding things to sell right now!
I suspect that there may be a problem with this method for lower cost items though: the lower the risked amount, the greater chance for vandalism should a bad-actor simply want to fuck with people... i.e. on a bad day I might just be willing to lose 0.2 BTC just to mess with someone, right?
Can anything be done about this? It seems that you assume that the seller's risked amount has to be the same as the value of the item being sold. What about allowing a larger risk amount to actually make the risk of destruction more tangible?
@_date: 2013-10-07 23:43:13
Very exciting! Thanks for this.
@_date: 2013-08-03 01:52:25
or table salt and a battery... 
In other news, I wonder if there would be any value in a wallet to g-code converter for those with cnc mills? I wonder: how well would a QR code etch with an engraving mill?

Its a self-balancing system. It will reach equilibrium when mining just barely makes a profit. 
I'm not really sure what you are asking, but there is no reason to think that the cost of the proof of work will always climb. At some point in the future difficulty will go down. (Not necessarily down from where it is now, but down from where it will be.)
The difficulty will go down after enough miners have discovered that they are not making a profit and turn of their machines. Then, after the difficulty goes down, the BTC &lt;-&gt; fiat rate goes up, the cost of power goes down, or the efficiency of the equipment goes up; the miners will turn their machines back on. 
Eventually, we should see that difficulty stays close to the same level for extended periods of time. (Like in the past, before GPUs, then before ASICS.)
If you are, instead, asking why it's OK for the proof of work for older blocks to be so, relatively, easy. Thats because the blocks are in a chain. If you wanted to edit the genesis block, you'd have to recalculate every single block since. That'd get out of hand pretty quickly.

Just spun up two nodes in the past few days and I'm working on getting bitcoind running on them as well.

Why that particular alloy? What other alloys are good?

hey! that's mine...

wtf did you just say?
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:53:07
You misunderstand. 
I asked if the number if potential coins is possible to change. Not if the existing coins can be divided.

Sorry, this isn't helpful to you, OP, but it seems like a good place to ask: Why the focus on backups to the exclusion of cold storage? Sure, back up your wallets, but why keep large amounts of wealth in a wallet file at all? Flash storage fails, HDs fail. It seems a offline, analog (paper, steel, stone) wallet is the best place to keep the majority of your BTC wealth. What's preventing that from being the de facto solution?
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:00:43
 &lt;-- I made this a while ago, it works for hardy cold-storage.
@_date: 2013-07-31 03:02:56
Actually, even better would be to allow the funds to be risked as soon as you see the transaction, but don't allow them to be put into the actual 'escrow' until they are confirmed. That way I could get my postings listed without the hour+ wait on confirmations.

Where is "over here"?

isn't .ca canada?
@_date: 2013-09-15 17:55:47
"waste" is a bit presumptuous... This is the "work" in "proof of work". There has to be real effort, therefore cost, or else the historical blocks are not protected from being rewritten.
BTW, I think that cost is exactly why proof of stake is an interesting alternative to proof of work for protecting the historical blocks. (unless my understanding of proof of stake is broken... not positive on that.)
@_date: 2013-08-02 18:43:52
Hmmm, I wonder if it'd etch ok?
@_date: 2013-09-03 00:04:21
Yeah, I think I was asking a real-world question _inspired_ by the fictional future world...
Is it possible that some forward thinking folks might notice that 21 Million isn't actually enough and convince all the users of Bitcoin to raise the limit? Or are we really stuck, due to it being baked into the math somehow, with 21 Million?
@_date: 2013-08-03 17:51:21
I suppose the printer should also be destroyed too... Sheesh! At least don't give it away when you buy a new one, destroy it then.
Seems like brain wallets are the only really safe way to go. But those are pretty hard to pass on to someone else.

There! I've posted something for sale: 
Now, someone go buy it! (but lets not try out my "fuck with people" scenario, ok?)

I hadn't heard of HHTT (funky site!).
Neither of those support merged mining though. (right?) Why give up the added revenue from NMC? (I can understand not wanting to support the other few alt-coins that can be merge-mined with BTC, but NMC seems like a laudable alt-coin...)
As far as steeling your coins goes, it seems that as long as you auto-withdrawal at a fairly small amount then that risk is small enough that it wouldn't outweigh the probable revenue benefits.
@_date: 2013-08-18 14:54:10
I did.
@_date: 2013-08-03 01:30:56
Its pretty. It'd be nice if they had a version that'd render in a Github README.

8 confirmations before the funds are available to risk... 
I'd love to see that slide based on the amount of the transaction.

This weekend I'm going to get Tails running and I'm gonna make the real deal. Thanks for the reminders to stay safe!
