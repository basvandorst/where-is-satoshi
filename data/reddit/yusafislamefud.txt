Dcash is not okay but Dch (pronounced 'deech' or 'ditch') is okay. Similarly with Bch.

Bch is definitely female. Female dog.

Bch is a better ticker for Female Dogecoin.

Bch if the dog is female.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:29:43
But Bch is already a kind of a Dogecoin. It is Female Dogecoin.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:40:20
Like 'bit'.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:25:35
People say Bch which has one proper pronunciation. Also known as Female Dogecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:41:17
We shouldn't call it 'Bitcoin Cash'. We should call it 'Bitcoin ch'. Like 'Bch' is abbreviated 'Bitcoin ch'. Then there is no doubt how 'Bch' is pronounced.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:39:02
There were some idiots offering 'bits' as if it was bitcoins. Didn't last long.

If this passes then ltc would crash because bitcoin would look cheaper and ltc becomes pointless.

Did you just imply that she is a 'Bch'?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:43:50
That sounds exactly the same as Bch.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:37:39
Bch can't be a boogey**man** because 'man' is a masculine and Bitcoin ch (Bch) is a feminine.

Yes, gold is very valuable for Jewry. They value everything else including Bitcoin mostly as a way to get more gold.

**Did you just use the neuter gender for 'Bch'??** A 'Bch' is a feminine, in case you don't know. You should use 'her' instead of 'its'.

Then turn bitcoin into a cheap scam coin and everyone would buy it? Make bitcoin core software steal bitcoins and bitcoin will crash some. It will be so cheap that everyone would buy it.

They still bch about 'Bcash'. They don't bch about 'Bch' anymore. But 'Bcash' means nothing and 'Bch' means Female Dogecoin! Ha! Bchess.

You still owe me 1 BTC. Don't shame UASF by not knowing how it works and not paying your debts! Pay me now. You have to pay your debts while you have the money.

I would! God is my witness! If you even have 1 BTC, prove that you have it.
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:37:59
It would not be a hard fork! It would be a Usr Activated Soft Fork like last year, you idiot.
@_date: 2018-11-13 11:21:26
First you sign a message then I will. Then the bet is on. I'll show that the mining reward can be reduced to 0.25 BTC / block as a soft fork before the halvenings. If I'm wrong, I will send you my 1 BTC. If I'm right, you will send me your 1 BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-13 12:04:37


Okay, as long as the miners are not allowed to have more than 0.25 BTC block reward and as long as my fork idea is not breaking any existing consensus rules, and it is only a soft fork, I win.
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:42:05
We the UASF army don't care about miners. Only we matter. We don't need them. Just UASF!

Why do you think SEGWIT was not the same kind of fork? Do you want to bet 1 BTC that it is a soft fork?

That would not be Bitcoin (BTC) any more. That would be an altcoin. They would not get 12.5 BTC. They would get 12.5 of some altcoin. Remember, the rules of Bitcoin (BTC) have changed thanks to a soft fork! The chain with 0.25 BTC / block would be Bitcoin (BTC). The chain with 12.5 units / block is a different chain. An altcoin. They are not the same things.


12.5 of some altcoin are not the same thing as 0.25 BTC! The soft fork rule guarantees that no miner is able to claim more than 0.25 BTC / block. The condition is satisfied.


Yes the change is enforced by full nodes! It is not opt in. Not every soft fork change is opt in. If some blocks are now invalid Bitcoin blocks then it's not. The only other option is to create an altcoin. But then they are not creating more than 0.25 BTC / block. They are creating 0 BTC / block and some altcoin. Because the block is not a valid Bitcoin block.


12.5 altcoins! Not Bitcoins! Legacy consensus rule can still exist only on a different blockchain! Not the Bitcoin blockchain! An altcoin blockchain! So it's irrelevant!


Condition 1 is satisfied if there is a soft fork. All nodes enforce it. This is what a soft fork is. This is not a hard fork. Here you showed that you don't know what is a hard fork. A hard fork is when some of the old rules are removed or relaxed. This is how hard forks are defined. Hard forks are not defined by how many nodes enforce them. This is your mistake. Now you can pay me.

You have 1.85 BTC in your address. I have the signed message. And you have my address. I will be watching the address. I can post here when I get some of the money or the whole 1 BTC. And I will retract calling you dishonourable then. Thank you.

This is about soft forks. Everyone here should know what a soft fork is. So they know that you are wrong about soft forks. They know that you lost the bet. And now they should know that you are dishonourable for not paying me. Prove us that you have honor and pay me.

Reducing the mining reward in this way or by forcing a new limit of 0.25 BTC / block instead of 12.5 BTC / block is impossible with a UASF if you ask idiots like u/Kalin101. I bet him it is a soft fork. u/Kalin101 owes me 1 BTC because he lost the bet with me:
He thinks it has to be a hard fork. He lacks belief in the power of UASF. Tell him that he lost the bet and needs to pay me and not be dishonourable.
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:35:35
I see that one of you UASF-nonbelievers tried to say something against the struggle for UASF and you failed. Your reply to me won't see the light of day! Commenting is ruled well here. I don't know what you wanted to say but whatever it was it was probably dumb and wrong and we don't want it here!

Yes 0.25 BTC / block instead of 12.5 BTC / block is compatible with old nodes. They see that the blocks are valid. This is what backwards compatible means.


What do you mean by break consensus? A soft fork is not what you say it is.


If you don't understand hard forks and soft forks go read about them. But first you said that you agree that my idea is a soft fork. See the rule again:


Not opt in invalid. Invalid. All of them. With this soft fork there is no more 12.5 BTC / block.
Do you really don't understand or are you trying to escape? If you don't understand then read something or ask someone. Then don't delay paying me.

In fulfilment of the bet I made with u/Kalin101 here:
(archived:  and
(archived:  I show that the Bitcoin mining reward can be reduced to 0.25 BTC / block as a soft fork before the halvenings.
It is known that it is possible that a miner claims less than the maximum allowed coinbase reward or destroys part of the coinbase reward. This is valid. Therefore it is possible to make a new consensus rule that all new blocks which claim more than 0.25 BTC / block will be invalid. Therefore only blocks which claim 0.25 BTC / block or less will be valid. Therefore the Bitcoin mining reward can be reduced to 0.25 BTC / block before the halvenings. No existing consensus rules are broken. A new consensus rule is added. Therefore this is a soft fork and not a hard fork.
I have sent you a PM with my address and my signed message. Now pay me as the winner of our bet and you will prove your honour. God bless you.
