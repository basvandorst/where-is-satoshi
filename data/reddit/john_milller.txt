0.04973040 BTC is the estimate, but that will go up because I'm getting a better gpu. I average $4-$5 per day

You don't have a right to fly. It is a privilege. Don't fly, don't deal with TSA.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:31:30
That doesn't mean you have a right to fly on a private airline. That says you have a right to the airspace.
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:17:49
Internet access isn't a human right. I don't even believe in human rights. I don't like the TSA either, and this discussion is about rights.

Should you be banned for calling me a moron?

He is right, statistically. Whether he meant it as a +/-/= is something else. But jews are....jewish... when it comes to money.




@_date: 2017-06-27 03:11:25
I'm not a libertarian, and I don't like the TSA. But they don't violate any rights, because flying is not a constitutionally guaranteed right.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:31:54
I'm not defending tsa

You give up your right when you walk into the airport with a ticket.
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:05:05
Not my problem. Let me know when flying becomes a right.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:21:18
it automatically switches to whatever is the most profitable. for instance, last night there was a spike in sibcoin, so it mined that.
if everything gets more difficult, then yes it'll slow down.

Disagreeing or use parenthesis is not ground for banning someone, or else you'd be banned already :)

You think antisemitism should be banned because it is offensive, correct? So explain why you calling me a "Pos" and suggesting I am a Nazi isn't offensive and worthy of a ban.
You can't pick and choose what is offensive. Either it all is, or none of it is. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:57:46
I rest my case

So if you buy anything as an investment it's an emotional trade? I think the exact opposite.

You have a right to the airspace, not to a private companies vehicle.

my 380x artifacts when a display is plugged into it while mining, but i think it's just a broken card. i havent tried it under other loads like a game.
it runs at sub 80c @ 44% fan 24/7. I could go higher but the fans get loud above 45%. the biggest thing to worry about with mining is the fans. the fans will die before your card dies in almost every case. but even then you should get a good few years going 24/7. you can always replace fans easily.
