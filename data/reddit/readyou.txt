Which is why I am extremely surprised that Bitcoin can still fly that high.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:38:07
That's something I talked about with a friend yesterday..... we both thought that there will be massive crash but afterwards some currencies will stabilize again while quite a lot will never come back up again. So, I see it like you... there will be several coins that survive.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:54:03
Yes it is temporary, and on top of that there are scaling solutions in the work.
Can you say both about Bitcoin? Is it worked on short-term solutions and long-term solutions together?
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:48:53
You deserve it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:21:42
That's awesome. I understand the companies because in the current state there is no reason to offer Bitcoin as a payment method.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:35:11
It took two days and gas was down again... now tell me how serious they work on the Bitcoin transaction issue?
In other words. There are people behind Ethereum that care a lot about the project and the future. This is where I donate my trust.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:00:15
I don't give a shit about him either, and I am a Redditor and not just a Becky.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:39:44
I don't question this. I actually believe that in the long run there will be several surviving projects, but at this point I question that Bitcoin will be in the list.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:46:25
Right, at least I did educate my friends who saw something about Bitcoin in the news that there are much more interesting coins like Ethereum for example. :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:50:16
That is a good point.
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:52:56
Because he is a bragger and an evangelist.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:32:16
And Ethereum will take the spot.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:18:02
You need to move your funds to Binance.
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:37:29
Not really in this space... maybe somewhere else.. not for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-03 08:57:49
That's why I always say we have a shitload of insane people in the Bitcoin community... so much delusion going on.
@_date: 2015-12-08 09:43:22
It seems it worked for you now?
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:34:11
Not a sum that would make me jump from my chair if I had 1000 BTC
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:11:31
The headline of the article should be: ""Bitcoin has a big problem — ordinary people aren't paying with Bitcoin."
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:02:10
lol yea sure... did you read the article?
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:09:29
Makes no sense at all.
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:20:52
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:38:56
So, is this something worked on?
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:33:06
Not new... just inactive in this sub for a while... back then nobody would have said something about these small movements.
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:01:47
WHat is nice... that there is no adoption?
@_date: 2015-06-03 09:06:39
I am amazed how many people in this thread worked for Google or do at least know people who worked for them. I call this bullshit.
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:12:21
Are you guys seriously celebrating a raise of 20 USD?
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:08:51
You don't have to understand deflation to be interested to hodl Bitcoin. Just take a look at all the kids who beg for Bitcoin on social media... "To the moooon!!".
@_date: 2015-06-03 08:58:16
Dream on.
@_date: 2015-06-03 09:08:39
Only peasants had btc stored at gox.
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:48:02
Yes, especially because that's how most sites started.... remember FB was a school network not an international face book lol... Reddit had to create thousands of fake profiles that actually communicated, to make the site look as if there would be activity... and so on.
@_date: 2018-08-19 10:49:44
I think production is capped, it might be still worth it to get one now.
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:10:40
Next bubble or next crash... one of it will happen.
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:17:55
How can the attacker know that the address pool does belong to a software wallet instead of BitPay, Coinbase, Circle or any other provider with addresses?
@_date: 2015-06-17 10:19:36
You missed some of the spikes... there are far more points where you could set the guilding sign.
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:07:39
Ok, but educating people that a Bitcoin advantage is that you don't need middlemens like banks and authorities, and ecudating businesses that they should use middlemen to accept Bitcoin, that doesn't fit together anyhow.
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:03:08
I didn´t say that it isn´t awesome. But popularity is exactly what all people in this sub are waiting for. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:29:40
Not sure why they downvoted you. I had to laugh. I think they are not too big yet, rather too small. If they become big here on Reddit, I´m sure there will be some legal stuff involved soon :D
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:51:24
You are right, there is a lot of spam but it depends whom you follow. If you follow interesting people and sites, it's actually quite cool.
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:29:23
You made my day
@_date: 2014-11-27 21:59:12
I am thankful for this kindness :) Happy thanksgiving!
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:38:04
This is actually a correct answer I think. The mining technology for single individuals could't keep pace with the hashrate. Mining isn't rentable anymore for individuals who run a few mining mashines. These people probably stopped to mine and the hashrate starts to adjust. That's at least what I have read anywhere in and it sounds reasonable to me.
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:29:41
This! There is still enough room in my wallet.
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:21:41
I use paypal maybe 20 times a week.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:25:21
I feel your sadness.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:30:18
brincalhão? :)
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:55:41
Yea, without much more info, this smells.
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:42:50
Lübeck (just 240k people) in Northern Germany near the Baltic Sea. Beautiful city but I bet bitcoin didn´t arrive here yet :) Even my friends don´t dig that deep into the internet. Some of them found out about PayPal last year. :D
@_date: 2014-11-21 15:00:42
Agree, best correction I have heard since a long time :D
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:28:34
Yea, depends on the definition of the timespan. Bitcoin is not very new, but given the fact that we are still a minority of users who know about it, you are probably right. Then we are early adopters.
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:37:59
Around 250k
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:47:47
Yes, I also got heavily downvotes for tipping here on Reddit, just tell you one of my experiences. If people are unsure what ChangeTip is, they are afraid and then you see this kind of behaviour like you experienced.
@_date: 2014-11-23 03:24:22
I think that is very true.
@_date: 2014-12-02 12:06:22
I actually not sure why someone downvoted you.
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:10:24
Isn't it a joke?
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:16:01
Though, I guess there is no web store where I could buy a camera with BTC. :P
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:42:39
 Your username implies that you dislike the moon.
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:42:55
Yea, something is wrong today. I had it happen 2 mins ago again.
@_date: 2014-12-03 13:47:47
I see that different. I learned indian people are quite curious about new things. The search engine market is a great example. Lot's of them tried to jump on the band wagon to earn a few bugs.
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:50:44
Now I wish there would be a photography gear store in Germany that accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-05 10:43:44
Agree. I think we should tip all kind of highly engaged and creative people, not just some funny comments. I think we reach far more people with this method, also I noticed that they appreciate the tips more as they see it as they see it as recognition for their own projets. I tipped also random comments on Reddit and got heavily downvotes or flamed and I learned this is the wrong approach. I noticed I get downvoted in subs like or but in creative subs the chance was higher that my tip was appreciated and accepted.
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:16:27
Also I want to add that it would be cool if "bits" would also be a choice in the moniker currency dropdown list. If I want to create a moniker I can only choose the amount by different country currencies and BTC. I wish there would be "bits" in the list, it would make it much more easy to create small monikers without calculating.
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:12:14
You guys must be rich or so :D
@_date: 2014-11-12 07:43:01
Agree, so, just stop mentioning Bill Gates here. He doesn't add anything useful to the discussion.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:29:28
The idea is actually pretty nice because I am sure the developers over there would be very healthy for Bitcoin and they probably would try to integrate it into their own projects.
@_date: 2014-11-05 14:02:54
This is fine but isn't it coinbase, circle and all the others? If so, it will dumb the price further. They exchange into USD anyway.
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:06:01
Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:02:57
I wonder why so many peope downvoted you question. This is a good question.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:30:22
It's maybe real, but not physical.
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:48:13
But we have enough kids in the community that will.
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:05:47
How would it affect the price? Price increase?
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:57:43
Which is why it probably didn't happen. However, nicely written story.
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:01:57
Is this really true? How do you order food in Germany with Bitcoin? Just asking because I am from Germany and all I can find is payment with PayPal.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:54:56
Agree with every thing you said. Take my 100 bits sir @_date: 2014-06-13 18:32:53
What does ELI5 mean?
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:13:00
Lol, most creative tip I've seen. But I wouldn't even have tipped a satoshi to this troll.
@_date: 2014-12-04 11:35:16
I assume the price will fall and push back up later on.
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:59:17
Also, people who feel offended by 10 cent tips, those are the ones who probably feel also offended by 1 usd tips. You won't make people happy with tips, you might create awareness about Bitcoin with tips. I didn't jump from my chair when I got my first bits via tip. I just thought "Wow, cool, what about that?" became curious and found out about ChangeTip.
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:42:01
Thanks for your feedback and the tip Parsnip :)
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:37:06
Not interested, thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:59:26
Love it. I can go on the street with a camera and film 100 people and pick out 10 that describe my message and you would believe it.
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:39:42
Are you a racist or what? It's not an US forum my friend ;) Get used to the fact that the world is a bit bigger than that.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:27:43
Even if it would be forcing... at the end it is something good for everyone. The world will be a better place with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-16 02:28:29
Agree. Just woke up and saw the news about it. Thought it would be an april joke. Where are we at that people complain about a comic shirt with some comic characters on it. The world we live in is quite wired. You can put on TV and there is all kind of sexual content. Music industry, movies and what not. Why do prudish people get a job in the media? What is happening?
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:42:01
The sun is still not up. You get a second try :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:10:35
Damn, is this Onyxia???? Man, that was a great time!!!!
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:13:08
You guys are way too paranoid. I suggest to not use the PC if you get so paranoid about technology.
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:41:35
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:13:10
You shitty spammer will soon realize that Reddit is a bad place for you :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:56:24
I think we are not at that point yet that it will reach 2k or 10k. I expect the price to fall back to around $300 over the next weeks and it will follow a downtrend. Next year might look different. Sure, it's gambling what I do but I would get more out of it if things happen this way. But I also must mention that I won't convert back to USD anytime soon because I hope the technology will be fully adopted at least in a magnitude that PayPal will be a shadow. In this case I could just start online shopping with bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:47:39
Behaviour, learn it.
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:06:51
Hopefully they add Paypal.
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:16:26
Right. But using btc to pay for products and services does.
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:37:21
Posts like yours make me either think that it must be irony or that you are member of a cult.
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:29:55
Agree... show or we don't believe :P
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:34:46
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:17:03
But they could get more developers with more coins, or not?
@_date: 2014-12-03 13:48:47
Nice... next time I have an airline coupon, I fly there to cut my hair.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:24:32
You dream a lot right?
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:59:03
The other people gave you already the informations, especially the "Leck mich am Arsch" is right... if yoou repeatly say "Ja, ja" if someone tells you anything or maybe even "Ja, ja, ja" people usually reply "Ja, ja heißt leck mich am Arsch!". This reply translated means "Yes, yes means lick my ass!". I think this comes from the fact that "Yes, yes" is not really an original reply and people think you have no opinion and don't want to listen. Some take this very serious and some just use it as funny whiteness.. because "Ja, ja heißt leck mich am arsch" is also a common saying. A lot of people understand that it's normal to reply with "Yes, yes" if there is not much to add, but many people would still come up with the saying "That means lick my ass", just because it's a common saying and because it's fun to reply on this way :)
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:50:12
It is happening!
@_date: 2014-06-15 10:31:57
Thank you very much for explaining. I get the point now.
@_date: 2014-11-13 09:39:43
Haha, very funny :D
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:51:03
It's not evangelizing, it's tipping :)
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:20:51
Oh.. didn't notice. Thanks for fixing the cookie :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:15:23
I thought this happened early this year, but I am not sure.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:27:26
I am on my way too but I actually just hold $60 usd in BTC. Anyway, I will add $50 each month as this is what I can afford. :)
@_date: 2014-11-03 09:08:14
I think too that ChangeTip is a way to spread adoption.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:56:46
Don´t get sentimental boy. You and your domain are the only things that are worthless on this planet. Du kleine Ratte :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:24:13
Nope, that's how it is called here commonly :) Also in Germany :D
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:39:52
Another shitty comment that I had to downvote. Please don't take my time again.
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:56:28
This is wrong. Soon we will be so old to not know how to turn their superior computers on as we still use ours.
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:10:00
True. It will result in the opposite. :)
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:30:22
Did you count?
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:31:32
Also being an early adopter in your definition, we are early adopters that came too late to throw money around like wild. It wouldn't take me long time to empty my wallet if I would tip 10k bits tips. This is what I mean. Should I tip a VIP 100 bits? I won't reach a goal with it, which is why I think wealthy bitcoin users should tip them high amounts. What I will do is tipping smaller amounts in other places but I won't tip 100 bits to any VIP.
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:14:21
Thank you. Tested but that's very strange... I can look up my town but there are no search parameters for Bitcoin. :/ They clearly must develop a better search.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:08:19
If we all tip, it will go viral. This is my opinion. I tip content that I like. I just can make small tips but I think the mass if we all tip, it will help creating awareness. Also don't forget we have these super tippers that work on it right now too.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:35:26
I did enable bits denomination on ChangeTip... it is so much better anyhow. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 08:38:43
Yes please, I buy the coins.
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:28:42
I think I must Google his name.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:45:44
One of the reasons why I think our community is strong and we can make things happen.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:21:37
Thats cool, I'll take a look!
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:48:35
Facebook for Bitcoiners?
@_date: 2014-12-09 11:28:27
Yep, that's what I thought and why I came up with this number.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:17:08
Thank you. I could retweet my message to my bro´s account too if you like.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:48:51
I am quite interested and fascinated by bitcoin too but if my mother would ask me to invest her money as well, I maybe wouldn´t do it due to the reasons you mentioned. Volatility and quite speculative until now. I really like bitcoin but for myself I can say what I can and what I can´t put into the "system". I wouldn´t be so sure about my mother. If it does not go to the moon but to the ground, I would feel very sorry for my mother then. Thanks for the tip by the way. Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2014-12-27 22:26:38
Sure I will. To the moon. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:06:36
Good point, man. Agree.
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:48:12
I don't get the same result.
@_date: 2014-11-28 20:38:49
I just hope that apart from the experiments, there will be soon a full integration. Not necessary because I would want to store my bitcoins there, no, I mean because it really would drive adoption in my opinion. I hope it will happen.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:12:38
Haha, very cool 50 bits
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:35:48
This is truly cool :D
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:35:47
I think that is the fun with different languages. I sometimes also need to learn English expressions :)
We also have a lot of local expressions. It might be that you hear things in Hamburg that you never would hear in Munich ;)
Or another example... the husband of my mother is from Thuringia and moved here where we live. When I bought something and he asked how much it did cost, I replied "5 Euro und paar Tote..." which means something like "5 Euro and some dead people". He laughed and said in German "What?? Dead people?". I couldn't explain why we say it but it's just common expression here where we live when we round up numbers and means something like "A little bit more than 5 Euro". He told me that this is not a common expression in Thuringia :D Vice versa I of course had to learn things from him too.... this local shit is fun :D
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:41:03
You nail it. Bitcoin is a bubble of a dream. It's very good idea but at the end the masses will never adopt to it.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:50:19
I will check that out :)
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:51:51
And yet they have no problems with the name Bitcoin, although it is not really a coin. Hilerious double standards. :)
@_date: 2014-12-09 06:50:57
Bitcoin is not doomed but the current price of one Bitcoin is. I think the current price is still driven up by speculation and nothing more. However, at the end it doesn't really matter... the ideology of this technology is still great.
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:27:56
Ok this is a good point, I understand now.
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:15:38
I don't buy whole Bitcoin. I add small amounts every few weeks when I have some money leftover. Yesterday I bought for example 0,03300000 BTC. :D
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:02:19
Same here. I can offer german translation :D
@_date: 2014-11-27 18:51:30
zero... we shouldn't even discuss it.
@_date: 2014-11-08 13:33:01
Thank you :D
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:53:25


Lol, nice number. Very creative tip :D
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:41:06
Tears in my eyes :)
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:40:46
I´m not sure what you are talking about. All I can imagine is that its not your fault. I believe your father did punch the shit out of you. Or does your social problem has another root?
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:39:17
Thanks again :D
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:50:56
Thanks for your kindness :) Much appreciated :)
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:04:14
I choose Obama, I would offer him a Bit (note: this is a German beer) and have a chat. :D
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:57:39
You are the only troll here... how did you get access to the internet. I thought you would still live in a jungle. Du kleiner scheißer du. :)

I think it's not much more clunky than writing chat emotes like a smile :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:01:55
I still don't get the point.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:26:33
Ah understand. Well, this is truly pedantic. Because I also don´t really see a difference. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-09-04 21:49:14
Much easier. Less clicks.
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:39:23
Agree with you. This is why I think back and forth between Electrum and Coinbase. I really love Electrum but I am paranoid that I could do things wrong. I never had much problems with malware as I am pretty paranoid "no-script browser extansion", "anti-vir", "firewalls", "second windows profile when visiting sites that I don't know", "second notebook for opening programs that I don't trust" and so on. But you never know... it's still not a very nice feeling to have a tool on the PC with value in it. :D I believe I trust coinbase more than I do trust myself. But as said, decision is not made yet, which means the guide you posted can come in handy if I want to add extra layers of security.

At the end it doesn't matter as I buy Bitcoin regularly and will be one of the 1%. You can trust me, I'll be a better wealthy person that those we know today.
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:40:06
Nope, I just meant that it seems that there is a book in front of you where Germany is still ruled by nationalists. But that's not the case. We are modern and peaceful but we hate trolls like you :) Buy a new book. Germany looks different today.

I won't force anybody to Bitcoin. I think this is not a proper christmas gift and I would find it very awkward to give a gift that the receiver doesn't even know. However, I would do this if Bitcoin would be more mainstream, why not, I also did gift somebody Paypal balance in the past.
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:23:18
Thank you. Didn't know that one.

Are these freaks everywhere?

I agree with this. We need to push this forward :)

My bitcoins are mined. Ok, that was a joke.. In fact I consider to buy some but it´s still too expansive.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:18:43
That is awesome. Didn't know that :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:03:02
Yep, stackoverflow would also bring a lot of new creative people onboard of the Bitcoin world.

This is what I love about our community. The team spirit is the power here :)
@_date: 2014-09-04 22:17:56
I use paypal and I really think paying with coinbase was more confy. Not talking about the process to create an coinbase account because you would have some work too if you´re not paypal customer yet. I just think that it worked very nice with coinbase to make my first purchase. I am ok with this payment variant.
@_date: 2014-11-30 14:16:38

That sounds so mainstream... I am sure my grandma will understand what you mean.
@_date: 2014-12-02 10:41:41
Yes, please drop the difficulty heavily. I want to mine Bitcoin with my computer. :D
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:04:39
I said more than that. I think buyer protection is nice but in the case of PayPal we all know that it also opens doors for fraud. As a fair person I simply can't make an online deal if I can't be sure if the other side will try to rip me off months later with the buyer protection.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:20:15
I think that is how many businesses feel about Bitcoin. As much as I like Bitcoin, I wouldn't like to implement it if I would have an online shop or so.
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:37:57
I rather would use a wallet on my desktop system and never ever a wallet on a phone. But I wouldn´t get money on it anyway, if there is no PayPal solution.
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:44:53
You get it right. I am.
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:36:55
This is actually true and I go so far to say, that people like you are way more healthy for Bitcoin and the community than those who are totally blind and take no criticism. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 09:28:32
Virtual and Digital is the same.
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:48:11
Good points but Reddit should take such things more serious. There was also a similar story about where mods used the monopoly to only let certain articles through and so. I think there is a lot of abuse going on here on Reddit.

I often see the tips in this sub and I wonder what would happen if someone tips a person that does not have a bitcoin asdress? And how do the people who tip know that this particular person does have or does not have an address?
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:05:38
I thought it's good for some more amusement. :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:16:46
Exactly... it's as if ChangeTip changed some things here.
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:04:20
I'm glad you have humor :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:17:40
I think they might make it go viral. I just can say thank you. But don't forget that there are also people who make smaller and less tips but they together are big too. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:15:28
Thanks for your efforts but I didn´t even open a single image you posted. I´m sick of memes. I´m sorry that you did put so much efforts into our conversation. I´m very sorry for you. You little fragile person.

@_date: 2014-11-08 04:44:48
That's it. This is the reality about Bitcoin. It's not cheaper, it's not safer, it's not anonym... there is a lot of bullshit spread about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a lot of problems and they will make user adoption difficult.
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:48:45
To be honest, I would store that amount of BTC offline.
@_date: 2014-11-05 11:10:11
This is a good approach. See it already at lost and you can't loose it.

Nothing will happen if you do that I believe. A friend usually sends me money with memos like "For the whore you lent me", "For the heavy arms" and so on. He is a funny guy but nothing happened to our accounts.
@_date: 2014-09-03 18:52:07
Might be but my point is that all this is nothing compared to the popularity of paypal. I am a big supporter of Bitcoin as well but I really think that some people here dream. If Bitcoin doesn´t get the mass adoption that PayPal had, this will go no-where. That is my point and why I think Paypal does over the way to pay via internet imo. Ask some people outthere if they ever purchased anything over the internet and if they say "yes", ask them how they did it. I believe a huge amount will answer "With paypal" or "credit card" et cetera.
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:54:03
Because he want to buy in for $1.

I know what Bitcoin and ChangeTip is, but what is a faucet??
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:42:09
I know, the fees are horrible. I don't use bank account online, she doesn't too. Bank account is only for life maintenance and Paypal for online shopping. Bank account is enought money to reach the next month and no more. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:51:03
Interesting. Maybe I'll take a look.
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:09:42
I guess it won't take much time until first peopel create a bot for those giveaways. Happened with steam keys too.
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:18:21
Yes I did that. :)
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:14:59
If I click on a 2 years scale I see a constant downfall. But anyway, probably still very overpriced at the moment.
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:44:22
Any chance that we could see ChangeTip on wordpress.com in the future? I wrote [here]( what I mean.
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:13:54
You don't get the point troll.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:14:08
Exactly. Change Tip will change the world together with Bitcoin. I really would like to see that content creators and any kind of people can be tipped anywhere in the web. That's what I want to see.
@_date: 2014-11-22 22:02:42

Is there possession with my Electrum wallet? I have it stored there.
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:05:46
But this is not Forest Gump?
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:58:36
Can you explain?
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:07:54
I suggested the Paypal&gt;Virwox route since we both have regular online income. She has a paypal account, I have a Paypal account and a longtime Virwox account. I know, high fees but doesn't matter in our case as we often have Paypal balance. I might do this for her if she is really sure, and then I forward it to my Electrum wallet until I explained her more about security. I don't think that it is a good idea to set up a wallet on her PC. I am not sure if this would end well. I might suggest her to create a coinbase account just to use it as wallet later on. This is probably better.
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:09:42
I am not even sure what this means
@_date: 2014-06-15 20:42:40

Yep, time runs away!
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:12:43
I wouldn´t compare PayPal with Bitcoin, so why should we call Bitcoin the next PayPal? I see your point but it´s really bad to call Bitcoin the next PayPal.
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:21:23
Let me think about this offer :)
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:57:13


Same here. The first two paragraphs were super bored.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:21:51
Exactly. Leave tip amounts in it but don't use it as wallet.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:30:04
Thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2014-11-22 22:17:05
Thank you. Learned :D
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:08:48
This article made me tired. The first paragraph was already a hurdle.
@_date: 2014-11-13 14:00:00
Exactly. ;) This is the problem with it :D

No, it´s all about money.
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:58:03
Why do you crowdsource your translation? I went through the German translation database and there are all kind of strange suggestions. I noticed that there are a lot of non-natives suggesting German translations and the outcome is pretty wired when you read it as a native German.

@_date: 2014-10-09 19:27:32

You seriously ask that? This news is about reddit notes and that is not a cryptocurrency but you come up with the comparison like "premined" and so on lol. You know what? They simply make a data base entry to create these notes. Or do you have to mine your comment before you can share it with the world?
@_date: 2014-11-26 03:03:16
This is actually a post I wanted to create too. It's totally embarrassing what I see here. I guess we have a lot of kids in the community or ar least immature as you said.
@_date: 2014-06-12 11:47:27
Thank you. Found it out now :) It was easy as autorizing apps on Twitter or other social media sites. Pretty cool.
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:36:41
I totally agree. I absolutely waiting for it. Maybe we all should contact them and ask for it.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:24:13
I think I must Google Trezor... but there comes up another question... will Electrum update automatically or do I just need to uninstall and install new and type in my password to gain access to the wallet again?
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:08:02
Not sure what his point is
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:42:16
Yes that is a good point as far as it is possible when shops take btc. Since humble bundle does offer bitcoin as payment variant, I used bitcoin a few times to get their game bundles. I didn't use my hodl amount (pc wallet) but exchanged fiat to coinbase instead of using paypal as in the past.
But when I did that I always assumed it would be kinda unhealthy for bitcoin due to the fact that they probably exchange to fiat again anyway. But then I don't understand the whole market theory behind bitcoin anyway. I maybe should dive into this and I follow already bitcoin markets to learn about the bitcoin behaviour.
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:22:01
Where comes all the hate from in this sub?

I am happy for you that you can afford to tip more. I can't. Look... the world is actually bigger than you think. It's not only about you.
@_date: 2014-11-28 03:13:43
Don't spend what you can't afford :D Thank you :D
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:53:57
But still I would hold because if this is possible, there will be more possible :D

@_date: 2014-11-20 18:27:15
No. I know that this happened. But not anybody would secure the money with exchanges to Bitcoin when fiat would collaps. Bitcoin won't be worth millions of dollars in this case.

Do you think a service such as ChangeTip can play a big role in adoption? What is your opinion about tipping influencers on social media platforms? Can this be an approach to create awareness, to help Bitcoin growing?
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:33:42
No, not really to be honest. Because if the difficulty gets to a point where we will need server farms to generate them, I bet only a few very huge brands will generate them. Maybe even a single company. That´s what I ask myself.
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:14:49
Ok that makes sense.

But it happens too early. I stick at 0.5 btc and planned to stock up to 1 btc. It will take much more time if it goes to the roof now :D
@_date: 2014-12-01 12:46:51
Thanks for explaining! I think this is now a little more clear, especially the part with the privacy.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:55:52
This means, buy some as long as you get them cheap :D
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:20:37
Agree with you. The ChangeTip mania is the most interesting story of the weekend.
@_date: 2014-11-08 15:54:32
I expected this to happen. Thanks for sharing. 200 bits @_date: 2014-11-05 11:56:27
I actually asked my question because I want to write about it too but on my blog. Reading your document, I see you approach it very similar than I do but that is the problem. 
You in your document and me in my blogpost draft, we both mention the network very early and theirfor also the word miner as well. This is what I mean by technical, it's extremely hard to explain what makes Bitcoin so special without talking about Bitcoinrelated technical terms very early. 
While I like your document very much, I think it will only work to explain Bitcoin to people who are already open to tech innovations.
What I tried is to write a post for my 1600 followers who are mainly cat lovers, photographers, designers and what not (as my blog is a little broader). I tried to not mention any technical details too early but it seems impossible.
Things like the "cash of the internet" don't work in my opinion as same as "sending and receiving money via internet" doesn't work without explaining why Bitcoin is superior to PayPal. In real life I tried to explain Bitcoin to people who asked me when I mentioned it and it almost every time doesn't take much time until they answer "So, this is like PayPal? I can do this already!" and that is the point where I need to say "No, wait, there is a huge difference..." and I need to go into full technical comparison *laughing*
This is usually the poiint where people stop to listen. The Bitcoin technology is extremely complex and I am not sure if the mainstream will ever understand what makes it so special.
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:50:23
deleted? what was the idea?
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:17:28
It hurts my brain if I know I could get a quarter of a bitcoin with 50€ and weeks later I just get a tiny fraction (if price will reach 1k again for example)
@_date: 2014-11-08 19:11:55
Good point. Probably until everybody knows it. :D

I second this. I use Electrum as well. Easy to set up and easy to use, even for beginners. I didn't know how to start some time ago but Electrum was fairly easy to understand.
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:19:49
Ok thanks for the explanation, I understand now. I sadly can't edit this now. :/
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:10:02
Welcome onboard of Reddit and ChangeTip Vitcoria. Hope you have much fun but you sound already very excited :) Enjoy the time with us :)
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:46:34
You are expansive, man. For me, a beer would enough to get my friendship.
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:52:16
I am glad that someone points this out. In case of widespread adoption it could work as you described and the result wouldn't be small amounts.
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:05:15
What exactly is this?
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:53:33
That is a cool thought. :) But hopefully the last days are also motivational for the whole Bitcoin community :) I think we have a good toolset to create awareness about Bitcoin outside of Bitcoin related subs. I also like how it changed the atmosphere in our sub. It's really cool.
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:18:01
You missed a slash :D but thanks anyway.
@_date: 2014-11-07 08:05:30
Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:23:13
It's really interesting to see how much nice projects are done for Bitcoin. Amazing.
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:59:48


I agree with you. I maybe did generalize too much. It's just that I have holidays and used the time to relax, to browse the web and of course browse Reddit with lots of time. As I am interested in Bitcoin I do also frequent here in this subreddit and I didn't meant everyone here but but after heavily browsing through this sub since some day it is to me clear that there are at least pretty much strange people with pretty strange arguments. But I agree with you, my comment might be offending to those who are not. I maybe should have written it different. It's just that I see a very clear trend that is far away from reality. You can see one example in my comment and I see this contradiction with the middlemen quite often.
To your last question. I just can say why my comment came up. If I would have a business, I wouldn't be interested to implement some kind of currency that is not established yet and that needs to rely on another service to grow. If at all, I would rather implement businesses and currencies that are already established, for example Paypal with standard currency. Which means, I fully understand the mail of Lastpass and that as someone who would like to see Bitcoin grow. I wouldn't like to add an element to my business just because a minority does pay with it. I respect if others would do it, but I wouldn't and fully understand Lastpass.
About the middlemen services, I just could repeat what I wrote in my previous comment. I find it very funny that people talk about advantages for users such as "no bank" aka middlemens, while they start to suggest middlemens once a company says that they don't want to accept Bitcoin as they think it's not feasible. It's that easy... it's unlogic for me and some people in the Bitcoin community are entangled in contradictions. The middlemen argument was just one of many examples. I see every day something here that makes me go huh.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:32:54
I asked them to do this a half year ago. Good to see that they finally will make it possible. Awesome!
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:41:14
He used his crystal ball as most of the people in this sub. :) Including me :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:48:47
Why is it working in your case?
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:33:20
I think so ;)
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:41:55


This is so wrong. Satoshi Nakamoto probably holds a chunk of Bitcoins, maybe he did sold already many. He did or he will earn with it too.
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:30:57
Thank you for the suggestions. I have everything on Electrum wallet and did only send the needed amount to coinbase to make this purchase. I like electrum. I am still a little bit afraid of paper wallets. But anyway I just have $20 in btc and not a huge amount.
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:08:23
Thanks for explaining :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:01:19
It happens way too fast for me. I was on my way up to 1 btc but it takes me some time as I only use money that is leftover each month. I own around 0.5 btc right now and then it happens... gentlemen. I didn't expect it to happen this early :D Please people stop the train for one month, after that we can reach the moon or whatever. :D
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:52:30
I think the difficulty never will decrease again. Mining won´t be easy for you and me anymore.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:04:53
Wise words, man.
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:43:55
Oh how cute all those life changing stories are. Very heartwarming. People like you will put a lot of people off from Bitcoin because it's sounds too much like a cult.
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:09:26


This never will happen.
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:06:45
Too sad that I bought my domains already :D
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:17:16
He should have bought you a computer first. You wouldn´t be so pedantic about the words then and you would be able to understand millions of people who use both words as a common term for things that occur on the computer screen. I´m sorry for your. My half father is from East Germany and thinks like you by the way but it´s not his fault.
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:30:36
The ride to the moon?
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:43:59
Can you explain?
@_date: 2014-12-27 23:30:26
Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-11-08 11:35:38
I assumed that your small world looks like this.
@_date: 2014-11-09 11:22:35
Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:55:30
As much as I would agree with you, but not everyone can simply make mega tips. I could empty my wallet with 1000 bits tips in a very short period.
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:43:44
Love it... yes.. please!
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:17:57
Where exactly is the difference?
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:14:43
Look at the user name... FAToshi :D Well, this was a fat one :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:13:52
The problem is however that we shouldn't forget to tip outside of Bitcoin related subs.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:49:23
So, you would suggest to move to web wallets instead of using Electrum?
@_date: 2014-11-22 22:01:53
Bitcoin could also be very overpriced at the moment.
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:43:11
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:23:59
I pretty much wish that this comes true. :) Yes, then I will throw large amounts around too because the definition of "large" and "small" is then changed.
@_date: 2014-06-23 09:36:51
I think he is totally right. To be honest.... it´s extremely hard to exchange fiat to bitcoin if you aren´t from the USA. Same for purchasing things with Bitcoin. Btw, I am from Germany... it´s hard to buy products with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:20:47
That is the right way to look at things.
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:57:35
You compare a beach sandcorn with a rock.
@_date: 2014-09-06 14:14:49
Fine for you :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:12:55
And what about my question 2? Could I just deinstall and delete all Electrum and wallet files and could I then still restore my btc after installing a fresh Electrum wallet? I mean, could my pc basically sink in the ocean and it would still be no problem as I just could install a new Electrum on a new PC and use my 12 words there to restore the BTC?
@_date: 2014-08-11 03:31:52
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:23:05
I think the love that people like you spread will give bitcoin more attention. Would like to see changetip spread all over the social networks. I like the concept. It´s much better than up or downvoting. I also subbed to changetip now and will take a look there.
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:59:50
A lady in a hair salon heard about Bitcoin at all? Are you kidding me?
@_date: 2014-10-09 20:06:00
What does that mean?
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:44:09
wrong :)
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:09:29
I love that, I really love that. You make a very good point my friend :D
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:13:56
I thought tipping more than $25 wouldn't be possible?
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:16:54
I will :)
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:40:00
That's not bizarre, that's an over 10 years old concept.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:32:18
I use Electrum on my way up... does it offer 2FA?
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:39:19
Thanks for posting this. I am good old Second Life merchant :)
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:09:56
This is very reasonable. I pay around 30 euro for my hair cut o.O
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:45:38
Yes noticed that it would be better to ask there :) I´ve done it. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:28:21
Thanks, someone explained alreay.
@_date: 2014-08-10 10:43:50
Problem is... I still have to use Paypal as Bitcoin is still not very known in Germany.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:01:35
I am glad that this strategy works. We should be present anywhere. I tipped already too content that I liked in subs that I follow. I will continue doing so. My tips are small but if we all do it, it's big.
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:11:54
Not to release reddit note as a cryptocurrency as it seems.
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:57:48
Corrected your downvote. It seems that people didn't get your irony :D
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:56:41
Or he donates to me. I will spend it in any store that accepts bitcoin to support the economy.
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:44:10
You don't need to
@_date: 2014-06-15 21:13:55
Sounds like a doom loop then.
@_date: 2014-12-11 10:07:49
Not sure.
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:10:53
Funny but the smiling working womans are very creepy :D
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:35:06
Interesting! Thank you.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:34:48
Best answer.
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:39:12
I am the only one who thinks she looks like a head cheese?
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:36:10
Is this a joke now? :D
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:05:10
I am ready to buy more :)
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:39:42
I plan to use Bitcoin to inhabit the Mars in 10 years. We have already all plans and once we established our planet, we will come back to exterminate the earth. Let me know if you are interested in AMA.
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:21:03
@_date: 2014-08-10 10:58:34
This is why I love Reddit hard :) 
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:56:47
Du bist ein kleiner Affe der etwas aufmerksamkeit braucht :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:34:05
I stay. I support Bitcoin. It's just that I don't see Bitcoin as a get rich quick theme. :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:30:10
Your title makes me think that the name of ChangeTip is actually not that bad as I thought :D
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:54:35
I rather think that your mother didn't do a great job.
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:51:35
How do you mean this?
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:26:28
Nope... but male and never happy :D a bad customer :D
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:48:10
So, you suggest me to wait until it drops again and buy in then? If this happens, I will do it :) But I can't afford to buy in if it goes through the roof.
@_date: 2014-09-12 20:19:24
I would have done this for you because as a long time reddit user, your account here seems legit. 
However, I logged in to my Second Life account (I create 3d content there and sell it and receive via paypal), I just had $6 left that I did requested now. Sadly not enough for two copies. All the game bundles really did empty my online wallets (except for my BTC currency) and I never use my reallife money for online purchases because I earn through my website ads and Second Life too. The blog will pay out on the 30th and that is too late for the bundle. Can´t predict when there are new sales of my Second Life content, and even if, it takes around 5 days to get the money down so that the timeframe would get short.
We have still 15 days left for the bundle so that I could at least write you a PM in case I can request another payment.  But I believe you got the bundle already then.
As said, we don´t talk about much money and additionaly your reddit account seems legit so that I would have done this trade with you. The HOI bundle comes just in the wrong timeframe so that I had to request my last pennies. I even paid $1 transaction fee paypal (which is why I usually rather wait for big payments, but these cheap bundles make you crazy lol)
Hope you find another solution. And if I get some more money down early enough while you still don´t have the bundle, I let you know and you tell me if you got the bundle already or if you still need it. In this case we could do that :) Sorry
@_date: 2014-09-04 23:07:46
Thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:34:26
Real gold or Reddit gold? :D
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:38:01
I would like to hear the answer to this question too. What exactly is a fake tip?
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:50:43
More people should do support the economy instead of hoping for profit.
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:01:40
Which is why rockstars usually destroy hotel interior. It simply works out well. :)
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:38:19
Tasty! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-08 19:24:35
And for sure they immediately downvoted the post here. ;)
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:44:12
Now we need to expand this strategy :)
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:09:21
I missed it as I was busy in real life, but congrats to those who got some fine tips :)
@_date: 2014-10-09 20:07:28
But I am Deutsche Bank customer and can´t. :)
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:50:32
No it's not funny. It's actually sad. I give you a hint...
You compare apples and oranges. This feature has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies but yet you do compare it with it, which is why I asked if your summary does also count for the commenting feature of Reddit.
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:55:47
I'll take a look now. I don't own a PayPal credit card yet but if they offer PayPal online payment too, this would be awesome.
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:45:58
Only if it is raining gold. Otherwise it didn't happen.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:44:11
No, the people at  are killing it. It's crowdsourcing, they get the translation for free. I suggested some German translations today because a lot of stuff is wrong.
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:05:08
I will test this out :) Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-11-05 12:01:26
I like ChangeTip.
@_date: 2014-06-12 11:28:33
Wow that was easy! And thanks a lot for the tip. This is a pretty cool system!
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:11:32


Sure we need, unless you just want to trade person to person like in the medieval or on Ebay clasifieds. But if I want to shop in online stores, I surely need a centralized provider. When I for example wanted to buy the Humble game bundle, I only could use coinbase.
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:42:49
What are all these posts about million clubs? I am in the club too? What is a million club???
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:23:54
The messure is 100%. Google trends always shows 0% to 100% and no exact data. I asked Google keyword planner but it seems that there is no data known for this keyword imo. Only admins can be sure imo.
@_date: 2014-12-01 03:16:40
Yes I have read that but I still don't get it. I mean with Bitcoin there is zero privacy anyway because even if I forward them to a new generated address, people could see where the coins came from. And security? Don't know... it's still in my wallet no matter which address. So if anyone gets access to my wallet, it doesn't matter which of the addresses is Bitcoin loaded. So, I really don't get it :D
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:50:02
When I joined the Bitcoin community, people mentioned a lot of benefits of Bitcoin. A lot of people praised me that it's better than Paypal (yes I compared it with Paypal because I liked Paypal) as it cuts out the middlemen. Now we talk about businesses and eventually people start to suggest Bitpay. Is this irony?
@_date: 2014-12-28 01:03:58
"I never paid a prostitute with Bitcoin, will you be the first one?"
Use this one at your own risk.
@_date: 2014-11-08 22:00:39
He hopefully does. With ChangeTip it's possible!
@_date: 2014-11-02 01:23:00
I think I will do that too as soon as I filled up my wallet. We must adopt people :)
@_date: 2014-12-04 04:13:15
Thank you Five!
@_date: 2014-11-12 07:59:31
I think it would be much cooler to hear the talk with the people, I mean without music.
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:21:59
It's indeed amazing. It's fairly easy to act like a fan boy :) I do that too because I like ChangeTip. :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:03:17
Thank you. I hope the keys are very well encrypted so that even malware would have problems to get on them.
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:22:43
@_date: 2014-11-03 09:25:50
But that would decrease the amount of people who tip as not everyone can spend one dollar all the time.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:54:06
You make me tired bro. You tried hard but we still can´t be friends. Can I go on with other things now?
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:09:12
It isn´t. I use virwox for years since I am Second Life designer and merchant. Works very well since years just that the fees are high.
@_date: 2014-12-27 15:30:20
And I always come too late to a party like this :(
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:15:03
Agree. I only invest what I can invest. It's money that won't hurt if I lose it completely. It won't make me freak out. If it will, then only if a half bitcoin will be worth a million :D I sure would freak out because I didn't expect to get rich in my life. :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:41:16
I agree with you. Not much to add.. The first time it was funny but when I saw only these ads in the bitcoin sub, it started to get emberassing and immature. Point. The actions on twitter are even more emberassing.
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:01:43
But this is not different in bitcoin related forums outside of Reddit.
@_date: 2014-11-12 07:51:48
BUt then you must also understand he is getting old. My grandpa was once a very good guitar player. He still is, but when I talk with him about equipment, he is not informed anymore about all the new stuff. I think you can't be up to date your whole life. But this is ok.
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:06:08
Why is data such as profile photo collected? I do not like this.
@_date: 2014-12-26 15:54:57
Nothing of importance
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:59:47
Oh my god are you blended.
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:33:02
But people bought that stuff also with fiat currencies.
@_date: 2014-11-12 07:35:20
True, I am one of them. Extremely smart but very lazy.
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:13:49
Yes, this is a good mantra. 200 bits on me @_date: 2014-11-12 20:07:42
She is, as most moms :)
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:41:03
I use bits since some time as I find it very easy to speak in bits anyhow.
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:27:58
But how hard will it be to mine in a few years? Who can afford to get mining hardware? Two or three mining companies? I believe the difficulty will reach a point where only a cloud can generate bitcoin. Am I wrong? Because if this is the case, I bet only one or two huge brands will mine them and not a single user. I would then see scenarios like "Paypal/Ebay creates the infastructure" or "Amazon has already the infastructure" maybe "Google?". Will the last bitcoin only be able to be minted with super clouds?
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:25:06
It's not covered by any popular tech blogs. I read them all.
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:00:51
Oh, and suggesting godaddy, that shows how backward you are :)
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:40:46
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:40:47
Don´t be pathetic.
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:31:25


That sounds so negative. You don't want to the moon?
@_date: 2014-12-01 22:14:37
Wait, you can set up a tip that can be collected by the first person who grab it fast enough? This is awesome!
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:41:37
Is your comment premined?
@_date: 2014-11-28 03:19:14
Congrats for your sales!
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:03:09
I am not amazed. Bitcoin is still too cheap. This is not gentlemen.
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:07:29
I never used them, I don't even understand how they work.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:56:19
Yep, I think there are no places in the internet without trolls. However, I do prefer Reddit Bitcoin over Bitcointalk too.
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:37:45
Also we don't need to see one and the same news again and again. The whole story was submitted several times.
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:50:52
honeypot :)
@_date: 2014-11-22 22:16:53
RemindMe! 2 Years "Is one Bitcoin worth $1 yet?"
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:33:59
How does that work?
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:15:02
LMAO, that's fun. Thanks. :D
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:40:47
And what exactly are bits?
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:04:48
I just started to share love in other subs. :)
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:03:44


Yes, google Electrum. I use that one as many others.


Not possible yet. Only way to get Paypal to Bitcoin is the exchange provider Virwox, however, high exchange fees and a real mess because you must convert through several digital currencies before you actually get Bitcoin and if you have them, they did add up to 16% fees.. not best solution and also not exactly what you are looking for.
You might take a look at Coinbase... no paypal, but you could buy with bank account?
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:11:41
Now we need this service in Germany. I would fill a box of games.
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:34:52
Exactly, very well said.
@_date: 2014-10-22 11:52:46
Then I am at least rich in satoshis.
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:56:41
Maybe he is from another country. I for example live in Germany and never heard of them either until they started to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:44:43
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:14:38
Lol, that's cool.
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:07:21
Fixed your karma. Someone probably accidently downvoted you.
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:21:46
Not sure but in case someone knows it... the next question would be... where do I get this shit in Germany?
@_date: 2014-11-02 20:28:51
the probability is high :)
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:00:29
So you do believe that we don't need new users?
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:46:53
It's good that people don't stop to mention it... With ChangeTip we got a big weapon in our arsenal.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:05:52
Who told you my strategy?
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:41:57
This is a so much better idea. He should send us.
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:23:41
OK this makes me afraid now.
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:41:57
What does that even mean? Is this gambling?
@_date: 2014-11-02 00:02:05
Thanks a lot! :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:21:15
Agree and we all must continue to create that kind of awareness. We are a strong community.
@_date: 2014-09-04 22:22:03
To experiment a little bit I actually used some bits that I had on my electrum wallet and forwarded them to coinbase. It seemed that I couldn´t use my electrum amount directly at Humble store . Am I wrong? Would be nice to know due to the mentioned fees. How much fees does coinbase take? Well, I´ll find out in their FAQ I guess.
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:41:49
I think this story came already up monthes ago. It's known since some time that they infiltrate online discussions.
@_date: 2014-09-03 17:29:41
Is bitcoin already more popular than paypal?
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:00:31
I keep my coins too but they were tipped anyway :D
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:11:23
I do not think so much about Bitcoin when somebody is asking me about what I am thankful for. My loved ones have the highest value in my life. I am happy and thankful to have the right people around me.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:49:36
Trust in the power of cryptocurrency my friend. Buy in more and be billionaire soon.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:50:46
Cool! Didn't know about this sub!
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:18:43
You could pay me a million and I wouldn't install your extension lol.
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:20:12
Seeing a bits tip under several mBTC tips is like medicine for my brain. It is so much beter to look at it.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:52:42
Haha, very fair :)
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:37:23
My next purchase will be at $300. It won't stay at $380 anyway.
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:35:12
Ok thanks, didn't watch.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:50:13
I suggested ChangeTip to add bits to the moniker creation but it seems no one did support the idea.
@_date: 2014-06-23 09:38:06
No you can´t. You are maybe in the USA. In Germany you will have a hard time to purchase things that you want and this with BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-24 20:08:10
So, you tell the truth and you receive downvotes. Amazing. I am happy to have people like you here. Although I wish there would be more.
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:30:38
Wish people like you would put your energy in real game development. Even your screenshots tell me that it´s yet another mini game in the 80´s style.
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:56:03
Would like to see this movie but won´t pay for it.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:31:06
This is a point of definition. You could say exactly the same in two years "I wish I would have bought them when they were cheap!"... you might say it again some day :D
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:06:51
If he is true, it will make me sick because my goal was to get 1 btc but I am at 0.5 btc now. Or it will take much more time. I actually planned to buy 0.2 in december but it looks that this won't happen.
@_date: 2014-12-06 02:12:57
Couldn't watch fully. Became sleepy.
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:03:58
Pretty cool! I'll do that!
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:19:51
Might be true soon ;)
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:27:11
I said this quite often in this sub and most people flamed me for it. As long as you can´t buy things everywhere with Bitcoin, it´s just a hype in one country. It´s as the OP said, this whole thing must actually reach other countries and if it doesn´t, Bitcoin will remain something like a US internet currency.
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:53:16
Care to explain the joke?
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:26:10
I ordered more. I am gentlemen.
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:05:48
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:43:27
It´s related to the beer mug that we call Maßkrug: 
Bavarian people often say "Ein moaaars" when they want one mug :D
@_date: 2014-08-10 10:52:10
Cool.... I´ll be there in case the BTC price drops again and when I bought a chunk of them... 
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:24:12
You're welcome ;)
@_date: 2014-11-03 09:23:04
You didnd't listen to his suggestion :D
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:15:45
Exactly. Played all kind of Paradox games. Eu3, recently I played EU4 a lot, Victoria 2 and so on.
Then I saw the Hearts of Iron bundle. Good that there are still enough days until the bundle runs out. I have to fill my paypal account with a few dollars to get it. But I have enough on my coinbase wallet and I was sad to find out that Bundle Stars does not offer btc payments while Humble Bundle does.
By the way, they answered and said that they have no plans to add bitcoin at the moment but they do thank me for the feedback and do like to add new payment variants. Looks like it won´t happen soon but they think about it already as I understand the answer. They probably check out if they get enough feedback about this, which is why I thought it could be important to write them this.
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:27:54
Oh a very smart one.
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:17:27

1 million... in some years.
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:15:30
I hold my hand opens and buy them up.
@_date: 2014-11-05 10:52:47
As a guitarist, blogger and hobby graphic designer I feel with you :) Also one of the reasons why I support Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:36:24
I have a mental health problem. I suffer from depression and anxiety disease and I don't do such things. I think it's not much about mental health problems but about idiots. You find trolls everywhere in the web. In games, in forums and they love to make trouble. I don't wonder that they are here too. But... I think we are stronger and will drive it to adoption ;)
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:26:33
Not sure why but something makes me feel comfortable when I read your shit. Please create a blog and tell us more. 100 bits
@_date: 2014-11-03 09:24:41
Agree but not everyone can tip huge amounts.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:57:58
I have no problem with it. I actually think that ChangeTip will help adoption and it's ok if people organize "Let it rain" threads here. I like the whole idea.
@_date: 2014-11-05 14:18:56
Ah, that sounds like fun :D
@_date: 2014-11-05 10:35:29
I use Electrum. Easy to set up and easy to use.
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:57:49
Same here. I would go there every week.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:57:11
Unconsciously you thought me how to write middlemen correct in english. Thank you :)
Related to your comment... I am not sure if any business will ever fully rely on Bitcoin rather than fiat. Maybe, but I think fiat is much more attractive which is why Bitpay is of course a smart service idea. It would be cool but I don't think it will ever happen.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:49:10
Lol... tears in my eyes.
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:24:07
Can confirm. Living in Germany and that's what is happening here.
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:49:45
I'm too far away... he should drive backward and catch me up. I am near the trainstation on the first day of december with new money in my pockets. :)
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:36:58
But there is always an upward trend later on. To the moon!
@_date: 2014-11-20 11:42:32
Not really.
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:44:36
That is good. I love that Wiki takes things serious.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:43:11
Eu vou ver se falo com ele hoje. Ok?
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:47:29
Understand. That's why I said my comment was more general and not aimed at your video. I want to make this clear, I liked your video. I especially like the guy who corrected himself like "I do, ehhh I mean others do buy drugs with it". :D
As said my comment was related to the user who said "All of them have heard of bitcoin, even if they don't know too much about it." which implies to me that he thought you would have asked a group of people and all knew about Bitcoin. But that was not the point you wanted to make as it seems. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 11:36:54
Right. But that doesn't promise anything for the future of Bitcoin. To be honest, I hope for Bitcoin too but I see it more realistic. Sure, it could sky rocket but it could also collaps but many people don't want to hear it. The fact that the protocol will always work, doesn't mean that people will always use Bitcoin. It could hit the bottom as it could hit the sky. Everything is possible... and by the way.. the actual exchange rate is pretty much pumped and not natural. So, be very careful. I hope you are invested with money that you can afford to lose. That's how I do it. It wouldn't hurt me if my Bitcoins would be worth $2 dollar tommorow.
Long story short... 2024... maybe we still know Bitcoin.. but it could also happen that Bitcoin is already in 2016 a story of the past that only a few geeks can remember of.
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:50:21
And who said that financial institutions and governments can't regulate or stop Bitcoin? It looks to me that it is possible.
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:40:39
No but it will become the end of the bitcoin decentralization.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:28:34
So, this is the case where people eventually start to suggest a middle man service? Is this Bitcoin irony?
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:17:20
I knew usernames like your would pop up some day :D
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:38:10
You don´t get it. But anyway... I´m tired.. not only of you... I´m really tired. If you need to talk more about your problems, let me know tommorow.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:47:37
Can I copy this and send you back?
@_date: 2014-07-20 23:38:06
I am pretty much sure that is true but until now, it just proves that Bitcoin is nowhere or at least just in a very beginning stage. In Germany you have a hard time to buy and to sell... it´s nowhere.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:40:49
Já, comigo ninguém pode. Onde foi que você ouviu isso?
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:23:34
But that's what the Bitcoin community does regularly too.
@_date: 2014-11-16 02:20:31
Lolz. Bitcoin believer who was able to install a wallet and to manage bitcoin transaction believes that a forum is like a 747 cockpit. Lolz. That is irony.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:11:05
Go back and p0wn some people on xbox. You still bore me, even with your doubleaccount, kid.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:27:28
True and appreciated.
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:03:52
Thanks steve.
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:33:59
Yes, this is my idea too. I don't want to force anybody to Bitcoin but I will mention it at times and I will try to educate those who ask for more informations. This is what I actually like about the Bitcoin community.. when I was new, a lot of people helped me :) I think it's important that we introduce some people :)
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:48:23
I have money but I am tired. 18 dollar waiting to be spend, in eight hours I´ll buy in 9 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-01 03:51:44
I am very sad. I now can't increase my little Bitcoin holdings up anymore :D
@_date: 2014-11-21 15:01:47
Wise people do understand the world.
@_date: 2014-12-02 10:40:25
This is called delusion. But there is cure.
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:19:13
Yes, told her it's divisible. She seems to understand.
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:16:46
Working :)  300 bits for your Bitcoin support @_date: 2014-11-07 13:51:27
Thanks a lot. But I do think about it at the moment, if I should move my bits to coinbase. I think this is the safest solution as they send me an email if I login to coinbase and I think it is unlikely that someone can hack both my coinbase account and my email account at the same time.
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:38:13
I hope there is coffee on the moon that I can buy with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:12:02
Yes please. Spare us with stories of an insane reporter.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:07:03
Yes, exactly how I feel about it. :D
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:08:11
You don't need them.. if you are often around here, you will see them, even in this thread here.
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:59:43
I am in Germany o.O
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:40:37
This. It's actually more healthy to have some people here that don't jump in the cult clubhouse. We have some insane people here and I am pretty happy if there are more realists now in the sub.
@_date: 2014-12-09 06:51:59
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:36:35
Thank you for the tip. By the way, I have a blog on wordpress.com with own domain. Is there any chance that you will contact wordpress (automattic) to implement changetip there? Not sure how it could work but this would be awesome!
@_date: 2014-12-25 18:04:12
I am glad I sold my coins before christmas. The only thing my family asked is why I have so much christmas presents for them this year.
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:11:17
Ok thank you :)
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:44:47
Wow! Didn't know all that. This is very extreme story. I am active in both places and didn't even know that both are connected to one person. So, people trusted him and he made a profit of it. Crazy.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:11:49
All I can say is that it was a bug in my software. Will buy-in  again when bugfix is applied.
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:40:21
Thank you. Understand now. And thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-11-08 19:09:20
I can offer him some bits :)
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:20:50
What is world fist? This sounds pornographic anyhow.
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:51:39
Very well said.
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:23:51
I love the idea but will it work if the shirt is crinkled? If so, it would be an awesome idea!
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:12:29
I just bought today. Price doesn't matter to me. I have not much, I just did spend what I can spend without getting in trouble. Today it was 50 USD left over from the other month that I did spend to get some more bits. I am already pretty wealthy in bits. I want to be part of all this, I believe in the technology and I will spend each month a small amount no matter where the price stands. I spend funds that I can afford to lose. It's not much but it doesn't matter to me.
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:51:02
This is a shitty place full of scammers anyway. It's a wonder that this forum still gets attention at all.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:12:36
Thank you
@_date: 2014-11-08 12:02:10
Should I ask tommorow? :)
@_date: 2014-12-06 08:31:23
Liked the story :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:11:58
Oh man... you shocked me :D I thought someone would tip me $1000 :P
I'm kidding. 
Ok.. I understand now :) Thanks for explaining. Also I went through the whole thread here earlier to find the answer :)
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:36:38
Yes Reddit would cope. I just saw this screen with "Reddit couldn't make this page for you" ten times today.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:45:56
To be honest, I believe this is a fake. If not, ask me for my BTC address. But please send be BTC 1000 USD worth. I do shoot a lot of photos with my smartphone and I am more and more interested in photography, so that I need a decent canon camera. I hope you can convince me too :P
@_date: 2014-06-15 09:51:27
I trust you so much
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:35:54
Awesome!

This is gentlemen :D

I can only speak russian when I drunk too much Vodga xD
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:31:00
But the big question is if anybody will do so if they don´t see benefits when the difficulty reaches a point where you will need super clouds to generate bitcoin. Or will the difficulty not be that hard?
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:17:01
I am not even sure how this can be upvoted here.
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:07:54
But did you get them for the actuall rate you were selling them?
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:04:46
Not sure if I want to pay tax on a few cents :D
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:22:39
Absolutely agree with this.
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:55:34
I prefer the downvote.
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:15:05
This.... this makes me think that it is in most cases users fault if accounts get hacked.
EDIT: typo
@_date: 2014-05-17 11:57:26
THIS! I am happy that someone is mentioning it.
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:49:56
I see a rollercoaster :D
@_date: 2014-11-03 09:07:13
Are you a bot? :D
@_date: 2014-11-27 18:35:29
Not only in San Francisco :D
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:09:13
That is cool! :)
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:02:22
Yes, this would be cool but after reading several news articles, this will probably happen. Hotels are only the test and they might want to expand it to all other services as cars and airlines if it works well.
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:29:02
Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:07:40
I am from Germany and use Coinbase. I believe they added a lot of countries last month.
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:52:16
Can somebody translate? :)
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:35:12
It's doing fine, thanks. No need for any site.
@_date: 2014-09-04 22:38:04
I never used a QR code and don´t know how to. Maybe I should read about it. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:17:17
It's mainstream if my grandma only accepts bitcoin when she sells her apples on the market. I am working on it...
@_date: 2014-06-15 21:17:14
[I´m too old, really...](
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:22:59
My Paypal acc is now free again and I could make the purchase. You are probably right... it's actually good that Paypal is very careful with the accounts.
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:05:32
Good that we still have attentive users.
@_date: 2014-11-05 13:54:16
First you need to login to  with your Reddit account or any other social account where you got your first tips. It's in your case Reddit and you can there connect other networks later on if you like.
Now that you are on ChangeTip, you can click on "my account" and then "money". On this site you will see a section that is called "Withdraw" and under "Send bitcoins" you can put in an address where you want to send your tips and the amount you want to send.
What you now just need is one of your Electrum addresses. Electrum created already some for you when you did install the tool. When you open Electrum, you click on the "receive" tab. There under "receiving" you see your Bitcoin addresses. You pick one of them and right click on it and choose " copy to clipboard". Now you just need to go back to your open ChangeTip profile that I mentioned earlier and you put that address in there and the amount you want to send :)
Also be sure that you always let some small amounts on your changetip account to tip others. If you just have a tiny amount that might make no sense but in case you have bigger amounts some day, use a fraction of it to tip too. I say this because it is very healthy for the currency because you can tell people about Bitcoin on this way, the same way as people told you about Bitcoin, the reason why you are here now :)
Let me know if you have further questions. I am no super tech geek but I know some basic stuff already :)
Edit: removed some of many typos (sorry I am German)
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:01:45
Nice quite but we can´t use this one yet.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:17:24
Always if there is a alternative where you can pay with Bitcoin, you should do it. Always!
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:21:41
She is Ebay powerseller :) No need for extra income.
@_date: 2014-11-26 03:10:03
No, this is actually a bad news because it will show what kind of embarrassing people we have in the community.
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:57:02
Now land this thing safe on any street in any megacity without hurting someone. I think on this way we will get full media attention. :D
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:46:32
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:09:46
Hopefully to the moon :D
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:00:40
True, it is :/
@_date: 2014-12-04 05:08:48
This is the truth but people will sadly call you a troll for mentioning it. I'm happy that we still have users with opened eyes here. Guys like you are much more healthy for Bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:57:06
Agree. The truth is, nobody can predict.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:17:20
This is always a good place because you can get a dozen of games for just $1. Also I suggest to leave some percentage in the ChangeTip wallet to tip others especially in non-bitcoin related subs. This really helps creating awareness.
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:44:33
Nah, we are happy with No need for alternatives.
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:36:49
Nice dream. I like that one. Sadly it's just a dream.
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:21:04
I see but at the end it really depends too if the place where I want to buy something offers this QR code variant. I beliebe Humble store for example just offered coinbase.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:05:21
Best comment here.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:31:40
This sounds like heaven in my content creator ears.
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:07:23
True and for sure you got downvoted. People simply can't take the truth. I agree with you. Security is plain hard for the Jon Doe and overall it's way too complicated too for many.

Oh that is smart. Well, then I can order my future pizza's with Bitcoin. There are many stores in my town. Although I dislike the idea when I remember the Bitcoin-Pizza story :D
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:58:28
Wow, that's cool. I didn't know that!
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:47:59
He doesn't 
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:01:55
Wonderful! Good support!
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:40:05
True. It's very embarrassing behaviour. But that's how it is if you have kids in the community.
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:41:56
Now please contact wordpress.com to add it too.
@_date: 2014-11-24 00:48:02


So true. Absolutely my recent feelings. Can't even add much to it. The hardcore evangelization probably does scare a lot of people away and I wouldn't wonder. It does even start to scare me and I am getting more critical about it.
@_date: 2014-12-28 01:01:57
This sounds decent.
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:14:39
We might meet each other there :)
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:54:33
So, I have 0.4 BTC... as you are pro traider, you can make 1 btc out of it? :D
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:55:58
Sounds like fun anyhow. But I will only play this game as long as the market is that volatile. I only spend what I can afford. I usually buy at $300 to get a warm fuzzy feeling :D
EDIT: I meant I only buy in if the price is anywhere at 300$ or even below.
@_date: 2014-09-04 22:19:03
Yes... yes... that might be... I see the moon :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:05:39
I am pretty much sure he does. I made several tips over the days and it worked well, same for receiving tips.
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:13:22
Very creepy indeed.
@_date: 2014-11-05 13:58:56
I said similar things to my friends and they immedietly answered "Thanks, but that's what PayPal can do too". This is the point where you need to go more into detail with technical stuff and ideology. To be honest, sending money anywhere over the internet, that is nothing new, which is why I understand these replies of my friends... so how do you ELI5 the advandages of Bitcoin? That's the question.
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:22:46
I am from Germany and it worked anyhow. Don´t know why. But my humble page is in english.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:11:25
I can really suggest the Firefox addon called noscript. It blocks all kind of javascript and can save your ass. It's basically like a firewall for the browser and you can whitelist certain sites. I am sure this addon is also available for chrome.
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:42:02
This is the wallet I use and I am a real noob. Easy to set up, easy to understand. Can suggest anybody.
@_date: 2014-11-08 22:33:37
Yep, checked this out too. Very interesting that it's more and more asked via Google too.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:26:03
What makes it funny is that all people here say that one of Bitcoins strengthen is that you cut out the middle man like banks and other authorities. Now, when a business say that they don't want to implement Bitcoin into their daily business, people start to argue here that there are services like Bitpay and so, that make it easy for a business to accept Bitcoin. Eventually people start to suggest a middle man. Funny. To be honest, this shows the delusion of this community and how blended people already are of Bitcoin. Weeks ago I saw a German documentary about Bitcoin and someone said that Bitcoin supporter are like sect member. This is so true. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of Bitcoin, otherwise I wouldn't be here but we really have a lot of strange people here. Just saw someone a few days ago here asking how he can sell his house for Bitcoin. It really shows, if the Bitcoin ship is sinking some day, some people will probably go suicide. I think we have a lot of people on board who don't live in reality anymore.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:17:45
Lol, very creative moniker ;)
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:28:13
Oh man, that looks tasty! Happy thanksgiving! Enjoy your time!
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:04:17
Your name should come true please :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:57:07
Can you explain why?
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:02:42
Cool. I never met someone who knows Bitcoin. :/ I am from Germany too.
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:07:33
Cool stuff, man. But please take care of your synapses.
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:55:51
Nope. You didn't get it. I respect it if a business does not want to accept Bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:19:41
Not very creative but here is my retweet: 
Much luck to you.
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:47:07
Please do this. Sometimes I get the feeling that the interval of submissions in this subreddit slowed down a little bit. Always good to see new things here. Especially if it is not only so serious as most topics. I like also funny bitcoin related stories.
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:50:55
Thanks for doing this! I hope a lot of wealthy bitcoin early adopters will do this.
@_date: 2014-11-05 14:19:24
That made me laugh :D
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:29:26
Hope I don´t have too much negative impact on you.
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:01:13
Paid article. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:18:23
I like the UI. Simple and slick but this is for sure a matter of taste :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 11:36:12
There are some freaks who only live in a bitcoin world and they don't realize what you said because they suffer from delusion.
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:13:17
Bitcoin is the dressing on the salad.
@_date: 2014-11-21 15:00:15
That was a Reddit bug. His comment went the wrong route.
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:48:13
Oh yes! You are right, there were other places with dragon eggs :) 
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:35:23
Most here are just gamblers.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:29:45
LMAO :) But a good one!
@_date: 2014-11-29 11:02:15


I wanted to say that it is not the main reason why I would be happy to see them adopt Bitcoin fully. Yes, I pretty much like the security aspect of PayPal too. I  would probably think about it, however, I wanted to imply that the main reason why I would like to see it, is that it would drive adoption heavily.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:20:40
First we will reach ground so that I can buy in.
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:20:46
Yep, told her about some ways.
@_date: 2014-08-14 11:58:17
I will buy in tommorow when 1 BTC is worth 10 USD. I will buy 7 BTC :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 10:09:36
The Microsoft news will drive the price heavily down too I think.
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:29:41
Much appreciated! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:49:56
Well said. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:28:12
It is. I buy quite often there and I love the fact that it's charity too.
@_date: 2014-10-09 19:36:05
You made my day.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:02:08
Is this somekind of Firefox plugin or what?
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:35:13
That sounds awesome! I think I will set this search engine to standard.
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:48:02
You are funny.
@_date: 2014-11-28 20:25:06
conspiracy! :D
@_date: 2014-08-10 21:58:36
So, when I unlink Twitter, will the data be deleted too? And can you still access future data even if I unlinked the account?

Thank you for saving my time.
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:40:48
Then I understand what a fake tip is... I made two of them accidently too. I thought I still had a balance but ChangeTip didn't update it right and I tipped two more people but in fact there were no bits anymore and two tips became broken :( The ChangeTip updated too late.
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:39:26
Happy Cake Day :)
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:40:01
So true.
@_date: 2014-11-08 19:05:52
Agree. This is the reason why the idea is very bad.
@_date: 2014-11-15 19:36:29
Is this possible?
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:45:18
It's not my car but still I do wonder where I get these Reddit and Bitcoin stickers!
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:03:26
Won't happen. I hodl.
@_date: 2014-06-15 09:57:00
And how can we trust the person who will manage the whole sum?
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:15:41
It's because some people enjoy to flame. I wouldn't care about it. There are trolls and there will always be trolls. :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:38:15
What is a HD wallet?
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:52:59
I think the biggest thing of 2014 was ChangeTip. I am pretty sure that it brought in a lot of people.
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:29:14
I don't understand these charts. When I for example open bitcoinity charts on a 2 year scale, all I see is a declining price.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:51:36

To the moon, I´d say.
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:42:53
Thank you! Much appreciated :)
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:25:58
Good. You got my point. It's just as long real as there is internet.
@_date: 2014-11-30 14:12:36
I am not even sure what the change addresses in Eelctrum are for. I usually transfer the money from change address to my real address but it always cost me a fee. It's horrible that the tool decides where to put money.
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:40:11
That´s what I did in the past. I am also long time Second Life user and 3d designer there with income. In the past I was able to send my linden dollars into the inworld terminal to exchange it on the Virwox site.
Later on, this was not possible anymore. Now it is possible how you described it but the fees are indeed extremely brutal so that I didn´t consider it yet. But it could be the last solution I have if there is no other workaround. Thanks
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:29:37
Yes until now. What I ask is, how the difficulty looks like in a few years? Are cloud servers required to create bitcoin then? If so, I guess only two or three huge brands will generate bitcoin in the future and not a single user. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:19:07
Sad that I suffer from dyschromatopsia. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:51:07
No. Just one last thing... please go and die :) You´re such an embarrassing creature and it´s sad that you don´t even notice it. :)
@_date: 2014-08-08 00:05:53
Thank you but I am from Germany and coinbase is only for the USA. Also I dislike the idea that coinbase wants bank account data.
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:31:46
Does that mean buying and selling are no transactions in the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:13:36
That's cool :D Not sure how that happens. I see this sometimes too. Nah, I was kidding when I said I am a spokesman. What else should I answer? :D
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:54:45
Yes, I love the idea but you mention it, you would need trusted community member and I am not saying that we don't have some but how are they picked. If I would be one of the early adopters, I would ask me this question.
But anyway, there would be indeed more tipping power. Many person who tip, resulting in much bigger and faster reach of people.
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:23:03
I thought it would only apply if she own Bitcoin. We are not that far. But maybe I don't get the whole Gentle-thing. :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:20:24
I think she understood. :)
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:17:58
Yes, if you save money with a currency that is experimental and lost most of it's value in a short timeframe... yes that is delusion. I have Bitcoins too but not because I think that I can save money on this way. I really think that we have a lot of strange people here and it is no wonder if some outsiders think that we are some kind of cult. I remember that guy who wanted to sell his house aa few weeks ago here to invest this money in bitcoin. I don't want to know how much people will lose their lives in case bitcoin wouldn't do that well and lose more value over the next years. That is the problem I have here. Some people are already blind of greed and they are responsible for the bad bitcoin image.
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:50:51
Only noobs would fall for this trick.
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:42:01
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2014-12-04 04:38:21
Haha, 100 bits
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:09:50
Exactly and businesses will always convert. So, what people suggest, that doesn't fit together. It shows that it's often just delusive what you read here.
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:08:28
Stop dreaming. BTC won't be worth $1,000,000.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:23:13
Or they fixed it.
@_date: 2014-12-04 04:35:34
I hope wordpress.com will make it happen too.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:32:12
I didn´t even know this sub, this implies you would fit better there.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:30:41
This is something that came to my mind. You can find a lot of negative articles with Google. It´s just that you wouldn´t find them often in a Bitcoin related forum or in a sub here on Reddit and so.
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:22:14
What is an ATH?
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:31:42
Nice article but I hope this will also get mainstream media attention. Would love to find CNN or others write about it :)
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:23:12
Thank you. I was actually inspired by our subreddit here. I for example saw people asking online shops why they don't accept Bitcoin yet and so. I really love this approach because we can show demand on this way. Then I saw people offering me fiat to promote content on my blog, and I thought I could apply the same "method" too.
I actually became aware of Bitcoin when I offered a Steam game in a German forum some time ago. One person did send me a PM and asked if I would accept Bitcoin. I replied "What the heck is Bitcoin?". He explained some things and it was interesting and I started to spend several days with Google to find out more. I think that's why our voice is so important and I agree... small steps.. but as a community they are big steps.
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:40:26
No I actually meant to drive mass adoption, new users.
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:10:28
I could imagine that a lot of countried could forbid companies to trade or accept Bitcoin. I am pretty much sure it would kill all possibilities for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:26:32
True and that is the problem. I have $50 and I couldn't tip these amounts of $3 very often. You must also consider that I also hold bits for myself. What I mean is, I can tip smaller amounts in mass and will do this, but should I tip any V.I.P 100 bits? In my case I will start to tip small amounts in other Reddit subs, I won't tip a V.I.P such small amounts because it probably would result in the opposite of my goal.
@_date: 2014-12-08 08:37:25
If it's German, he is offending.
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:45:17
Yes looks like she did understand it.
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:56:29
Next time you want to trash bits... send them to me.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:37:49
That's nice. My first dogecoins YaY :D
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:41:40
Haha, yes this is a good idea I think :D
@_date: 2014-12-07 14:32:15
You can also go over board with analogy. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:24:21
I don't believe you.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:51:06
Haha, that is kinda cool! Thanks for ELI5. I understand now!
@_date: 2014-12-25 19:20:55
Not really. I didn't sell for the price you see today. I sold weeks ago at 380 or so. :)
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:15:55
That's awesome. You remind me, I did distribute cookies in the past too. That makes me think that my statement is misleading.. I didn't hodl everything. But I am not sure if it had any economical effects :D
@_date: 2014-11-08 12:33:20
I wouldn't call myself a Bitcoin beginner. I also do understand some technical aspects, however I do write about it right now and noticed that I can't explain everything. I ask this question as I thought some people could give me a better understanding. I don't understand what the system of miners do in that process. I know that one address sends informations to an open ledger called blockchain and when it's proccessed, it's forwared but the whole transaction is still visible in the ledger. What I do now wonder... when the transaction is in the ledger, it is waiting to be processed and signed, I assume this is what miners do? As you can see, my knowledge is even after researching very vague and I asked this question to get a better idea because I know that some people here can come up with very nice explanations and if I still don't understand, I can ask for ELI5. So, what I still don't get to 100% is the whole technical process that works behind a transaction. When I asked Google another day, I got all kind of results and after reading it looked to me that a lot of people don't get it right. There are at least several articles out there where it is explained different than in another article. And then I found a couple of articles that write it like "it's goes in the blockchain and transaction is done after that", but that doesn't help me much to understand it. So, I am a little bit more into Bitcoin but I don't understand in which sequence is what processed in the background. :)
@_date: 2014-11-05 14:01:55
Happy cake day!
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:08:08
I agree with this. ChangeTip might be the rocket for the moon trip.
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:37:58
Can someone explain me a few things?
1. why do I have two passwords? One thing that I generated and one thing that the software generated for me? I wrote both down but I am absolutely not sure why I have two on my paper now.
2. Could my PC be hit by a rocket and I could use my paper with the two passwords on another new pc after I downloaded Electrum there? I mean are my two passwords all I need to restore my wallet whereever I want? Could my hard disc die tommorow and it wouldn't be a problem?
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:10:45
Do they sell happy pizza for Bitcoin too? I´d be interested.
@_date: 2014-11-27 18:53:52
Spending? That's the mission for rich people. I just have 0.4 btc and I won't use them for shopping. I don't even have a wishlist. I just hodl my small bits pile :D
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:31:02
Althought fair use is not very clear defined. But then, the whole copyright is old and not proper defined for modern technology. As a blogger, I am very careful with fair use and tend to use my own images. Sadly.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:31:01
And again you are talking about yourself. Do you really want me to leave this discussion here?
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:48:22
Wait 4 hours... I will move the exchange rate up later. I preparing it already.
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:51:34
Me not
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:32:28
Haha ok, good to know :)
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:08:04
Ok I'll do in the future but what exactly is np.reddit.com and what is the difference? Just asking so that I understand. I am since some time on reddit but this was my first crosspost. Can you explain me?
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:03:39
Because gentlemen :)
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:12:02


1. Bitcoin is slower than Paypal.
2. Less risk for chargeback brings in another Bitcoin contradiction. It's less risky for the merchant, but it is theirfor more risky for the customer, although the opposite is praised often here.
3. It is not cheaper to implement a payment variant to allow a minority to use their currency. The weighting of established payment providers will eat up the fees. I would rather implement something that is used by many.
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:07:38
Yep and more sexy.
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:19:07
But this is...
@_date: 2014-11-08 11:48:06
I am sorry but you just showed the other 5%. How could I know?
@_date: 2014-12-02 12:45:24
Delusion is trolling. You actually scare away newbies.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:14:43
Understand but it's a big difference if the price is at $1000 or $200 if I can only invest around 50€ by the end of each month.
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:05:54
In Germany too but I don´t want to use my bank balance.
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:43:23
Oh my... I am lucky that you are just kidding.
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:55:07
How is it not relevant if all sites still show BTC? It's very relevant but I agree, it might not be that relevant anymore in the future if everything works out fine.
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:04:37
Agree. And now there is not anybody who doesn't use the internet. (sure, apart from some people in countries with less tech)
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:14:04
Yes in the long run it might work out as you said and I hope so too but at the moment it is in my opinion an experiment, which is why we don't know it :)
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:15:56
Only thing I missed was the term moon. But this guy awesome.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:41:10
Not only unfinished. The nearly finished ones are quite bad translated. I went through the German section today and suggested some translations. But there is a lot wrong and I stopped to check out more as they probably won't pay me anyway. Crowdsourcing is a complete joke, I mean, they could at least make small payments for contributors.
@_date: 2014-11-19 07:51:44
Now I need to google Xapo.
@_date: 2014-11-03 09:24:00
But the problem is that not all people are rich in bitcoin to make huge tips.
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:20:33
Not sure. I am not a marked expert. I did just read in a German news article that there are higher transactions but that it will cause the price to decrease because it is exchanged in USD. This did sound very logic to me.
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:25:40
That was not against you or your video. I assumed your intention was not to say 100% knew about Bitcoin. I wrote that for the Redditor above me who assumed that 100% would already know Bitcoin.
I think people should be very careful with street interviews. Media is full of it... they show here in Germany 20 interviewed that think some political decision is good but they don't show those who dislike it. As a German I know how opinions are formed. They are formed by the media channels that are biased.
I didn't assume that you wanted to create the opinion with your video that all people know Bitcoin. Your title says clearly it is about fun replies of people who heard about Bitcoin.
EDIT: Error. I wrote attention and replaced it with intention in my first sentence.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:29:23
To be honest... yes, put it in BTC.. believe me.
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:59:04

Sorry I´m quite new to the whole and thought it would just always increase in difficulty. But I get your point. Understand now. Thanks for explaining.

So, you know what I know? Interesting.

@_date: 2014-10-28 12:01:02
I have quite hard rules. No spun and duplicated content, only 3 outgoing links to sites that I approve, minimum of 500 words but better more and so on. I review any article before I publish something.
Additionally it must be content or a subject that I would want to write about too, it must fit at least to any of my categories and so on.
But yes, I get your point and you are right. It's to 90% bullshit that goes directly to the email trash folder. I look for the 10%. There are articles that I couldn't have written better. If the outgoing links and the whole article is about serious stuff (not casino shit for example) that I find interesting, I''ll publish it.
There is no real problem with guest posts. Google won't even notice if it's a guest post or not unless you accept all kind of crap. If I ask you to write me a nice article and if you are a very good writer, it won't hurt my blog to publish it. It's rare that you find good stuff but it's possible. I usually take a look at what they offer me and I review it.

I too support this idea. I know already what changetip is but I can imagine that it will confuse newbies a lot and it doesn't sound related to Bitcoin anyhow.
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:16:46
I don't think so. Opening the all time charts shows me that it is more likely to lose value. I really suggest OP to take profit. This is going nowhere. By the way, there is a massive amount of BTC waiting to be exchanged to fiat, the miners will do this.
I did buy me a quite expansive DSLR camera with several lenses and some other extras. You are right, anybody should decide for themselves, OP can just read our pros and cons and decide for himself.

Is the 50% or 51% issue related to my question? I saw all those posts where people have been afraid that this one pool would mine over 50%. Are people afraid that one entity does the job to mine bitcoins alone?

I did that a decade ago and I am happy that I left this time behind me, though I don't deny or regret my experience, but I wouldn't suggest it anyway.
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:45:05
Saw several people crying in different threads here today because BTC sykrocketed to 300 and then back to 275.... which is why I suggest newbies "Don't panic, welcome to Bitcoin".
@_date: 2014-11-27 18:38:08
This is probably fake.
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:49:27
So true.
@_date: 2014-11-10 09:19:56
No, if you want to create a moniker, there is a dropdown menu and I only can choose from currencies and BTC. I wish that bits would be in that list too. If I want to create for example a "cookie" that is worth 1000 bits, I can't do that.. I first need to calculate what 1000 bits are in USD, Euro or BTC. There is no way that I can create monikers with the bits denomination. There are no bits in the dropdown menu.
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:27:49
The longterm charts say something else.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:57:54

Je suis Claire.
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:40:18
Yep, pump and dump. That's how some take their profit. You got it. But overall we will get to a point where not even this is rentable for the speculators anymore. If speculators and miners leave the field, you will find out where Bitcoin stands and this will happen.
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:18:44
It will. I agree with your sentiment, and if it won't, I  don't care, I buy even more.
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:06:15
Thank you. I learned my lesson. I shouldn't have dropped my initial idea. I am back with a new sentiment, the old one. From now on I will increase my funds of my wallet over time. Fortunately I still had 70% of the USD that I got due to BTC profit. I just did put it back in now.
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:53:57
Stupid advice.
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:50:04
This is interesting, I wait for a new version since some time.

They are quite expansive but it's at least a fast way to unload all my Paypal dollars that I earned with web projects. I get some tears when I see how much Virwox takes for all the exchange shenanigans... but well, still a good way to trade my dollars away from PayPal.
@_date: 2014-11-08 11:36:15
Thank you for the tip :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:56:48
Especially when it comes out of the mouth of the fiasco brothers.
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:07:54
Agree. I'd suggest that to the OP only if there is a real reason. In my case I used it a few times when Bitcoin was nuts for some hours and when I saw the chance to get some cheap coins. On this way I could start to hodl a little bit with help of my paypal money. But apart from that it's just not the right way. Even if the fees look sick, I maybe understand Virwox,... I guess they compensate the risk of customer chargebacks with paypal with the high fees, for example if one of their customers would do it, they compensated it with the fee income, I guess. That's the problem with paypal, nobody wants that risk.
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:20:59
I use Virwox to convert my internet income to Bitcoin or the other way around, depending on what I need and how fast. Problem there is that Virwox adds high fees and with high fees I really mean massive fees. In my case it is not that much of a problem because I don't see my web income as the same money that I earn in real life... the web income just adds up, I mean some people don't even have web income.. considering this, I am sometimes ok with high fees, but to be honest, it's indeed not that ideal. Apart from that, it's a hassle to convert via Virwox because you must convert from paypal to Second Life linden dollars and then to Bitcoin (with fees each step). But if you are like me and have enough money generated and think "fuck it, lets convert it", Virwox might be handy in some situations for you too. You maybe get my point... it's sub-optimal but sometimes "fuck it" handy lol.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:49:09
Thanks for doing this! I am sure you introduced a lot of people to Bitcoin on this way.
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:44:05
I bought what I could afford but sold all coins at $370. Nice profit, bought me an expansive DSLR camera and several lenses for the camera, a tripod and all that stuff you need for photography. :) I expected that Bitcoin won't go anywhere. I believed in it for a long time but looking at the charts of a month is just bullshit, I made this decision when I looked at the all time charts. I think a lot of people will burn their hands on Bitcoin because they spend money they can't afford. In my case I did spend money I can afford but anyway, I thought it is better to get out and take some profit.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:03:34
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:19:00
In this case I would prefer it. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:01:09
I'm so lucky that I sold all my coins at 380.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:10:24
LOL, yet another freak that hurts our community and bitcoin in general. I hope you don't talk with newbies, otherwise they will get the impression it is a cult.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:50:58
So true lol.
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:51:43
How cool... creating some fake profiles to make a bitcoin conversation with the own fake profiles lol. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:49:26
If you ask me, yes... I like Electrum because of the good usability. Simple tool, simple to use.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:01:11
It's good that you do this and more people should do it as well. I remember that time when everybody here was tipping inside and outside... that was a nice atmosphere and brought in a lot of newbies.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:07:46
Doesn't matter.
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:01:30
Wait a little more and you get 50 for the same amount.

Drugs are no solution. Computer games are.
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:39:16


Until these companies get regulated by governments.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:03:14
There is a lot of Bitcoins waiting to be converted to USD (mining)... and it will happen. The price will go even down further, maybe $100 or $50.. who knows. But anyway, that doesn't mean it is bad for Bitcoin... I think this is actually healthy.
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:07:46
I think this is really a good approach. Me and my friends used quite a lot of things back then, mostly on weekends or when we visited big event like the Mayday in Dortmund or the Loveparade in Berlin. But as said, we did do it also on most normal weekends. Our main arsenal was XTC, Amphetamine and Cocaine. But we also experimented with Acid, Mescaline, something we called Gülle (one of my friends brewed it with a substance you can extract from glow sticks)... I don't know, I guess we used the whole herb garden but more likely anything chemical.
This happened over a period of two years, really flower power and fortunately I am absolutely ok today, but to be honest, I still see some of the other guys at times and not all are ok. One of them suffers from schizophrenia, another guy became drinker and does still use drugs at times as far as I heard... and so on.
And now I sit here, totally healthy but see how much damage it has done to some people. This is why I dislike to suggest it. I don't use anything today, not even a drink, it's because I dislike what I did when I was younger, it's because I realized that this can go either way, some can control it, others will damage their own lifes.
My honest respect to you. I loved MDMA... if you really can control it this way, this is good. Don't dig deeper into the field. You are right, moderation is the key. But even then I wouldn't suggest it to anybody, because not all can control it like you.
About my part, I had my fun, I never will try again even if get a smile when I remind back to some trips lol. But that is history for me.
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:38:04
Great day for panic guys :D
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:22:08
Right, and it's hilarious to just choose a few days, weeks or months.
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:45:24
Right. Strong hands can do this.
@_date: 2015-05-14 09:30:15
You have no idea... just take a look and see what happened when YouTube (and other networks) tipping became possible.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:39:20
Me too... I love these rides.
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:22:50
There will be more chances... it's not the first time that bitcoin is wonky
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:06:36
I laugh my as off about both, people like you and people that burned their hands on Bitcoin. The delusion here is unbearable as the butter trolls. Fortunitely we have some great members here too but 80% are not.
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:16:18
That sounds good. I like that.
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:13:12
That's what I actually did. I don't believe that the current price is realistic. It's artificial kept on this level and nothing more. There is no real economy that would justify the current price, it's speculative and will burts sooner or later. I was hodler and strong believer but this changed over the past weeks.. the reason is that I don't believe in the price anymore.. I strongly believe the price will bounce back to $180 or $200 range soon. Taking a look at the charts you see how the exchange rate is fighting for live. I will buy coins again but now I just sold what I had and made profit (I am not bitcoin rich, I speak about a few coins).
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:15:55
But wait, I thought you started to troll? So, what is your point? I love trolls that get sick once they find someone who fires back. My grandpa is by the way still living and he thinks that you guys no matter which faction you are from, are backward as hell. You are the ones that didn't learn from history. You slay each other like stupids and still believe in religion LMAO. Oh and your German is actually not that bad, but you should still improve because it looks still as if it would have been translated with Google. But apart from that.. good job! And now please spare my time du kamelzüchter.
@_date: 2014-11-05 10:24:05
In this case I get almost anytime the answer "So, this is like PayPal?". This is the problem I mean. You can already send and receive via Internet. In this case I must go into full details and explain what the makes Bitcoin superior to PayPal and when I do it, people get confused and try to switch the topic because they don't understand what I am talking about.
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:39:53
I love that! Good idea! Didn't thought about this purposes. :) And thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:08:19
I just recently had my Paypal account frozen after trying to purchase Bitcoin via Virwox. I had to send them a photo of my ID. Paypal said they thought my account would be compromised but this is hilarious. I tried that purchase, not a hacker lol.
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:20:42
He is right. Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme as fiat currencies are too.
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:22:32

@_date: 2014-08-10 11:00:33
Nevermind. I´ll laugh at them when they will be the last one with fiat in the hands. :D
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:44:05
Take a look in the sub here, I just saw people saying "Oh my gosh, I received $300 and now it's just worth $275"... panic newbies must learn to hold the hands still.

Told her stuff like "Imagine you go shopping and you're able to pay with your smartphone". Told her things like "You don't need banks anymore in the future, not even PayPal" and so on. Basic ideas that I do understand too :) She asked about 1 Bitcoin and replied "If this is the future, the value of this unit will increase!". I told her "Sure, it's 50% to 50% chance and probably a better game than lottery.

@_date: 2016-03-20 22:38:30
Yep, but it's not in the context of bitcoin. Look, they could give you a very hard time on a much different way, they could send you back to Bitcoin medieval age where people can only trade via forums... there is no need to chill in this sub.

@_date: 2014-11-28 16:49:33
But then I do still see the fall of value. But OP did invert the charts anyhow. I wonder why people invert charts so that it looks better. Is there any reason other than feeling good to see how it could have looked like?
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:33:52
I have more problems with deluded people.

@_date: 2017-03-17 18:31:33
Just one account, with crypto trading history... it's just that I had cases inbetween where the up and down of the coin value stressed me that much that I didn't do one trade after deposit and widthdrew the exact same amount back to the wallet to hodl instead. That's why I asked.
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:05:30
That is nice but I believe I won´t find anyone in my town, who knows about bitcoin. This town is sleepy and backward.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:08:23
I am sometimes in the situation that I want to trade a certain amount like 10 ETH because of how the market looks like, and then I deposit this amount on Finex. It happened that I withdrew it an hour later back to the Ethereum wallet. I wonder if this can get me into all the trouble this guy had? I don't use Tor or something like that. But I definitely had some withdrawals without trades because I changed my mind as the exchange rate went up and I decided to hodl instead. Is this allowed or can this get me into the same issue?
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:21:05
Can you tell me a bit more about the universe?
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:06:44
Exactly, that's what many people forget. Do people really want to trade in forums instead?
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:13:27
Oh shit, this is way too funny.
@_date: 2016-06-13 07:12:59

Exactly. This must be complete bullshit. I am German and I don't know a single person in my environment (working mates, friends or family members) that know anything about cryptocurrencies. Some have heard the term Bitcoin but they have zero clue what it is about.
Not sure where they got the 29% from... this is the type of journalism you need to skip, because it's utter bullshit.
@_date: 2016-12-24 15:08:55
I am glad my family never heard the name Bitcoin. It's not known in Germany, unless you are a geek. So, no trouble here :)
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:22:08
1. As someone else commented already, the 51% is a real threat and that is something that not only Snowden suggests.
2. Yes, call it authority, you are right... The problem is that Snowden can actually show that he has experience in computer science. How do you think he got the position of global communications at the CIA headquarters? This is not just a random stranger like you, he is actually someone I take much more serious than a random guy commenting nonsense like you.
3. Let's face the reality... this sub here is full of very strange people that make out heroes, but once that person is just slighty negative about Bitcoin, it's an enemy. Let's be honest, the majority of people in this sub here is quite dull, completely blinded and can't take critique... only to the moon should be mentioned.
Seriously, I would much prefer it if the community would be full of people like Snowden, that do actually contribute to the Bitcoin subject instead of acting like a parrot as most people here.
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:20:30
Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2015-08-15 06:01:30
You too. It seems he understands more than you.
@_date: 2015-08-15 05:57:39
So, you are an authority in this matter? I prefer his opinion over yours... you are just a random  internet stranger acting smart... you didn't do anything, what makes your knowledge more valuable than the knowledge and opinion of Snowden?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:06:53
But on PayPal you could store the amount without any issues. This shows how unhealthy the Bitcoin-sphere is. Lots of scam services surround Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-15 05:50:00
Remember, the majority of people in the Bitcoin community is not able to take criticism and never was.
@_date: 2015-08-15 05:55:18
This. Bitcoin would become worthless again in this case, unless you mean trading through forums would be the future.... always if I mentioned that, people would answer "Well, then we can still trade through forums"... that is hilarious.
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:49:16
I did already... not sure where this will go lol, but I want an uncut place: @_date: 2015-08-15 05:48:45
That happens constantly here. People are heroes if they talk positive about Bitcoin, if they critique it and mention some negative aspects, they become enemies.The Bitcoin community is not able to take criticism. I generalize because the majority of people here denies even the slightest problems of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:05:48


This is something I told her right away when she asked to get into it. I told her "Mom, if this is going mainstream, you will benefit from it anyway". But yet she finds the idea to hold Bitcoin very interesting :D
@_date: 2015-07-16 10:48:48
I appreciate that much, but I checked out the price of the device and this thing basically costs at least 1/5 of what my mother most likely want to store in Bitcoin. This would really be an overkill gift from a stranger, a precious offer indeed. I talk about securing something around 1 or 2 bitcoin for my mother, maybe 4 if I count my own Bitcoin to it. Really, much much appreciated your offer, but I am shy to accept that from a stranger. Anyway, thanks a lot! I watched a few review on YT, looks like a decent device to me though. Your offer is honored, but anyhow hard to accept :D
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:34:25
This list makes clear what happens to the exchange rate if just a few of them would decide to sell BTC for USD.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:34:00
No they can't. SEPA not working.
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:46:49


Are you kidding me?

Or people that believe the video is true and not edited?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:32:19
I get this impression too, that is one of the reasons why I created the post.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:15:18
Yes I think so. We are from Germany. Probably the least country that will go downhill due to our industry (unless the Euro currency goes downhill)... but, people won't forget what happened in the past with failed banks. Not sure why, but there might be several reasons why they don't trust banks to hold much money, dunno.
Just a couple of weeks ago a friend bought a new car...  quite a lot of money (not a used car) and I asked him how the feeling was to hold that much in the hand after after visiting the bank, as I know how it feels like to get money that you spend a moment later. He answered "Cool, and bad as I knew I would spend it for the car, but are you crazy? Do you think I hold that much on a bank? I had it in my safe!". That's the general sentiment I hear often now.
I think there are some people that rather would put money under a pillow but not on a bank lol.
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:49:15
True but it's fun for short term trading now :) Go in, get out fast enough and profit.
@_date: 2015-07-14 06:34:27

@_date: 2015-07-07 15:36:02
Someone creates a bicycle for a person without legs and you say "Well done."
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:11:26
Exactly... first I explained here that this acts as a payment variant, and that it's imo not fully mainstream. I explained all the details. Then I mentioned that the price is of course connected to that, it's something you can not just leave out if you tell someone about Bitcoin... but that was the point where she got interested. She might not be a techy, but she understood and answered "That means it is a quite cool bet!". Yes,... she didn't take much care about the payment, she immediately saw the investment aspect.
This is quite sad... I mean it's somewhat cool that my mother is interested, but it's sad that she is not interested in the payment aspect. Now I really start to wonder if this is how many people will see Bitcoin? A bet to make some quik dollars in case this thing is hyping? So, who is using Bitcoin then in the future? I think this is concerning.
To the second part... yes, if at all.. I need to manage this investment for her. I don't think it will be very secure in her hands, that is the problem too.
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:16:38
Fine troll... I heard you. Bye.
@_date: 2015-07-12 12:51:55
Oh damn, yes that was awesome back then.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:46:24
As same as fake videos. Cut the video, so that only the stupid ones that choose the chocoloate bar appear in the video, and people will believe this video has any value.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:47:01
Yes, if they believe these videos, then you are right. Ever heard that you can cut videos to make them appear how you want?
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:54:48
This. A constant and steady growth is much more healthy for bitcoin in the long run.
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:19:40
Fine but how can people without SEPA buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:34:31
Waiting so long for transactions is really annoying
@_date: 2015-07-12 11:34:09
I wonder if they removed the possibility to exchange bitcoin to SLL? Under BTC/SLL I see only "Exchange SLL to BTC"... or is it because I currently have no bitcoin in my account?
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:39:58
Because trading will then happen in burried threads of bitcoin related forums? Do you want that to be the only case? Do you really think the currency has still value then? Are you kidding me or what? You can not deny that adoption is needed... trading through forums is not whats called mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2015-07-10 11:00:48
But I did profit from it :)
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:25:32


Good point. I can not assume that everyone will see the same aspect about Bitcoin like my mother. I am a little bit concerned now that this could be the case, but hopefully there will be more people that want to use it for payment.
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:37:39
Which is great... fun time to make profit.
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:03:11
She is no expert in that, me neither. I can explain her technology but not banking stuff. I am pretty much sure she isn't interested as she doesn't trust creditinstitutes.
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:27:55
For me this would sound concerning as pure speculative assets are only thast long interesting, until the majority of people don't think that anymore... sorry.. my english... I am native German..
What I mean by this... I think there is a point where all investors would decide "Let me get out here asap... price too low". This is concerning for me if nothing will back this up, like real usage as payment. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:17:22
Makes no sense at all.
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:54:07
These jokes are boring.
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:43:23
Yes, because you always need new users to fullfill this dream... which makes it look like ponzi... not that I agree with this, but this is something often mentioned in the media, with the result that the avererage guys think it is a scam. It's indeed a PR problem.
@_date: 2015-07-12 12:26:52
Wow, that is a lot! I play in a smaller league but it's still fun to be onboard. Yes, finger crossed!

This, and it wouldn't be good for bitcoin, because the media will love to slander about how bad bitcoin is.

So glad that we still have people here that know their stuff about Bitcoin. Thanks for sharing your opinion, there should be more of you.
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:01:24
Of course this is the crapiest comparison I have heard.
@_date: 2015-07-09 10:46:38
Why exactly?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:40:34
That sounds very interesting! I think I need to dive into this subject... I will read into it later on. This is also addressing my concerns, the malware that I constantly have to remove from her PC. Now this sounds like a real solution for the problem! Thanks.
@_date: 2015-07-21 11:55:42
Bullshit... Linux has its place but is imo the worst OS when you want to use things "play games, using all kind of software" and so.
Btw... I have a system with Linux too, but on my main system there is Win installed since decades and I never had too much problems.
Stop suggesting people Linux, it does not have a lot of usecases for the average guys.
@_date: 2015-07-16 00:09:49

As same as your comment that is not contributing anything meaningful to the discussion.
@_date: 2015-07-09 10:02:37
This! This is why I asked this question. Some jokes are cool but as you said, it's too much since some time, it's not serious here anymore.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:21:18
Very wishfull but I assume most people there didn't even heard about Bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:17:29
Not having an infections since a decade makes me feel very secure :D I don't want to disagree with you, you never know... but.. I can not deny that it feels very secure for me considering that my pc was always very clean.

That is the point... it's somewhat embarrasing that they don't want to afford professional translators, or do at least pay native German users to do a decent translation.

I see a long TX Hex number... is this something I can share in the public?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:58:47
To be honest, I myself use Electrum on Windows since a long time. Never had a problem, it looks very secure to me if your PC is not full of malware.
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:25:04
Look, this sub is bitcoin related and shapeshift too... this sub contains users that probably used shapeshift as well,...
Thus, I was waiting for them to reply. I couldn't care less what you think, you are no mod here and if you are unhappy with my post then you can downvote it. It's that easy.
Why are you guys here so toxic? It's not that someone forced you to look at my thread :(
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:44:30
A tiny percentage I believe. Most greeks won't be able to afford much Bitcoin anymore anyway. And apart from that, I also wouldn't suggest anyone to invest right now where the price is still heavily pumped and artificially hold up but slowly heading down. The price we see right now is not really justified. I expect that the price will further decrease... just check out the all time chart, the big bang ATH, but since then the value is decreasing, so, do you believe greeks are that stupid to put their money where it will lose value? Let's be honest, Bitcoin is a poker game, and we all know it... the chance that this thing will hype is very little, we all know it, we all just hope for mainstream adoption, the adoption that is imo not there.
EDIT: Don't get me wrong, I hold Bitcoin too (I love the technology)... it's just that I did use money that I can afford to lose... I see it as a 50/50 bet (not a very good investment).... imo it looks as if I lose the bet, which doesn't matter since I only used spare money. So, nope, I do not think that anybody will go so far to bet on this too.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:53:37
I don't work anyway, so, you wouldn't get me hired.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:52:33
I would give a rapper lyrics like "Fuck it, fuck man, Bitcoin, yea Bitcoin made me rich, fuck, Bitcoin, fuck Bitcoin, made me rich".
This is the way you get people into it.

Well said. That's how I see it :)
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:59:23
Yes, but I know how to get her Bitcoin... the sentence might have confused you... the question is not about getting bitcoin. I am sorry if that was not clear in my post.
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:13:59
That's not what the topic is about.
@_date: 2015-07-14 08:45:03
Nope, if you are crazy like me, you rather should not sell. Use money you can afford to lose and hope that this goes mainstream anyway. What I want to say is,... I do think this is a very high risk investment. I am preprared that it could get dumped to the price of LTC.... everything else is just hope to earn money easy if this goes mainstream... it's a bet for me, nothing else..
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:46:08
Yes but SEPA is currently not working in greece as far as I know.
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:11:35
Of course they can, but the Bitcoin crowd has to realize that the main selling point is not what will lead to success... a centralized Bitcoin service is the only way this can be driven forward.
There have been many statements in the past that were plain wrong... Bitcoin is decentralized, no, for the majoriity of people it never will be. Bitcoin is anonyme, nope, it simply isn't and never has been, there is a publich ledger and actually less anonyme than a bank account. And many other myths..
Is this all a problem for me? Nope, for me not... I have reasons to stay. It's just that all this need to be debunked clearly.
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:28:38
Ok... where do I find the TXID in the future? I just had this blockcypher link... they only show this huge TX, or I am blind and don't find the other one :)
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:34:09
Do they have SMS auth like PayPal?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:31:33
To be honest, I am not that far on my own... I store my BTC with Electrum. However, this is the case as I don't play with too big sums at the moment. I still don't own Trezor yet, but I will look into this, would probably a secure way to store both, her and my Bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:23:47
I am not hateful at all :D
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:42:16
It will have to play a role.. without them there will be no mainstream adoption... this is my opinion.
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:19:40
No, I do not think that this will happen... do you think Bitcoin will make them feel better? Just check out how much "value" Bitcoin lost over time.
@_date: 2015-07-16 00:13:10

If you can not exchange USD/BTC or BTC/USD, Bitcoin will become worthless even if it is a pseudo-decentralized currency, it will be killed if that case comes true.

Ok understand... but that is a huge problem as well. I assume the problems will go away, but image there are some beginenrs looking into Bitcoin right now. If I would be new to all this, I would be scared away.
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:43:01


What exactly is that? Looks like an us classifieds site to me. This this not used in our country. We are from Germany, people only use Ebay Kleinanzeigen, Ebay.de and Hood. None of them accept Bitcoin.

Lols... I rather tip her something on top of her purchase :P
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:17:02
I second this. Coinbase has the most horrible German translation. And I can tell you why... they want the community to create translation for free... they have a crowdsource project where people translate it for them for free.
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:33:46
Of course it is not hard. I would agree with you.. but this is a definition thing.. you and me think that, now we talk about a non-techy person. There is no way that I would suggest her to install Electrum on her PC, I rather would manage it on my PC.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:49:03
This... it's al edited... and there are enough stupid people that believe this is how it turned out in real. Thus, the majority of people commenting in this thread how stupid the people in the video are, they are actually more stupid than the people in the video.

That might be the case... that is what people tell me quite often in many other situations too. I always want to have everything perfect... bad habit :D
@_date: 2015-07-02 22:25:50
No difference... Coinbase to bank and bank to Coinbase isn't working in greece either. You get the point?

But that is exactly the point I made here. We talk about my mother... I would go through all of what you have said.. I am a geek who loves to try out new things and who has no problems to understand things after a while. But here we talk about my mother... thus, many people who commented here confirm what I said, you need to be a geek to store Bitcoin in a secure way... we all can do it, the average people can't.

As I stated, I constantly need to fix her PC software-wise.. she knows how to get malware as she clicks all kind of crappy links from her FB friends, or if her FB contacts are hacked. Another one her said that Trezor would be a solution, I will look into this... because, Electrum is safe on my PC, but my mothers PC is the last PC on earth where Electrum would be safe. :D
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:08:17
But at the same time you enter threads that you dislike, just to troll OP. Congrats.
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:18:30
Are you kidding or what? With Google trend you see a percentage scale from 0% to 100% traffic to the keyword. This could mean anything.... for example a few thousand ask for that particular keyword. It could be an extremely tiny amount of people... Google trends is really bad as an indicator as long as there are no exact numbers.
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:09:33
Just explains how toxic the sub is... people here can not take critique.
@_date: 2015-07-12 12:18:58
I did expect that and I expect much more than that.
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:36:06
I get that, this is how I see it... but this is no counter argument to what I wrote. In case only speculation is backing Bitcoin, it would go under if investors decide to get out... I do believe this would not be the case if there will be actual usage as payment variant.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:34:20

@_date: 2015-07-15 18:13:18


This is something I learned in this thread... this sounds good and makes Coinbase a real option for her as it worked with PayPal too, true.
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:56:29


I don't think so. Most people I know save quite a lot of cash at home... although this is a new trend I noticed, they don't trust banks anymore, I know several people who said they would rather save cash at home. So, they are basically their own bank in this case.
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:14:30
Did send via PM.
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:44:03


And this is a big problem. When I have to wait a half day if not a whole day to get transactions through, it's a big problem. Now as it is, it would scare me away if I would be a beginner, I would think "WTF??"... I hope the problems are solved soon, I think it will scare people away. 
I didn't take a look at Bitcoin news for a while send transactions and how could I know that I have to raise fees? Anyway, why should I? I thought Bitcoin is supposed to have low fees?

@_date: 2015-07-15 18:10:04


And this will teach her something she didn't learn in 10 years? Nope, I have to fix her computer and I have no problem with it... but this is the point... Bitcoin will never be safe on her end without extra creativity (son comes to explain trezor or what not.. something she wouldn't understand anyway lol). This is the point.
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:21:38

I would agree, I do for example dislike all the fake stories here like "[Enter company] is accepting Bitcoin now"... however, I have no problem with people that are excited to get a little bit profit due to btc&gt;altcoin exchanges... I just did spend some BTC for LTC too to have a little bit of fun. I do not think that they do troll, I assume they are just excited about the volatility of Litceoin and that they can play now with some coins :)

What? I have a couple of transactions waiting for the first confirmation since 12 hours. Do I do something wrong ?
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:39:25
As someone here told me that Coinbase has SMS auth as PayPal does, I agree with you... I always experienced that PayPal + SMS is very secure... now that I know Coinbase can do this too, this is most likely the easiest solution for my mom with high security (she had no problems with PayPal either).

I think my vape device is an extremely good replacement.
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:52:53
Nope. Nobody knows about Bitcoin here, just some geeks like myself and OP... apart from that, stores and companies are not really interested to get into Bitcoin either.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:18:07
They at least didn't update their payment methods page: 
Nothing about Bitcoin there.

lol, yeah, sure... what is harder to believe, that I talk with my mother or that I told her about Bitcoin?

It's some time ago since we had holidays ;)
@_date: 2015-04-03 10:58:00
This is so true. I also laugh about all these pseudo-experts. My strategy was for a long time that only one thing is sure, bitcoin goes up and down and that can be used for daytrading. It's no real rocketscience.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:07:58
Sure, I don't disagree, but it's not a huge news.. I wish there would be much more important adoption than just that.
@_date: 2015-04-09 22:43:13
Much hype about nothing.
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:32:56
I comment where I can related to. If overkill or not. Wether I add something positive or negative to the discussion (I do this everwhere, you probably too). I am not afraid to do so. It is usually also not a problem. But here it is different but I am aware about it. I know that I can tank evangelists with my opinion because if you are rather moderate, you will appear like a magnet for haters. And yet I still don't care. So, overkill or not, nothing will change. I rather fight for it, because this sub here does clearly need people with opened eyes, people who are not afraid to point out that not everything related to Bitcoin is moon. Edeka accepting Bitcoin, that is fine, but it is not a real big story.
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:31:31
Does your stuff expire on the way at home after your shopping tour? No? Rewe stuff doesn't expire as well, Rewe does deliver right after you ordered. Edeka however doesn't do it. So, this is the reason why Rewe is much more popular and why it is not a big deal that Edeka does accept Bitcoin now. As said, you can order things like frozen Pizza from Rewe and when you accept it on the door, it is still frozen :)
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:48:23
That is collegial. But as a colleague I send it back. Have 50 cent on me and get one of our great bio strawberry yoghurts. :D
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:42:49
Which is why Rewe has a great concept, like your local Pizza deliverers. Again, in every town there is at least one Rewe (usually more than just one). You order, and they get the stuff into the car and ring on your doors hours later. This is a big difference compared to Edeka. As same as you dont order a pizza from another city, it makes no sense to order food and what not from Edeka if they deliver it via package days later. That is also the reason why people prefer to order with Rewe (talking about my friends and family). This is the only thing I pointed out and also the reason why I do believe that Edeka should think about this concept too, and then it would be big... you order via Bitcoin and get it an hour later directly to the doors. That would be huge. Why should I order at Edeka (where it takes days to get the stuff) with Bitcoin if I can order at Rewe (where I get it hours later) with PayPal? That is what I mean. I don't wait two or three days lol, I could at the same time go out shopping with fiat. Edeka should rethink their online delivery concept, and then accepting Bitcoin, it could get huge!
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:56:54
Can't believe it. Sorry.

Yea sure, I don't really care if you believe it or not.

The algo is not called page rank. Page Rank is a tiny part of the Google search algo. However, the page rank is dropped by Google and not updated anymore, at least not public, but is most likely still there in the background. But as said, it's part of the algo and not the other way around.
@_date: 2015-04-10 03:53:10
Look, I am here to find Bitcoin related stories and not the mail traffic of one guy and his step mom.
But if we already talk about this subject, I find his behaviour embarrassing and hope that he doesn't speak with anybody else about Bitcoin. Because this kind of hardcore evangelizing is it what makes the Bitcoin community look like a cult. People like the OP do frighten others away.
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:01:27
To be honest, I see this happen very often... as same as the old grannies that search for pennies to pay the exact amount... or grannies that want to talk with the cashier for some minutes while all others are waiting.
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:42:51
Not gonna happen. They probably won't even makes sales through Bitcoin. Apart from the fact that Bitcoin is extremely unknown in Germany, Edeka is not really the online store where people buy online, it is Rewe because of the same day delivery anyway. So, this news here is not really a big deal.
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:41:51
I agree so much. If I would lead a company, start accepting Bitcoin because some users demand it, and then there is no profit at all through this channel, I would just drop the idea and it wouldn't be easy to get us back.

Yes, on his own addresses :P
@_date: 2015-04-16 09:04:37
Nothing inthe list that could help me :/ It's so sad that Bitcoin is still not a thing here in Germany.

You're right, this is an old news. Not much happened since then.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:58:08


So true, nothing to add. This is exactly my problem here.
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:14:58
Sorry, but I simply can't believe me until you show me that it is true. How does it fitt together? Someone can not afford food but can afford iPhone? Seriously, if at all, then the phone is stolen to afford food. 
Anybody would sell a phone if there is no money available for food.
Apart from that, I don't even believe that they have the infastructure to use phones (But to be honest, I am not sure about this).
I can't believe it.
@_date: 2015-04-03 01:37:50
100 bits or 100 bitcoin? :D
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:45:56
Maybe it was an April joke. If so, it was a bad april joke, because most people wouldn't even understand the joke as Bitcoin is quite unknown in Germany.
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:32:03
To be honest, the last time I bought something outside of Germany, it was a real pain in the ass. It's expansive due to import taxes, you wait ages to get the product, the stuff is not under German conversion law, our customs take it very serious and calculate how much you have to pay in taxes before you get the delivery and so on.
I never ever buy outside of Germany again. It's just a pain. Not even the "gifted" trick is working anymore.
@_date: 2015-04-17 01:23:49
What about customs? Did you have any problems with the import?
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:56:28
Yes it can. If the small Bitcoin economy does scrap the idea to accept Bitcoin or to build services on Bitcoin, investors will follow to get out of the game.
What stays is a currency that you can only spend in forums where a few trade for Bitcoin in hope for a new ATH (lol).
@_date: 2015-04-18 04:46:36
Exactly. I am invested a little bit too with money I can afford to lose. It's just that I wouldn't suggest my mother to invest as I still think it is risky. Apart from that, my mother would profit anyway if this would go through the roof... I would give her a share anyway.
I am with you, I see the potential and I have some hope not only because profit thoughts. I like the way how Bitcoin works and would like to see it spread.
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:59:44
I think he/she is trolling... not sure either how it is hard to believe. Me and my mother talk about all kind of stuff and that morning I told her some basics about Bitcoin, not sure what is so strange about it.
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:57:03
What is this purse.io?

You explained why I am here, I am same as you at this point. I see a lot of shit content in this sub... some people that think Bitcoin will replace fiat and what not. I am rather moderate. Being moderate, I am often called buttcoiner lol.
@_date: 2015-04-06 11:44:37
I tested this right now... it's not that easy. There are for example games that add up the total foller count. My bet was total wrong and I did check out the trends :D It seems there are different game modes.
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:59:00
That is sad. And that is what the thread here is about. It's sad that there a just a few of these possibilities.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:33:00
I redirect this comment. But now please... do annoy other people.
@_date: 2015-04-02 00:57:36
It isn't. As a German I can tell you a story about it. Edeka is a great store and I do like to buy there in real life... but when it comes to internet shopping, they simply did miss the train. 
There is one store called Rewe that is accepting PayPal and whatnot.. sadly not Bitcoin imo... but Rewe will bring the stuff you buy online on the same day to you at the doors. Talking about Edeka again, they don't do this, they send via package delivery. Results, at Rewe you can even buy a Pizza as they have it cold in the cars, you can buy anything online they sell in the stores too. 
Thus, Rewe is going viral right now and there is not anyone in my circles who didn't hear about the "same day delivery" of Rewe. They conquered this market. Now if Rewe would accept Bitcoin as well, that would be a huge news.
Now I dont want to bash on Edeka. When I go shopping, I always go to Edeka because they are awesome. But they missed the online shopping train. Accepting Bitcoin wont change that.
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:44:32
I preach this again and again and people here don't believe. It's a wonder that nobody did downvote you (which is great). Usually comments like that one get downvotes fast, even if you tell the truth (I am German too and have the same impression, not a lot of people here who ever heard the term Bitcoin).
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:06:06
I think you had luck or they wrote "gift" on it.
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:01:29
That is a big news... I waited for this to happen lol.
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:04:25
I told her that this is not mainstream yet and that it is basically an experiment (yes, I know the next person here will probably call me buttcoiner because I see it as an experiment)...
She is aware that this can go in any direction. I told her to stay cool about this, it's not the wonder that will change the world. I told her not to invest. ;)
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:18:16
True but that is the reason why companies must react to the market, react if others do it better. If they don't, it'll be harder to catch up later on.
@_date: 2015-04-11 02:22:58
And how exactly should my grandma shop on a website in this case? Do you think she will install a wallet and learn how to manage addresses, the security and so on?
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:58:01
At least they did hear about it. When I asked a dozen of times, the answer was often rather like "What the heck is Bitcoin?" and most didn't even send a reply.
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:35:35


To add something to this. Your statements sounds as if you never ordered a Pizza online because you are afraid it could expire on the 5 minutes tour to your doors or what? Again, you can order anything at Rewe online shop and it won't expire. I think you don't get their concept... they have own cars, you order via internet, they put the stuff in the cars (yes, as same as you would do it after shopping), and then they ring on your door to deliver. It couldn't be faster.
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:03:23
The truth is I am German and don't care what guys like you are thinking about us.
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:37:09
We all saw it coming. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:43:40
People in Germany don't know either of these terms... Bitcoin or BitPay, both is unknown for the majority of Germans.
@_date: 2015-04-10 03:44:06
I am always very pleased when I find out that we still have some normal people like you in our community. People like you are rare here.
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:16:00
Agree.... fail.
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:39:10
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:42:32
You speak German?
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:31:31
As said I don't disagree, I just think it's a baby step. I don't agree that it is huge. I see no reason to order stuff there and to wait days for delivery. I could at the same time go 100 meters to the next Edeka. Which is why I said it would be better if a store like Rewe would accept Bitcoin as they really deliver to my doorsteps on the same day. That is awesome, and it would be crazy awesome if they would accept Bitcoin. ;)
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:38:11
Smart people spend Bitcoin when the time has come.
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:01:54
Look, just because you disagree with me, doesn't mean I hate something. It's the usual bullshit you come across here... if you are not fully delusional, you gonna get hate in this sub.
Whenever a comment is slightly off and not totally pro Bitcoin like "Yeaaaahhhh mooooon EDEKA mooon", people will hate you.
This is the problem. I am afraid that people who show potential interest in Bitcoin come across people like you. When some said the Bitcoin community is like a cult, there is some truth in it.
Here there is no criticism allowed. I am moderate Bitcoin follower... I don't hate Bitcoin, however, I start to hate the Bitcoin community because a lot of people here are extremely brain dead. If any Bitcoin messias would say jump from the bridge, I bet quite a lot of people here would do it.
Now you see where I coming from. I wish this community would have some more decent and moderate people with a clear mind that can discuss and question things. I would love this community so much.
Now that I wrote this... sure, call me buttcoiner or what not. I am just sick of the delusion here.. even the smallest news gets hypes like crazy here. This is my problem.
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:36:56
Yes, but I searched on Google and didn't find any that accept Bitcoin, otherwise I would have suggested some for the list.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:13:02
No, it's the logic way, that of course will collide with the opinions of some Bitcoin evangelists. Don't get me wrong, I use Bitcoin as well and love it but check out the initial delusional comment... "This is huge!". This is absolutely not huge... it is a very very tiny step, and we hopefully see more of these steps, but in Germany we need to catch up, because Bitcoin is imo not a thing here and you can't deny this.
@_date: 2015-04-10 05:41:43
If he feels the need to post this here, I am sure she is not the only person evangelized with Bitcoin subjects. He clearly wants to show us how brave he did suggest Bitcoin. This is evangelizing. Also he mentioned that she hates Bitcoin and that he does send her weekly mails about Bitcoin. What else is it?
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:20:52
I can not imagine that. Mainstream people won't understand how to use Bitcoin unless there are services like Coinbase and so on.
@_date: 2015-04-16 08:57:15
That is corect.
@_date: 2015-04-30 17:36:58
Too late :D I bought it locally with fiat :/
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:53:32
I hope so, but I am not that sure.
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:57:01
I gave up on it. Even the highest ranking person of those companies you get in touch with never heard about Bitcoin in Germany. This is the sad truth.
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:05:22
I told her that this might happen too. I did not suggest her to invest. Now what?
@_date: 2015-04-18 04:47:51
Haha, yes... but there is not much Bitcoin on it ;) I have another secure wallet.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:24:58
You are delusional, which is why my comment did upset you. You can not take it if someone does tell the truth. Please fuck off.. I have no time to speak with people like you. You are embarrassing for the Bitcoin community. Lets just hope that you never speak to a newbie... because of people like you they run away.
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:35:08
Yes, but it would make me wonder if you have no groceries over there.
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:04:19


Sorry but I call this bullshit.
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:55:09
I got another impression. I never met or wrote to a single person outside of this sub that ever heard about Bitcoin. :/
@_date: 2015-04-16 09:26:09
Caseking would have been an option but I see they don't have this SD card. Overstock and the others. I will probably pay extra tax on the delivery then.
I think purse.io is my only option then. I know Amazon.de has the SD card I need. However, when I remember right, I asked purse.io some weeks ago on Twitter if Amazon.de would work too, but they said I could order on Amazon.uk, but then I probably have to pay import tax again. 
Looks like there is absolutely no solution. :/
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:49:50
Yes, and I realized later how unlogic my decision was :D
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:00:31
I'd be much more interested if some major online stores would accept BTC in germany. Lets be honest, most cafees and bars do accept Bitcoin due to marketing reason and due to the "maybe I can get rich quick thoughts".
@_date: 2015-04-26 11:42:24
Good night :)
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:53:24
Yes, only Berlin, saw it also in Hamburg... but thats all.

True, I feel more rich if I think in bits :)

I think that's not the only sub where people moved... I didn't expect that the voat Bitcoin sub and others would be full of assholes, sorry, but I was wrong.
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:04:19
This is just capital moving, not investing in BTC.
@_date: 2015-11-06 15:47:12
I do agree with you, but I don't talk about this sub but about Reddit... you have many alternatives at Reddit, you don't have to use only.
@_date: 2015-11-26 13:55:31
So, you have friends in Europe who have heard about Bitcoin? You frequent in rare circles.
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:10:18
Nope, it isn't.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:56:40
This is not true, I rather post news links related to Bitcoin in r/bitcoinuncut :P
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:06:33
Yeah, sure... but I was afraid that would not be enough when I saw this post here :) After reading OP's post, I thought I would need to store some file too.
@_date: 2015-11-24 01:54:02
Thank you, yes, I think you are right that I should test this to know how it works :)
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:58:43
Huh? It's not made up... I had this conversation with my mother :(
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:16:22

@_date: 2015-03-08 11:41:40
You compare melons with a very tiny grape. The internet is really something that came with a much bigger importance and impact and that changed our all life.
Back to the regular internet user... they do not and will not understand the difference between PayPal and Bitcoin.. never ever.
How do you want to explain that kind of person that there is something that will need 10 or 15 years while they do think something like that is already available with PayPal?
Will you go into full technical mode to explain them the difference? They will look at you confused and search another partner to discuss with.
Will you explain them that Bitcoin has super fast transactions? They will laugh at you when they see how long it takes, and in the meantime they send you a Dollar within a second through PayPal.
Will you give them lessons about ideology and money? You will scare them away.
Will you tell them the middleman story? Afterwards when you see that they don't get how to use Bitcoin, you will even suggest them rely on them (circle, coinbase). Do you see what I mean? This is attracting us as we don't need to use coinbase and what not. There is no advantage for the regular user because PayPal does all what Coinbase or Circle can do.
It's not happening. Sorry to take away your dream and I really hate to be that guy, especially as I am in the same boat as you... of course it would be a dream if any cryptocurrency would go fully mainstream, I mean the dream is just logic as I do both, I use and hodl Bitcoin... that dream would make me wealthy. I like the dream, but I am realist. I like to play with the tech, which is why I probably came here. But I started to realize that I am a rare person, like you... apart from us, I see no chance anymore that regular guys would find Bitcoin useful. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:12:25
Does that work with PayPal?

There is. Using cash. And even using banks. I don't know any person who doesn't use cash or banks.


And which makes the old system accessible for anybody. And why Bitcoin never will get to this point. It will be limited to circles we frequent in. You did just explain perfectly where the limits are and why the whole "moon" stuff is just hilarious.
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:41:55
Not the same people. Investors did breed a new community, players that are submissive, players you can sell what ever you creat even if it's crap. All serious players left the game a few years ago, I saw a whole 50 man guild dying. So, what Blizzard did in the streamlining process, they replaced the community with more submissive guys.

Thank you. I didn't use labels yet, so this is probably not that important at the moment. But I might backup the data anyway.
But what I wonder is, why do people often suggest to backup the wallet.dat when the seed is enough to regenerate all the addresses? Do they suggest it because of the same reason you mentioned, because of the labels?
Also there is still some confusion in my head...
1. When I remember right, Electrum generated some words when I installed it. I wrote them down and have them on paper in a save place. 
2. Then I did set up a password for Electrum back then. I have this on paper too. I have this password on paper as well in a save place.
What of both is the seed that is important to regenerate my wallets? Is it the password I thought out, or the words Electrum thought out?
I have both written down anyway so that there will be no problem, however, it is probably still important to understand the difference.
Thanks for helping!

The internet was a promising technology that enabled quite a lot. It was something new. Bitcoin is not new, it does enable you to send money, but the average user does already send money and doesn't understand what is so different if you use Bitcoin. The whole internet comparison is a complete joke, it's funny that it comes up again and again, because it's similar to a comparison between a beach and grain of sand. Sorry that some has to pop your bubble, but Bitcoin is nothing more than grain of sand.
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:54:09

You can also hack a PayPal account of a noob who has no phonecode enabled, log into the account in a shady internet caffee and you will get the same anonymity.
As you just admitted right now, Bitcoin is anonym as everything else. You can get pseudo anonym through detours, but even then it is not enough.
Face it. Privacy is no argument on the side of Bitcoin. You have less privacy unless you go through the detours you mentioned, but even then you are just anonym for noobs, experts will trace you. 
You can not say Bitcoin has privacy, because if that would be the case, the privacy would count for all people, not only geeks as we are. Your mother doesn't even know what a VPN is, my mother doesn't as well.

Looks like we have the same experience then. I was really heavily into WoW with Vanilla, BC, LichKing but after that it really went downhill with both the game and as you said the community. I took a look at times and played a little bit of Cata but when they released Mist of Pandaria, I had to laugh hard too and was sure this is the best point to stop playing the game.

He doesn't sound like a Buttcoiner. He has some great points in fact. Just because someone is more moderate Bitcoin follower, that doesn't have to mean he is a Butccoiner. I am very skeptic too at the moment, I am bearish but that doesn't make me a Buttcoiner.
Face it, as interesting Bitcoin is, aside of the benefits, Bitcoin does have quite a lot of flaws and apart from that even the problems that no one wants to use it other than we geeks.
If you explain someone a currency and they show you confused faces, that is a currency that has and will have problems with adoption. I see no way that Bitcoin will go full mainstream. It would have the potential to play in PayPal's league, but that's all. But the sad truth is that Bitcoin is much more difficult to understand for the regular internet user who might already have discovered PayPal. This explains why there is stagnation. You can not deny this, especially because... take a look in this sub here how hard people try to make a point about Bitcoin, see how hard they try to "sell Bitcoin to the public"... and yet it doesn't work out well. 
So, who is atracted at the moment by Bitcoin? People like you and me, people who would go over hurdles to have benefits (Bitcoin ideology), apart from that, also people who see the big profits that can be made due to the volatility. Fact is, Bitcoin is not very attractive to people like my friends or family members... most of them are no geeks and just discovered PayPal last year even if it excists already since quite a long time. So, when I told them about Bitcoini, the usual answer would be "This is like PayPal"?
Do you get my point? You and me, and all others here, we are a rare species that wants pseudoanonymity, a currency without middleman and all the benefits it could bring. The regular internet user doesn't have the problems we see, they don't understand how money is working, they don't understand all the technology stuff and wouldn't understand what makes Bitcoin so different to the common payment providers like PayPal or banks.
There is a big problem with the adoption. It is reality. It is no buttcoin flaming.
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:12:02
Pretty much this... this paranoia gets boring... lets face the reality, we all don't have the balls to go without the internet.

What could happen if you don't? I thought once I see an incoming transaction in my wallet, it would go through? Or is this the case? I mean, when I see someone sends me BTC, then it means 1 confimation happened already?

I mostly live my life with cash money. I just let so much on my bank that I can pay all my stuff like internet and what not. It was just an example with the bank.
However, apart from privacy, I do agree with all your last points about bitcoin, which is why I am here ;) I am much more into the ideology (as you said, ownership back to the people and so) of bitcoin but not due to the privacy aspect.

I am glad you have a tech fascinated grandma. Most people don't. And by the way, hate doesn't play a role in my life, you don't have to worry.
I can not go into a store with gold to buy something, because as you said, it is rather a store of value and not for payments. I can't and won't be able with Bitcoin in every case either. I can't even with PayPal, so many years after it was introduced. But I can in any case with my cash or bank account. Apart from that, you compare Apples with Oranges. As you mentioned, gold is a great store of value, however, Bitcoin isn't, its imo just a nice asset for trading, and a currency that you can use in a few onlinen stores.
In case you are interested.. to tell you a little bit more about myself, where I come from, why I do write much more moderate than you are accustomed to in this sub...
I love Bitcoin, but I am one of the rare people who try to not get hyped too much. I don't see that Bitcoin could be the magic bullet. Bitcoin has quite a lot of flaws that will make it impossible to play a big role in the life of many. I see the potential that it could play a bigger role than PayPal, but not further. I am here because I use Bitcoin and I am interested to use it in the future, I am here to find out if at least more serious and major webstores will accept it, to make it possible that tech fascinated people like me have an alternative to PayPal and of course banks (when it comes to online shopping). 
I do not believe that Bitcoin will ever supersede banks or cash money, I absolutely don't believe and I never will. A currency that you can only explain to a small group of people without seeing confused faces, that is a currency that might have the potential to play in PayPal's league but not further. It will only attract people who see the benefits, but not everyone will. PayPal has quite a lot of benefits over cash money, which is why I use PayPal as well. And yet I am one of the rare individuals in my circles who ever used it. I can not see how Bitcoin would convince more people to go online to manage payments. I can only see that Bitcoin might convince people who do it already, people who rely on the internet as you and me. 
I try to stay realist, I like dreams but I don't take them too serious. Bitcoin has quite a lot of potential, but sadly limited to a special user group.
**Too long too read:**
I am moderate Bitcoin follower. Not really an enthusiast, and I am not a buttcoiner. You find me in the middle. I hold Bitcoin, I use Bitcoin, but I am not delusional or scornfully about Bitcoin. Which is why you call me hater, you can not believe that there are people who think moderate about Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-03-03 18:20:34
Haha, yes that experience will stay. I talked with friends about this and they said too "This is something you won't forget". The screaming happened in our guild too, we just used Teamspeak but I still can remember it was as if we really won somekind of war in real life :D Really amazing, because as you said.. the whole dedication and preparation, then some fails, and finally you beat the boss and hurraaaaaaaaaa. Amazing. Can't forget that either. This is how WoW stays in my mind too and of course all the fun people I met at that time. I do still have real life contact with some of them (my RL friends of course, but also people I met in WoW).
We had a guild meeting back then, it was really cool to see all those guys you usually just knew by voice and the characters in-game. Man, I can't forget that either :)

So true, quite a lot of people here hate to hear negative things, they do even hate it if someone does mention some flaws of Bitcoin. However, it's good that not all people are blinded. Critism is very important in my opinion. Bitcoin is great, no question, but there are flaws and problems and it should be allowed to mention them.
@_date: 2015-03-05 09:22:36
I am Second Life user since over ten years as I am merchant and designer there. Which means I know VirWox since quite some time as well. VirWox is no scam, however, others are right when they say the fees for the exchange are very high. What VirWox seems to do here is that they try to buffer the danger that some customers could chargeback the PayPal amount. So, yea, it's bad with the fees, but other than that, it works very well. I use them quite often and unload my internet income that I get on PayPal and exchange it to BTC on VirWox.

So true. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of Bitcoin too but when I hear Bitcoin enthusiasts speak about privacy while I have opened the blockchain website, my hairs do stand up. It really shows that some people don't have an idea about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:08:03
It isn't. For the regular user who prefers to use cash, it is complex as getting a bubble gum out of a machine. Even using creditcards is less of a rocket science for the regular user compared to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-03-08 12:03:48


Exactly. They sadly have much bigger problems, no water. Which is why I am very happy when I see organizations buildings schools, creating fountains and what not, to help these people.
Back to Bitcoin and related to my text above. How do you expect people to get into Bitcoin without education, and without money? Will you send everyone there some bits? Do you mean they get a better life if you do so? I am not living in Africa, I live in Germany and I can't tell you a single store where I could order water or any other products. And even if, I would need the funds to do so. As I am into Bitcoin, I have these funds. What should people in Africa do to get Bitcoin? And then, who is creating the Bitcoin economy there that Bitcoin could be spend?


True. Apart from tech fans like we are, there is of course the growth because people expect to get rich quik. Apart from that, I see no real or natural growth as you do. Sorry.
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:11:43
That is an option that you have as you understand how to use Bitcoin and as you were not afraid to learn it. The regular user can not do this and won't learn it, and if so, they will not see the benefits due to the difficulty. But then you will suggest that it is easy, they just can use Circle or Coinbase. I see this very often here... eventually the argument does change and people start to suggest 3rd party. This is the problem that does limit Bitcoin to make it a thing widely used.
@_date: 2015-03-03 22:36:12

mate, you clearly are not informed about Bitcoin. Every single bit is traceable and there is no technique to make them anonymous. Which is why "peseudo anonymous" is mentioned. 
See it on this way... you can send a mail from one mail adress to another, and from there to another and so on... until you did send the mail through a tons of emails to finally reach the target destination. It doesn't make your email less traceable.
@_date: 2015-03-05 09:17:50
Exactly. You can find every address via Google, if it has been used Google will show blockchain link.
@_date: 2015-10-03 22:02:11
I am WordPress blogger and wrote a couple of times about Bitcoin, and the only solution was to me to link to my ChangeTIp tipping page, and to include a bitcoin address below the post. However, I thought about removing all that because I barely got tips although the posts got decent traffic.
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:37:51
You can do the same with fiat money. Just open a fake bank account in country where such accounts are offered (criminal energy). You know what I am talking about. 
You can not suggest people to use Bitcoin with the idea that Bitcoin would offer any privacy. Bitcoin has a public ledger, bank accounts don't. Bitcoin has no privacy for potential mainstream users. It's simply not the selling point. It's also not why I am using Bitcoin. I see better advantages than the privacy.
@_date: 2017-05-02 04:32:42
I have no idea. Maybe it's cheap labour or I don't know... I start to get insane and think there is a bigger agenda than just helping.
To be honest, I wouldn't even care. I'd take hundreds of thousands Japenese, American, French, Britisch or [insert almost any nationality] fellows.... I really don't get why I never see these immigrants in masses.
In fact I would even like to socialize with people from different places and would welcome them here. But so far, all we get are people that exploit us, harrass us and so on. And if you call them out, like saying they are mostly arabic or muslim, you'll be called racist, nationalist. I start to stop caring... should they call me however they like... this doesn't frighten me and I will continue to mention my experience with the so called "cultural enrichement".
As much as I'd like to help refugees, it's really hard to do that when they create their own circles, don't speak or learn our language, create their gang structures and so on. 
Our city has some old historical buildings... when I for example see Asian tourists, they approach you and smile, some do even ask questions in English or want to learn about the place... these people for example make you smile and make you become as curious about them, to the point that you start to ask them questions too, like where they are from and if they need any tips about our location and so.
I get there is a major difference between a tourist and a refugee, but I wonder if this difference really should be there?
Let's say my country is in civil war and I want to get out of here... I'd be glad if I am welcomed in another nation. I'd want to set a new home, learn about my new place, make friends, learn the language and hopefully get a job to contribute. 
It's nuts. I will never understand how someone can enter another nation without accepting the values and laws there.

I pretty much agree with you. Bitcoin is limited by its own complexity. Expect to get flames here as people dislike the reality. Bitcoin is very attractive, however, "geeks" as we are see the benefits and understand how to use it, traders who see profit potential due to the volatility see a point too and go over hurdles to learn Bitcoin, but that is all. Bitcoin will never go full mainstream. With luck Bitcoin will play in the league of PayPal but I am not sure if this will happen.
Bitcoin has too many flaws. Apart from that, Bitcoin has a very poisonous and daunting community (which is why some people compared us with a cult and sadly they are true, as we have quite a lot of delusional people in the community, just let see who will allege me to be a buttcoiner in the comments under me).  criticism doesn't get into the mind of the regular Bitcoin enthusiast, they only want to see good news and do blind all other news off. This is one of the things that hurt Bitcoin as well. 
I am moderate Bitcoin enthuasiast and realist to see the flaws, even if I like the idea of Bitcoin, even if I use Bitcoin, it has problems nobody can deny. Those who do, they are delusional and one of the biggest reasons why we are stagnating, they scare people away and do give Bitcoin a very bad flavour too.

Thank you. Well, most sites use JS but I can visit most sites even with no-script, but your site is fully blocked as it seems your site prevents visitors with disabled JS. Once people trust your site, they will enable java anyway, I see no reason to block them completely :) Just my thoughts. Good that you take feedback here and thanks again for doing something in return and make some people happy. Awesome!

@_date: 2015-03-08 10:48:51
This is the point people don't want to understand. My mother, my sister and I could count up maybe 50 people in my circles, they all wouldn't understand the benefits of Bitcoin, they do not study technology like geeks, they simply don't care. It took them quite a lot of years to discover PayPal, but even then I just know maybe 3 people who use it. Some of them just discovered that you can order stuff on Amazon... imagine it. How can Bitcoin go fully mainstream? It's delusion. Nobody cares how money is function and why Bitcoin has some benefits. What people care about if you explain or show them is that Bitcoin has flaws, a horrendous usability for the regular internet user. It's not possible to explain the benefits and even if you try, you will hear "So, this is basically like PayPal?". People should face the reality... Bitcoin is not going mainstream, Bitcoin does attract us tech geeks, some traders who see profits, some soldiers of fortune who try to create a business, and some shady scammers who see profits too. As much as I love Bitcoin, this will not go mainstream, with luck maybe playing in PayPal's league, who knows. Nobody cares about the difference between PayPal, cash, banks and cryptos... nobody except of us ever heard about cryptos.. this is the problem people here don't want to hear.

I know but you can't see my transactions even if you would knew my banking address. The point I wanted to make is that there is no privacy with Bitcoin. Another commentor here claims that you can acquire bitcoins from another person or through services like localbitcoin and then the coins won't be bound to your persona, but under this logic you can also open up a bank account anywhere and you will get anonymity with fiat money (so, of course, with a little knowledge you can do things like that everywhere). This is the point I want to make. As said, don't get me wrong, I am here in this sub for a reason, I am enthusiast as well and see quite a lot of good points of Bitcoin, but pricacy is not what counts to that list, at least not for me. I stand on this point, Bitcoin has zero privacy unless you frequent in this sub, but our parents, the so called mainstream doesn't. They just found out about email a decade ago. Not everyone is a geek like you.
So here is what I mean:
1. Banks  = Authorities, governments and the bank can see and keep track of transactions.
2. Bitcoin = Everyone can keep track of the transactions.
In both cases, there are ways to unlink the transactions from your persona, but to do this, you need knowledge. In the case of Bitcoin, we "geeks" here have the knowledge. But talking about the mainstream, most people wouldn't. 
Privacy is not the golden side of Bitcoin. With the term privacy, we won't sell Bitcoin to the mainstream. Bitcoin transactions are as easy to analyze as bank transactions, with the difference that Bitcoin transactions are visible for the public, bank transactions not (so much about privacy).

Nothing. Otherwise we would see adoption. Bitcoin doesn't solve a problem. People play with money already, just not with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:19:59

@_date: 2015-03-15 13:05:18
Definitely VirWox, however, as you search something with low fees, it's a bad suggestion of me as they take up to 7% to compensate the risk that some of their customers make chargebacks with PayPal.
@_date: 2015-03-04 08:31:08
Yes, this is the fun fact when you have grandpas and grandmas in the governments and authorities, they simply don't understand how the internet works. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 23:03:20
I think it also has to do pretty much with the behaviour of our Bitcoin community. Lots of immature and insane people here. However, it's good that we still have some cool people onboard too.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:02:07
If you would just have r ead the whole thread, you would have noticed your argument is already destroyed.

You will, because at some point you will get tired.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:53:22
And how do you explain it that people don't use Bitcoin? The average people... why don't we see them arriving here? Face it, there is no adoption happening... Bitcoin is too difficult for the average guy.

This is where the term "dumb market" comes from in trading.
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:17:19
And as much as I love Bitcoin, my bank account gives me more privacy than Bitcoin. Because.. you can not trace my transferals, not even if you know my bank address, but you can trace my transferals when you know my Bitcoin address. Where exactly do you see the privacy? Do you deny the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-03-11 12:07:49

To be honest, not only international exchange. Lately my German bank transfers take up to two weeks to either go through or show up correctly in the online banking interface. I can't tell you how often I had trouble with companies as they thought I didn't pay, and then I had to send evidence. I got several times trouble due to the snail-exchanges of my bank lol. So annoying that it inspired me to flame about it on my blog: 
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:57:44
I can confirm, I have schadenfreude too. Also I wonder why so many comments are removed in this thread?
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:16:37


It is, especially if it is the truth. Bitcoin is far too complex to be attractive for the average internet user. If this would be not the case, we wouldn't have this kind of stagnation we see at the moment.
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:09:33
Not sure why someone downvoted you, this is actually a fact... I gave voat a try some time ago, and it's a very rude community, it's actually hard to stay there unless you plan to get on the same rude level.
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:22:38
This is called delusion my friend. Your and my grandma just learned what the term email means but yet they still don't use it. There will never be a full Bitcoin mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:38:42
I think that's how it is going in most cases. I had this happen in other games. For example with my BF2 clan and so. It's sometimes sad but as you said, the experience stays. I had that happen in most games, just not in WoW for some reason.
@_date: 2015-03-08 11:28:04
And it will make them doing what? There are no stores in Germany where you could use Bitcoin. The stores that accept Bitcoin are not very well known. The currency is useless at the moment and 500 bits or even more won't change it. Which is why Bitcoin has quite a lot of problems. It makes people like us fascinated, but there is no reason why a regular internet user should now use Bitcoin. There is no advantage for them.
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:55:04
Yep, not sure why stuff like this is worth to be submitted here.
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:39:44

You talk about people who also wouldn't be able to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:19:26
The internet didn't replaced anything, it created new possibilities because there was nothing like it before. 


I am pretty much sure it did for him. Same as the washing machine invention solved a problem for us all. Otherwise you would still use your hands.
What exactly does Bitcoin solve for the mainstream? Have you never been able to send money from person to person? Have you never been able to send money to people even if they are in other countries? At the core, Bitcoin can be used to transfer money, it is no replacement, it is an alternative as it is already possible. If you look deeper, you find the advantages, which is why we are here in this sub and follow all that. But I promise you, regular users won't see it...
They will rate it on the usage. What does Bitcoin and why should I use it? I can use it to transfer money. Is this new? No, I do this already. This is how the mainstream does rate new things.

Because he is right... vanilla players all left the game since some time. What is left is community that the investors did breed. The backbone of WoW is broken and this won't go anywhere anymore. They will milk the cow and nothing more. I wouldn''t even think about supporting them. This is now Electronic Arts 2.0
@_date: 2015-03-08 11:08:12


You speak about those who don't have computers or internet?


And how do you explain why people don't flow in? Why is Bitcoin still stagnating?


Would that mean Bitcoin has other flaws why people avoid to use it?

I am going to format my hard drive as I want to reinstall Windows. I use Electrum to store my Bitcoins and of course I did write down the long password that I need to make Electrum transactions...
My question is now. Is this passwort all I need after I installed a fresh Windows? Do I then just download Electrum again and use my passwort to restore my wallet? Or do I need to save my wallet file too before I format my hard drive?
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:54:28
This is something that I had in my mind since quite a long time. I really could imagine that.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:48:46
I see, you are inconvincible. However, it's your thing. But you will hear this more often in the future I think.
@_date: 2015-03-08 23:56:21
What a fallacy. Sounds extremely deluded.
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:55:11
Exactly, sounds like conspiracy, but today you never know. I thought about this too.
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:50:16
As same as fiat cash is used for money laundering and all kind of criminal activities.
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:44:37
I agree but who is Wiz Khalifa?
@_date: 2015-02-07 03:26:22
But some have a point as this one:


@_date: 2015-03-14 19:00:56
nope. spammer. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 22:50:11
It's not about if it happened, it's about that it can happen and then the screamin is often big... Saw quite a lot of these posts here and in other Bitcoin related forums. You should be very careful when it comes to accepting PayPal as the buyer "can" do a chargeback. The problem is, if it is a hacked account, the hacker did use proxy servers and what not, he now owns your bitcoin and you have no chance to get him.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:30:43


And yet we see no adoption, and that proves that your argument is a fallacy.


You use it because it solves a problem for you. As same as it solves a problem for anybody else. Bitcoin instead doesn't.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:55:28
Now make it happen that nuuvem accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:04:20
Yea, I totally agree.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:54:05
They could also declare it illegal and I still would use it.

Blizzard is just a slave in this game. Investors direct them what to do. But you are right, BTC will never ever come to WoW.
@_date: 2015-02-27 06:08:47
This is actually the correct answer I think.
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:35:36
The best advise I can give is to never do this again. Trading with someone in PayPal is just stupid.
Here is the chargeback guide from PayPal:

My goal is 1 BTC. Stuck with 0.5 right now. Anyway, stocking up next month when new money is there. 10/10 bitcoin makes me horny.
@_date: 2015-03-14 22:24:00
Ok, I assumed I would get a complex answer :) Thanks for explaining, but I guess this is only something programmers should know. I am not. Thanks anyway :)
@_date: 2015-03-08 23:50:58
I wouldn't talk too loud about your crystal ball.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:57:07


Listen to your own advise. Sorry, had to invert a part of your comment.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:48:04
No bank would throw money back at you, but here it happens :)
@_date: 2015-02-13 14:11:32
More of this stuff please lol... :D Had to laugh.
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:15:42
No. But I was able explain email and internet to my family, yes even to my grandpa back then... but when I talked about Bitcoin, nobody understand me, result is that I usually dislike to talk about it. I am invested in it as a supporter, but I really dislike to suggest it as it is a nerd currency, point. Also the whole concept breaks when I introduce Coinbase to someone.. don't get me wrong, Coinbase makes PayPal out of Bitcoin which means it adds Usability for mainstream people, however, it destroys the sense of Bitcoin (middleman). SO even there the usuall answer would be "So this is basically what PayPal does too?" when I told people about Coinbase.
There is some kind of delusion if you don't see that. Sorry.. Bitcoin is only for us tech nerds the cure, everyone else doesn't understand it yet, and if so, then just with Coinbase Circle and so. Btw. here in Germany most people didn't even here the term Bitcoin, it's just not a thing here. If people speak about it, you can be sure they are geeks. 
As much as I love Bitcoin, this is a true problem, which is why I linked one of the comments that descibes exactly my point. 
To make it worse, up to today I just know four people who use PayPal in my circles. Get my point? I have a lot of friends and I count in my family as well, but yet they all use mostly cash. There is a reason. For some things like PayPal is even difficult to use or understand and they are afraid that they could be hacked and what not (yes, even if you explain them that you can lock accounts with phone verification). 
Believe me, as much as I would like to see Bitcoin travel to the moon, at some point I realized that this is really a bet with an extremely small chance. So, as you can see, I am not a buttcoiner or so (because that is what people assume if you criticize BTC), I am supporter and dreamer, but my mind is clear enough to see that the odds are very bad that Bitcoin will go mainstream.
EDIT: Removed as much strange grammar as I could (sorry I am German and still learning)

Thank you
@_date: 2015-03-08 10:52:18
Nope. Just wanted to tell you that the chance for this threat is as high as the chance of what you implied. In other words, the chance that happens what you and me said, is tiny, extremely tiny.
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:59:16
LMAO... you get it :)

Try to eat a burger in public in a East German town like for example Hoyerswerda.

Nice story, too sad that it is fiction.

In the US, do they actually have a tiny "Do not eat!" inscription on the pin? Just wondering.

Thanks for doing this giveaway. I will spread the message on Twitter and upvote here.
1. Just found out about BitQuick because of this thread here.
2. Not sure, I'll take a look.
3. That your site seems to depend on java script.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:04:48
Maybe it's time to change your bank, because, well, we live in 2015 and bank apps or websites are very easy to use? I think your bank is just not suitable for customers. If a bank is more difficult to use than Bitcoin, I can not understand how this bank is still in the market.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:35:54
You don't need to sell something that people can't even use. You talk about people who have much bigger problems than thinking about Bitcoin. You talk about people who have no internet access anyway
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:58:50
That would make me incredible rich too.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:08:16
I think you need help. I am pretty much sure you will find help in your area. It seems to me that you have a gambling addiction.

Sadly I can't think of a charity.. I am from Germany, not sure if some here do accept BTC :(
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:44:26
He only accepts 1000 Bitcoins :D
@_date: 2015-02-27 06:05:40
Fun fact, most people won't understand it as both, Bitcoin and Reddit are not very well known in Europe.
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:24:48
Yes you make some points, and I read that often here but for me it really seems that Bitcoin is more popular in the US and other countries but not so much in Germany, I think that is were I take my experience from, yes.
Haha, yes we use more cash than anything else. I could use my bank card as creditcard but I don't do that. It's even a little bit taboo here lol, if you do that, all people in the checkout line will bend their brow because you take their time as typing in the number does take more time than paying in cash. It's funny :D
I hope you will like it here. It's always a good thing to visit another country. And 6 months sounds like a good time, I guess you can learn a lot of German on this way. Learning by doing is the best.
Viel Spaß und viel Erfolg in Deutschland! :)
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:10:41
Banks WILL do this... they mentioned it a couple of times that they would rather create their own blockchain than using the Bitcoin blockchain.

@_date: 2015-02-27 19:45:05
Then you are mentally still a kid because you ripped images. However, I must admit it was funny.. it's just unoriginal due to the copyright infrigment and that is a turn off anyhow.

My organs are way more expansive than a satoshi.
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:46:18
I don't get what you mean. I usually do understand analogies... but not this one.
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:44:59
This means, a whole youth does grow up with the idea that bitcoin is not nerdy but something very normal. Now think about it when they get kids some day... :))
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:26:31
People will take the cash first. Bitcoin is not that known that people would even understand what you did hang up beside the dollar note.
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:10:22
That's lol, because you are basically talking with a social influencer.
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:58:11
Which means you didn't learn how to behave right in the internet. However, you hopefully will learn this. Don't get me wrong... it's just a no go rip content. Especially if you want to be taken serious when it comes to creating graphics or memes.
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:34:05
You invented catcoin right now.

Considering your word choice, I get the impression that you are the only sociopath that comes to my mind right now. Seriously, learn parlances that don't make you appear like a 14 years old child and then you can expect that people will go deeper into the discussion with you. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:13:17
That sounds good. It's just that I am content creator myself and had my own images stolen several times at some point too. For example used on projects that I didn't want to have my content linked to.
Didn't want to annoy you.. but good to hear that you see my point too and that you might think about it. Have a nice day or night, what ever it is right now in your location :)
@_date: 2015-02-09 02:00:41
You also want to get into Reddit now right?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:39:49
As most bitcoin involved people. They often contradict themselfs.

Steal much, sell low.

Haha :D This happens if you give kids access to the internet and graphic tools.
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:25:41
This is how I felt :(
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:07:38
Seen as a whole, no. The "enviroment" seems to attract a lot of criminals before it attracts the mainstream. Not a good starting point anyhow. And as you said... BTC opposed will and do already point to it. So, that people like me get even more uncertain.
@_date: 2015-02-07 15:59:12
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:50:35
same here. I would buy many bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:33:06
Counterquestion and this is really not meant to be rude. So, don´t get me wrong. But how would you explain my mother or my grandma that bits and bytes are more safe than the money in their pockets? How would you convince them? This is the problem I talk about. 
Apart from the fact that people like my mother never heard about bitcoin, they wouldn´t even be able to create a bitcoin wallet,.... now some would suggest to use an online "bitcoin bank" or service. But often have we read that bitcoin services were robbed? It happens. The enviroment is not safe. The ways and weapons of virtual bandits are much more complex. And not even the police would understand if you tell them that someone robbed your bitcoins. You know what I mean? How can someone trust in it if even a police man would ask back "Please explain, what is a bitcoin?".
And even if he knows about Bitcoin... what would he do to seek the lost bitcoins? Does he have some great methods to get the robbers caught?
I repeat what I think. Actually the bitcoin universe does attracts a lot of black sheeps. Apart from the fact that a non-techy person never heard about it and never would be able to understand how to use bitcoins, they only could try to trust the whole. There is nothing else they could do than trusting in it.
After that... how would you explain my mother that she should rather trust in bitcoins than in fiat money?
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:53:02
Sad but true. It even makes me uncertain. To be honest... I like the idea behind bitcoin but at the moment I am afraid that it never will be a safe way for payments.
