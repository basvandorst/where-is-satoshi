I have to imagine they were prepared for this and hedged with futures contracts.

We have a time machine. A bunch of smart guys built it a long time ago. It’s down at the Costco but it’s really expensive.

Idk if bitcoin specifically will succeed or not but the principles of bitcoin sure will. This is why I think it’ll happen....
Imagine living in an old west boom town more or less isolated from outsiders. There’s one bank in town that everyone uses to deposit their money. The bank puts all the money in a vault and keeps a ledger of everyone’s balance. You make a withdrawal, they write it on the ledger. You make a deposit, it goes on the ledger. Things are simple. Now imagine another town pops up close by with another bank. People in the two towns are trading with each other and the banks are constantly sending money back and forth between the accounts of the people from each town, but it’s too much work to move the actual coin, so they just track it independently on their respective ledgers and settle up later to simplify things. Now imagine there’s a whole country of such banks with millions and millions of accounts having to balance their ledgers against all others constantly. Now imagine a whole world economy that has to do this, but in hundreds of different currencies. The logistics of this are an absolute nightmare and is the reason payments take so long, particularly large payments and those that cross borders. The banks will not be going out of business. They will restructure themselves to fit a trustless ledger system into their mold (centralized, decentralized, whatever doesn’t matter). Be it bitcoin or bank coin or USD coin or whatever. Doesn’t matter as there aren’t any coins anyways. It’s a series of transactions on a ledger who’s entries you can trust and all the banks can share. And you know why? Because it adds tremendous efficiency to their service saving them a ton of money. That’s what banks want and that’s what banks will have without a doubt have. I imagine that if bitcoin or some other bitcoin type currency is widely used before the banks make this transition, the transition will happen around that coin. If there is no adoption ahead of this transition, they’ll use their own thing, and the services that can be set up around it make things so simple for the consumer, it’ll make us forget about bitcoin, because when that happens, what’s the point?

It has to dip far enough to recoup your losses on the way back up.

Don’t they take like 20% or something absurd when you convert your coins to cash?

You should watch the YouTube video of Andreas Antonopoulos speaking with the Canadian senate. I think that’s a fair reflection of how governments feel about this technology. Confused, a bit skeptical, yet eager to see where this technology takes us.

Here’s another good Andreas video of his take on the energy costs of mining. He has so many good talks you can just choose a random related video of him and watch more for days. I would also recommend his book the internet of money which is available in print and for free in podcast form.

It doesn’t matter how they would have been purchased. If banks were “all in” there would have to have been enough buy orders to drive prices up substantially.

I dare you to go try to pay your mortgage with actual green pieces of paper. I wouldn’t even know where to begin.

People daytrade for the same reason people go to casinos. The thought of big returns outweighs the risk of losses no matter the odds.

I think the big wave of people that got in between December and January not knowing what they were getting into and fear sold are starting to do their research and learning how important bitcoin is and starting to trickle back in and hold.

They should accept fiat, but only give change in bitcoin. Good way to get people to download their first crypto wallet.
