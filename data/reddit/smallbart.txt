you're about two typos in your name away from sovereign citizen territory here. if you think "suddenly won millions because a dude died" isn't a motive that would have you investigated to hell and back, lol at you.

go ahead and run me through your logic here. there are people with credit cards, who want bitcoins, and they want to pay more money while taking more steps than anywhere else to get them. this is legit because ______________
surprisingly, not everything illegal gets shut down quickly. doesn't mean individuals using the service won't get hit when the card owners realise what's up:

stop right there. my entire point is that there's no reason for this to happen. you're describing a fantasy world where everybody overlooks all the downsides of bitcoin for reasons, then entering into a gentleman's agreement to not screw each other over.
bitcoin's strengths are around p2p trustless transactions, not a new golden era of chucking everything in a database and swearing to live by its contents.

the legality of placing it is irrelevant if you're trying to make sure the cops never find out who you are, though? anybody making those bets would be flagged as people of interest in a murder investigation, they wouldn't need to go after the operators for gambling when the subpoena covers anybody betting on X event.
reminder that DPR got owned because he misconfigured his server(and this was documented on reddit, bitcointalk etc like a year before the takedown so it's not like the feds employed some black magic to find it), physical shipments had nothing to do with it.

my examples were the first hits on google, you could keep digging if you'd like since there's been more recent cases. regardless, if you trust it and have no qualms about likely enabling CC fraud(since let's face it, the other scenarios are a bit of a crapshoot - we'd definitely have heard about it if a huge amount of Turk workers started using bitcoin to cash in their paycheques) then enjoy. 
personally, i'm uncomfortable with it _especially_ because of purse's response: even at launch, the concept of CC fraud was inconceivable to them, so they're either as smart as your average bitcoin business or actively ignoring criminal activity.

@_date: 2015-10-20 07:20:29
this is the problem with blockchains, though(and indeed bitcoin) - if the assets handled are worth considerably more than the cost of building enough ASICs to get to X/2 hashing power, then your chain is doomed. 
you want attacks on your infrastructure to cost significantly more than the cost of building it, making bitcoin useless for high value assets. the use case for bitcoin is anonymous p2p transactions, not billion dollar deals between megacorps.
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:30:31
if somebody's asking a question like this, linux won't help them. anybody who'd trust some random AV software to protect their assets will likely run not_a_wallet_stealer.sh without having a clue what'll happen.
_actually_, thinking about it, the built-in support for languages such as python would make a newbie even more likely to get owned by running a script accidentally, since everybody knows what an executable is now but they may have never seen a .py before.

literally nobody talks about things in terms of "per second" as some isolated snapshot of a given second in time, with the assumption that nothing else happens after that one second.
yes, given infinite seconds of no further activity _after_ the max per second is hit, bitcoin can process infinite transactions per second. good job. in reality, 1Mb/&lt;transaction size&gt; per ten minutes is the limit(there is no 'instant' unless you're counting zeroconf, which is a whole other can of worms). note that a transaction size of 56b is overly optimistic since real transactions tend to be larger.

i'm still waiting for my morning coffee to cool, but market cap is a meaningless metric for bitcoin. if you wanted to at least try to be honest measuring it, though, you'd need a rough idea of how many btc are still in circulation vs how many have been 'lost'. it's a lot less than 15m, that's for sure.
@_date: 2015-10-21 20:20:54
this is something way too many people overlook when daydreaming about using bitcoin for literally everything. the author put it better than i would:


@_date: 2015-10-20 14:29:22
subpoena arguments are irrelevant to me since i'm not evading taxes. this is pretty far off-topic, though, since the point was "why use your CC to buy bitcoin to buy thing, when you can use a CC to buy thing on the same page", and now we're down the rabbithole of rube-goldberg shopping mechanisms that some people jump through.
i mean, i could also probably find somebody willing to give me a roast chicken in exchange for jerking it on a live cat in front of them, then trade that chicken for a subway token, then trade that token for an itunes gift card, then trade that for bitcoin,  then use bitcoin to buy Madden 2015, but i'm not going to bother using my feline erotica performance to buy something when i can just click two buttons instead. YMMV.
@_date: 2015-10-21 08:59:39
no problem. not quite sure why people have a problem with their purchases being tracked, since it's the same reason stores offer clubcards etc, but to each their own.
@_date: 2015-10-20 08:57:47
i'm familiar with purse.io as a hub for credit card fraud, which is the only reason you see 'discount' items there.

you're a terrible salesman then. it's easier to convince somebody to part with pocket change for something utterly useless than part with a significant amount for something worthwhile. 
the numbers being optimistic were kind of my point, anyway - they're entirely made up. you can use whatever you want with the same accuracy. he might as well just say "BUY BITCOIN AND HODL" and be done with it.

bitcoin's problems need to be trivial to verify, but difficult to solve. complex problems are not trivial to verify. so, unfortunately, all the mining power behind bitcoin is utterly useless outside of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:34:24
theoretically(and purse would like you to believe it), but there's been no evidence of widespread turk payments being used to buy bitcoin that i've seen.

i read this as "21 inc ceo is still alive" and got really confused for a second.
@_date: 2015-10-21 20:50:12
pick any amount of hashing power and the argument remains the same. the only way bitcoin becomes untouchable is if more than half the money in the world is already spent on the hardware behind it and more than half the energy in the world is powering it, which sounds more like "i have no mouth and i must scream" than a cool and good solution to anything.
also, that's a pretty big 'if' - there really isn't a use case(IMO) for putting assets on the blockchain unless you're actively looking for reasons to incorporate blockchains into every part of your life.

@_date: 2015-10-21 20:16:54
it can't. think about it - an attacker starts bringing online massive amounts of hashing power to build up to an attack on the network. this is the same as... somebody legitimately building up a new mining pool. the difficulty climbs, and the cost to maintain the network increases, which is the exact opposite of what you want an attack to achieve. even an unsuccessful attempt will heavily disrupt you if they pull the plug afterwards.
the mining arms race is a pretty good example of how far people are going to go just to get an ROI, and we now have a network that consumes the electricity of a small country per day to defend nothing of great importance(in terms of transaction content). imagine what would happen if you could potentially earn billions by (maliciously) controlling what happens on the network - the block reward/fees are never going to match that, so honest miners lose.
