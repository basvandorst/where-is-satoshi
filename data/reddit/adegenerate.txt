5k. I’m doing limit orders unless it starts going haywire either way. I can’t ‘lose’ because I believe it’s going to always recover any trade I make. I want to start amping up my trades because right now I don’t really take losing trades but it’s costing me value long term. I guess there isn’t a way to decide if the coin loss will end up burning me long term is there? 
Yeah I’m on gdax

You're definitely right. I was using those numbers to simplify it. I ended up dumping them all and got litecoin at 121 and unloaded at 131. Went back into btc at 15450. 
I played poker professionally for a decade so I have a good base for trading. I've just got a lot of room to grow. I'm more than happy breaking even for the first few months.
I'm not randomly picking spots. Trying to read the graphs and taking small gains / profits while I get used to it. I got smashed going from 15350, unloaded it at 15899 and rebought at 16675 :(. Ended back up on bitcoin with a 4% gain to my coin and priced in at 15450. 
That's good advice that you've shared. I'm definitely soaking it in.

I'm not opposed to taking the hits...for example I could have locked up $300 after my $15,390 hit at $15,000....the problem is that I don't know if continually burning coins like that will come back to bite me in the ass.

Can someone help me out here. I'm not the greatest at math.
I'm trying to figure out if this strategy is working out well or costing me in the long term. 
I bought at 14,800 and sold at 15,000 (+200), 14,900 sold 15350 (+450), 15,395 in and haven't sold yet. 
So I made $650. From a coin % I got in $100 cheaper and then $45 higher for a +$55 differential in actual bitcoin. I think it was a .006 gain which is about 90$ on top of the $650?? I'm not sure I can maintain a net gain in coins with my style but I'm confident I can continue crushing these small trades. Is this a stupid strategy?
