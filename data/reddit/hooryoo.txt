Because that's what Bitcoin shills call Bitcoin Cash. At this point I don't know WTF is going on and I don't trust either side. All this time I kept wavering on Bitcoin in general and, worrying it was a ponzi but, coming back when it seemed solid and time tested. 
I came back to this mess where a few developers convinced 97% of Bitcoin Miners to turn it into something Bitcoin is not. This should not have been allowed. Bitcoin is now controlled by a few and, I don't know what to make of Bitcoin Cash. Supposedly it runs closer to Satoshi's vision but, the oscillating difficulty isn't right either.
None of it is what it set out to be. The point that it can be altered to this extent and, the reason for using the Cryptocurrency has been lost...

I looked at the Kraken exchange and was turned off by the very basic, simple password requirements and, fairly recent hacking issues.
I looked at Electrum and found literature which dissuaded me from using Electron Cash.
My Coinbase account is useless in this situation.

FFS... I've found several tutorials.
The easy versions lack security and, the secure versions are beyond my grasp.
I mean, I could probably follow the 40 something step offline secure Electrum Wallet process buuut... It doesn't–
A. Fuck you Apple. 
B. Fuck you Apple. 
“Electrum” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the Mac App Store and identified developers." OH! Maybe I can fix that...
122GB memory dedicated to encrypting two offline wallets and waiting 40 fucking hours of installation to pull one god damned line of code. Fucking what the fucking fuck?
I'm not buying a fresh PC with the promise of a coin that will be worthless by the time I get to it...
This is the process I found on youtube. My notes may be hard to follow. It's long and absurd... but secure. Maybe someone with the bandwidth and honesty to do this for... No. I can't trust any of you... Annie, git ur gun...

Speculation had me tempted to throw in everything I didnt have over a month ago but, I sat it out and nothing happened... Then I learned what was happening with the split and there was so much misinformation, due to people talking out their asses, I put in a little to see what would happen. Of course I regret not throwing in everything... Just like I did years ago, when I took it out to pay the rent.
It's a dangerous game and I just can't afford $800 becoming $200... But, $3k is another story. I don't doubt the spike is due to people trading out BCH TO BTC... I don't knoe what to do with my wapping $27 in BCH. It would risk my $150 turned $190...

So... A fork is going to be a thing. Damn. That article throws me. Unfortunately, I don't have coin due to my loss in faith from the $1.2k to $200 crash and, I was considering buying back in because of recent revelations from the Chinese government... 
After reading this I'm not sure because, the beginner article seems unsure of the fork outcome's potential drawbacks...
The first thing I thought, based on the article, is the fork might result in doubling coin but then it said it could result in double dipping transactions...
Thats a very discomforting uncertainty... 
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:17:54
Thank you. I search by key words. Who has time to mindlessly scroll entire reddit subreddits, including 2 other Bitcoin based subreddits.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:00:47
I gotta say, I dont currently have BTC... Any crypto. I dumped it the first time China pumped and dumped it almost $1k.
Every time the Chinese government financially spooks citizens, value goes up. From what I heard today, I would expect a sharp rise as Chinese citizens convert more to BTC for international financial freedom...  
Apparently, the opposite, if nothing has happened... Did the Government just throw down the measures to stop sending money out of the country without warning?
On the other hand, I just saw something about a potential Dark Web retailer heist...
Then there is the upcoming hars fork...
All I have to throw in doesn't even amount to a whole coin unless I cashed out credit. I regret pulling out at a loss  back at $200ish...
I don't want to regret throwing in more than what I can afford... But I don't want to regret not making hay again...
There are so many factors right now. Im sure it will go up over time, if it doesn't crash entirely over the fork... It could rocket... All I would do is pull out what I borrowed to repay the debt and leave the gains for the long term... 
Like most of us, predicting Bitcoin's near futurw while it is still so volatile seems impossible
