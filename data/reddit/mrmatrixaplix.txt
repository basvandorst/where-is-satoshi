Well he or she already had the funds to risk (i hope) to buy into bitcoin so selling at a loss at the first sign of a hiccup just tells me that they shouldn't have bought any at all. So they might as well hold it and learn something.

Prices written by 2 different people. Seems like someone just wanted to have fun with the orange chalk.
Found a recently deleted AMA haha

Selling now would be foolish.

Market it to the entirety of reddit in these simple steps:
1. Bacon scented candle (of which I see you ALREADY MAKE!)
2. Picture of cat with candle (kitten for extra points)
3. ???????
4. Profit
And you spelled "lavendar" funny in the color options. Also, suggesting a sort of bitcoin incentive, with maybe 10% off or whatever you can afford it might make someone on the fence buy a couple. And your "twin pack" page is broken, there is no field to type in color and scent but it shows for the 3 pack and 4 pack. Another idea is a "mystery" candle where you can either sell your screw ups or extras to people for cheap. And glow-in-the-dark candles would be cool! I dunno just ideas good luck!

The mod's brother was killed by a hitman hired through silk road for a few thousand bitcoins during the summer.

$100,000,000 usd per coin by next week mark my turds.

No prob. Just poking around your site. Your 4 pack candles are $1 more than if someone was buying Two 2 packs, which is odd. And if someone bought a 2 pack and a single it would be less than the 3 pack candles as well!
A good pricing would be something like 2 for $28.99, 3 for $39.99, 4 for $49.99. I can probably bet you haven't sold a lot of single 4 packs but most smart customers would have ordered Two 2 packs instead :D

More of this is true than you would believe.
