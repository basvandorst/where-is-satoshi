If it drops back to 3000 you should def buy. Although i don't think it will, at least not in some time.

In reality we don't know. It could or it couldn't. Only time can tell us.

How do I know when is the top and when I should sell though?
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:59:21

When will bitcoin reach 10k?

Give it a few more years (2023 to be exact). Yes I am from the future. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:11:13
Do you have a sample I could hear. Just so I know what kind of beats you are working on? I don't rap but 2 of my friends do and want to make it out of the hood.

Coinbase your best option
@_date: 2018-12-08 09:19:34
I really like what you are doing, but I showed it to them and it's not what they are looking for. They are looking for more like new school beats similar to travis scott beats in example.

Unrelatable question, but how is rap music in the future?
