Why on earth do we trust hashes posted right next to download links for *security*? They’re to verify you got the file the site owner wanted you to get, but if someone owns the download page, they can post whatever they want alongside a valid hash.

What about cryptocurrency isn’t fungible? BTC is totally interchangeable.
Edit: I think what’s needed for adoption is for advocates to not do things like load up existing financial language with ideological baggage.

I don’t think so.
To you adoption is: add complexity to the chain to meet an anonymity goal that you call ‘fungibility’, pulling people in that care about making it difficult to identify their activity, after someone has done the work to link a public address to a person.
Ok, that’s a reasonable goal.
To me, loading up the terminology with your ideology makes you look like a zealot. I think that’s an impediment to adoption - how does anonymity assist in getting Joe Schmo buying coffee with BTC? For big purchases (like a house), having an immutable ledger may be seen as a *good thing* - so, I don’t agree that anonymity is required for *adoption*.
Here’s the thing - you said, roughly, “fungibility is needed for adoption”. I said “we have that”. You said “privacy is needed for adoption, I said that, you should understand my secret language” - can you see how that can hurt bringing people into the crypto ecosystem?

So what you want is anonymity, not fungibility.

You don’t have to keep doing anything. We disagree, we’re looking at the same facts and reaching different conclusions.
OP wants privacy. You said you want fungibility. I said we have that. You said “they are the same”, and presented an ideology-laden justification. Ok, so here I am confused why you would tell OP “do this thing first, even though I believe it’s the same as the thing that you are asking for”.
Whatever. Let’s argue some more on the Internet.

I understand the argument - that you can’t perfectly substitute 1 BTC for 1 BTC. But thing is, this is no different from currency (with traceable serial numbers), gold (with signature contaminants), grain, etc. etc. BTC is as fungible as fiat, gold and other commodities.
I get what you’re asking for - *anonymity* in the chain. Cool.

This isn’t a network issue. You can choose who you do business with, same as in real life. In fact, since you can trace coins between wallets, you have *more* visibility.
So - the work is in making those well-known, provable atrocities public, making the transactions public, and giving people tools to block the wallets involved.
