Come on sherlock, give me the definition of wet.
 
Fire does not burn things. It just can give things enough energy to make them ready for oxidation. 
Want to see a fire burn something in a room without O2
And i never said that anything about synonyms. It‘s like me saying: No, you‘re answer that „correlate“ is a country in asia is wrong.

What are you trying to say with that? 
Fire is an exothermic reaction and it makes sense to say it‘s hot.
Water is a fluid and fluids are wet.

Fun fact: in german „wet“ can be used as synonym for „water“

A bitcoin can be split? If it needs more value, the price goes up

Uhm... isn‘t it like costa rica didn‘t even react to cryptos but their law just does not forbid to pay the workers in something different than fiat?

Sorry to say that but i think you‘re wrong. 
If you give me 1 bitcoin and want 1.1 bitcoin back
I could just keep this bitcoin to pay it back. Then  i owe you 0.1 bitcoin. So i have to work to get 0.1 bitcoin from somebody else.
