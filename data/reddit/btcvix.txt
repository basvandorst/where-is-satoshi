FYI [ actually has **500x leverage** 
leverage is a tool and far some evil creation you make it out to be -- take a for a moment to remember that MtGox had ZERO leverage which means users had 100% of their principal exposed to counter party risk. In the still wild west environment that BTC operates in with shady operators, hacks, and exchanges disappearing overnight leverage of that nature allows me to expose a fraction of what I would otherwise need to trade appropriate size in the markets -- now the remaining funds can be put on other platforms or in the safety of my cold storage wallet -- that is much harder when platforms have zero leverage
@_date: 2016-04-09 21:31:42

You are conflating a bunch of things here for your argument ie that gambling = lossing and non gambling = winning -- you can very well make consistent returns year over year with proper setups and risk management -- in fact my win percentage is under 50% but I am still up massively on the year because my winning trades are massively larger than my lossing ones -- and I have done this all on 20x leverage btw as again leverage function isn't purely a sign of gambling or not gambling.
With that all said that does not mean we are not engaging in a form of gambling (we are) -- those that don't accept this usually have an ego related issue that they could stand to tell themselves, their gf, wife, friends, family etc that they are actually engaging in a form of gambling plain and simple "no uncle Bob trading isn't gambling there are mathematical probabilities" 
In the end you are still gambling just embrace it  
Edit: also re reputable exchange -- let me remind you that MtGox had zero leverage -- it is just best to assume that all exchange are scams eventually so the important of leverage is even greater as you can reduce counter party risk.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:08:51


In my opinion though if you are going to learn to trade it is best to take very small amounts and learn on those high leverage platforms -- from what I have found is the danger in a confidence build in new traders that start out trading low leverage and they jump up so quickly that they don't realize that their risk management department isn't equipped to deal with that big of jump -- it is easier to start high leverage then go down then the other way around. I could use poker example if you ever watch people that usually play hold'em suddenly play omaha they don't understand that their hands aren't quite as strong -- this is the same kind of false confidence that goes into someone coming from low leverage to high leverage and they won't see the holes in their risk management usually until margin call
@_date: 2016-04-28 16:56:28
All trading is gambling though -- it depends how you manage risk not the leverage component in and of itself

@_date: 2015-12-29 16:50:03
We discuss this quite a bit on telegram and on but China does a lot of volume washing/pumping and on a zero fee exchange this isn't that hard to do with minimal capital .
As to specifically why it is done there are a number of theories -- first many technical indicators are volume based like OBV so you can paint the candles with appropriate volume to produce false signals. Another more simple answer in my opinion is there is an agreement between the exchange and an MM or MMs that for some premium access/privileges they need to generate X volume. This allows the exchange to have more appearance of liquidity then is actually there but it is also begets more liquidity with appearance of liquidity

Zane officially joined BFX in mid-March   and CZ was gone from OKC in Mid-Feb  so the "last couple of months" they haven't been speaking with me in any capacity concerning OKC
Also check my earlier responses ON this post -- there were a lot things you didn't hear or see that weren't being recorded so don't try and project your thoughts upon me -- there were certainly elements of dishonesty I was aware of but the question is whether I really cared or if it was a fight worth having.  You probably won't understand but the host is playing the game just as much the contestants involved so it is not like a simple candid conversation. Some of the concerns were brought out on hangouts and you can see that but the fact is before our hangout there was near ZERO communication at these levels between traders and exchanges -- having said that there is line you walk up and can only push so far -- that is why I alluded to Zane about the front running -- I have NO DOUBT in my mind the hedge fund that plugged into OKC futs was not co-located but inline with the matching engine -- but after we gave them hell on the hangout they turned down the front running setting and all was more or less fine. Where do you suggest I push that ? should I go David Seaman and rage quit in epic fashion because of these "horrors" or do I want to take the chess approach of you know that I know what you are up to and now everyone knows in a more subtle fashion.

that is if you think those still have that much relevance -- IRC isn't controlled at all by Theymos and that probably has the biggest reach outside of twitter  -- then you have: TradingView Bitcoin Chat, WhaleClub TeamSpeak as well not to mention the content itself isn't his. If it ends up getting spread on those other channels doesn't really matter what kind of control functions he exercises. 
I would say the most relevant out of all those is Twitter -- by far the biggest source of where I get my information from on a day-to-day basis of what is going on in crypto.
@_date: 2015-12-26 14:19:45
Well it seems to provide more clarity about what the PBOC discussed specifically -- and this is some no name blog with a better English translation. Just because it was 10 days ago doesn't mean it isn't relevant or has been priced in-- Bitcoin suffers from a large information lag and dissemination so it is just getting attention now  
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:12:54
I am not exactly sure what you are asking but bitcoinwisdom is basically just on auto pilot at this stage as he doesn't do updates to it what-so-ever. You might be able to get cryptowatch or tradingview to show what you want to

Ok but now you are crossing into a tax attorney and not really a tax accountant -- obviously at that stage you could establish a foundation or incorporate a Belize IBC.

Hey Zane -- your response here got me thinking to a specific time when we were discussing frontrunning surrounding the 13 contract market sell that executed that dropped the price $16 without hitting a single order between the last price and fill price -- I remember asking you off air if it was possible they weren't telling you everything that was going on and you did say that was possible. I guess I will just leave it there as I have no idea where I was going with this post.
Secondly I think I have just been melancholy as of late observing the whole matter over at OKC. Watching the birth of .com and the futures market and engaging you every step of the way as you, CZ, and the original International Team turned that into a such a raging success --  I find a piece of myself missing. That product **still** makes me the most money *for now* but I know in this exchange game things change quickly. This isn't necessarily a cry to action or an outlash toward OKC but just that I want to see more viable products for me as a trader to make money with. OKC may still have a lead but they have undoubtedly harmed their image with the west and if they don't stay on point with their product, functionality &amp; execution my confident will wane even faster.

For individual taxes I am very against continuing to pay an industry that essentially begs for more complexity in the tax code so they have a job. Even if he just has to report capital gains this is pretty easily done with TurboTax and so is the rest. All that is needed is to put forth a good faith effort in reporting -- if that is too complex then they have made the tax code too complex plain and simple

I will just refer you to 's post -- there was 8 months of withdrawal problems at GOX -- so if you didn't see it coming you were just flat out blind and it wasn't too late. There might be some concern but we aren't seeing that on manifest itself out of exchange proper
@_date: 2015-12-23 04:30:30
I also think a lot comes from legal/compliance -- banks are actually very conservative when it comes to what they take for client funds and although in this specific case Daniel is an open celebrity and it is well known the source of his funds but the banks don't want to deal with additional AML compliance and the possibilities of fines that come with that.

@_date: 2015-06-11 23:22:03
I think it was well articulated on hangout and having spoken to many exchange operators both on or offshore it is in all their minds -- this idea of how far do the tentacles of AML/KYC reach and to what extent is this apparatus going to pursue these offshore entities. I certainly don't want to make light of the situation and it is not at all unreasonable for exchanges like Kraken to make such a business plan but we will just have to watch it play out.
I remain on the side that even if specifically the US embarks on this crackdown effort it is a question of how much resources they care to expend -- sure they have a lot to throw around but this means going into Russia and China even in the current state of Bitcoin exchanges -- they aren't going to cross Putin and thermonuclear war over a bitcoin exchange I am sorry but some of the ones domiciled offshore we might see them chased around like the torrenting sites. Only time will tell.....

Bro have you ever used TurboTax ? I am not talking about corporate taxes that require a full accounting department -- if you have ever used  TurboTax then you would understand -- most of the battle is just having all the documents you need present at the time you are doing your taxes and TT walks you through everything to the point of near dummy proof. 
Also if you don't have the required documents it doesn't matter how good of a tax accountant you have they won't be able to help you. 
You sound like you work in the industry or your wife does and you want to protect their job/profession. TT has all but replaced that for those that are able to use a computer
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:59:50

I am not saying the PR shit show doesn't cause **some** concern but these leaps to conclusions INCLUDING yourself need to be shoulder checked.

The p2p lending product gets labeled as a total return swap as per CFTC guidelines:
Total Return Swaps
A total return swap ("TRS") on a single currency, loan, or narrow-based security index (as described above) generally is a security-based swap. However, if a TRS includes embedded interest rate optionality or a non-securities component, such as the price of oil or a currency hedge, it is a mixed swap. Additionally, TRS on a broad-based index or on two or more loans (which one would expect to be considered "narrow-based") is a swap rather than a security-based swap.
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:52:35
Why ? This whole situation is getting blown out of proportions epicly -- just because a private contract went sour and the said party handled it terribly should not be construed that they as an exchange proper are insolvent, it is both reckless and negligent of Ver's part -- this is a standard boogymaning of China as the cause for the bagholders anonymous thathas become -- they can't accept that they made a bad investment decision buying at ATHs and instead chalk up to the "evil Chinese" that Ver's narrative supports and continues to drive ethnocentricism.
Shit happens this is Ver dragging his personal matters onto reddit and for completely selfish reasons -- this has nothing to do with his second coming of the messiah persona. Let us not forget how he lost all shred of credibility as he stood behind mtgox

If you can't handle the heat of uncertainty your funds should never ever leave cold storage EVER -- if not you just need to accept the reality of the imperfect space that is the BTC exchange space -- some people value aspects different than others but for me it is functionality and ultimately the ability to make more profits -- last time I check this was an open forum so I am entitled to voice my opinion just like anyone else 
Also withdrawals are fully functioning unless you have never withdrawn before because you never have profits to withdraw

Well we haven't broken the downtrend from the ATH so it is a bit premature to make those claims --- also going sideways means there is no apparent trend -- we can sleep walk through that trendline break without actually going into a bull trend. This is just a typical decaying sin wave like formation where we are compressing the range for a bigger breakout/down type move. We can certainly consolidate and resume down as well -- I trying to articulate that you can't go reaching that this is overtly bullish -- although with that said I do have a bullish biased out this consolidation but I simply trade the setups -- I am not committed to that view

Still all of this doesn't matter to a trader, exchange proper, and the incredible futures product that they built -- if anything back when they they decided to make this pivot to focus on wallets and payments with this Bitcoin.com deal they could have paid me $20k in consulting fees to tell them it was a stupid idea to focus on anything other than the trading platform and would have saved them a massive headache. So hopefully this starts that refocus but I doubt it -- regardless they still have the best product out there from what the former dream team built with their deep community involvement. 
I am sick of Roger Ver -- he just need to ride into the sunset of anarchist utopia -- have you not forgotten about his backing of GOX and that he got Bitcoin.com for Mark ? Wake the fuck up or maybe you weren't around for that -- in trader history it is our 9/11 we will **NEVER** forget
@_date: 2015-05-19 13:56:35
See you DON'T -- you are talking about the trading of cryptocurrency not the lending of coins to be used as margin in their swap facility -- this is a total return swap and BFX even lists it like that -- that very CLEARLY falls under the CFTC and you can find TRS even listed there so stop thinking you actually know financial products -- there are a number of BTC companies specifically dealing with the CFTC and getting their swaps approved -- this includes LedgerX and SolidX

I will concur with the horrendous UI and lack of documentation -- it is made for traders not really the Bitcoin hobbist -- and I did over look the idea of strictly lending BTC versus lending USD on BFX which is far more lucuaritive -- going forward I could see if more altcoin exchanges offer p2p swaps that you would get a much better interest rate there -- solid write up though

Yes Zane did offer an official response over on : 
Although I welcome more quant data like this I am bit hesitant looking too deep into this specific case based on the statement released. The generated lag from people entering in larger positions then they otherwise could have followed by subsequent attempts at closing etc makes me throw this in the misnomer camp.
Also I know the XBT designator is the official code for BTC but I just can't get behind XBT -- to me it will always be BTC -- maybe I am just old fashioned for the BTC trading community

I would say it at least appears to have paused for the moment -- but that doesn't mean the downtrend is over -- we could also go sideways for a very significant amount of time -- either way I am starting to get longer term bullish as we compress the range and tighten the Bollinger bands on the daily and weekly time frames 
@_date: 2015-05-13 07:32:28
the way you are framing your argument is intentionally leading to make assumptions that no one using TA should ie that you can "predict the future" TA is at best 20% science 80% art -- because although the indicators are hard science based on their code and quantified measurements they are only one window into what ultimately drives underlying price and that is market psychology. Once you can establish a trading plan that includes risk management often after learning the hard with several blowups you can start to form a trading style to fit your personality and lifestyle -- once you view it is a business with the critical part of risk management then it is possible to lose 60% of trades and still remain overall profitable

People in the hype to get on the exchange with margin haphazardly turn over all of their personal and identifying data -- it was a great slight of hand on Polo's part. I said to them directly though as they were beating the drum of meeting KYC for the terms of the MSB licenses they are obtaining -- MSB doesn't cover their margin swap facility -- that is CFTC and that is a whole different animal there 
Also why it that 3 of the 4 major altcoin exchanges are in the USA while the USA has no major BTC exchange lol -- I guess Coinbase is doing a descent job

I have heard some of those ideas before -- they are all "neat" but tbh the money in those suggestions is infinitesimal in impact size. I think Bitcoin believers need to have a sobering look at those grandiose ideas and embrace the fact that a use case exists that is going on right now -- as a new speculative asset class for traders and funding trading platforms CFDs etc -- I will add the 24/7 nature of Bitcoin trading/markets is a big step from the legacy system and gives it an edge in certain fronts. Trading and speculation IS a use case

Everyone using margin trading on Poloniex needs to KYC/AML by May 20th  (swaps are CFTC area)
@_date: 2015-05-19 06:01:06
That is how it starts though -- stamp did the same thing -- if you watch the process it all follows foot in the door theory 
All the KYC they have listed and cite for abiding by the guidelines set out by FinCEN for obtaining MSBs still doesn't address the illegal swap market they are running with out the CFTC's blessing

CZ is friends with Roger though -- this is proven by their prior relationship at blockchain.info -- but with that said it doesn't rinse OKC of some obligations based on what one of their employees did -- it does make things much more complex though

I have rather mixed feelings on this -- I don't think very highly of Fyr what-so-ever for various reasons and am not a fan of how he approached the situation but I actually understand to a point where he is coming from, it mostly spawns from a **lack** and even **total disregard** of tact and professionalism from Arthur IMO. When you are the CEO of an exchange that handles OPM (other people's money) you are held to different standards then those in the community. 
I went on to have a conversation with Arthur about this on telegram and many of his responses **don't sit well** with me. From the idea that he wants to be the "Goldman Sachs of Bitcoin" yet operates at a level of high school blogger/tabloid journalist to viewing all his clients and customers as "children". I don't know maybe I am off base on this one but to me this is not the behavior or attitude I would like to see from an exchange operator in the bitcoin space

I am also not really denying what you are saying as I am not defining absolutes, maybe that is what YOU actually think that TA is some kind of science, so it should ALWAYS work or some shit, very common misconception as trading and the proportion of TA weighing to the decision making process is an art not a science

Yea you are ignorant because is a kind of silly calling imo -- like the typical ers that have this strange idea that they can convince people to NOT have btc on the exchange &amp; NOT lend it out and then people can only buy and omg moon!. Yeah just doesn't make sense 
We are years if not decades away from decentralized exchanges -- they simply lack the high level of functionality to be competitive -- sorry to piss on your crytpoanarchist dreams
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:22:50
The postive light is their trading platform is still light years beyond their nearest competitor -- if people want to leave and have less tools to be profitable then so be it
@_date: 2016-03-26 04:59:55
Well in the way TA is traditionally taught yes I would agree with you but that doesn't capture the essence of market structure -- the only thing bbands are telling you is really compression and in bitcoin it is very important because it represents how tightly coiled the spring is -- not sure how you somehow think you are a TA god when you clearly don't have the slightest understanding then make a near absolute statement just goes to show your myopia -- I actually fairly doubt you have made more than myself and the likes even if you bought at sub $10 prices over 3-4 years ago -- with the high leverage game of 20x on OKC it has been shorting BTC from the Summer of 2014 that has been where the money has been -- short from $550 to $150 on 20x is a the equivalent of a $8000 move 
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:46:48
Maybe but the leverage on $USDCNH is way more than BTC -- BTC won't be as smooth as the devalu

Yep -- can't deny being a trader and wanting the absolute best product imaginable to maximize profits -- oh if only we could get that OKC dream team back -- but even though OKC has essentially halted all exchange developments for the last 90 days it is still so far ahead there isn't even another futures exchange product in its league -- but those times can change quickly 
@_date: 2016-01-07 12:00:44
the only thing **more** sure than the bitcoin bull trade is the Chinese Yuan bear trade -- you could go long $USDCNH (offshore yuan) and pretty much bank the continued devalutation, at least I have
500x leverage on $USDCNH doesn't look so bad with 
@_date: 2016-03-26 03:27:59
Ignore at your own peril, it is mindsets like yours that still makes bitcoin one of the most profitable and easiest instruments to trade overall
@_date: 2016-03-26 03:21:51
The problem with your logic is that you have a subjective and biased definition of what brings about bitcoins "true" price, as many call it "legit use cases" whatever that is suppose to mean -- speculation is all as much of a use case as any of the nice warm and fuzzy narratives that get talked about at bitcoin meetup groups -- in fact a speculative bubble could very easily induce the adoption of those core bitcoin idealists use cases of consumer adoption etc. Don't believe me ? just look at the infrastructure and adoption that was built in the wake of the $1200 bubble -- do you think it would be easier or harder to spend bitcoin if we hadn't had that $1200 run?
As far and 's commentary regarding bbands and their current squeeze the break will be violent for all the reasons they list and it can reach far beyond those only day trading in a such a thinly traded market like bitcoin

@_date: 2016-03-28 15:29:24
to clarify as I did in my post I have **no** problem in the high leverage aspect but what I **do** have a problem when they are touting "professionalism" being the "Goldman Sachs of Bitcoin" and saying they are very transparent when they clearly aren't -- there is a lot of data they are not providing/withholding and it raises doubts and skepticism about what I am actually trading
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:17:08
Well there is currently no liquid and viable product on par with OKC 20x futures -- the haters can hate but their platform is just far superior in functionality and feature set as we sit today in the space -- now this can certainly change though going forward and welcome other competitors to step up -- there is a golden opportunity right here if any of them can
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:44:01
the plot has surely thickened -- I have a strange feeling that Roger was not oblivious to these actions taken by CZ. Since always turns into we might as well take it to that level that they conspired together *sarcasm* (emphasis added for those unable to detect it) . Then you throw in the accusations of no payment of wages etc -- what a complete mess. I had no problem bad mouthing Roger Ver (because of my resentment toward his involvement with GOX) but I had this sinking feeling CZ might have something to do with this whole deal -- the pieces were aligned -- in my dealings with CZ I have nothing but praise to give him and he knows the inside of the exchange at the matching engine level better than anyone else I know -- his product is still the best there is out there but at some point we are going to need to hear from @_date: 2016-03-12 17:30:54

This is a realised VOL tracker and not really THE VIX per se-- a true VIX calculation has to be implied volatility not realised so it becomes a calculation of calls versus puts of what ever the underlying is, in this case BTC. Seeing that bitcoin has no liquid or dominate options market there really isn't a VIX yet if that all makes sense.

not commenting on the ethics surrounding the contracts or subsequent behavior around it as it is just a complete mess -- but having encountered &amp; spoken to bitcoinity directly on a few occasions, his PR skills were not much to be desired especially when you consider that the charting platform itself is at such primitive levels to any serious trader, it is barely a consideration. I actually know no one that uses it and am pretty surprised the site is still around. It does raise some question of OKC's foresight in aligning with such a shitty platform but I guess this is the trend considering they decided to do business with Ver over bitcoin.com and this continued NON-focus on the trading platform aspect of their business -- that is a continued worry for me while waiting for exchange players in this space to actually step up. I don't care about politics or friendships I care about making money and the products/services that can aide me in that -- if the product sucks I have no problem saying it because I am have little interest in using it. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:41:54
well you can go through all the citings, I have provided links to all of them in the piece -- there is a balance between slapstick humor and content, I am not going to write in dissertation format on a reddit post -- if you actually look through their history there is a number of times where OKC fucked something up and they were there to remind people that they were there offering no socialized losses and could be trusted so to me that is exactly what I see with a fat chick trying to get attention from some guy that was treated badly by his current gf

generally I would agree with you but once he stated that everything "is business" and about the views/clicks then screenshots are fair game -- there are plenty of exchanges operators I do business with daily that uphold myself and themselves to a higher level of professionalism and these kind of things remain confidential. 
In this case I think Arthur went too far and it should be pointed out by community leaders that this isn't acceptable in our eyes. Regardless if you think Fyr was being out of line it seems Arthur was happy to taunt the lawless domicile he resides in so it is up to the court of public opinion and communities like this to be judge of right and wrong. Some may disagree with me but this is my opinion
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:37:25
Well to my understanding Nobel is a competing model to Alpha Point -- so that is first and foremost -- also what we are seeing is a move away from having to start every exchange from scratch or an open source dump of Bitcoinia code like BFX was originally built upon. 
There are some worthwhile discussion points concerning centrialization of backend work that is a valid projection of future problems but what comes from that is expansion of other services and features that would otherwise be consumed at foscusing on the backend build. I am also very certain this is what many of the HFT players like DRW have been waiting for to enter the space with a significant market making capacity. And before I get an idealist retort do understand that this is likely the paving of the way for large institutional money that has been near completely absent up to this point

Well also I understand the concept of systemic risk as well -- so I couldn't even come up with a sap story of "omg I just lost all my coins on X exchange" -- this is the current landscape of crypto, I trade accordingly and I am fine with it. In fact I have made so much money on OKC futures that the balance I have there could be gone and I would still be up around 900% so again you don't seem in much of position to understand these things and access risk and mitigate it appropriately.
Also have you spoken with 4 of the 10 members that left international ? Probably not so I have some additional understandings of the inner workings.

Well the trend is clearly defined -- 80-90% of BTC volume is offshore -- i.e. not on the US no margin exchanges as well as the heavy KYC/AML requirements of domestic exchanges -- Coinbase Exchange has a role to convert wallet users to base traders but isn't at par with being an exchange for very active traders without margin and algo order types at the very least.
I went over all this with Michael, Roman, and Charlie Lee of Coinbase in the panel interview we did in Teamspeak. I know my 250 users well and there is very little use of Coinbase as a trading exchange other than some market maker bots -- however they are a terrific fiat gateway.
Edit: also you seem to have this vendetta against margin trading and BFX specifically -- I would be interested in your comments concerning the OKCoin futures spike from $270 to $350. Same criticism applies here ? Why are focusing so much in BFX may I ask ?
@_date: 2015-08-18 05:39:56

@_date: 2015-08-19 15:54:15
actually it does because you don't **understand** the purpose of DRW Trading Group &amp; Cumberland Mining -- the layperson thinks they are an investment fund but actually they are HFT/market makers. To them if the rate on capital is right they make these deals regardless of instrument -- it just ends up being part of their inventory to engage in future market maker operations which isn't really directional at all -- they just want that virgin flow.

Sure -- everything in life is basically a ponzi-- even Bitcoin as I bet you have shilled your friends on the great things about it trying to get them to buy and use it. Stock market is a ponzi and on down the line -- I just have to sell before the other guy. 
Also all exchanges in BTC are basically bucket shops in nature so rather than take some idealist bend on things like you do I just trade accordingly with that assumption in mind. Reminds me of people that say the Fed is going to cause things to "end badly" ... Sure but there is a lot of trading to do in the mean time.

not sure exactly why you are framing it that way -- is nice actually speaking with exchanges in the space where there is often minimal dialogue -- especially considering as a trader we tend to put good chunks of coin on them I would want to know as much as I can about them and Google Hangout interviews allows for traders to ask those tough questions -- imo there is a ton of value there that didn't exist pre-GOX. Even if no one listened I would still do them because of the great insight I get from the movers and the shakers in the space

The problem for active traders is the exchange space is a compete hot mess currently -- I would say that other exchanges have done things so ungodly bad and out of touch with reality that is why we still people use OKC. Just because OKC might do a lot of things wrong from a PR and ethical standard doesn't mean other competitors should look at everything china/OKC is "bad". OKC UI/UX literally blows EVERYTHING in the space out of the water -- I cringe having to look at other platforms or even attempt to use them. Also love it or hate the futures 20x futures product with socialized losses has been a MASSIVE success. So for me who talks to exchange operators on a weekly to daily basis I noticed a lot of myopia and even total disregard when I mention some of the things China does well -- they don't have the user base they do for no reason so I would like to see some of the western exchange operators swallow some humble pie an look what they can build on rather than just dismiss everything OKC/china does as something to stay far away from.

Would you be interested in coming on a Google Hangout with bitcoin traders to discuss this more ? very interesting 
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:41:43
I will give you one overarching point, in the last year or so outside of some minor cosmetic changes we have seen little in the way of platform and product development -- it is the largely the reason I left BFX for OKC futures back over a year ago -- I have voiced this to Phil, Zane and the BFX team and I **know** they keep saying that once Alpha Point integration is complete there will be noticeable improvements but this industry moves quickly and the competition is fierce.
But with all that said I don't think you are a very imformed trader or watch the markets that closely -- the spike up on OKC futures and .cn was -- here is the 1 minute chart but we started at $270 and spiked to $350 in a matter of minutes  You were correct about the glitch in April -- as that was just a settlement calculation issue. Also it was last year during that flash crash that BFX implemented the "speed bumbs" -- I am not a huge fan of it actually and as I stated yesterday on TS with Phil I think it actually makes the problem worse because when you "slow the market down" people seem to panic more as they are trapped in positions they want out of
Edit: yeah it does seem that you have an idealist leaning as alludes to but you seem to take specific aim at BFX. He goes on to make another good point as to that being interesting considering BFX only offers 3x versus OKC futures 20x and 796.com 50x. The thing that idealists usually fail to understand that if a lot of their merchant adoption is going to take place you need the liquidity from speculation. IMO speculators are the only growing user base in bitcoin currently, I include BTC proper trading along with using it as collateral at CFD brokers. This is the despair phase of the bear winter -- if the bulls haven't given liquidated they will be worn out.

You must clearly not be a trader then -- without margin trading there is little incentive to trade the instrument as a trader. Unfortunately I can give a long list of reasons of why Coinbase Exchange isn't up to par even with BFX but you can just find the SoundCloud interview where I go over everything

I like to look at those trend line as more of areas of interest then clear *lines* to be broken -- but it appears we have cleared it all. Now I know many of the bitcoin kool-aid drinkers jump to the conclusion then we must be in BULL market but that isn't necessarily true -- we could continue to drift around in this area for quite some time but that was a **VERY** heavily watched area and we appear to through it 
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:01:24
Meh. That rheotic gets old and it really isn't the current state of affairs --  there is a lot of middle ground outcomes that aren't binary conditions like either Gox or NOT Gox -- imo it is far more likely we see just an erosion of the edge OKC as more fierce competitors enter the space. Just as I have been so vocal against their pivot towards wallets and payments as it inevitably diverts resources away from trading platform proper. With that I just see a steady loss of users as active traders migrate to a superior platform. Far from any Gox like scenario.
I took a look at GOX before the $266 bubble and never even bothered opening an account, I could even then there were issues I didn't want anything to do with -- went right to BFX but I came in with a trading background so I knew what to look for.
@_date: 2015-08-08 16:12:32
BFX owners are known though -- met them all in NYC and they talk to us daily on TS
Not to mention WSJ reports about DRW -- it just confirmed what I had known for months 
And my post on the matter -- do read that they are hedge funds after the flow -- that doesn't mean "big money /price appreciation" 
You are very naive as to what is going on the space and before you think you are talking to some idealist do know that I am trader. So much so I stood in the face of all the ridicule as I shorted BTC to $160 so don't attempt to paint me in the corner.

I worked in HFT and have friends in and around the Chicago MM crowd just the same so I am not going to get into a pissing contest on reddit. Cumberland is largely a pilot program for them into crypto to get the offshore flow -- so I agree with you actually on the immaturity and little interest a MM would have in BTC/crypto but as the race to the bottom with speed continues in HFT they will seek other more virgin markets to take their slab of skin from.
Edit: also I don't think you got the jist of my blog post either -- I was really suggesting that they were behind it -- but it is interesting that they did their biggest buys of USM's coins after. People can draw conclusions from there. Most of the point of the blog post was to re-iterate what you just said -- they don't give a fuck about direction or directional strategies in an esoteric unregulated product -- but that isn't to say they don't have **an** interest in it -- as I was pointing to in the virgin references
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:06:31


You do realize this is complete nonsense right ? If you want a more mature capital market margin is a piece of that puzzle -- (AlphaPoint CEO discussing that at conference  maybe in some idealist utopia your clouded vision is right but not in reality unfortunately. And there is nothing wrong with speculators being interested in bitcoin -- for the most part it got bitcoin here as that is what drew in media attention and got developers, merchants, entrepreneurs, money mangers, exchanges etc here to grow the community and turn it from neat niche experiment to something of benefit. 
Also how do you suppose all the projects growing up around bitcoin that include **bitcoin** as a funding mechanism will go to access liquidity ? Even the idealist need liquid markets or I should say **more** liquid markets as it frees up resources and allows them to focus on their specialty.
Want to know what BTC starts to look like with out speculators: bid $220- ask $240 -- good luck trying to effectively off load risk or merchant revenue into that -- you see the model breaks down and can't support it
Also a side point seeing you seem in the idealist camp but somehow defend Coinbase -- what do you have to say to this

How will your product differ that of ? -- I think they worded it correctly that it is an actual Historical VOL or realized VOL product versus a traditional VIX product that would be implied VOL -- specifically the VIX is calculation across the calls and puts of the underlying but to date BTC doesn't have enough of an established options market for that product to come to fruition... yet.

• so as to the first alluded attack on July 10th they have decided to provide some compensation which I commend them on but I guess IMO it wasn't enough -- their most valued resource is the integrity of their trading platform so that should be paramount on resource expenditure but we know they have pivoted/re-focused (at least in the near term) on wallets and payments -- that decision might be starting to catch up with them as they were caught flat footed by this attack.

@_date: 2016-02-06 20:36:45
Actually this isn't so strange and your framing of this goes to show your myopia -- .cn is the chinese based server and operations for chinese based users, even though they do accept some foreigners there is no good solution to their connectivity issues from outside of the mainland -- so to appease the local regulators they put up strict lending requirements for what would be the equivalent of an accredited investor. These reasons are also why they offer no more then 3x leverage and moved the high leverage futures to .com their foreign facing company.
Just watch Kraken and/or Coinbase do something similar where they offer conservative products to the users within their demographic domicle then off higher levered products through an offshore entity and exclude their domestic users publicly at least.

Disagree -- people choose a path of least resistance when it comes to funding/payment options so actually bitcoin is easier than going to your local western union and feeling sketchy as hell sending money to a name you can't pronounce to a country you can't pronounce.

I think your conjecture is rather subjective -- the fact we are discussing it is actually the second faction of political change -- when there are exits there come voices concerned about the exits -- it creates a feedback loop upon itself.

Well information advantage/asymmetry is one type of alpha but certainly not the only one for example HFT is entirely speed based so once your firm doesn't have the fastest microwave tower you have to either evolve technology wise or pivot to another source of alpha 
I can say I don't strictly utilize standard indicators or setups -- I have proprietary tools at my disposal and then its about trade setup and risk management. Trading can actually become rather boring and methodical but thats the key to approaching it like a business and not a degenerate euphoric highs &amp; despairing lows gambler. I will add that there are professional gamblers as well but one thing they have in common with traders is they manage risk accordingly. 
To be perfectly honest I read your types a lot -- my guess is probably think you are smart guy - blew out a few etrade accounts and then just came to the  conclusion that no one could do this without clear insider information and it was rigged against you because after all you are a "smart" guy-- when in reality your were unable to accept and own the loss and move on (so lack of emotional intelligence) -- you are just butt hurt really-- I am still wrong on about 40% of all trades I make but risk reward is in my favor that I am taking small losses taking small losses then getting large winners so I am very comfortable in my skin when my trade setup results in a loss
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:08:13
I disagree with that that cliche -- it is a vote against the obsolete technology known as a representative republic -  opting out of and watching voter turnout go to nill does actually illustrate the point -- it is exit versus voice.

@_date: 2015-04-21 23:40:16
absolutely -- I am not arguing that point -- but BTC **is** involved as you need to have it as collateral for your futures account and it settles in BTC not USD
Also the contract is actually denominated in USD $100 but the amount of btc that represents changes as per the market rate -- it is more complicated then you think it is if you have never traded on OKC. For intensive purposes it isn't really worth going into a deep dive on but you seem to be drilling down into specific details so I felt the need to clarify

There is nothing wrong with daytraders or speculators in general and as a new speculative asset class it is one thing that is proving to be a use case **now** and not some hypothetical payment system of the future like the idealists want us to believe. 
Secondly although there is a solid trading following in China I wouldn't be so skewed to think that represents the origins of all volume coming from of those exchanges -- the futures market has a very large western trader following and after I left BFX 9 months I have had no incentive to trade on a western exchange since

Both actually -- and if you actually talk to traders there are a number of reasons to utilize each of them depending on the trading strategy you are employing -- also the Chinese traders are on .com, BitVC, &amp; 796 just as much as the westerners -- I think the general trend though has been a move away from the spot .cn as evidence by futures often assuming the lead role -- the non swap fee leverage has become a very lucrative for both domestic Chinese and western traders a like

trading is certainly a form of gambling regardless of leverage amount -- anyone that tries to convince themselves, friends, family, wife/gf are doing it solely to restrain their inner degenerate gambler and associated psychological and social stigma. With that all said there is certainly a descent living to be made as a professional gambler/trader but it all comes down to risk management and very **solid** risk management at that.
there are several overlooked **advantages** to leverage especially in the bitcoin space:
1) first off all the "boy who cried Gox" types that are always FUDing on evil speculators crashing the price and how all their coins are going to disappear in the next GOX have to understand that say on a 20x platform like OKC I can greatly reduce my overall principle exposure to counterparty risk (you know the exchange getting hacked, theft, etc) -- that is right now with a fraction of the exposure I can control just as much buying power while having a significant majority of my coins never leave the confines of my cold storage wallet.
2) High leverage will absolutely condition you to **NEVER** hold a losing position -- the pain is so great that one must just cut losses even quicker which is what through experience a good trader should trend toward anyways.

well I have talked to all of them and understand their concerns -- have you ? And I will come out and say that their concerns are certainly valid but from a trader standpoint it isn't a blanket case -- it is simply a risk calculation -- I can, **HAVE** and continue to make more money on OKC futures 20x with less counter party exposure then I would have on BFX. So really what you are saying doesn't address the issue from a trader standpoint -- it depends on your risk parameters and ultimate exposure. If I can make more money and expose less capital even with those concerns the correct risk/reward is present for me to stay on OKC. I can really tell why you are a failed trader as you fail to understand basic r/r

This really isn't a problem anymore with leverage. I can have 1/20th of my coins on exchange and control the same amount as having **all** of them on there. So with 19/20ths of my BTC in cold storage I have no problem leaving the remaining 1/20th on exchange to trade with leverage.

Again the r/r of all the claims (risk) VS money to be made still is my threshold to continue trading there. Care to speak on any of this or do you not understand r/r at all ?

Disagree -- although I can tell you don't quite understand trading specifically so let me clarify a point. I don't like the word "predict" as it carries heavy ego implications that someone can "predict" the future. I certainly want no part in that discussion however when it comes to trading there are **setups** that present themselves that have me taking a long or short position. Risk management is the element that most people fail on and protects you on failed setups. Ultimately if risk/reward is in my favor and I have properly selected the critieria for my setups my winning trades will run and my losers will be cut quickly
And just because you can't do it doesn't mean others can't

actually this is ponzi marketing 101 -- it is like the "wellness" MLMs you see but if you ask people about why their product is 3x more expensive then something I could get off bodybuilding.com they say well this about providing a healthy lifestyle and support group. So their is a premium to the cult or what they like to call "membership" dues. Then comes the "we are here to make members rich just to provide a place to share healthy living information **and help each other**" but yep the cash register keeps ringing. And picking on the wellness companies specifically you will never find a shortness of "help" as there are tons of seminars and shit by higher up shills/marketers that some how claim they are providing some kind nutritional information which conveniently all points back to their products
@_date: 2015-10-13 14:38:44


probably not -- you **think** you know with some minimal knowledge
well it depends what the "study" is encompassing -- of what is typically taught as TA is not taught to make someone money so any "study" consisting of popular EMA/MACD crosses I am certain will underperform because it is taught out of tradition and selling classes/seminars that is why as a trader you need to incorporate your own set parameters and prop software to find something that suites your personality and style -- that really can't be controlled and tested in any "study" -- it is not that those before mentioned indicators are worthless but blindly applying them to a strategy is -- but yes most traders, probably 90% of them lose money -- but 99.9% of aspiring NBA players fail to make it in the NBA -- it is just another profession that requires easy 10k hours of experience to master with LOTS of blowouts and let downs on the way but it is often seen as "easy" because people just see average looking people clicking buttons on the screen and then think "well I have an internet connection and a mouse I can be a trader too" but this is as dumb as someone thinking they can step onto a basketball court at the NBA level and make a living.

I am in both agreement and disagreementat the same time with you &amp; so let me start with agreement side of things: there is clearly a pick-up in wash trading across Huobi, OKC, and **Bitstamp** -- yes even BitStamp although you seemed to gloss over that as it didn't fit neatly into your ethnocentric narrative of the Chinese boogeyman. Here is video of the OKC volumizer at work:  -- here is Lock Ness monster style screen shots of OKC volumizer:  -- now let me show you that Stamp is engaging in a similar volume washing although not to magnitude of the Chinese exchanges as Stamp does still have fees: 
All exchanges are somewhere on the bucket shop spectrum -- even trading on BATS is quasi-bucket shop so it is really a matter or being aware of what I agree is some form of volume washing spoofing but I am not so certain it actually has an intent other than to just inflate volume and appear more liquid then what some would deem as "reality" (more on this in a bit). It is very likely **NOT** the exchange but a very cozy MM that has some deal in place to provide X quota of volume or book depth per day in turn they get to feed off of the retail order flow probably not all that dissimilar then Flash Boys a la Michael Lewis. 
I long ago stopped feigning outrage at these activities and have become a proponent of the "fake it till you make it" model of bootstrapping an exchange. Why do I say this ? Well it is a function of network effect as even the appearance of liquidity begets more liquidity so it becomes self-fulfilling. I actually would say this is a global trend in general as think of the social dating sites and their many socket puppet accounts to give the appearance of a deep pool of potential suitors. It ends up building upon itself and clearly it has offered some success -- I am not stating this as a perfect solution and it brings a whole host of other issues; however it does allow the business a fighting chance at the beginning because from my standpoint the only marketing angle I hear from the ghosttown exchanges is "our volume is REAL though" -- yes I am sure the 79 coins that traded on Gemini were "real" but I am very sure I could easily fill my positions in the 200k BTC of OKC wash trading even if only 5-10% of that was "real" whatever that means.

well what is a "professional technical trader" as this is kind of a nonsense term other than to the people that want to feel warm and fuzzy with some title -- seems the problem is defining WHO that is to even conduct a worthwhile study. Beginning traders tend to make the same mistakes as a cohort and often over and over again -- some of these include overtrading, not defining setups properly, too large of position size, risk management, indicator-itis to name a few. Really risk management is the hardest to learn for most and requires several account blowouts before they start to understand this even though on the surface it seems so obvious but fighting the inner demons can be a real struggle 




well of course if you are trying to define things in terms of **consistent** than I am in total agreement as trading is essentially a non-linear profession. Taleb makes this point in most of his books as to the problem of applying linear thought process/models to a non-linear field as I can sit for 6 straight weeks and make little to nothing and then on week 7 I can make my whole quarter/years salary as that is the nature of the markets as they change from rangebound to trending or vise versa. Those looking to replace their "9-5 clock punching day job" with trading by trying to define how much they need to make per day/week will likely fail miserably with that mindset applied to trading returns. The market does not care if you have to make money to eat tomorrow as it can spend days to weeks without providing a viable trade setup only to then start providing a trending trade setup for days to weeks -- no person to what they know of the world having worked in Ivy Towers or corporate have the capacity to comprehend this. Having worked on a prop desk and for a HFT firm I see the influx of traders into BTC trading and they are certainly more pompous on their aptitude to program something to make them money but many find out the hard way that besides Hedge funds that have a team of quants constantly tweaking parameters on their quantitative algos or the HFT firms that are purely speed driven as their alpha there is no "set it and forget it consistent money making machine"

I can assure you if they are going to launder money they **aren't** going to use BitStamp -- we all know they AML/KYC is up the ass so the last thing someone engaging in such activities is going to is want to is to lay out all that information and then blatantly wash their coins when there are other exchanges that don't collect such information -- really you have no idea what you are talking about -- MMs don't pay fees to provide liquidity but what they are doing is smashing their no fee orders into fee'ed orders and churning volume

Nice in theory but if you are a trader you are going to have funds on the exchange. Thankfully with the addition of higher leverage like on OKC futures it enables people to keep less than 1/5 of the amount of coins on exchange then they would otherwise need with out leverage to control the same amount of coins

Well I have used .cn in the past and never had a problem filling 1k+ coin orders but they do offer a suite of algo order types like icebergs to expedite the process.
I was one of the first people on OKC futures and remain there and thrbpoint is when I place my order at the front of the book the bots eat it and I get filled. This wasn't the case in BFX or stamp granted Stamp it appears you could that now. IMO you are trying to make excuses for stamp but really their volume washing might be even more insidious as it is explicitly for smashing MM zero fee trades into retail fee'ed trades -- at least the Chinese zero fee exchanges have zero for all participants -- that isn't to say there aren't other issues but your defense really doesn't hold water. It doesn't sound like you trade much at all based on the substance of your post. I am sure whatever exchange you are on is good enough for your hobbist endeavors. 


So you just choose to have an ethnocentric view that if it isn't faimilar it must be wrong/corrupt/fraud ? Makes sense

I appreciate the community engagement and I have a lot of respect for Jack -- I followed his blog for over the last year and think he has a firm grasp of the intersection of legacy finance and cryptospace 
What concerns me specifically as a trader is **not** any of the current FUD that fills this post and the one on -- that there is some brewing security issue or loss of customer funds. What **does** concern me as a trader though is this seemingly redirection of focus onto wallets and payments. 
With the conversation I had with Jack I **do** see there being a relationship between wallets/payments &amp; trading but as a highly active retail trader myself and the 250+ traders my community I can tell you that is being seen negatively as far a pushing aside of what made OKCoin the powerhouse it is: a highly functional and feature rich trading platform. There is nothing you can say that would make me think otherwise that all that was built on .com is at jeopardy of being marginalized as a secondary activity/focus for your company.
I think the reason for the mass exodus although not all encompassing is largely that these individuals do not agree with this direction and do not think you can tackle the goliths of Coinbase, Bitpay, &amp; Blockchain.info
How do you plan on maintaining retail order flow on your exchange if you aren't pushing the trading platform further ? The market maker isn't going to trade with himself if he doesn't have retail flow.

I like how BitMEX is coming together and  and I think there is a lot of promise going forward -- with that said the difficult balance I believe is where you are going to get the flow from for those institutional clients ? I presume they don't want to trade against themselves and need active retail essentially -- currently active retail in BTC is addicted to the high leverage platforms like OKC and I don't really forsee that changing until BitMEX is able to offer the same kind of leverage. It the biggest sticking point IMO

I don't see anyone from OKCoin or Bitfinex on here -- considering they are the largest exchanges and most heavily used by traders it would interesting to get such leaders in from the trading side of things on -- ones that have proven themselves with their user base.

I think it is more around the idea that they could use BTC as the vehicle -- not buy and hold but to get it out of the country and convert into other fiat currencies. That might not be the idealist wet dream but even as vehicle we can see rapid price appreciation

fair points -- I have only seen the interviews and interactions on here so I have to admit where my personal experience with him has its limits. But there are some other people that at the very least share my viewpoint on the kind of spam nature in which he is pushing bitcoin.com even if he isn't doing that intentionally

yeah I figured you threw in some funny chinese saying in there -- I didn't bother translating it because it is not relevant to the discussion

Well you started the arrogant assumption that somehow if you can't even manage 3.3:1 then surely no other human being is capable because you are of course so "smart" and you weren't even able to do that amount. So everything else exceeding that is bad/evil/impossible etc just because you can't.

How about those Chinese exhanges ;)
@_date: 2015-10-11 14:41:30
Yeah I don't necessarily disagree with what your points there. However there is what bitcoiners "hope" for and what reality is -- the reality is that Bitcoin really isn't anything that special -- a new asset class sure, a great payment method for everyday commerce not so much, but two clear undeniable use cases of BTC are for gambling/speculation and the purchase of drugs. 
There is a lot of money in those sectors and I think the expectations of growth potential should be applied to those industries rather than fucking online tipping or getting Chipotle to "accept Bitcoin"
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:43:26
yes totally -- counterparty risk is very real
@_date: 2015-10-29 23:18:23
well that is probably because you go all-in like most these bitcoin idiots. You have to learn how to use leverage appropriately.

And your point ? What is wrong with profiting on other people's losses ? The act of creating sentiment and betting against is nothing new -- I am from the Floor and have seen the whites of the eyes of those I have taken money from and felt them quiver as their badge didn't scan the next day -- I am machvellian in the purest sense -- if you understand the reference then no more needs to be said

they have a daily maintenance period where they go down for 5 minutes that is posted in their instrument list of tradeable times. Also the spread is less than 1broker now so not sure why that is being contest as of course as things become more volatile so does the spread. They do say **up** to 24 hours but rarely takes more than 2-3 hours.

where did I ever say "predict the future" ? I even made sure to add breakout/breakdown as that is what happens after compressing range consolidation. TA is NOT about "predicting" it is about exposing capital at defined risk reward setups nothing more nothing less -- I have no ego to stroke about "rightness" either it is a profit or a loss and on to the next setup so no need to bastardize your idea what technical trading is.

Ben thanks doing an AMA -- why do you think doing an AMA on different forum is good idea ? Especially when this post is dedicated to telling people to go elsewhere for what we have all come to know and love with Reddit AMAs

no it is an **assumption** based on your myopic viewpoint -- you are making assumptions based on an assumed model -- but that isn't my model or trade strategy. I could easily say to you I am introducing a cross margin pairs trade long/short and your again **assumed** model is garbage, NA or does not apply. I worked for an HFT firm and understand quantitative finance quite well so don't think you can throw around the "oh I work at bank" bullshit. You don't have the slightest clue about my strategy so don't assume. End of discussion

Well I disagree though -- shorting is integral to price discovery -- Bitcoin idealists/purists might object but speculation and the outing of information will help move BTC from niche to mainstream.
There still remains quite a bit of risk that Bitcoin will fail to cross the chasm and be stuck as a niche industry
