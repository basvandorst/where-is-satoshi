I transferred funds to coinbase first (bank transfer) and moved them to GDAX and did limit order for free.
You can do wire transfer if you doesn't want to wait.

Are there general guidelines how much transaction cost will be? I tried to move 0.01 BTC from GDAX to my Paper Wallet address. 
Here's the breakdown. Looks like I was charged about 7.8% as a fee. Is there a way to know this before making the transfer?
**Total Input**	0.0111 BTC
**Total Output**	0.01024234 BTC
**Fees**	0.00085766 BTC

Thanks. I tried to do that, but the app was always saying insufficient funds. Lesson learned I guess for $2.5.

Is there an app or service that sends alert if I receive 
 or spent money from my bitcoin address?

I did the bank transfer (ACH takes 3 days) - this is pulling from GDAX account.
I also transferred via wire transfer (available in 3-5hrs) directly to GDAX from my bank.

I have following leftover BTC in a wallet (blockchain.info) after transferring rest of the BTC to the paper wallet. How do you clean the wallet when transferring to other?
**wallet1**: 0.00000678 BTC
**wallet2**: 0.0001234 BTC
Looks like I can't do anything about now... I would like to learn how to 0 wallets when sending BTC; Can't afford multiple leftovers like this.

Hello all; just found about this sub. 
I have been hearing about Bitcoin a lot and obviously would like to get involved. This question might have been asked many times.
What exchange most of you use? I would like to start small (Maybe $10K or 1BTC). Any guidance helps! All I want is grow with Bitcoin and use the secure exchange.
