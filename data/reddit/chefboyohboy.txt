Not available in Canada 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:05:21
I'd love some. PM me please 
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:20:16
I see what you did there. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 21:19:44
What I meant really, was if they don't go on sale until Tuesday, how are people placing ask orders? They wouldn't be able to have the coins, so they are placing ask orders for coins they don't have. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 19:48:15
You've been a changetipping baller this past week! Kudos. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 21:02:16
Thanks for clarifying that. Also, if they are not on sale until Tuesday, how are there asks already in the BTC/DIV book?
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:48:07
TANSTAFFL friend. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:16:43
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:34:17
Bahaha. I actually lolled. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 14:44:31
Gtfo man! 
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:20:13
Any relation to the agora darkmarket? 
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:52:08
If you're in the GTA, the ATM at Bitcoin decentral in Toronto (King/Spadina) has zero markup 
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:58:09
You can't really day trade per say on VOS though, the lack of volume kinda inhibits that. I do use it however, its great for getting money into and out of the markets, but for trading I go elsewhere
@_date: 2014-06-20 21:37:09
That doesn't make any sense. I can't go and place ask orders for a coin I don't have. I understand opening up the bid book, so on Tuesday the coins can be released for sale and those with bids in the book can be filled (well the first 5000), but why allow early asks? 
@_date: 2014-05-22 14:36:10
Ah, but you arn't factoring in risk to any of your calculations. You pay the bank fees to take on risk. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:28:13
Never had a problem. Have done over 500 trades on cryptsy. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:02:10
Nice try Danny Brewster. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:56:26
Will be ordering. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 18:44:59
Very illegal. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:39:52
It was a good feeling. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:42:29
Still saying not available in your country for me. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 09:56:08
Not too sure about that one. I have only used the Decentral one, which when I did it was 20$ cheaper than VOS 
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:23:16
AW yeah hhhh
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:43:33
Being Canadian makes me sad. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:40:53
So far, 25 boxed of girl guide cookies, a T-shirt and some wine
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:28:21
Agreed, although that lack of liquidity can't create some great arbitrage opportunities sometimes ;)
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:12:16
Trading bitcoin CFDs is risky as fuck. Tread carefully unless you seriously know what you are doing.
@_date: 2014-09-03 16:28:23
Yup just got mine! Watched my $10.00 to to $9.97 then to $10.02 
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:09:40
Welcome the best unregulated finical services market in the world. You should give me your BTC so I can keep them safe. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:48:42
Lol someone be mad. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:58:50
VOS has been going down the tubes for a while now. There is no way that they are making money, the volume simply isn't there. I have reached out to them on several occasions, offering to help get them back on the right track, evertying goes unanswered. Such a shame, I used to have a great relationship with them. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 02:52:03
Because there are sell orders in the book 
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:17:15
We love em when the price goes up, hate em when it goes down. R/bitcoin

Ah shit. May I be doomed to mine moon ice forever. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:44:30
Agreed, its scary times up here. Just starting my first career job, and realising I won't really be able to afford living anywhere close to work. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 16:24:00
Anyway to change the percentage range for above/below? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:58:41
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:41:23
Well its great to have you aboard. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:40:15
Bitcoin Paranoid does the same thing as well
@_date: 2014-10-10 11:14:54
Rock on 
@_date: 2014-06-21 03:14:42
Go to BTC/DIV ; yeah idk, it's probably not that big of a deal I guess. I just don't know why they would open up the ask side for it until Tuesday. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 20:54:04
~~So if I hold 10 coins I can expect 0.2168 btc/day?~~ clarified below by @_date: 2014-05-24 20:14:51
God damn. You're making it way to easy for me to pour money into coins. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:59:09
What's up with the $300/month for herbs ? 
@_date: 2014-10-10 11:17:22
Hold on my popcorn isn't done popping 
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:47:33
All mine are on cryptsy/vault of satoshi. Yikes. In going on vacation for a week, and my plan is to cold storage them up when I get back home. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 22:59:19
Took a page right out of Trackr's book. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:31:54
Its a legitimate business, they gotta cover their asses. It sucks but that's the way of the road. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 17:42:15
Haha that's what I figured. Awesome. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:12:57
What VOS really needs is a market maker. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:57:18
Ah okay. Thanks, yeah I guess that would be considered to be re-mined. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:09:57
I would assume that they don't intend to provide this service out of the kindness of their heart. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:05:03
That's not a problem, its called economics. Someone's gotta lose 
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:06:30
Shut up and take my 0.02% transaction fee.
