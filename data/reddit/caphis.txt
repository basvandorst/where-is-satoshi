I think I'm confused on how limit orders work. If buy orders have to be made below current market value, how does the market value ever increase?

So in a hypothetical- person A sets a stop order to sell .00000001 BTC at $500,000; person B sets a stop order to buy .00000001 BTC at $500,000. This trade could execute, but wouldn’t affect the market/“last trade” price, thereby manipulating the price?

And now I understand. Thank you!

Makers pay 0% in fees.

What if I opened a limit order to sell for the same?

25% of it has been eaten away in under 5 hours, during a period when most of the US is asleep. Looks good to me.

The east coast of the US is waking up; the sell wall will crumble shortly. It’ll move then.

But market orders process at the current price, not above it, right?

Ah, that makes sense. So if I had a limit sell of $200,000, it wouldn’t fill for quite some time.
So if I, for example, had 1 BTC, and there was someone willing to buy it at $100,000, there would be no way to execute that trade immediately on the exchange? I assume not, since doing so would manipulate the price almost immediately.

So there would be no way to, say, post a limit order to buy, but only when it goes up to $18,000? Not that I can imagine a reason why anyone would do that.

If this is just one person (and the fact that this same game has now been played twice in a row), he’s positioned himself quite well to bank half a mil a day. Sell a block at 17,250, watch the price struggle the next day in the mid 16’s as folks panic sell, buy them back up cheap, rinse, repeat. If he isn’t just liquidating, then he’s set to bank quite a bit from doing close to nothing. Kudos to him.

Making more sense now. Thanks!

You post the order for $17249.95; whoever buys it from you pays the fees. You pay nothing as the maker.
You can post a buy order for a cent or two above current trading price; you won’t pay anything in fees when someone sells it to you at that price.
Whoever posts the order is the maker, and you pay no fees as long as it doesn’t fill immediately.
