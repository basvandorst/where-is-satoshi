Anyone having issues with GdaX, keep saying " BTC trading not yet available in your region".

 Guys, noob here.. when u buy Bitcoin from coinbase using your bank account ( 2-3 days to transfer) do you get locked on the current Bitcoin price? or u get the BC price 2-3 days later? Trying to save on fees
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:28:23
Unfortunately true.. IAM gonna hodl, I can wait few more days I hate to sell at lost..
