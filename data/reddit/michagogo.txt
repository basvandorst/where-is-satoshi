Note that this is just the first release candidate, and may well have bugs or other problems. So, use at your own risk, but if you are able to test it out that would be very helpful. You can build and test, or you can download binaries at  and test those.
**Reminder:** Always check the signatures on any binaries that you run! On bitcoin.org, you'll find a signature file called SHA256SUMS.asc signed by and you can find signatures from multiple people building the binaries independently at 
If you do want to compile your own binaries, on Linux it's a pretty standard `./autogen.sh&amp;&amp;./configure&amp;&amp;make` (with options that can be passed to configure and make as usual). You can install dependencies as system packages, with some tips in [build-unix.md]( If you want to build your own dependencies, and/or you want to build for other platforms (e.g. Windows), you can easily (cross-)compile the dependencies and Bitcoin Core itself, using the [depends system]( which will take care of everything, including downloading the different sources, with one command, giving you a prefix that's ready to be plugged into configure. You'll just need to install the relevant compiler/build tools for the platform you're looking to build, e.g. `sudo apt-get install g++-mingw-w64`, etc.
On a clean install of Ubuntu Precise, I needed to install the following packages to get the cross-compilation working for 64-bit Windows: `git g++-mingw-w64 autoconf libtool`, as well as `nsis` to create the installer. YMMV on different systems and for different targets.

No, I don't think so. It's saying, in general, that once the databases are built etc, the raw data (even without pruning) isn't touched, except for the purposes listed there. In other words, because it's only used for those purposes, it's safe to delete it.
@_date: 2014-12-24 10:08:31
It's not a flag -- it's a different git repository. If you already have the bitcoin repository cloned, you should be able to check out the tip of the pruning branch with this command: `git fetch origin pull/4701/head:pruning &amp;&amp; git checkout pruning`

Release notes are [here](
Note that despite what it says there, the binaries are not yet available to download -- that is still waiting for more people to build the release with the deterministic builder and submit their results. However, the binaries for v0.9.3rc2 are available, and are the same for Windows and Linux. A fix was made between rc2 and this version to the way the OS X codesigning is done, so OS X users should definitely wait for the final release binaries.

That's just the source code. You can build your own executables, or if you want I could go and get the ones I built. Note that you shouldn't just trust those binaries! You should always verify them.

Sure, it does, given infinite time. It's all a matter of probability. 51% is not a magic threshold. It's a slightly better chance of getting a block than, say, 49%. In the short term, you will have lucky and unlucky streaks. I'm probably not explaining this in the best way possible, so if something is unclear, try reading IRC logs or comment history.

All the release binaries (for Linux, Windows, and OS X) are built on Linux, using a tool called [gitian]( Basically, that tool is used to create a clean environment, either a VM (using KVM) or LXC, that is then reused for each build, allowing for determinism in the build. The process used for releases (approximately) is located in [doc/release-process.md]( That assumes that you already have Gitian set up (more details about that are available in [Gitian's README]( If you want one set of instructions that you can just follow and (hopefully) will just work, [doc/gitian-building.md]( has instructions for installing a fairly minimal Debian in a Virtualbox VM and setting up Gitian (using LXC) within it. It's not the only way, and not even necessarily the best way, but it's one way to do it. If you already have a machine running Ubuntu, you can just run gitian in that, etc...
If you'd like help with getting builds to work, you can ask for help in IRC, too.
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:33:05
That's not true. All transaction values are integers, and they are in units of satoshis, that is, 0.00000001 BTC. If you send me one bitcoin, you're actually sending me 100,000,000 satoshis. Changing this would be the same, from a protocol standpoint, as increasing the number of bitcoins in existence, because it would be necessary to increase the number of base units. Presumably in such a case, though, software would be changed to call 1 BTC something else.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:51:52
I'm not sure I'd call it a design decision -- I don't think Satoshi was thinking "Oh, I want to allow anyone to change a transaction ID while keeping the same transaction". There are no validation rules (for now) that *prevent* malleability, and so it's possible, but allowing malleability was most likely not a decision made in the design.

@_date: 2014-12-24 00:39:43
RC stands for Release Candidate. It's the version of the software that is put out for testing, etc.
Once an rc is out, it needs to be tested, and usually issues are found that then go through more cycles of fixing, RCing, and so on. Eventually, once an rc is tested enough and has no known problems, that rc becomes the release. For a major release, such as 0.10, there are often multiple rc tags before the release actually happens -- so far, on previous releases, there have been as many as 4 different rcs before the release. Already now, it looks like there will be at least an 0.10.0rc2, since there's a problem with the determinism of the source release tarball.
@_date: 2014-12-28 13:29:19
It's a typo. It's 0.10.0rc1.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:49:01
That's a message in the coinbase field of a block, not a transaction. Transactions do not carry messages.
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:33:20
The same way you would mine any other coin. Either using the built-in CPU solo miner (gen=1, or the setgenerate RPC) or using an external miner, such as BFGMiner.
@_date: 2014-12-24 10:40:54
Well, that's why it says "future" in the release notes :-)
But I'll fix the comment to clarify anyway.
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:28:02
No. [Pruning]( will hopefully be in 0.11.
@_date: 2014-05-09 07:00:07
No, it's not that it was sent to an address Satoshi didn't control. Rather, because of the way it's coded in, and this may be a bug or it could have been intentional, the genesis block doesn't actually exist as a block, and its coinbase transaction also doesn't really exist. It simply can't be spent, even with the key.

How did you initially install Bitcoin-Qt?

@_date: 2014-04-09 11:21:23
No, it wouldn't really. On the protocol level, everything is in integer satoshis. Increasing the number of decimal places would require a hard fork, meaning that every single validating node would be required to upgrade. On the protocol level it'd be the same as increasing the number of bitcoins, and it would need to be carefully planned. One way this could be done is with a cutoff, saying that "as of this block, all utxos are worth 1000 times as much". The problem with that is that older software that hasn't been updated for the change could end up sending 99.9% of its money to fees. Many other methods of such a hardfork would also be problematic in their own ways.

It's not a "switch" in the same way that the switch onto LevelDB in 0.8 was. It's still the same basic DB, the difference being that some things that were always the case in 0.9, such as blocks being in the right order, are no longer the case, and so it's possible that 0.8.x/0.9.x won't be able to handle the database properly once it's been modified/updated by 0.10.

@_date: 2014-12-24 09:52:59
It's not so complicated. There's a guide at 
Basically, it's just a matter of installing the dependencies that are needed, then running a couple simple commands: `./autogen.sh &amp;&amp; ./configure &amp;&amp; make` will give you the default build configuration. If you run `./configure --help` (after `./autogen.sh`), you can see more information on the different options, switches, and flags that you can set to customize the way your build is built.

v0.10.0rc3 has been tagged, with a one-line change to the build system to fix determinism.
@_date: 2015-01-12 11:29:14
This is pretty much just bug fixes, but anyone dynamically linking OpenSSL 1.0.0p or 1.0.1k will need this to fix the fact that those versions of OpenSSL changed their signature validation code to require strict DER conformity, breaking validation of transactions with malformed signatures (that Bitcoin treats as valid). [Release notes are here.](
Binaries and an update to the PPA will be available soon.
Also, note that if you're using released 0.9.3 binaries, those have OpenSSL 1.0.1i statically linked, and so are unaffected by the OpenSSL bug.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:29:36
Not getting any updates, including security stuff, isn't incentive enough? Is the machine offline or something?
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:03:24
Yes, `make HOST=...` (in the depends dir) is building the dependencies for that target. Then it creates a directory with that name, which you point `configure` at. So you'll need to change it in both places. Also, at this point you should use rc3, and not rc2 (it's a one-line change to the build system)
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:30:29
Right, just that your top-level comment implies that it's "the fully vetted and released version" of 0.10. I *did* make sure to specify in the title that it's for testing.
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:38:48
After `make` is done, there should be executables in src. `ls src/*.exe` should show you what's there, and then you can transfer those to your Windows machine.
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:39:43
Version 0.9.0 doesn't change anything about the transaction *creation* code. It won't create transactions with 10x lower fees. If a transaction qualifies as free, great, but if not, it will still impose the same fee as before.

@_date: 2015-01-12 14:08:04
That depends on what you do with your node. If you're doing anything critical (mining, merchant, huge amounts of money, etc) it's probably safest to wait for the full/final release.

Yes, you can build master this way, just use `git checkout master` rather than `v0.10.0rc3`. (though with a git clone, if you don't specify otherwise, master is the default, so you can just leave it out.)

It was only just tagged, so people are still running builds. If you want to make your own Windows builds, you can pretty easily, thanks to 0.10.0's new depends system, which makes cross-compiling easy. In an Ubuntu machine (I did this on 12.04, but other versions would likely also work):
    sudo apt-get install git g++-mingw-w64 mingw-w64 autoconf libtool g++
    git clone 
    cd bitcoin
    git checkout v0.10.0rc3
    cd depends
    make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32
    cd ..
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32
    make
You can give configure all the usual arguments/options, with `./configure --help` to list them all. And the same with `make`, you can use e.g. -jn to run n jobs in parallel, etc. And if you want to build for 32-bit rather than 64, just replace x86_64 with i386.
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:38:22
No, `--prefix=/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32` won't work. You can try prepending the absolute path to the current directory. For example, `--prefix=/home/username/bitcoin/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32`. Basically, you need to specify the absolute path of the directory `x86_64-w64-mingw32` that will be created when you run `make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32` in the `depends` directory.

That's actually already done. The builds are done using [Gitian](gitian.org), which is a set of tools for creating reproducible builds. Anyone who wants to can recreate the exact same binaries, and there are several people (including myself) who build them, sign the hashes, and publish them at  See `doc/release-process.md` in the Bitcoin source tree for the instructions to build yourself, if you want to. Note that you'll need to have gitian set up, which isn't too complicated if you're on Ubuntu, and I think there's also a guide in the source tree for setting up a Gitian environment in a Debian VM. Instructions for setting up Gitian outside of the environment set up by that guide are at  For Bitcoin Core, you'll only need 1 VM, Precise amd64.

I'm not familiar with that guide, so I don't know to what extent the instructions are good, but the process should be just about the same for 0.11 as for 0.10, though some of the dependencies may have changed slightly.

The `chainstate` directory contains another LevelDB database, this one is the UTXO set.

This is a bugfix release. The headline fix (and the one which dictated the timing of this release) is the upgrade of the miniupnp library, to patch a vulnerability that could allow an attacker on the local network to crash Bitcoin Core nodes. Additionally, UPnP is now disabled by default in order to guard against other potential undiscovered vulnerabilities. If you're behind NAT and wish to accept incoming connections, it can be reenabled, or you can activate port forwarding on your gateway.
For those who are for any reason unable or unwilling to upgrade to 0.11, version 0.10.3 has also been released.

In *theory*, there could be some bug that sends coins to an unspendable (or just incorrect) scriptPubKey, or a bug that can make it seem like you've received coins when you haven't, or a bug that sends transactions with massive fees. Not saying that any of this is likely, but bugs can always happen.

By definition, Bitcoin uses secp256k1. If you change that, it's a hard fork, and very arguably not Bitcoin anymore, at least not as it exists now. If you have a problem, take it up with Satoshi.

[Preliminary release notes](
Please remember that as with any prerelease, especially the first of a new major version, you should only test with what you can theoretically afford to lose.

Very unlikely, and *probably* impossible, but that's what the testing is for.

Nice. What was the trick for getting the parts into a working privkey?
@_date: 2013-06-24 21:16:03
In some, but not all, cases you can send a transaction with no fee and have it confirm eventually. However, if a transaction doesn't meet a certain set of criteria (and that can easily happen with a lot of dust) the fee is effectively required. And to answer your question at the end: I would simply try not to accumulate dust.
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:49:38
Except that this doesn't happen with bitcoin on a regular basis. This happened due to the OP using a (not very good) transaction-generating tool wrongly. Compare this, not to accidentally writing a too-large check, but to using buggy accounting software to print out a check or initiate a bank transfer, without double-checking before authorizing the transfer or mailing the check.

If I remember correctly (and it's entirely possible that I'm wrong here), the type of keys that bitcoin uses don't work for encrypting data, they're signature-only.

I hate to break it to you, but P2Pool doesn't have a pool operator who can refund you those fees. P2Pool is a decentralized mining pool, with miners running software that, not too unlike the Bitcoin software, connects to other people running the software to mine bitcoins in a decentralized manner. Those fees have gone out instantly to all the miners mining on that pool -- if you look at the coinbase transaction, 3178271edbc74f77eb507415e130d7ddd72cd2bb1f6817a2a4101c9d9c51e90c, you'll see that those bitcoins have been distributed to hundreds and hundreds of different outputs.

At least in terms of power, ignoring the fact that ASICs are useless for anything else, I would not be at all surprised if Bitcoin miners did constitute the most powerful computer network. Now, we don't have an exaflops that could be used for other things, thanks to ASICs, but we do have the equivalent of an exaflops of power. Visa wouldn't need to be more powerful, because while it may be true that they have more transaction volume, they don't have the blockchain. We're running about a hundred trillion hashes every SECOND.

I have all 7 parts. The key doesn't seem to be valid. Are the parts in order?

The idea is that the transaction is given to the merchant, and then it's the merchant's responsibility to get the transaction mined, whether that's broadcasting it, or contracting OOB with a miner, or any other way of getting it into the blockchain -- the idea *isn't* that the transaction doesn't get mined, it's just that the user shouldn't be responsible for staying online to rebroadcast or otherwise ensure that the transaction gets mined.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:47:53
This is exactly right. This transaction was crafted with  That, essentially, *is* the raw transaction API from bitcoind, with auto-population of the inputs field. With no warning or indication that this is what it is. Personally, I find it easy to use and convenient, but I know how dangerous it is and I know to manually inspect the transaction before it goes anywhere. I've seen it sometimes silently add a change output back to the address derived from the privkey, but other times it doesn't do that and ends up with fees. That site *really* needs big red warnings, and maybe a Bitcoin aptitude test before it will let you use it.
@_date: 2013-06-25 18:18:28
In this particular case, I didn't mean dust as in the sub-5460-satoshi outputs that are no longer relayed by default, but rather "a large amount of small transactions".
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:34:28
This is another case of services being named something with a different meaning causing confusion. The problem here isn't that OP used "a brainwallet", rather (s)he used "brainwallet", the site. It's the same kind of phenomenon that causes people to complain that "their transaction is in the blockchain but their wallet says 0 confirmations", when all that happened is that it appeared on blockchain.info.

It's not that OP was using "a brainwallet" -- as far as I can tell, they used  That site (or page on the site) is poorly designed, and doesn't have enough warnings that you're basically hand-crafting transactions and you need to double-check all the details of the transaction prior to broadcasting it.

Yeah, just tried about every variant of that I could think of. Doesn't seem to be quantum computers either.
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:03:16
It's not that the software (website) is buggy, it's just poorly designed and the OP wasn't paying enough attention. brainwallet.org/ is not a wallet, it's a mostly-manual transaction creation tool, and such tools can be dangerous if used incorrectly or if you don't know what you're doing.
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:21:11
Observe the page.

And of course this wasn't even wallet software. It's a semi-manual transaction crafter.
