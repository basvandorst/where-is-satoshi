Do you have any idea how easy it is to spoof a MAC address? Recording them is pointless because any 12 year old with half a brain and 30 minutes can figure out how and implement the change using google. Using MAC addresses to track people is generally an awful idea.

I've been saying it since I was a kid, and I feel it bears repeating now. Don't piss off a bunch of hackers, ever. They will hide in the shadows and scheme instead of attacking you back directly, until such a time that you realize you've already lost the game and they've infiltrated your organization at every level and it's to late. This is how I feel they see Bitcoin today, especially after J.P. Morgan failed to get a patent on the idea, but because of their stubborn conservatism the ones with the most power to threaten Bitcoin will be the ones who hold out the longest and fall the hardest when Bitcoin, or a successor, replace the old order.

yea you're not gonna get very far mining bitcoin on that card, better off probably looking at a scrypt coin if you want to mine anything on it, and then selling them for bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:19:35
That and with cost to entry for long haul investors being decently low still both for miners, and people wanting to dump money into whole coins, it's an attractive entry to cryptocurrency where bitcoin may seem intimidating, too expensive, or too hard to mine for anyone who doesn't have a bucket of cash to shell out for a high performance ASIC
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:10:23
its the hashing algorithm used. There's a lot more coins than juts bitcoin, many based on bitcoin's SHA256 algorithm, for which there are high performance ASIC miners you can buy that are a far better deal in terms of price/performance (both in $ per gigahash and how much power it takes to generate said performance). There are also other coins, based on litecoin's Scrypt algorithm which doesn't currently have ASICs available yet and is mostly just mined on GPUs, like what you would be running. you'd make a lot more money in a shorter time plugging your mining performance stats into  and seeing what coins are worth mining right now for you. dogecoin has been doing really well recently for short term turnover (buying the coins and immediately selling them to bitcoin) but it just suffered a technical breakdown that has been fixed, and the difficulty has dropped as people have temporarily stopped mining, and the price is starting to go back up rapidly. Now would be an opportune time to mine and save for a little bit to see where the price goes.

It didn't, I was just annoyed, hence the apology after the fact.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:55:30
Though I didn't ask for the help, you just provided me with a lot of info I was about to search for myself. I feel bad I have no bitcoin to tip with yet as I've been keeping all my holdings (from mining) in doge. Still, their value's been going up fast. You gave me the info I needed for when my ASIC gets here this week to get secure and get set up once I replace this goddamned iphone 4 I have which is stuck on a 2 year old update because I refuse to make it even more unsecured than it already is.

i was implying that all the methods you listed could be assassinations made to look like accidents. for instance if you inject someone with a massive dose of insulin they will have a heart attack and by the time they get to toxicology screening the tissue will have metabolized the insulin even if the person died instantly. I don't need to explain "accident" and "overdose". "suicide" is a bit trickier though

yea he did a really good job of hiding his true interest, promoting bitcoin, while still ragging on the guy he didn't agree with in the process fabulously. Very much impressed

This is inspiring for me to hear. I'd feared that I got into the cryptocurrency game to late, but I managed to get in before most of Wall Street so I have that going for me. We all do now really. 
My question though, is what do you think is best for people who want to invest long term? Right now many new players who want to mine are buying in via other coins which have lower difficulty to mine and higher early returns, but I feel like many of these coins don't hold any long term value because if their proof of work is that good, then the features will get implemented into bitcoin (or litecoin now, for scrypt coins), and the proof of work coin will slowly shift their holdings in some form to the top players. Do you think, given the cost of a serious mining setup, that it might be better in the long term to just buy coins when the market is low and wait for them to go up, or support the infrastructure directly and hope to recoup your investment in hardware long term? Keep in mind that the mining hardware for scrypt has resale value to people besides miners (gamers, HPC and distributed computing applications for starters), so some of the startup cost can be recouped via regular upgrades to stay current, or if you opt to liquidate your hardware once you've amassed a proper size wallet, you can use that income to reinvest back into coins directly at a later date. someone should really make an app for this

So they will get hit with a class action suit like BFL is about to be (they just lost a court case setting precedent on the issue, by not showing up to court at all), and they'll get put out of business. These companies need to stop fucking with their customers, especially considering how many have become rich and possibly powerful from mining coins alone.
@_date: 2014-01-08 12:30:56
True, but with time this could change as well. Remember LTC just saw a MASSIVE growth spurt recently with it directly affecting the cost of video cards being used to mine it. As install bases increase the network hashrate will continue to grow just as it did with BTC, and as more of the scrypt altcoins flop out or are integrated into LTC somehow, the people mining will switch their hardware back onto the original network. I'd expect once 22nm GPU parts come out we'll see a huge boost on that side, with 22nm capacity possibly not being available with SHA256 ASIC until later given who gets early access to the best fab tech. When those cards hit market there will be another huge growth for sure if the market stays stable

looks like they just confirmed the specifics of the policy in the thread i posted again and they're different than they used to be. the only thing they wont help with is configuring things like riser rigs or other ways of making the boards run more cards than they are meant to and things like that, or driver setup for non-standard setups and the like which would only be used by miners. if you are having issues with your non overclocked card driver crashing just tell them its crashing in the apps you run (vague as possible) or if the cooler itself gives out then just send it in for that and tell them its not working anymore and they will fix it for you under the assumption that the defective/failed cooler is why the card cooked itself and not because you were mining on it! remember guys the service team cannot tell what software was run on the card, only whats wrong with it

Integrate to google pay so that sites using it support payment via bitcoin (please don't give them control over what payment options they accept either, any bitcoin resistant companies will try to stop you). Also a browser extension for chrome that allows you to do this on other sites by purchasing visa gift cards for your exact purchase amount and entering the credit card info for you would be awesome.

If MSI is going to accept bitcoin payments they need to start warrantying/supporting bitcoin mining on their hardware. As of right now MSI's forum official policy is counter to this offer MSI is currently making and I recently was denied support by them when I admitted to using a motherboard of theirs to stick miners in, even though the issue i was asking for support on (cpu support) was unrelated and I own no MSI video cards. 
Here's the thread for anyone wondering the details. 
From one of the users who did kindly respond posting the forum policy (which i failed to read because mining isn't an illegal activity), " DO NOT: Ask for help on shady or illegal activities such as password hacking, software piracy, or bitcoin/crypto mining
Would MSI like to clarify their policy on this officially now?

They're still extremely popular yes, and they're making JNCOs again and kikwear also did a re-launch event a few years ago before JNCO which was a sell out hit.

Given they used to produce their own PCs for years till they realized just how much it was hurting them vs buying from Intel or AMD and using windows, I doubt they'd do much better now

this is the truth. especially with LSD, which most intelligent minded people will put on blank white blotter. it will be blatantly obvious based on its size what it is to anyone specifically looking, but if you, say, package it in a book as a place marker with a note about "Reading the marked section" and an accompanying letter, no one will ever look the wiser. seen people send it this way before many times. the books get passed around in those circles as vessels, and the page used is typically going to get reused for ages to come as well since some transfer can occur and using the same page reduces loss
