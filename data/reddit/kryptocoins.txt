Sorry for your loss.
You can't sue them for giving their customers the freedom to decide if they want to implement 2 factor authentication.
Nevertheless the PIN issue is important. Perhaps the hacker hacked also your PC and stole the PIN. Or you received it on an email that was in your inbox. In these cases you won't be able to do much against the exchange.
But if you had the PIN written on paper the hacker couldn't steal it. If he brute forced the PIN because it had only a small number of digits made only of numbers or letters chosen by them and their security system didn't detect the attempts to guess the PIN you can sue them.
The exchange not controlling if the IP is from the same country is also a flaw. Email providers do this.
The main point is the PIN. You have to figure out how the hacker got it. If he got it inside their system you can try to sue them for a part of your money.
If the exchange is innocent (or not) you should act against the hacker, but it won't be easy. He most likely used a proxy. I can give you details in private message since the hacker probably is reading this. I created this new account also because of this.

You'll need the exchange's cooperation but don't believe anything they tell you without evidence. A search shows that this Rock Trading has a scam accusation and its representative posted things no trustworthy exchange would post [
