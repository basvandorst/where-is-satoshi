Checks and money orders could easily be stopped, they're just paper that tells the receiving bank to talk to the sending bank. I'm sure they get cancelled all the time due to AML junk. Cash, sure. But who is going to trust sending $200 in cash via the mail?
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:22:54
Sorry, I mean if two people are transacting. Say I want to rip you off, so I build an identical looking device that shows an address with 20 BTC on it, but when the tab is broken does nothing, because my fake version never had or made a private key.

Sure, but even if that malleability fix works for LN in theory, the code still has to be adapted to craft transactions that are valid with their new style of doing things. What bcash developers are even working on that? The one guy who maintains their reference client (BitcoinABC)?

This can't be overstated. For example, there are things we view as central to Bitcoin that _aren't even in the whitepaper_, such as the 21 million coin limit. While it does talk about how new coins are created (section 6, Incentive) it doesn't talk about what the cap should be or how it should tapper off.

If your connection isn't that stable, just set your `to_self_delay` for your channels to give you 8 days for a unilateral close. Then you're ok, even if your connection is only 98% reliable (down for up to 7.3 days _a year_).

@_date: 2018-01-24 16:20:56


Nope, you can trustlessly outsource enforcement of the channel to a 3rd party. They will have 0 control of your funds and can only broadcast the justice transaction if the counter-party in your channel attempts to cheat.
You could even have _multiple_ trustless 3rd parties doing this.

It's not in the whitepaper but version 0.1 of Bitcoin had some basic mechanisms for payment channels and the concept was originally created by Satoshi. LN is just an expansion on Satoshi's payment channels.
But if we're saying everything not in the whitepaper is bad, we should get rid of the 21 million Bitcoin limit. It's not in the whitepaper after all.

No, bcash (like Bitcoin) has an average block time of 10 minutes. But since this is a poisson distribution the actual time between blocks can often be seconds or hours. No matter how big the blocks get, this fact is inescapable. LN transactions are _actually instant_, and have lower fees than bcash can ever hope. With LN you can send sub-satoshi amounts, true micro payments.

@_date: 2017-12-14 23:01:39
I've been in Bitcoin since 2010 and talking with local, brick and mortar store owners since then. The fact of the matter is that even when the blocks weren't full, it was still a no-go because they wanted things to be confirmed, and that takes a variable amount of time. This was especially true back then because none of them trusted the tech since it was new.
Zero conf has never been secure.

You might not pay fees for certain actions, but you are absolutely paying the bank in one way or another. Banks aren't in the business of providing free services out of the goodness of their hearts.
You're also dealing with currency that is printed at will, and controlled by a central authority. Your bank account can be seized, and your money gets inflated every single day, losing value constantly. The bank and whoever they grant access to, also know where every dollar you have came from and where it went.
Sure it's convenient to use fiat, but it's not private, it's not sound money and _it's never really your's_.

Those bad blocks are also invalid, since they'd be spending an input twice. So each bad block would be a miner giving up 12.5 (+fees) worth of BTC, as these blocks will never be recognized as valid.
Additionally, if someone does decide they want to make one of these blocks (again, at a cost of 12.5+ BTC), it won't be useful as an attack for terribly long, as it'll be orphaned and nodes won't bother processing a block from a shorter tip.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:05:50


And that reward use to be 50 BTC, it gets cut in _half_ roughly every 4 years. It will soon be a very small portion of the income for miners.

The 21M supply cap was written in by Satoshi, in the original client. BIP-42 is simply a _bugfix_ because Satoshi didn't realize there's a bug that would come into play around the year 2214. This bug only exists in versions of Bitcoin client software written in C/C++, and is _clearly a bug_.

I think the idea isn't to stop MITM attacks, but instead to stop wholesale passive traffic analysis (which could be used to determine where a TX came from).
If every connection was secured by swapping public keys, it raises the bar from passive sniffing to active MITM, which is much more difficult to do on a large scale.

That's not how Bitcoin works, the sending party always determines the transaction fee. If you tell them to send 20 bits to your address, then that's how much they send to your address. It's up to them to determine how much to spend on transaction fees.

They should send the "payment received" message as soon as the transaction is seen, and then another e-mail saying "your Trezor is being prepped for shipping" once the confirmations go through.

This is a terrible idea, every single piece of software that creates/signs transactions would have to be updated to switch to segwit-only on some kind of flag day or particular block height (which they might not even be aware of). This would be massively more complex.
Segwit as a softfork is great, because no one needs to update their software immediately or at a particular time. Perhaps sometime in the future, when virtually all transactions are using segwit it would make sense to hardfork and require segwit only. For a smooth and simple deployment it makes way more sense to add a new feature (segwit) and deprecate/discourage non-segwit (e.g. by incentivising segwit over non-segwit txns).
Having a large period of overlap between the two methods means developers can switch to segwit as needed, instead of being forced to prioritize it.

The economic majority is more important, what good is following the miners if all the exchanges/stores don't accept your version?


This is flat out wrong. Writing consensus critical code is not just copy/paste from various clients.


This is only the case if the overwhelming majority of the miners AND the economic nodes agree to the fork.


This is incorrect. If a node is sent a block that fails validation, **it bans the IP that sent it that block for 24 hours**. It doesn't show warnings to the user, the only thing is a line in the debug.log that says it banned a peer for sending an invalid block.


Again, incorrect. Only the nodes that share consensus rules will see that transaction. Nodes that disagree on consensus **ban the nodes they deem invalid**.


I wouldn't follow the longest chain if it imposed rules I disagree with, for example if some kind of AML/KYC requirement was being forced.

Due to the quadratic hashing problem, it's not safe to create blocks greater than 1MB if they are made up of non-segwit transactions. Segwit keeps the limit at 1MB for non-segwit transactions so no one is bumped off the network, while opening the blocksize for segwit transactions which are unaffected by the quadratic hashing problem.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:24:36


This is completely false. Segwit is absolutely an on-chain scaling solution *for anyone who wants to make use of it*. Sure, non-upgraded wallets won't be able to make use of Segwit's scaling, but they wouldn't be able to make use of larger hardfork blocks either, because that also requires an upgrade.

There's also the issue of quadratic scaling of hashing, so a 2x larger block doesn't mean 2x more hashing, it can mean almost 4x more hashing. Which means more CPU and memory usage, as well as increased time before a block can be relayed (since we must validate it first).

Soft forks are actually much safer for a number of reasons. A soft fork allows everyone to upgrade at their leisure, instead of exiling anyone who doesn't agree with the new consensus rules once they take affect. Since there isn't just one implementation of the Bitcoin node software, it's very hard to get everyone using the same consensus rules after a hard fork change. Anyone who gets it wrong, gets forked from the network. Soft forks also greatly reduce the risk of re-orgs, which can easily cause people to lose money.
Hard forks are dangerous and difficult to coordinate. For these reasons I'd like to see a hard fork done **after** segwit, and only if it also addresses a large number of the "wishlist" type issues as well.

Everyone agrees that scaling Bitcoin is important, but Satoshi was not omnipotent and there are things that need to be solved before just opening up the maximum blocksize limit. For example the issue of quadratic hashing of transaction signatures. This means that a block that's twice as big, might take 4 times as long to process. SegWit solves this and allows us to create larger blocks more safely. For this reason SegWit should be considered a hard requirement prior to increasing blocksizes.


SegWit does not make any fundamental changes, it merely moves the signature (witness) data to a separate structure in the block. A fundamental change would be something like changing the PoW.


No one is impartial, everyone has biases. What's more important is looking at the technical merits of a suggestion, not who suggested it.


Hardforking to larger blocks is not safe without solving some of the other issues first, such as the quadratic hashing of transaction signatures I mentioned earlier. The argument that is never occurred before could hold some water, prior to the Ethereum split. What happened to ETH/ETC shows us that if we want to have a hard fork we need to have anti-replay mechanisms in place FIRST, not to mention waiting for near complete consensus (e.g. 95%).


Agreed, SegWit does not solve the scaling issue right now. But it does make it safer to deploy a hard fork with larger blocks later on, and thus should be seen as a necessary first step towards larger blocks.




I don't want to get into the rabbit hole of who said what, as that conversation is solely focused on the past and not on moving forward with improving Bitcoin into the future. It's just not productive to keep rehashing it over and over.




I would agree with this point. Though I would hope that as time goes on the BU devs continue to improve their process.


  It fixes this issue, but it also makes a couple changes to Bitcoins code that gives us some potential scaling options in the future. It also makes some minor changes now that gives us time to implement a new long term scaling solution.
I've probably covered this topic to death with my other replies above.


  A node is what allows normal users to signal their support for a Bitcoin protocol (type of code) which helps to keeps it decentralized, if the block became too big normal people could no longer run a node.




Node counts are actually very important, since there's only a limited number of connections each node can handle. Having more nodes increases the pool of available connection slots for wallets.


I have nothing else to add here.


Eh, I'm less swayed by who said something and more swayed by the merits of what they said, but I suppose this is a useful thing to note.

The only difference between softfork segwit and hardfork segwit is the location of the segwit header and hash.
Since hardforks require *everyone* to upgrade, they present a risk of a long lived fork of the blockchain and subsequent chaos, especially if they trigger a small majority (75%) vs a near unanimous majority (95%). Additionally, since everyone has to upgrade once the new rules take effect, it's a less smooth transition.
With a softfork everyone has the ability to upgrade at their leisure (or not upgrade if they don't need/want to use segwit). Hardfork upgrades aren't impossible, but they are definitely not as smooth and elegant as a softfork.

I've never had performance issues with Linux software raid 5, the data is already in memory usually, making parity calculations super fast.
Where RAID 5 falls down is with larger drives, due to the chance of having an unrecoverable read error (URE) being so high that when one drive fails, another is likely to fail while you rebuild.
Here's the good news though, the blockchain doesn't need to be on a RAID array, because you could just download it again if needed. You only need a RAID (or better yet, a backup) if your connection is really slow. My home internet connection is 75 Mbps, that means at the current blockchain size (~33GB) it'll take me an hour to download it.

In a hard fork:
* All nodes must upgrade, else lose ability to transact at all
* All wallets must upgrade, else lose ability to transact at all
* All exchanges, payment processors, and the hundreds/thousands of sites and services that use BTC must upgrade, generally involving custom programming. Or lose ability to transact at all.
In a soft-fork the only downside to not upgrading is that you don't fully validate the chain until you do, all proper implementations should warn users that a soft-fork they don't understand has been activated. You can still send/receive Bitcoin and you can upgrade when convenient, in order to take advantage of the new features.
A hard fork literally requires everyone to upgrade all at once, on a timetable that may not work for them unless it's planned in advance. And when I say in advance, I mean a year or more. I'm a software engineer and, yes, there are companies that will take that long to get their shit upgraded. With a soft-fork they can simply put a segwit understanding node in front of their exist infrastructure and they get 100% validation without having to immediately upgrade their custom software.
The argument that segwit doesn't help capacity because it will take time for people to upgrade and make use of it is pointless, since *literally everyone* has to upgrade to make use of a hard fork capacity increase. If we want a capacity increase (and a bunch of other useful stuff), right now, all it takes is the miners signaling for segwit. More than half the network supports it, a bunch of wallets either support it or will soon support it.
We could have additional capacity available 2 weeks from **TODAY** if the miners started signaling support.

Segwit is on-chain scaling though, and it's a better/safer version than simply increasing the blocksize. A straight blocksize increase does nothing for enabling additional on-chain scaling like signature aggregation (schnorr signatures) and actually makes bitcoin scale worse due to the quadratic hashing problem.
Segwit solves the quadratic hashing problem, solves malleability, opens the door to signature aggregation and various other on-chain benefits. Yes, it also makes it easier/safer to do layer 2 solutions, but that shouldn't be viewed as a negative.
Also, since segwit transactions don't have the quadratic hashing issue, it makes it safer if down the road we want to do a hardfork increase of the blocksize for segwit transactions. The smart thing to do is activate segwit right now, then in parallel people can research and build the on-chain scaling segwit enables, as well as the off-chain scaling and determining what (if any) hard fork increase is needed to allow for even more segwit transactions.
Also of note, by keeping node resource requirements low, we keep the network healthy by having more people able to run nodes. Remember, every SPV or non-node wallet still has to talk to someone, and the fewer peers, the fewer connections the network can accept.

It makes more sense to deploy it now as a softfork, because as a softfork it doesn't require that **everyone** upgrade immediately.
The problem with hardforks is that it requires everyone to change all at once or risk a fracture of the network. Softforks don't risk a fracture of the network, and allow all users/devs/miners to upgrade at their leisure.
An example of a "softfork" style change is how the TLS protocol evolves over time. Newer, more secure improvements are made, but deployment worldwide takes a long time so the older versions are deprecated and *eventually* removed entirely.
For instance, there are older Android ([4.4.4 and earlier]( devices that aren't capable of using TLS 1.1 and 1.2. Ideally, we'd only be using TLS 1.2, especially since SSL and TLS 1.0 (which are the only things those Android devices support) is no longer considered good enough. But here's the problem, those devices account for [46.3% of all Android devices as of September 2016]( Yes, it would be cleaner to not support these devices, but at the risk of cutting off a large number of users. Eventually we'll cut them off, but if we forced everyone to use TLS 1.3 once it comes out, there will be a LOT of pain.

That only 5% of the nodes would follow. What good is a network that has larger blocks but can only handle ~58k concurrent connections (compared to the current network's ~702k).
Badly done math stuff: A node that accepts incoming connections using the defaults will have on average 117 connection slots, 125 total minus 8 outbound. There are currently around 500 accessible BU nodes, so 500 * 117 = 58,500. The entire network is around 6k accessible nodes, 6000 * 117 = 702,000.

In another comment you said you wanted to solve the transaction maleability issue for all transactions with a hard fork. This is only possible if *every piece of software* upgrades.
Soft-fork segwit: people can upgrade as needed once it's active.
Hard-fork with literally any change: everyone must upgrade all at once or get left behind.
It's hypocritical to be against segwit because not everyone will take advantage of the benefits until they upgrade, but support a hard fork where not everyone *can even use bitcoin* until they upgrade.

Segwit achieves part of it's scaling by increasing the blocksize to 4MB, just in a way that looks like only 1MB to non-segwit nodes.
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:37:15
BU is not simply a blocksize increase, they have added a lot of code specifically to allow miners to choose on the fly how large they want the blocks to be. It's possible to use this mechanism, to launch attacks that edge out other miners.

If you mean that occasionally the mempool might become completely clear for brief periods of time (e.g. holidays, sustained power outage over a large area, etc), then I agree with you. But I think the backlog will always come back, because if there's space miners will accept transactions that pay _virtually any amount_ of fee, thus filling the block back up as people go "oh hey, I can store my ____ files for just ___ satoshis/byte!".
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:48:46
Short term there may be a drop in total fee revenue, due to less competition for blockspace. Long term, segwit enables LN which allows us to have safe 0-conf style transactions, removing the last great hurdle to true widespread adoption.
Right now the confirmation time is the single greatest factor stopping merchants from using Bitcoin. They want a payment system that settles quickly and easily, which LN gets us.
We'll see a huge influx of users and those users will need their LN channels to open, close, and fund using fee paying transactions, and there will be so many more. The total fees paid to miners will go up.
When the efficiency of using a resource is improved, the rate of consumption of that resource rises because of increasing demand, this is [Jevons paradox]( Think about how many on-chain transactions are needed to support all those LN channels with their low value cups of coffee transactions, transactions that will never occur on the main chain because of the long settlement time.

If the merchant doesn't want to take the risk on a RBF transaction then you (the consumer) shouldn't have issued a RBF transaction.
In the real world merchants make these kinds of calls all the time. Checks have high rates of fraud, but many merchants still accept them and factor that risk into their pricing or require additional info from the customer (ostensibly to prosecute them if there is fraud).

@_date: 2017-03-15 22:12:28




I hope that's not the case. Things like LN would allow us to handle around 500 million users, even with small blocks. That would easily result in a huge spike in demand and thus price, which directly impacts miners especially short term since the block rewards are still the largest part of their income.
Long term, having Bitcoin service hundreds of millions of users (or more) means that transactions to open/close LN will be quite numerous. Sure they won't get transaction fees on every single transaction (just the open/close and standard transactions), but demand that huge will easily outstrip anything we can get with even 32MB traditional blocks. This is because the fundamental limiting factor for mass adoption of Bitcoin is the confirmation times, because we know now that basic 0-conf transactions aren't safe (and never were).

I don't think we have enough data to say that the loss of nodes was caused by the growth in transaction data (i.e. correlation/causation).

Blocksize != scalability. For instance Bitcoin has an issue with the time it takes to validate transactions, this means that a block twice the size of the current max won't take twice as long to validate, it can take almost four times as long!

It's not SegWit vs Bitcoin transactions, both are Bitcoin transactions. SegWit enabled transactions are just a different format for storing the transaction.

I think what the anti-L2 miners are overlooking is the fact that those L2 transactions _are never going to be on L1_. We know it'll never make sense to do microtransactions or cups of coffee on chain. L2 systems let us make hundreds of those transactions _that would never happen otherwise_ for the low cost of a handful of on chain transactions. And those additional on chain transactions will only exist if L2 exists.
At least L2 gets the miners these channel state transactions, if we go the Bitcoin backed bank route (as Satoshi and Hal assumed would happen), those small/microtransactions will still happen, but with no/few accompanying on chain transactions.

So an attacker just sends two 1MB transactions...
Bandwidth _is_ an issue as well. Please stop trying to be divisive. If I say "the issues with [blah] are [x], [y], and [z]" and then someone else says "the issues with [blah] are [y], [x] and [z]" that doesn't mean one of us is lying or calling the other a liar.
Edit: Specifically you asked about "standard" blocks, which I assume means blocks that can take more than 1MB of traditional non-segwit transactions. This is unsafe, due to the quadratic hashing issue. SegWit allows for blocks as large as 4MB overall (likely around 2.1 MB in practice), which are no worse than the current 1MB blocks from the standpoint of the quadratic hashing issue. Basically, since 1MB seems safe today, it'll be safe under SegWit.
In short, 1MB blocks are fine, larger blocks are not, _unless they solve the quadratic hashing issue_. After that, there's reasonable research that shows up to 4MB of blockdata should be safe on the network.
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:14:22
For Opt-In RBF, yes. The previous iterations of RBF were not opt-in, and there was no way to determine if a transaction would be replaced.
Personally I'm ok with Opt-In RBF, since merchants can simply hold off on processing goods/services (until confirmation) if the user pays them with a RBF enabled transaction. It's a good compromise between how zero-conf transactions have worked since the beginning (where merchants choose to balance risk vs speed) and providing a new feature (RBF).
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:02:14
No, it's been figured out and we'll understood. The issue right now is choosing a way to route payments that meet a number of (sometimes competing) criteria: speed of circuit creation, efficiency and privacy.

I don't know if that 133MB block is taking into account potential future efficiency improvements. For example: signature aggregation (schnorr) and MAST should have positive scaling impacts on the size of complex transactions like HTLC/LN.
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:46:00
EC in this case refers to the implementation of EB/AD controls (and their related effects). It has never been used before, the BU folks picked an intentionally misleading name to make it seem like "this is how the system has always worked".

Bi-directional payment channels are huge, and make it safe for instant and dirt-cheap transactions between two peers (since you only pay to open/close the channel). Once wallets start supporting this, it'll allow actual microtransactions to be possible.

It is indeed harder to find paths when nodes are dropping in and out, but not impossible. There's also an incentive to run a node, to collect (very small) fees, which means plenty of people will run them from home or their business.

@_date: 2017-03-14 04:38:48
That's different than the new "Acceptance Depth" parameter that BU introduces. Satoshi wrote Bitcoin so that any **valid** chain with more PoW becomes the one you use. BU add an additional parameter where you say "I'll consider a chain valid if it's _AD_ blocks longer **even if I currently consider it invalid**".
This is a change to the game theory aspects that underpin Bitcoin and the reason why attacks such as the median block attack are possible under BU.

I think a lot of people will be very happy if BU included SegWit, we could have larger (1.7-2.1MB) blocks ASAP, start getting second layer solutions working on the mainnet (they're working on testnet).
I don't think they'll do it though, since they believe it'll kill the "momentum" of BU.

What happened yesterday in a nutshell is that some users/software that rely on their transaction IDs not changing, had their transaction IDs changed. This negatively impacted their ability to function.
SegWit allows for users/software who do not want their transaction IDs to be able to be changed, to ensure that they can not be changed.
**Using SegWit (which is opt-in) would have completely and fully stopped what happened yesterday, for any user who opts-in.**

There's no need to, BU nodes are currently operating under the same rules as everyone else. They have shot themselves in the foot once before though, when a miner generated a block slightly larger than 1MB. The BU nodes relayed it as they viewed it as valid, their peers saw it as invalid and then blocked them automatically for 24 hours.

@_date: 2017-03-09 19:13:36
Most of us who got into Bitcoin early, did so because it's a system that's resistant to censorship, fixed issuance (unlike fiat) and easily transferable without risk of reversal.
It was pretty well known, even back then, that Bitcoin would probably never be good for cups of coffee (or as I remember one particular conversation, vending machines). We know now, that the best way is using smart contracts such as LN to make "safe 0-conf transactions".
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:52:45
Yeah, I don't view this as explicit or implicit support for Core/SegWit (and I say that as a Core/SegWit supporter). It seems to me that the statement is basically "we don't support contentious hardforks taking the BTC symbol, and won't list them if they don't have basic safety mechanisms". Which is a perfectly reasonable stance.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:52:06
This will further drive centralization, because merchants will just rely even more on services to handle Bitcoin payments (and looking for doublespends) for them.

My bad, looks like it's 97% now ;)
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:18:00
I think LN will actually increase the income for miners. In the short term because additional users of Bitcoin bring the price up, which makes the block rewards worth more. And in the long term because those LN channels have to be opened and closed, and those users will still need traditional transactions when moving larger amounts.
Basically LN = debit/credit cards, traditional Bitcoin transactions = ACH. Most people (in the US anyway) get their salary/income paid via ACH, they pay their bills (banks usually call it ebill) via ACH or checks. But they buy their cups of coffee with a debit card.

Which Core devs are supporting UASF?
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:29:11
No, what we need is:
1. Deploy segwit (immediate increase in transaction throughput)
2. Evaluate how the larger blocks impact the network
3. Deploy hardfork to increase segwit transaction space to whatever research shows is a safe size.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:46:27
By design Core makes it trivially easy to set which softforks you support when generating block templates with getblocktemplate.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:50:25


It is, but it isn't. 


There seems to be a misunderstanding here. It's estimated that the total block size (witness+transactions) will be 1.7MB to 2.1MB. The max allowed is 4MB. It doesn't mean that 2.1MB block is actually 4MB.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:35:01
Lightning network fees will likely be very low, since it will be a nearly perfectly competitive market.
As for on-chain fees, I think LN will encourage massive user adoption (for reasons I've mentioned in a bunch of other comments), which will cause the overall fees paid per block to go up.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:20:24
It is a miner takeover though. They'll be in full control of the blocksize cap, with everyone else having 0 say in the matter.
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:52:55
Literally anyone can run a LN node and compete. Fees will be very low, not really much money to be made.

If we have to wait for "politically clean" code it'll be a long time before we can get _anything_ done.
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:28:04
LN will allow us to scale Bitcoin to hundreds of millions of users, and that increased demand will see the price skyrocket.
It's also worth noting that LN is really only good for low value transactions, the kind that are likely never going to be done as traditional transactions due to confirmation time. Merchants want fast and deterministic settlements, which LN gets us. So due jevons paradox, while the cost of an individual transaction will go down, the demand for transactions will go up. The cumulative transaction fees per block will increase.
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:08:54
BU isn't active yet, so they don't have control of the cap. If for some reason the network goes that route, they will have control. I thought it was obvious we were talking about what could happen if BU was the dominant software.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:46:43
Here's a breakdown I did that excludes SPV/mobile nodes:
Software | Count | Percentage | Notes
Core (SegWit) | 22,615 | 72.09% | 0.13.1 and higher
Core (Non-SegWit) | 6986 | 22.27% | 0.13.0 and lower
Unlimited | 978 | 3.12% | 
Classic | 386 | 1.23% | 
Knots (SegWit) | 317 | 1.01% | 0.13.1 and higher
XT | 71 | 0.23% | 
Knots (Non-SegWit) | 19 | 0.06% | 0.13.0 and lower
Note: I count all the Unlimited/Classic/XT nodes for this, since the outdated ones seem to be few and far between and those would probably work reasonably well under the hardfork conditions. Just be advised that it does skew the numbers _very slightly_ in the favor of Unlimited/Classic/XT nodes. I also did not count non-standard versions of Core as being SegWit ready (even if they were), such as Satoshi:0.13.99, since it's difficult to tell if they support SegWit from the version string alone.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:03:48
To be clear, if anyone is able to reproduce the issue without editing the page/image I'll retract my statement.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:11:05
1) You're one of the BU devs? TIL
2) There is no 1MB camp, we all want greater transaction throughput and larger blocks. SegWit gives us blocks up to 4MB in size (~2MB in practice). Which is an immediate benefit, not to mention the additional benefits later on like schnorr signatures/signature aggregation. Outside of maybe Luke, I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone who wants to stay at 1MB blocks forever.
3) The economic incentive for LN is that it allows for more people to use Bitcoin and allows for safe 0-conf style transactions. Those LN channels have to open, close, and fund using fee paying transactions, and there will be sooooo many more. The total fees paid to miners will go up. When the efficiency of using a resource is improved, the rate of consumption of that resource rises because of increasing demand, this is [Jevons paradox]( Think about how many on-chain transactions are needed to support all those LN channels with their low value cups of coffee transactions, transactions that will never occur on the main chain because of the long settlement time.
4) I'm trying my best to avoid name calling, I'd appreciate it if you'd do the same.

Core is not against larger blocks, SegWit allows for blocks up to 4MB (that appear at most as 1MB to non-SegWit aware nodes), and that in practice will be around 1.7 to 2.1MB.

SegWit allows blocks up to 4MB in size.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:26:52
Somewhat related, but I'm actually a bit excited for the idea of BitcoinEC, since it allows us move forward and hopefully have a more productive, less hostile and less convoluted debate.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:59:33
The Acceptance Depth (AD) is a configuration setting in BU for the number of blocks after which the node/miner will accept blocks larger than their Excessive Block (EB) value. So if you set an EB of 1 MB and an AD of 6, you will not recognize a chain with blocks over 1 MB until it is at least 6 blocks longer than a chain with blocks under 1 MB.
This means that when miners don't universally agree on uniform EB/AD values, it's possible to have a great deal of multi-block reorgs.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:09:01
Possibly the bandwidth costs? I know the miners were initially very concerned about that.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:32:53
SegWit blocks are allowed to be up to 4MB in size, though they will only ever appear to be as large as 1MB to non-segwit ready software. It's a neat trick to get us immediate onchain scaling without any real downsides.
I suspect the reason behind most of the segwit opposition is that they think it means further blocksize increase is impossible, which isn't true. Larger blocks will still be needed after segwit, but down the road. Plus we can couple that hardfork with further enhancements that have been on the "wish list".

This is what we (early adopters) signed up for, a system beyond the control of governments. Would it be ideal for Bitcoin to be able to handle every single low value transaction, absolutely! But we suspected then, and we know now, that on-chain transactions will never be feasible if we want everyone in the world to use Bitcoin.
The good news, is that due to the awesome foresight of Satoshi, he/they designed Bitcoin transactions as _scripts_ and not simply as ledger updates. So some very smart people have figured out a way to craft Bitcoin transactions/scripts that allow us to scale Bitcoin to the point where everyone can use it, for any value of transfer, without having to store all of that data on the blockchain forever. Basically, stuff people use debit/credit cards for today will be on the LN, while things you use ACH/SWIFT/wires will be non-LN.
Think about it. We are _this_ close to having a Bitcoin system where 0-conf instant transactions are effectively safe, while still maintaining privacy and censorship resistance. The only hangup right now is fixing the malleability so that LN can be effective and safe for mobile or intermittently connected nodes. 
**Imagine a world where every transaction you make is a Bitcoin transaction. Some will be via the LN as safe 0-confs, others will be via traditional transactions. To me, that's fucking amazing, and I can't wait.**

@_date: 2017-03-16 00:15:02
There will never truly be extra capacity in Bitcoin, because the value of immutable, permanent storage is huge. Look at all the junk that was stored in the blockchain when fees were basically non-existent. If there's capacity it's in the miner's short term interest to include a transaction that pays any amount of fees, because they barely (if at all) have to deal with the the long-term cost of storing that data.
Basically when extra capacity does exist, it'll soon be filled by someone's long-term storage data.

Core's roadmap is in my opinion the fastest, safest way to scale Bitcoin to the point where we can see true wide-spread adoption.
Basically, we need SegWit now (it's ready and tested) to get us a small capacity bump, but primarily to open the door to other types of scaling (on and off chain).
LN will let us do safe 0-conf style transactions, and the estimate is that even with 1MB blocks we can service the daily needs of 500 million users. That's amazing, considering we're talking not just a huge increase in capacity, but true instant transactions. We could start really using Bitcoin to pay for cups of coffee.
Then, once we've seen how the SegWit 2-4MB blocks impact the network, we do a hard fork that includes the "wishlist"/technical debt stuff.
This roadmap gets us huge capacity increases, with real lasting benefit.

I'm sorry, but you've been misled. The ideas proposed by BU aren't sound technical solutions to scaling Bitcoin, they're just a nice soundbite.
The way forward to true mass adoption is SegWit + LN. Safe 0-conf transactions will bring a massive influx of users, and allow Bitcoin to finally be used for not just cups of coffee, but true microtransactions. All of that will raise the price of Bitcoin, and the sum of fees paid to miners.

Excellent points! Though I personally believe SegWit (and soon LN) will lead to a dramatic increase in the price of Bitcoin due to increased demand. I think the biggest thing holding us back from widespread adoption is that the average merchant/user doesn't care about the things we Bitcoiners care about (decentralization, immutability, censorship resistance, etc), they care about having transactions settle quickly and cheaply, both of which Bitcoin + LN will be able to provide.

On first glance this appears to be an existential threat to Bitcoin. I don't understand what the endgame is though, killing Bitcoin by having a supermajority of hash power just means that their investment in sha256 mining power is useless.
If this info is correct, and the parties involved are not clueless as to the inevitable outcome, then we must conclude​ that there is something we are missing. I can't imagine all of these players being that blind to history and the market.
The only non-doomsday level scenario off the top of my head is that another major player will soon be making mining hardware. The rest of the scenarios are basically Bitcoin Chicxulub.

The best solution is SegWit now (immediate capacity increase) since it's tested and has been ready to roll out since Dec. It also opens the door to further enhancements, such as schnorr/signature aggregation, MAST, versioned transactions, Lightning Network, etc.
We have good research that shows as of right now that the network can safely handle up to 4MB blocks. So the next step after SegWit is to re-evaluate how the network is impacted by the change, and use that knowledge to plan a hard fork that increases capacity in a safe manner (without impacting decentralization). This includes creating appropriate safe-guards for things like replay attacks (which caused a good bit of loss for people during the ETH/ETC fork).
Parallel to that hard fork for blocksize research, we can begin deploying a whole host of awesome tech that's currently sidelined and waiting for SegWit to solve transaction malleability. For instance, Lightning Network would allow us to have safe and instant 0-conf transactions, even micro-transactions, with very low fees while still maintaining privacy and censorship resistance.

That is not correct. SegWit allows blocks to be up to 4MB in size, with non-witness (signature) data being able to be up to 1MB in size. This is still on-chain, in a block.

It was honestly painful for me to admit to myself that Core was right all along. I was right there pushing for Classic/XT, but what swayed me was, as always, evidence.
SegWit, schnorr, signature aggregation, MAST, LN, etc are the future, and they are frankly awesome. If you told me 2 years ago that safe 0-conf transactions would be possible with a clever kind of multisig I would not have believed you. But today, it's so clear that not only is it possible, it's going to allow Bitcoin to actually do what I've wanted all along, handle those cups of coffee transactions.

Upgrades take time, even when non-controversial. If a large portion of miners decided to start mining 32MB blocks tomorrow, the vast majority of nodes (~95%) wouldn't accept them. Maybe some will switch to software that accepts those blocks quickly, maybe some will switch slowly, maybe some will never switch because the nodes are somewhat forgotten or they just decide to shutdown.
The point is, a chain with a longer proof of work but incompatible rules, won't be accepted automatically. Human interaction and decision making is _required by all nodes/users_ for hardfork consensus rule changes. Think about how hard it is for a small (~10) group of people to pick a place to eat, now imagine that group is the size of all the people currently using Bitcoin today. Without careful coordination and enough time for everyone to get ready, if the miners try to change the consensus rules there will be a good bit of chaos. Even softforks like segwit have at least ~4 weeks of lead up before activating (2,016 blocks of signaling above 95%, 2,016 blocks of waiting after that), and softforks don't cause the non-upgraded peers to be completely disconnected from the network like hardforks do.

LN needs 3rd parties in the same way bitcoin does, because it's a mesh network. There's no trusted 3rd party or central server.
LN is basically a type of safe 0-conf transactions, where you and the person you are transacting with do a bit of crypto handshaking that makes it virtually impossible to get screwed over.
LN means instant and safe 0-conf transactions. Which is perfect for cups of coffee, microtransactions, and other low value payments (I imagine most things under say $100-500). For larger amounts you'll likely use standard transactions and wait for confirmations.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:27:44

Today, consensus level changes require the entire community to make. That's why the miners can't change the blocksize cap without hard forking first.

@_date: 2017-03-08 16:45:19
Short answer, no.
Long answer, still no, but here's a brief reason why. A Bitcoin address is a hash of a public key. So step one involves getting the public key, which is currently impossible (and it doesn't appear like that will change anytime soon), unless coins have been sent from that address (which is why reuse is bad).
So let's assume they're reusing the address, now you've got the public key. What can we do with that? Well, nothing. There are theoretical attacks against the particular type of public/private key cryptography Bitcoin uses, but they require a type of computer which doesn't currently exist (quantum computers).
There's no need to worry about this for the foreseeable future, as there are mitigations in place. We can also change to quantum resistant stuff if the need arises.

Unless every miner sets the same EB/AD values, it's possible that a multi-block reorg can happen naturally and at a much greater frequency than normal. For instance, if a chain with blocks greater than the EB of a minority of miners is created, it is active and valid at the same time as the chain by the minority of miners. In the end though, only one chain will survive, but if the minority miners have an AD of 6, that means there will be a 6 block re-org when the chains converge.
Anyone that had a node with similar EB/AD values as the minority miners, could see their transactions get a number of confirmations and then immediately revert to unconfirmed when the reorg happens.

talks about competing back and forth constantly, but the fact of the matter is that there is an upper limit, the value of the channel. No one is going to spend $100 in fees to steal $10 from someone, at least not for long. And that's assuming the literal worst case scenario of not being able to get your transaction in a block before the dispute period ends. You can increase the length of the dispute period to make it less likely that the malicious party has enough time to ensure only their transaction is included.
Here's a good quick overview of LN stuff: 
Edit: I should also point out, that the malicious party _can't stop you_ from broadcasting your Breach Remedy Transaction, and their theft transaction isn't valid until after the Dispute period.

Two ways, first is that Bitcoin is technically​ premined since Satoshi was mining at least a few blocks before anyone else.
The second is that, if you follow his logic of it being an altcoin (I'm not saying he's correct in that) then it's​ basically an altcoin that starts off with millions of existing coins.

LN channels would likely make very little in fees, since it would be a near perfectly competitive market.
The increase in utility for Bitcoin (instant, safe 0-conf transactions) would likely drive a significant growth in users. And those users still need to open and close channels, and they still need to use traditional Bitcion transactions to move larger amounts of money around. LN transactions would likely only cover small amounts.
In my opinion the main thing holding Bitcoin back from widespread adoption is the confirmation time, which larger blocks don't really solve. To an end-user like a merchant or buyer, there's not much difference between waiting 10 minutes and waiting an hour. Even under best case scenarios, we'll never see widespread use of Bitcoin in physical stores without LN or something similar.
Basically by making Bitcoin usable for day-to-day transactions (small amounts) via LN, we'll increase not only the price of Bitcoin (increased demand) but the total amount of fees paid.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:04:49
I've been in Bitcoin since 2009, and I agree this isn't the Bitcoin I signed up for.

Miners shouldn't be able to dictate constraints of the protocol. The best approach is:
1. Deploy segwit (immediate increase in transaction throughput)
2. Evaluate how the larger blocks impact the network
3. Deploy hardfork to increase segwit transaction space to whatever research shows is a safe size.

@_date: 2017-03-15 22:19:01
Yeah, I'm very excited for a future with LN transactions for low value transfers. In my opinion the key thing holding Bitcoin back from mass adoption is the time it takes for a transaction to be considered safe, and LN solves that in a neat way. Basically giving us safe 0-confs. The price of Bitcoin and sum of transaction fees per block will explode, everyone wins (except Visa/Paypal/etc).

The closest thing so far is this use of LN to monetize full nodes:
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:52:12

Hah exactly. The bcash trolls claiming it "supports" LN are really saying that bcash _could_ support LN. But first they have to design, code and deploy a malleability fix. Then they have to design, code and deploy LN code. Meanwhile, Bitcoin will actually support LN, in just a few days.

@_date: 2017-08-26 17:08:17
You seem to be confused so I'll clarify the terminology. Many consumers pay for an internet connection with speeds "up to" a certain amount. This is the amount of bandwidth available to them. It is a number (typically in Mbps) that specifies how fast they can transfer data over the connection.
A data cap (sometimes called a "data usage allowance") is the maximum amount of data that can be transferred in a given month, regardless of the speed that data was transferred. This is exactly like the data plans for cell phones if you are familiar with how that billing works.
Also of note, when you calculate how much total data (data cap) a node will need, you'll have to include the block data *and* the transaction, *to all peers*. If you only calculate usage as size_of_block * num_blocks, you will always get the wrong answer.

Actually they often do. The less down-payment you have, the greater the risk that your loan won't be approved. If the seller is looking to close quickly (e.g. to use those funds to buy another house) it's something they often take into consideration.

@_date: 2017-01-31 14:44:27
I assume the idea is to have multiple transactions if you need to send more. They can also take separate paths, which would improve privacy.

Actually they show 85% wouldn't support BU blocks (BU 11.99% + Classic 1.93% + XT 0.43% = 14.35%).
Whereas Bitnodes shows the network at 87% not supporting BU blocks.
Coin.dance and Bitnodes don't show non-listening nodes, which accounts for the massive difference in node count. In any event, BU compatible nodes are the clear minority.

I figured out how to send transactions via amateur radio. No internet needed.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:13:08
We've been trying, luckily the people blocking that (by spewing lies and conspiracy nonsense) have forked themselves off to a new altcoin. The Core roadmap is, SegWit then see how the larger SegWit blocks impact the network before deciding on a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:47:00


And there is no hashing/mining without people willing to purchase those blocks (tx fees, buying BTC, etc). If all the miners on earth disappeared, more would soon take their place because that's how markets work, if there's demand people will find ways to profit off it by creating supply.

Here's the thing though, bcash first has to fix malleability, which requires developers and time. Then they have write a version of LN that's compatible with their chosen malleability fix, which also requires developers and time.
Bitcoin will actually support LN in a few short days, and there's already a big community of developers writing software. Software that already exists.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:41:54
There's a decent chunk of the community that think some of the developers for Core are part of a massive, world-wide conspiracy. They even think people like Dr. Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream), who has literally decades of vocal support for cryptography and decentralized software, wants to centralize Bitcoin and control it.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:47:22
That's one, but look at literally all the other blocks. The average size is under 100 KB.

UASF nodes rejected any blocks not signaling for SegWit starting August 1st. Since the miners also chose to orphan any block not signaling for SegWit, there was no disruption to the network and now enough blocks have signaled for SegWit that even non-UASF nodes will consider SegWit as locked-in once the difficulty period ends.

You have to first open a "channel" with another node, which is basically a special kind of bitcoin transaction (recorded in the blockchain) that says "hey, me and this other node are doing a thing, these coins can't move for the next week (even by me!) or until we both agree in a specific way".
So those coins are committed to being part of the channel, and your channel partner isn't going to work with you if you send him obviously invalid instructions/transactions (e.g. doublespends).
@_date: 2016-11-19 02:28:32

As long as both parties in a channel are following their agreed upon rules they can keep updating the state of the transaction. If they stop agreeing, either party can post the latest state to the regular Bitcoin network and get it confirmed, closing the channel.
Best case scenario: working together == near instant transactions
Worst case scenario: close the channel at the most recent agreed upon state (no one gets to steal anyone's coins)

The amount of computational power thrown at the Bitcoin network has no impact on transaction capacity. If you double the amount of mining hardware, we'd see blocks being found every 5 minutes instead of every 10. Then at the next difficulty re-targeting (every 2016 blocks) the network would recalculate the mining difficulty so that blocks are only found every 10 minutes again.
Mining power helps secure the network by mathematically proving a lot of money was spent on a particular history of transactions. Here's a good site with links to resources about Bitcoin from high-level overviews of the basics, to in-depth technical details: 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:14:01

APRS is an amateur radio mesh network, used mostly for position and telemetry reporting, but it includes a messaging function. There are commonly available "gateways" that use the messaging function to relay APRS messages as SMS or e-mail messages. The proof-of-concept uses messages addressed to "BITCOIN" and containing a base64 encoded transaction.
I haven't (yet) tested this against the live APRS network, but I did setup an APRS-IS node locally and tested against that. APRS-IS is the internet side of the APRS mesh network.
If you've got any questions let me know. Eventually I'd like to setup a permanent gateway for this, but the code is very, very basic right now and I probably won't have time to change that for another month or two.

It's a DNS seed with a ton of A records, it already is round-robin. The low TTL is so nodes don't get saturated with connections (default max is 20), as the system can rotate out records quickly.
Caching records is great, if you are trying to reduce latency for end-users and/or the record will be requested a ton of times. The bitcoin DNS seeds don't need or benefit from DNS caching and it's not destroying the Internet or your ISPs nameservers.
@_date: 2015-08-08 19:13:55

@_date: 2015-08-09 02:50:36
You mean high volume websites that are running Apache, Lighttpd or literally any other web server? Software that can handle thousands of connections, even when run on a t2.micro?
Bitcoin nodes (running Bitcoin Core) have a default maximum of 20 connections. Not to mention, unlike HTTP(S), these are persistent connections. That means it takes very little time for a node to hit that limit, at which point it will not accept any new connections.
The domain in question (seed.bitcoin.sipa.be) returns 25 records at a time, probably to help keep the lookup small and avoid having it sent via TCP (slow, not always well supported). If all 25 of those nodes are running the default settings, that's 500 connection slots, total. For comparison, Apache 2's default for MaxClients on Ubuntu is 150 (depends on the MPM, I think some are higher), and again those are highly transient connections vs Bitcoins persistent connections. Also keep in mind that those 500 connection slots for the 25 Bitcoin nodes, most are probably in use, because the nodes themselves will (by default) attempt to connect to 8 other nodes, so the real number is less than 300 available slots.
Oh, and about anycasting, do you have a /24 and nodes in a number of places with providers who will let you advertise the route? If so, go ahead and setup a few geographically diverse nodes and get anycast setup. Of course, it's a pointless waste ~~or~~of resources since this is a P2P network.
@_date: 2015-08-20 04:47:05
I think this would be a reasonable compromise solution. I would suggest that a BIP for this should include a stated understanding that this limit is not considered immutable, in either direction.

That just means there is a market incentive for non-Chinese miners to produce small blocks. In regards to this specific argument (bandwidth and China), there isn't a good reason to keep the 1MB limit, because anyone who mines a larger block outside of China runs the risk of being orphaned, while the Chinese miners have no risk.
Put simply, if transmitting big blocks is bad for Chinese miners, they will simply set a soft limit (maybe still keep it at 1MB).

The provider knows it's a Bitcoin node and has no issues with it. Funny story, their security forwarded an email to me last week from some kind of botnet watching group. All because my IP was on one of the Bitcoin DNS seeds.

They can spend the money from the justice transaction as part of the fee IIRC, so there's no risk there.


Justice transactions are something your software will automatically send if it sees a transaction in the blockchain attempting to defraud the channel. Even better, justice transactions can be crafted ahead of time and given to a 3rd party (outsourced). This allows the 3rd party to transmit the justice transaction on behalf of the user, even if they are in a coma, all without the risk of the 3rd party stealing any funds! Fun fact, outsource-able enforcement of the justice transactions is only possible because of segwit :)

@_date: 2015-07-29 17:47:02
I run a full node at home as well as at a datacenter. Here are my costs for the home-based node:
1. Hardware - I put together a small miniITX system to act as a fileserver, running a node on it came later. I figure this cost is effectively zero for Bitcoin usage since it was a sunk cost for another project. I think in total I spent $500-600 on the hardware though.
2. Bandwidth - The node uses so little bandwidth, I have seen no impact to my Internet connection even during "stress-test"/spam attacks. My node has 20 connections currently. Since I pay a flat rate for a specific amount of bandwidth (~$50 for 75Mbps/75Mbps), and would be paying this cost anyway, this is also effectively zero.
3. Storage - I run bitcoind under it's own user, it's home directory is currently ~50GB. This server was setup to store files and has 2TB of space (hey, it's an old system that use to be a TON). Again, effectively free and only using a small portion of the drive.
4. Power/Cooling - For simplicity, we'll just look at the power cost since this thing runs pretty cool. I have measured with a power draw of around 100 watts for the file server. I pay **$0.098402 per kWh**, which means it costs ~~$14.37~~**$7.18 per month** to run the server. This is my only significant cost with regards to running a Bitcoin node, as I could have the server shutdown when I'm not home and use Wake-On-Lan via my router to turn it on as-needed.
Of note, this is a dual-core atom processor with 4GB of ram, and it can still handle being a full-node, and keeping the full txindex.
Edit: Accidentally did my math at 200 watts.
@_date: 2015-07-30 02:45:48
It's just a Dell 1950 running Zabbix (monitoring) and some other processes/services I needed. CPU mining is pretty much pointless, and would potentially impact the other processes (probably by causing the CPU to die sooner due to heat).
Heat isn't really a concern from the provider's perspective. With co-located equipment you pay for space, power and network connectivity. The maximum amount of heat you can generate is constrained by the size of the electrical circuit they give you. In my case, that's a 20 amp 110v circuit (which is practice is about 14 amps of usable power). That's about 1,540 watts maximum usage (~$112/mo in power at $0.10/kwh). A Watt to BTU converter I found says that equals about 5,254 BTUs per hour. Air conditioners are typically sized by the "refrigeration ton" (usually we just say "ton"), and in this case my max heat output is about 0.4 tons, the A/C for that one row of the datacenter is 20+ tons.
@_date: 2015-07-09 06:08:50


The node I run at home has 4096 MB of RAM, the mempool is now 86 MB. It's got a ways to go before it would be an issue. The node I run at a datacenter is on a server with 65,536 MB of RAM.


CPU utilization for my home node peaked at 26.18%, but that was because I did a system update, it's average is 5.72%. Keep in mind this is a dual core Atom 330, basically a piece of crap.
My average bandwidth usage is well under 1 Mbps for the last day, which is concerning since I also use it for seeding torrents. I guess no one is leeching the torrents I have running.


@_date: 2015-07-01 02:25:55

I took the time to read through the code myself (I'm a software engineer), and it's pretty clear that it's not "minerlink".
It is literally only sending the mac address, id (which is a counter of how many times it has phoned home) and the "hash_board_id_string". It doesn't send the current hashrate, temperature, pool status or anything else you'd expect some kind of remote management system to care about. It also doesn't do anything with the returned data, unless the data is the string "false" at which point your miner will show "Stop mining!!!" and "Fatal Error: unkown status." in the log, then it will stop mining.

It would not be reorganized, under BIP 141 (SegWit) the commitment (and inclusion of SegWit transactions) is optional. It's perfectly fine to mine SegWit and non-SegWit blocks after activation, non-SegWit blocks won't be orphaned.

Incorrect, the txn is valid on both chains and could easily (and likely will) be included in both. The only way for the txn to be valid on one and only one chain in a fork is to include newly mined coins, that have matured for at least 100 blocks.

Ok, so it sounds like we agree that Bitcoin needs to be anti-fragile. Which means responding to new information and events, in a way that strengthens the system further, in this case disabling ASICBOOST will help ensure Bitcoin miners stay competitive, enhancing the security of Bitcoin.
Another possibility would be the owners of the patent releasing it similar to how Blockstream did with their defense patent license, but that seems less likely to happen and would take unacceptably long for the rest of the miners to catch up.

I think you are misunderstanding them or their tone. There is active research into hard forks right now. Including writing code, running testnets, etc. There are devs actively working on hard fork issues. They just can't​ promise one in a specific timeframe, because they want to see SegWit's full impact first. That's why a hard fork can't be bundled or promised with SegWit.

It actually is possible, in a sense. BitPay forces the use of a handshake protocol that instructs the wallet on how the transaction should be made. Virtually all privacy focused wallets and most general wallets do not support this handshake protocol. The user is never presented with an address and it's very difficult to extract one from the handshake protocol and use it in an unsupported by BitPay (i.e. almost all of them) wallet.

It may be possible to build a different lightning network that doesn't require segwit, but it would be much less usable and be incompatible with the actual lightning network.
There are also no devs working on the shitty version of LN, so it's unlikely to happen.

There are no superior alternatives to running a full node from the standpoint of security and decentralization.
Yes, things like SPV wallets are objectively easier to use and typically safe enough for the average user (primarily spending, not receiving), but they are useless without a large supply of honest and decentralized full nodes. I personally run a full node at my house and have my SPV wallets always connect to it (as well as other nodes), which gives me *some* of the safety of aspects back.

Again, incorrect. Channel monitoring improves security, but is not required (you have plenty of time to broadcast the penalty transaction), and it doesn't require trust (which was your original allegation).

Seriously, just read the RFC/BOLTs. When you create a channel you and the other node must agree on a `to-self-delay` value. This is the number of blocks that to-self outputs must be delayed, using `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` delays. This is how long either party will have to wait in case of breakdown (dead node or one party tries to broadcast old channel state) before redeeming its own funds.
If you have say, a cell phone and you know it'll be online at least  _sometime_ every week, you set the `to-self-delay` to say 1008 blocks. If that's too long to have your money locked up in case of a non-cooperative partner you can set it to something lower. Maybe you know you'll be able to check at least once every other day, so you set `to-self-delay` to 288 blocks instead. In any event, **3rd party enforcement is NOT required to safely use a LN channel**.
BOLT  defines `to-self-delay`:
BOLT  talking about how Commitment Transaction Outputs are built using the `to-self-delay` value:
Fun fact in case you missed it, if the other party does try to cheat you by broadcasting an old channel state, you have an agreed upon delay period (`to-self-delay`) in which if you see that transaction you can broadcast a penalty transaction **and claim the entire contents of the channel**.
Edit: I forgot to mention, I **am** financially conflicted on the matter, as I hold a few Bitcoins and would like to see them go up in value by having even greater utility, such as having an instant, trustless, decentralized 2nd layer payment system.

The biggest difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin is how much power is backing the blockchain. The next biggest is adoption. This is true for pretty much every altcoin.
Yes, on a technical level cryptocurrencies are pretty much identical, but Bitcoin has more users and is more secure (by virtue of having more mining power). Once side/tree/whatever-chains are implemented even the minor technical differences between altcoins will be eliminated.

Without &gt;50% of the hash rate, they can't hard fork without first putting in anti-rollback features. As without those features they are simply mining invalid blocks as viewed by the majority of hashrate, and thus constantly orphaned. It's unlikely that BU will create an anti-rollback feature, as they have already said they won't do it (and may lake the technical skill to do so).
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:58:58
You don't need to be online constantly, that's the whole point of the CSV lock on the commitment transactions. You get to define how much time it will take before the other party could unilaterally close the channel.

Exactly. Every retail business I've talked to always gets hung up on the transaction times. From their point of view, anything slower than about 30 seconds is too slow to be useful.
The only businesses I've talked to that don't care about the transaction times are ones that either ship products or do hosted solutions. Since they can either not ship until confirmed or turn off the service if it doesn't confirm within a reasonable time frame.
Bigger blocks will never enable these business to use Bitcoin, even if every transaction made, regardless of fee, was guaranteed to be in the next block, it's still too slow.

There is has been a coordinated disinformation campaign, mostly using emotional appeals to sour people against SegWit and various other scaling tech.
It's not clear exactly who is behind it and why, but it definitely seems to be related to Bitmain (Jihan Wu) and Bitcoin.com (Roger Ver). It's possible since they are miners, they are loving the increased fees (up to 4-5 BTC per block!).
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:04:11
By using Check Sequence Verify (CSV) to force an uncooperative close of the channel to wait a set number of blocks before the closing party can actually move the money.
During that time, if the uncooperative close was actually an old channel state (i.e. trying to roll back the clock to steal funds), the party who is being stolen from has until that sequence lock ends to claim the entire contents of the channel.
This means that in order to steal someone's funds in a channel you have to risk *all* of your own funds. With SegWit, we get the ability to trustlessly outsource that enforcement too, so you can have a 3rd party watching the chain for old channel states who will broadcast the penalty transaction for you.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:04:31

This is why we need SegWit, it gets us a moderate capacity increase faster than any other solution, and it also enables Lightning Network. LN is cool in that we can do instant, low fee transactions, safely and privately.
If we merely raise the blocksize, first everyone has to update their software (which will take a lot of time to do safely) and we'll only get a temporary reduction in fees. As soon as demand fills up the blocks again, we're right back to here.

They expected SegWit to be out prior to the hard fork (so that we can see how it impacts the network), but it took longer than expected to ensure SegWit was safe and ready. The plan was deploy SegWit and then a few months later deploy code for hard fork, when SegWit got delayed that necessarily delayed the hard fork as well.
So lets continue that plan as agreed, SegWit first, then hard fork shortly after.

When the BIP148 chain is longer than the non-BIP148 chain, the non-BIP148 disappears. All transactions on it get reversed, potentially re-orged into the BIP148 chain, but not if they are invalid (already spent).

@_date: 2017-05-24 17:56:34




When you craft a Bitcoin transaction, the inputs are specified as [previous txid] + [output index], which is basically saying "output  of transactions [txid]". If the transaction ID change (because it's malleable), any transactions depending on that previous transaction are now invalid and must be re-signed. This makes writing smart contracts for Bitcoin very difficult, if not impossible.
Additionally, if you keep track of your transactions to/from your wallet by transaction id, you can easily become confused if the a modified version of your transaction shows up in the blockchain.


The main issue is that with Bitcoin all transactions have to be broadcast to all parties and the stored for all time by those parties. It's already a decent amount of data, and it grows by 1MB every 10 minutes. In order to process the daily transaction needs of more people, we'd have to transmit and store more data, which can quickly spiral out of control without some kind of limit.
Additionally, 2nd layer solutions like lightning network get us something that Bitcoin can _never_ do, which is allow for **truly instant transactions**. Blocks are only found every 10 minutes (on average), which means it always takes time before a transaction will be confirmed. By using some pretty ingenious Bitcoin smart contracts, LN allows us to create payment channels where parties can transact Bitcoin without having to place each transaction into the blockchain. Only the initial and final states (balances) of the channel are every broadcast.
And because of how these Bitcoin smart contracts are designed, both parties are protected from the other party stealing the some or all of the balance. In fact, the first party that attempts to steal, has to risk _all_ of their money in the channel to do so, because when the try to steal the balance they give the aggrieved party enough info to claim the entire channel's balance! It's pretty cool stuff.

Here's a great guide for developers that covers most of the core concepts, it's a much longer read but is a great way to learn about the inner workings of Bitcoin: 


In Bitcoin we assume everyone else on the network is potentially hostile, and design the software accordingly. It's not a value judgement on any particular party.


I did answer, I said the other replies did a great job listing most of the benefits, which are the reasons I'm for SegWit.


Signature hashing is a part of how transactions are crafted and verified, and the reason for why this scales quadradically with additional inputs to a transaction is fairly complex. To really understand the specifics you'll need to know more about Script (the language used for Bitcoin transactions/scripts) and how it works, specifically how inputs are signed.


The "who benefits" sections explain why a particular feature of SegWit is useful and what use-cases it helps.


I'm not sure, but that's the Bitcoin Core website. You can dig through the git repo to see who modified the page and when:

That's not how any of this works. If you give me a block that doesn't have the signature data, my node won't accept it, because you've produced an invalid block.

@_date: 2017-07-03 19:01:50
I don't think you understand how block propagation works. I don't "send out a request for witness data". When you have a new block, you send me the block. If it doesn't have the witness data, it's invalid and I ban your clearly misbehaving node, and so does the other 90%+ of the network. Just like that time a BU miner produced a &gt;1MB block.

The password is just a way of encrypting the wallet. What matters are the private keys (they are inside the wallet). Just knowing the public key (address) and a decryption password is not enough.
Unless of course you used a brain wallet, in which case you don't need to know the public key since you could just run the passphrase through a generator. Note: I don't recommend using brain wallets.

You can't group the inputs together without a transaction. The fee for such a large transaction will be pretty high, because fees aren't computed based on the amount of bitcoins but rather how much hard drive space it takes to store the transaction.
Your transaction will likely be made up of hundreds, if not thousands of inputs and that data has to be stored in the blockchain forever.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:47:30
1. Yes, some wallets do this by default.
2. Primarily, loss of pseudo anonymity. It is also possible that sometime in the future it may be possible to one's compute private key from their public key, when a transaction is sent from an address the public key is exposed. This isn't really a big problem though, more like Satoshi being paranoid (hence change addresses).

Virtually all of bitcoin's power usage is from miners. Sure, once Bitcoin takes over the world there will be more people mining, but they'll likely be using power efficient ASICs and still using less power than all the existing infrastructure.
Think about this one tiny part of the traditional system, armored cars picking up and dropping off physical currency. These vehicles are driving around all the time, almost every day, and they run on gasoline (or diesel). I'm willing to bet that they are burning up WAY more energy than Bitcoin.

I'm not affiliated with the project, but I know enough to answer your questions.
1. If you don't trust them, make your own device. The hardware and software is open source. Once the plans are released, I will be making a few for myself (and donating some coin).
2. When the device initializes it generates a random seed, the seed is displayed to you as a series of 12 words. This is being worked on as part of [BIP 0039](
3. You can use the seed to completely restore all private keys (as they are derived from the seed). I'm not sure if they have plans to set the seed/key, though I would like to have that functionality so I could generate my seed using a trusted hardware RNG.

Technically addresses are never "used up". Think of it more as discrete and hidden points in space to store your money. There's no good way to search it all without checking each and every spot, and there are too many spots to check (and it takes time to do each check) that it's more cost effective spend your time mining for bitcoins instead of searching for coins to steal.

Signing always requires the private key. The idea behind these types of cards is that you are transferring the private key to another person via the card (rather then sending to their public address).
I can't think of anyway these types of cards (or paper wallets) can be made without having to trust the manufacturer. Multisig/M-of-N transactions wouldn't be a good fit here, because the card would be effectively useless without the 2nd private key (and also more difficult to import to a wallet and use).
Personally, I don't really like the idea of these kinds of "gift cards", but to each his own.
