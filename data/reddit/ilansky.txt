The amount distributed by the ETF will be 20 million $.
Which is ridiculous compared to power of bitcoin at the moment.
I don't even understand how people can use this as speculative info...
20kcoins is 1 or 2 day volume on kraken shouldn't have any impact on the btc price if people were not guided by 'stupid and religious like hodler believes'

Hello, I'm trading on Kraken, what does it implies for me ?
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:00:28
So you admit its a speculative bubble ? It will flood 20 million$ which is nothing (while the twins will mass dump to cashout...)
@_date: 2017-03-06 11:05:55
Exactly but we want to get rid of the notary and the costs and the paper work and the building costs of archive etc etc

Same for money, if I randomly write a private key into Electrum that actually has money in it I can use it as I will...

No action from core since 2 years is same as action against btc i guess, everyone is to blame here I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:26:47
Exact same time, it happens a lot in regular markets also, people attentions goes toward the news, and just the fact that people watch something else and do not open and close orders can create a sudden fall in demand.

I'm happy that nazi scum like you have to hide like rats behind computers.

There's that maybe too ! Yeah but let them go, they'll loose everything and will come back with even more money to make again what they lost
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:09:27
It is not criticism, it's blatant lie. How in your mind lying that banks are controlled by jews is criticism of the jewish people ? Indeed copy pasting what Hitler said is nazism. JP is 100% protestant. here are the 100 greatest banks in the world, 1 is jewish AND publicly owned. Few others may also be held through stock by jews, does it makes the jews scammers ? NO. And please stop copy pasting mein kampf.

Aparth..what? The head of the supreme court is an arab, was the head of the suprem court of America ever was a black? Ever was the head of the supreme court of south africa during apartheid was black? Arabs serve in the military and have access to healthcare and education, they take the bus together with jews and even break the fast together during holidays... Go educate yourself.

If you do that you'll get your bitcoin stollen by BCC, first send your bitcoins to a new adress. You will then have 2 adress the new one and the old one. Then on an other device, use your old private key in a BCC wallet, then you're safe. Can't trust the BCC wallet, can have maleware and would use your coins.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:51:04
Classic Nazi propaganda. Can you give me some example, like please give me the 100 largest bank and prove me it's jew owned ? And even if it true, it doesn't mean that they (the jews in general) would scam you. People got killed because of this kind of thinking. Edit: It is not even true.

Mining contracts are good in a bearish market. A lot of newbies or alzeimer here do not remember that for months bitcoin was stuck at 2500 and was very bearish, no returns for months, with mining contracts you still get your daily amount of BTC, and when it gets bullish again you have returns on what you've earned + daily btc. 
Surely when we are in a peridod like now where we make 70% in 1 month it seems stupid. But in the long run bitcoin is worth about $1 per day of existence, so if you earn more than that on mining well, you're good.
The mining company I use has half price electricity as I do in my country and sell the rigges at about the same price as I would buy from hardware company. 
I have about 10% in mining contracts and I took already half of what I've invested out. Sometimes you need to take some risks to know if it was worth or not. 
If you go to investment forums most of the people would tell you bitcoin is bullshit but here its the messaiah so people's opinions is mostly bullshit.

Because we live in an interconnected world :)

I believe you about Mein Kampf. 
But still you're a very stupid dude lol. If someone uses a sentence in the aim to create hatred in the heart of people, quoting this sentence can be incitation to hatred. If the same dude says hello to his mom in the morning, quoting this "Hello" won't make you a bad guy. This is common sense, even a 5yo child would understand. In our case Hitler used this money and power lie to incite hatred towards people. And as far as I know, the jews that were killed were for the most not bankers, but ordinary people (some were bankers also probably). Taking things out of context won't make you bright... Maybe that is why you're watching website like the zog, looking at who is jewish at the head of banks instead of you being at the heads of banks or any big companies in the field you enjoy... You're too stupid to achieve things, and you prefer to blame others for your misery. That is what you make others perceive of you. 
If you're black and have suffered racism, why would you use the same kind of rhetoric openly antisemites people use to say about the jews? (And still does actually). I would never use anti black rhetoric ever.

100% agree with you, but why so much time going from 1200 to 1300 when it has no problem going from 850 to 1200 in a few days ?

Or any kind of calculation algo that scientst would ask the miner to compile.
But maybe there's a catch in the pow actual algo, maybe it has a real value for the people who know how to read it and what it means to crack some sha

Im french and french are stupid, they dont even know about bitcoin or would prefer german mark from 1929 than bitcoin, unless you serve them it bitcoin on a golden plate like you give milk to a child
@_date: 2017-04-29 00:06:30
Can you teach me how to use it? Thanks
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:19:29
For example if you ask miner to do some calculation about a difficulty related to prime number, the work would be easily checked and the end of the calculation will have a real value beside security

Palestine was colonized by britain, but the jews don't colonize Palestine as it is their homeland, a french by definition cannot colonize Paris, neither a jew the holyland.
What I mean is that you will hear much more of bad news, than news about people actually living together in peace, because that is the huge majority of the situation (people living in peace together). 
Here the same, we hear a lot of fud, because the majority of the situation is global acceptance of bitcoin by the people.

@_date: 2017-07-14 22:02:42
It's called free market. When there is no monopole like in crypto with 900+ coins, you cannot force people to choose you by theatning to blow up the system. In the end its less money which compensate with higher btc price or loose everthing, as we live in a free world.

Bitcoin is not g.od or the messaiah that will save the world from evil. Its a currency that needs to adapt to situations. If you want bitcoin is open source, you could just run your bitcoin and convince people use it.
