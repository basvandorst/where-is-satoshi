There are a lot of people who live in advanced countries who use bitcoin to send money to their overseas relatives. I'm not sure exactly the answer to your questions, but it's presumable to think that most people who have a wallet would not be activating a full node.

I doubt it, it would be cool though

Mine finally got the first confirm after about.. 16 hours :) There is always hope! mwhaha

Not really. Their fees are well stated and lower than most other methods to buy Bitcoins, ever. Stop being a negative nancy
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:32:15
You know, conscience is a thing? For most of us, anyways. When you start down the road of negativity, the road back from it is much longer.
You can believe your actions have no effect on yourself, but that only shows you truly don't understand yourself, or people, or the interconnectedness of the universe in general.

This is also the reason why ETH does not follow the same fundamental principles that Bitcoin does, and a lot of people will never like ETH. Of course governments and corporations LOVE eth and hate btc, don't you see why? That's exactly the problem. /rolls eyes

no, google auth isnt done by phone number, it's more secure imho
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:49:15
You are so misinformed
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:50:08
It's funny that btc is nearly $3000 now and people say it's failing :-p as thousands of new people buy Bitcoins daily. Lmao
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:57:06
they can call and act like they are you on the phone and get the phone switched :(

Paxful sucks. They have been banning loads of traders lately with no reason given and refusing to answer support emails or respond to chat.
DO NOT TRADE AT PAXFUL.
YOUR COINS ARE NOT SAFE.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
I am currently in the process of leading an investigation into their deceptive practices.
They have always been known to be shady, but only recently have been showing their true colors enmass.
DO NOT TRADE ON PAX. WARNING.
Also, the registered business phone number is not answered -- ever. It's a voicemail that literally lies and says they are experiencing high call volume, and to go use chat on the website.
BLATANT LIE! I tried to call 100+ times this week, same thing every time. All hours of the day.
Stop lying to people, Paxful. You are using deceptive business practices and you are stealing people's money.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:50:27
It defies the very idea behind cryptocurrencies, but schills like you speds will always fail to see it
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:04:32
Haha! Look at the feedback from most of the Amazon and iTunes traders. You will notice they are mostly brand new accounts, because all the originals WERE BANNED. And you're failing to acknowledge the blatant lie and lack of tech support? That's typical. Pax may be more user friendly (for noobs), but it's definitely not safer. Stop lying to people, scrooblet
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:24:26
They've also banned hundreds of legit traders in the past few months with no communication and they are attempting to keep the coins.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:21:28
You are forgetting that ETH rose from bitcoin, and has ridden it's coat tails. Bitcoin is the innovator. You are comparing years that bitcoin took to gain ground, then was moved to ETH... and crediting it to eth? You are hilarious, sir!
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:11:13
Lolol transaction fees because you rely on a 3rd party to manage your coins. Do you even know what sending with 1 input means? Figure it out kiddo
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:25:17
This is not a joke. I was sending a simple .1 btc earlier and the app recommended fee was trying to send .06 BTC!
60% FEE?
After examining wtf was up, I had too many inputs selected and it was a large transfer size.. but still.. it should never be that much. That's absurd

lawl "never break 5000"
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:45:34
Get your own wallet and be in charge of your own inputs. This way, no matter what about you send, you can send it from 1 input. This makes your tx size minimum, thus, fee smallest.
In which case, it wouldn't matter if you sent 1 or 1000 coins, or $5 or 5mil. The fee would remain the same, due to only using 1 input (224bytes)
Also, 
services like that don't account for this stuff and all do it based on scripts, they can't figure out the cheapest way to send your coins for you.

No, the admins at LBC are very respectful and honest. Unlike at Pax. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:16:33
Who let the trolls out? Go back inside
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:12:47
Let me spell it out for you; You can send 1,000s of bitcoins for 0.0009216 fee or less. You just have to use 1 input. Got it? 224 byte tx. Small fee. Figure it out. Go.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:17:25

"support the capitalist laws of liberty and freedom" lol, yea because that would totally get us to where we need to be, as it is right now, in the current "real world". lmao. lbc is run perfectly atm, no change needed
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:32:48
UASF and segwit both terrible, bitcoin is divided
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:05:03
Lol "flip", a scamcoin can never outmatch the truely sound decentralized money king. If you tx fees are high, you are doing it wrong.
Only send from 1 input. Duh?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:28:08
Lol, you are a paid troll? Figured! If you don't know that LBC is less shady than Pax, you are lost. Did you ever hear the story of Marcos the admin? Probably not. Lol. Notice the lack of sellers on Pax lately? They're all banned. No reason given.
Yeah, I'm just making stuff up
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:24:56
LBC is much better. PAX is like the back alley. Do not trade on Pax. You've been warned.
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:34:33
It can, and you sir are missing the point
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:14:59
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:51:39
i was sending .1 , it asked for .06 fee., therefore it was asking for 60% of my send, as a fee. wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:17:58
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:55:53
Google auth FTW!
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:13:42
For that price, you could send an unlimited amount of coins, from 5 different inputs. Please enlighten me more, crypto master!
