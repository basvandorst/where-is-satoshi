Yup! As I said in the thread yesterday, it's baby steps. What's nice is that since we have set up this infrastructure, you can see how we could pretty easily integrate another service too.

Balanced Payments is a payments company. We let people (generally, marketplaces) process credit cards and ACH transactions through us.
Yesterday, we rolled out a Coinbase integration as well. This means our 450+ customers (after it goes out of beta) can roll out "We take bitcoin!" on their sites. The announcement was basically marketing, today is the technical side. Since there was the discussion yesterday about marketing, figured you all would like to hear the tech half as well.

As a very first step, this settles to USD. Eventually, it will settle to BTC. Without settling to USD, this would have been a no-go. With it, it's possible, and provides a way forward.
Baby steps.

So settling to USD means one thing: the merchant ends up with USD in their bank account.
Your concern is a special case of recurring payments, and you're right: if you set up a recurring payment in USD from Coinbase, in theory, the price could drop right before and after the payment happens. It'd be up to the site with the recurring payment to implement logic like you've suggested.
Before this feature rolls out of beta, you'll also be able to denominate it in BTC, and so a recurring payment denominated in BTC wouldn't be affected in the same way: you'd just have tipped a lot less that week than usual.
Does that make sense?
(Oh, and if there isn't any BTC in your account, the charge fails, just like if you tried to pay with a maxed out credit card.

Yes, it is Coinbase only.
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:33:02
There's already been a few of those, including the very first online wallet.

See the discussion here, too:

Unfortunatly, not yet: 
I care about this a lot, but there are huge regulatory barriers to this.
And also, 'pay out to Coinbase' could theoretically help, but there are some issues there, too.

So, because Balanced operates as an open company, we often do feature development in the open. This is why it's a private beta, we want to get the integration with Gittip and CrowdTilt done and work out all the kinks that will inevitably happen. Yay software. Because Gittip is open source, you can track that here:  and 
And the rollout to other customers here: 
Now, once we're out of that beta period, it will be available to every single merchant that uses Balanced. As far as I know, we're the only people that do Bitcoin, Credit Card, and ACH all in one service.
However, we _do_ have restrictions on what kinds of businesses can be our customers, mostly due to requirements by our upstream processors. The full list is here, section 9: 
Unfortunately, right now, there are two big kinds of businesses that I assume you all are interested in building that we cannot support: Currency exchanges, and the general selling of virtual currencies. This is basically due to the large amount of risk that's involved. We recently had a certain situation occur where someone signed up for Balanced to sell cryptocurrencies and accept credit cards, and we noticed because their chargeback rates were a full order of magnitude higher than the rate at which Visa or Mastercard would kick you off.
I'm guessing that as the industry matures, these kinds of things will be worked out. Until then, them's the brakes.

Balanced employee and project manager on this partnership here, if I can answer any questions.
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:00:26
They are a customer of ours, but they will not be integrating immediately.
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:56:49
As [yesterday]( anything I can answer, please let me know.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:28:14
Yes, it is, because our merchants currently want to hold USD, not BTC, and we don't have the internal infrastructure (yet) for multi-currency support.
