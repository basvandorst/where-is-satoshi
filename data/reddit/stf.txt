I am going to guess it is the ones which allow the "USD wallet" feature currently.

It looks like something happened in finland?
@_date: 2012-09-18 13:40:04
This is the correct answer I think. Bitcoin is kind of designed to prevent surges inmining andcoins. As such it is much more profitable to sell equipment.
@_date: 2012-12-28 02:55:45
I can see some major ASIC provider going belly up easily, drama there. Some type of government intervention, drama...Lots left on the table to be honest.
@_date: 2012-08-22 03:31:29
I suppose I do have a different opinion and would accept a bank's contract more since there is some implied expectation on a use of force by the government if it gets there. It is a fair point though and banks usually weasel out as anyone else does. That said, this whole bitcoin security stuff seems shady as hell.

Actually what might be interesting is that the production of bitcoins will be in a much much reduced set of hands. Unless you have purchased ASIC equipment you will be out of the mining game entirely. There is surely currently a set of people who mine on their home pc's and who buy products/sell their coins which are simply not going to be available unless they go through an exchange. It will be interesting to see if these people continue to use bitcoin or if they simply stop now that the "free" money is gone.
If you think about what most people currently use for bitcoins, silk road, gambling,  and other "grey" materials it is safe to assume that they will probably continue to use bitcoin as long as they can get them with relative ease.

I think they did state that it was expected october/november. Last I heard they were expecting first week in November as the actual time. Still. Why no further specs, why no prototypes, who no additional information on their products to calm all the drama that has erupted? 
@_date: 2012-09-07 02:39:33
All I gotta say is thank god. BFL seems super scammy to me, and if they do deliver ASIC they will be the only game in town. It is good to get more players in the space.
@_date: 2012-11-28 05:10:42
seems there is not any company which can get these asic's done.
edit: as pointed out, it is just BFL and bASIC with the problems. Other companies, such as Avalon, have had no delivery estimation problems.
@_date: 2012-11-12 22:51:13
actually I think avalon is the reason both btcfpga and bfl increased MH, although the mini sc seems to be a direct response to the btcfpga offering...it is actually great to see a product in the $500 range and lots of companies making these!
@_date: 2012-09-16 01:48:42
50x is a bit outragous don't you think? That is 1000 T/Hash or 1 petahash at a 50x increase. To reach that number we would need 1000 of BFL's mini rigs which come in at $30,000 each. That is at a cost total of 30 million dollars. or 25,000 single units at a cost of 32 million. I dont know man I know it will reach that eventually, surely, but I will be surprised if it gets there before fall of next year.
@_date: 2012-09-21 23:45:58
People on bitcointalk have pictures, etc. The company has a thread about their prior products and the new asic on there as well. TBH seems as legit as all the other ASIC companies, BFL, ngzhang, etc. All of them have produced fpga hardware before, all of them are now offering preorders on asics with pretty similar cost and specs. 
@_date: 2012-09-30 22:57:25
this isnt even a well done fake 
@_date: 2012-09-20 04:14:05
Because miners will not be putting more coins into the economy. They will be harder to come by, and will want to get more for them. People who use coins for services, or as a currency will need to get them though so demand will create the price rise. 
That is what the thought is of course... Personally I think that the price will rise slowly, if at all. Most miners are not going to dump coins but are making descisions based on certain monthly prices and I doubt depending on the price to double is happening. It is also worth mentioning that asic mining hardware will be coming online right around this time throwing monkey wrenches in everywhere. 
@_date: 2012-09-21 17:38:56
Hopefully they follow through with the shipping times and really get some support! Bitcoin needs more hardware options than just BFL.
@_date: 2012-10-20 00:57:18
Why is it going to be "in late November or December."??? Didn't they have a huge head start on all other companies? 
@_date: 2012-08-22 02:55:15
I am really at a loss for all these security dealings. Are people really just sending money to guys with a forum post "contract" and a promise that you can trust them?
@_date: 2012-09-30 15:42:51
Not to mention adding a new 30 ghz tier at the same price point. What is crazy to me is they seem to be changing scope when they should be extremely close to shipping by now. Perhaps the jump from 40 to 60 was planned? Im kind of doubtful.
@_date: 2012-10-06 03:40:44
I must assume that this is a satirical post...If not jesus christ man/
@_date: 2012-11-21 00:55:19
Fair enough, I simply know that on other forums and places lots of PC hardware people, and even just gamers would mine bitcoins as all it needed was an AMD card and you are good to go. Certainly having multiple price points on the ASIC is great. It just seems like it will be more dedication for people to plunk down a minimum of $150 to try mining rather than the download some software for hardware you already had model.
@_date: 2012-09-30 21:00:42
nope, I think they are a direct result. Avalon seems actually better as they are stand alone units from what I gather.
@_date: 2012-07-31 03:44:08
this chat is hilarious. he says he isn't giving out free coins, just going to refund everyone...cool guy i guess?
@_date: 2012-12-12 14:15:42
The anonymous/lulzsec hackers a year or so back were kind of like this. They were clearly online only, but did have support and asked for bitcoin donations.
@_date: 2012-11-28 15:18:33
Sorry, did not mean to lump your company in with BFL and bASIC, I will edit my post.
@_date: 2012-09-16 02:20:50
Ok then we agree! In fact I think 1ph will be probably within a year. I thought you were saying that we would see a 50x increase overnight, which I don't think is quite possible. 
@_date: 2011-05-01 04:18:14
Funny about it right when bitcoin gets media attention.
@_date: 2011-06-06 01:07:35
of course not, would you arrest the person giving you oodles of money?
@_date: 2011-06-02 03:45:15
I doubt they will make it "illegal" and write a bill which says "bitcoins are illegal" specifically and so forth. Actually I have heard that if they attacked bitcoin in this fashion it would make other "online currencies" vulnerable (For example an online games virtual currency? points on a forum, the list could go on).
What I find likely is that they will simply attack the sites and places which make it viable to people. This is the exchanges, the markets, people trading for bitcoins, the large mining pools, etc. Even those actions will not destroy bitcoin, it is distributed and really this is the key action which has set it apart from other e-currencies in my mind. That said, they can make the practical widespread use of it extremely hard to impossible quite easily.
@_date: 2011-05-26 23:21:35
I have heard this is also due to some large mining clusters (business') going live recently, which makes sense. too bad most people are going to be out of the game now. 
@_date: 2011-05-16 04:10:51
It is almost as if people today don't remember using cash at all. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:36:50
The only "real" value is based on mining and the costs associated with it. The only real volume market is silk road and other illegal activities. Those are where you should try to figure the price of btc imo.
@_date: 2013-01-06 01:53:29
It is so that guys in foreign countries with large import taxes can avoid those, or people with big electricity costs. TBH I am not convinced of it at all either and think it is kind of off putting put that is the rational. 
@_date: 2013-01-06 01:55:49
Both are risky because mining is dependent on the price of bitcoins. With mining you are getting bitcoins no matter what, but if the price falls drastically prior to you paying off your hardware...well..

It took two years from the last bubble.

Do you offer steam wallet cards?
@_date: 2013-01-22 01:56:32
While at the same time telling people that all orders in the first and second "batch" will ship in march. IOW there is no place in line.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:34:07
unless he got them cheaper than what he sold them at?
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:49:32
I think this is really incorrect. Any type of bad news or threat of bad news could really pop this. Look at the dip that happened when mtgox had lag for an afternoon. When all that is holding it up is speculation all it will take is some negativity and it will drop in the opposite direction hard.
@_date: 2013-02-02 22:02:32
So disappointed that these turned out to be vapor. I had two orders with Tom and at this point will not buy from any ASIC maker until they have widely available products in normal customers hands. 
Avalon getting two units out, for what seems to be good promotion, while the rest of their customers still wait feels creepy to me. Of course being a customer of btcfpga and that fiasco makes me extremely nervous. BFL at this point scares the crap out of me as well since they are constantly in delays, much like Tom was, the key difference is they seem to have really competent PR and management of these setbacks while Tom imploded. Shame as when I considered investing in mining back in July I probably could have recouped my costs by now if I went with gpus. ah well.
@_date: 2013-03-09 00:49:28
6 months since they first said they would ship and still nothing. shameful
