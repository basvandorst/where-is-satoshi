Depends on how people take this, most of them don't even know what bitcoin is, so now it needs good marketing..

I don't see any connection with bitcoin..Demanding security deposit is smart decision..

It blew my mind out! 46 pages of bullshit! Seems like author wrote the article without thinking of what people call "belief".

accepting bitcoin is a good chance for Iceland to popularize itself, it's like what Netherlands did when legalized drugs. it's a good marketing way!

Ok! Now I got the idea! Nice trick! Is it only for android? What 'bout iOS?
@_date: 2014-05-01 08:00:40
So, it's a good idea to make one for iOS! Or there are restrictions from Apple in AppStore?

The first and the most important thing for me is that you could use it anonymously. The second is that I can mine it..it's like passive placements of funds. So, you earn it doing almost nothing, and then you got a chance to wait for high exchange rate to sell

There are a lot of zero fee pools, but popularity is another thing. Gash.io is

Wow! That's great! It expands the possibility of accepting bitcoin at the government level, i believe.

I agree, risks will always exists, but 51% attack is not the most serious one.

hey! very good idea! but is there any possible way of stealing money from the image? or deleting the image that keeps your key?

Looks nice! Good service and nice design! But a little advice to add info about the process of buying the game, because at first i didn't understand..
@_date: 2014-05-01 07:22:40
Looks good! Does anybody know, whether if there are bitcoin ATMs in Toronto??

I think that using bitcoin won't change the problem. The reason is every currency now depends on USD(or EUR) rate, even bitcoin. So if to change currency in country without risks the better way to do it is to accept USD. It is early to speak about bitcoin as a currency for country.

Many will see it as an opportunity, but we all know governments and banks will always discourage its use until they find a way to benefit themselves.

i've checked-they are not working yet, but you can subscribe for e-mail when they return the service!

You mean that the only way to do it is to use in-app purchase? I hate apple limitations!! I don't understand, why on mac you can do everything you want, but on iOS devices you are limited..it's not fair!

just one question: if bitcoin rate is unstable, how do you fix your payment? for example, you agreed to receive 1btc for your work as the current exchange rate to USD is 700 for 1. But at the day of settlement rate goes down to 500 USD for 1, what are your actions?
