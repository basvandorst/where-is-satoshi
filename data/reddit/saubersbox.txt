Exactly. I don't see how bitcoin would solve the problem, since bitcoins are also subject to taxation. I guess it maybe easier to hide them from the IRS, but I don't see any potential benefit for people who want to comply.

Bitcoin and derivatives are not mutually exclusive...

A better way to look at it would be the ratio:
(Utility for terrorist to wear shoes)/(Utility for ordinary person to wear shoes). This ratio will obviously be roughly equal to 1. On the other hand the ratio
(Utility for terrorist to use bitcoin)/(Utility for ordinary person to use bitcoin) is much greater than 1, i.e. the utility that bitcoin gives a terrorist is higher than for a normal person.

Would you discredit the nobel prize in physics also because Obama was at war while given the peace prize?

Peter Schiff actually argues that Bitcoin has as little value as fiat currency.

Can someone explain to me why the current price differs by as much as $100 between different sites?

The debt is much less of an issue than the unemployment. The demand for US debt is still strong.

Most economists agree that an inflation rate of around 2-3% is health for the economy.

When buying gold you speculate that the price will rise and you will make a profit from buying low and selling high. It does not give you any other cashflow. Compare this with bonds or stocks that pay dividends.

Nothing will happen to the internet if bitcoin disappears. If gold disappears you cannot produce certain jewelry, electronics etc.

Right, but according to Schiff neither has any intrinsic value

The title is a joke. Maybe you need to read more of Krugman to realize that.

Depends in the trader. A market marker will not increase volatility but speculators night.

No, the unemployment is result of deleveraging in the private markets following the financial crisis. When everyone tries to cut spending at the same time one ends up in a recession. That is the reason why the gov should be spending more now.

It is good that you know econ 101. 
What do you propose instead of capitalism?

Even though I get your point that value is subjective, I don't think a single person would actually say that food or fresh water has no value, since it is needed to survive.
I personally don't think it matters if a currency is backed by something of intrinsic value. What I care about is how well does a monetary system work in practice. As a Keynesian I don't think neither gold standard or bitcoin is a good idea, but I think bitcoin is an interesting economical experiment, and if it works out well I'm willing to change my mind.

Buying gold or bitcoin is speculating, not investing.
