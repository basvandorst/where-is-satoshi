Just sharing my experience, so no one else has to deal with these scumbags

Here is my experience with cex.io
I send them bitcoins 5 months ago. I tried withdrawing cash to a credit card, visa.
It didn't work, so I was blocked and had to go through verification again. They are slow, so it took me 2/3 months to get verified again.
I tried withdrawing to a different credit card, didn't work, I tried withdrawing to a bank account, didn't work.
Now I am permanently banned from making withdrawals of any kind, my money is stuck in their account. They want me to pay them another 20% commission to buy %75 fewer bitcoins than I stated with back from them, and pay them another 80$ or so in commission.
They have not helped once with anything, I have sent them hundreds of emails, they just don't care.
They have treated me like shit, and stolen my money.
DO NOT USE THIS EXCHANGE

They are garbage, they stole my bitcoins, and banned me from withdrawing any of my money.
