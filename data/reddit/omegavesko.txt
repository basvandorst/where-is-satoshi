Just because you don't literally need it to survive doesn't mean you can't be in need of it.

Sure, but you'd still need to wait for them to broadcast the entire 10GB or so of compressed Wikipedia (without images, I think) and then save it somewhere if you want to access it on your own time.

This is exactly what I've been saying for a while now. Bitcoin could cease to exist tomorrow morning and everyone would be switching to a new, better cryptocurrency by the evening. It *is* a lot like the Internet - the specific implementation might not make it (though it's certainly doing well), but the technology will absolutely make it. There's no stopping this once the cat is out of the bag.

Sure, but PayPal can offer extra features on top of that, mainly security. Say you want to buy something on eBay with Bitcoin - if something happens and you need your money back, there's little eBay can do if the money is already in the seller's wallet. However, due to eBay's integration with PayPal, if you sent the money through them, they could deal with the issue.
It's the same reason people use PayPal as a payment method even if the place accepts credit cards as well. You could just punch in your card number, but PayPal is safer.

True. Apple has a history of being extremely stubborn in not doing something just because the competition is doing it, though. There's a reason the iPhone is only 4" (*after* the bump from 3.5") when the Android-based competition starts at about an inch larger than that for flagship phones.


Eh, Apple low-end isn't really low-end in the same way most companies do it. The 5c is a perfectly usable, stable, fast phone. It's not comparable to low-end Android phones that make you want to punch someone in the face after using it for 10 minutes.
They aren't even advertising it as a low-end phone, they're advertising it as a 'colorful' phone that can be customized more than the 5s.


This I can agree with wholeheartedly.

The iPad Mini (concept of multiple sizes in the same range) and the iPhone 5c (concept of selling lower-end hardware at a slightly lower pricepoint) were both pretty big and post-Jobs. The iPhone display size bump was also after his death. Not to mention the huge design direction change with iOS 7.
Hell, I'd argue they changed more in the last two years than they did in the few years before Jobs died. iOS barely changed design-wise while he was in charge, and the hardware design was largely the same as well. The only major innovation Jobs headed since the release of the iPhone was the first iPad.

My girlfriend is in college, she isn't required to have one.
Great, you extrapolated every school in the world from.. two schools? Are you God?
And I wouldn't expect a college to require something like that anyway, they usually expect people to know which tools they need to study and take notes. Very few things in college are 'mandatory'.


'no-one' and 'not everyone' are quite different things. Obviously not everyone requires them, but quite a few schools do these days, especially in western countries.

No such thing as a 'Bitcoin account'. The bot holds your coins for you until you want to transfer it to a wallet.
Of course, you could also tip those coins to someone else without ever transferring it to your own wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:03:24
It's definitely an inherent security issue of smaller altcoins right now, but one not much can be done about (to my knowledge). You can't really stop a pool from mining an obscure altcoin and then stopping abruptly, even if that destroys the coin's value.
I suppose the supporters/owners of the altcoin could go after the pool operator, but it's questionable whether they'd actually be able to do anything about it other than making the community pitchfork them to death. There is no central authority they could go to here.

Google releases all of the code they *can* release under the Apache license, as part of AOSP. The binaries are under the control of hardware manufacturers and Google simply doesn't have the ability to release source code for them.
Firefox OS and Ubuntu-based phones are going to have the same problem, since neither Mozilla nor Canonical have the ability to push around hardware OEMs to that point.

Yeah, I sighed internally when the blurb under BITCOIN 101 was basically "how to print money". I thought we were past this. We need publicity about Bitcoin as a currency, not a trendy way to make money with your PC  overnight.

The actual implementation is easy, yes. The legal implications are not, especially for a large organization like Mozilla.

Pretty sure you can mine any altcoin now as long as you're using a scrypt miner. It would be fairly simple to change the altcoin being mined on the side of the pool operator.
On the other hand, I have no idea how you would mine altcoins using a BTC miner. I thought they were different enough for this to be impossible.

Ah, I love the smell of thinly veiled racism in the morning.
You're offended by the wording of the article, not the message. he's not calling for someone to bomb the White House and kill the president, he *is* calling for change and improvement.

Sure, but how do you figure homeschooling means she won't be in social situations? School is far from the only place to meet people. I'd actually say school encourages the unhealthy type of social interactions.

Yeah, that's the problem. Despite the bloat, it's still the best torrent client on Windows.
Good alternatives are:
- uTorrent 2.x (old versions are fine, it's the newer versions that are sketchy)
- Transmission (also on OS X and Linux)
- Vuze (pretty bloated, but works well)
- Deluge
- qBittorrent
There are probably some I'm forgetting right now, but those are your best alternatives.

OTA updates have nothing to do with the Play Store or even AOSP itself. That's up to the OEM and your carrier, not Google (except for Nexus devices, obviously).

Mining is at its lowest point since 2009 in terms of profitability. Nearly everyone has given up on it, and those who haven't rarely expect to make their investment back.

Unfortunately that isn't something they can do, as much as I'd like it to be. When I said the binary blobs are under the control of hardware OEMs, I was referring to chip manufacturers like Qualcomm and Nvidia, not the companies that design the end product.

Well, for one thing, I *really* don't see Google doing that, but I have seen apps banned for silly reasons from the Play Store, so it isn't out of the question.
