As was proven by the BIP66 fork.

Yes, the mempool is where a miner draws transactions from when constructing a block, so it has to be internally consistent. You're not quite right on how transactions work, though it's an easy misconception to get from block explorers. The block chain itself has no concept of an address balance, any more than it has of a wallet balance; these are synthetic constructs that are tracked in separate databases. A transaction input does not reference an address but rather a specific "coin", in the form of an "outpoint" which is the TXID and index of a previous output. So the first stage of checking an input is simple: either the referenced output is in the unspent set or it isn't. It doesn't matter how many other outputs happen to have been sent to the same address.

More signs of general incompetence and/or malice:  In effect, they user-agent blocked all API client libraries. Also I believe they disabled plain HTTP access to public APIs like the ticker, while their docs still say they work on either HTTP or HTTPS.

Re-send with higher fees can't be implemented wallet-side only, as it's a double spend which is against the relay and block inclusion rules of at least Bitcoin Core. Proposals to look into: Replace By Fee; Child Pays For Parent

They do, mostly. If you're asking why not ALL of them, likely because the fees are still tiny compared to the subsidy, and including transactions has a nonzero cost, mainly in the chance of mining a stale block due to slow propagation.

The problem is they're now statically linking Qt, thereby circumventing desktop customizations. I warned about this before the release, but sadly it's not likely to be fixed -- too many compromises made in the name of binary compatibility.  To fix the systray icon on Unity or KDE 5, one would have to duplicate the appindicator code within Bitcoin-Qt itself.

Thanks. FWIW, I appreciated getting the alert despite the confusing wording. Nice to see the system working.

Correct, RBF makes it easy to double spend zero-conf transactions. But note that first-seen is not a consensus rule -- there's no way to know if a miner followed it just by looking at a block -- so it relies on relays and miners being "honorable", even acting against their own interests if the replacement fee is large. (For example, a couple years back there was a kerfuffle around a double-spend-as-a-service called BitUndo.) So the argument is that RBF makes that incentive explicit and removes a false sense of security.

I got this alert from a node running a custom build of 0.11.0rc3. Bug?
@_date: 2015-07-13 03:19:14
Known issue, and not likely to be fixed in the bitcoin.org releases. Should work if you compile it yourself.

Multisig constructs like green addressing and payment channels can help the instant payments case with pretty low trust. They might not get much interest though as long as zero-conf works well enough.

getinfo reports "errors": "", so I think that means no. I saw it in email from -alertnotify.

Or they show the need to keep the block size where it is, so fees rise enough to prevent this silliness. In other words, they don't convince anyone of anything they don't already believe.

Well, Bitcoin XT is on track to become an altcoin. The only debate now is which will win the support of investors, and which will go the way of most other altcoins.
