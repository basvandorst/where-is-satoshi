LCB can't be expected to protect people from themselves. They do plenty on the site to allow people to protect themselves from scammers. It isn't LBCs job to be your mother.

LOL if you get an STD from a hooker, IT IS YOUR FAULT FOR NOT WEARING A CONDOM!!! you would actually blame the brothel????? wow, dude, you need to learn what personal responsibility is!!

LBC is a very bad metric for BTC demand in Russia. They have a shit ton of unregulated e-money exchange services that also do bitcoin.

LOL, how quickly people forget

1. Not everyone wants or needs escrow. Making it mandatory would punish other people for your idiocy.
2. there is nothing wrong with the reputation system. It even tells you how old the account is.
3. they do this with what resources they have.
4. they do this right across the top of the buy page when the payment method has chargeback risks.
5. there is everything you need right on the feedback page.
6. further verification is bullshit. people shouldn't have to verify themselves more just because you can't be bothered to do your own due diligence. Grow up and stop expecting everyone to take care of you.

People support Ross, because they support personal freedom. People like you, who condemn Ross, believe that your narrow-minded world view should be forced down everyone's throats. The case against Ross is all about the illegal prohibition of drugs in this country. He was made a criminal by the creation of unjust laws that should not be obeyed.

Really, go read something. These arguments are clearly more advanced than your level of education allows you to understand. Start with the US constitution.

I love how in your response to don't actually point out any problems with my statement... all you do is complain about what someone else might have said about Gates... I have never had any love for the guy, and I still wouldn't even if he pushed btc every day. So I fail to see what the hell it matters (in regards to my statement) what other people think about his opinion of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-17 06:48:17
how exactly does localbitcoins suck??? because you are too stupid to use it and got scammed??? something about suckers and their money comes to mind... if you are so careless with your money, you have no one to blame but yourself
LocalBitcoins doesn't need to do any more to "protect users"... you want them to protect you from yourself??? WTF??? 
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:59:25
i've used LBC at least 30 times and have never been scammed. exactly how are they supposed to protect people from themselves short of absurd paypal style controls? you had to ignore several LBC suggestions to do what you did, as well as ignore simple common sense.

Why do people forget that Gates has been behind the curve on every single major tech innovation? 
GUI? missed it and played catch-up to apple. 
Internet and browsers? Missed it and played catch-up to Netscape. 
Music? Apple again. 
Mobile? again, Apple.
Tablets? here caught on early, but could never get it right.
Search (and really everything internet related)? missed it. playing catch-up to google.
If not for the one good decision Bill made in licensing DOS, MS never would have gotten anywhere. They peaked back in the 90s and have been losing ever since. At this point, if Bill says something isn't going to take off, it probably will

it is an undeniable fact that when people get scammed it is almost always their fault... I really still don't understand what you think LBC should have done differently??? they provide all the tools and info (including warnings) that you need to avoid scams. There are scammers on every site. You seem to want a site more like paypal, maybe you should move over to them... you seem to fail to understand that economic freedom requires some responsibility
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:06:58
You are a douche. The murder shit is clearly a crock ALLEGATIONS. You morons just swallow anything the government feeds you. Drug laws are illegal.

without drugs, what's the point of life?
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:25:05
no, they don't hurt LBC's rep. I know about them and really don't understand what you expect LBC to do for you. They have a lot of instructions on how to use the site and how to avoid scammers. They also have escrow and a rating system. You looked at the rating (which, while 100%, apparently only had a few transactions and likely wasn't very old - a dead giveaway for a scammer) and then decided, god only knows why, to not use escrow. LBC did everything they can while maintaining a free and open atmosphere to prevent you from getting scammed. You want a nanny site like paypal to take care of everything and charge absurd fees to do it. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:43:09
several of things are already done... and none of those things would get rid of scammers... what you people don't seem to understand is that scammers can easily overcome all of the shit that you want to ad, while only making headaches for the rest of us... just as paypal and ebay have done over the years
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:28:30
I stopped looking at the price and focus on my quantity... way more satisfying
@_date: 2015-03-20 21:05:34
no need to waste much time trying trying to explain something to an idiot who has probably never even been to the country.
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:58:51
Why would anyone willingly use paypal these days? 
@_date: 2015-03-20 09:38:11
maybe... although there have been two articles already about this being a new policy... we'll see if other exchange services start having difficulty... I just used one and it was fine.
@_date: 2015-03-20 09:16:29
You are spot on. The whole 'separatist' claim they are making is obviously a lie.
@_date: 2015-03-20 04:08:06
Its not FUD. A Ukrainian exchange  (btc-trade.com.ua) hasn't been able to provide Hryvnia denominated withdrawals since yesterday due to their account having been frozen. Do some research before just dismissing something as FUD.
@_date: 2015-03-20 07:37:05
you really have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2015-03-20 08:00:58
or just go to the site... you can read about it in the chat box
@_date: 2015-03-20 02:19:22
should read "bank accounts"
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:01:18
they are freezing the bank accounts of users. They have already frozen the primary bank account of the only local exchange here, preventing users from making fiat withdrawals.
@_date: 2015-03-20 07:28:52
they have already blocked the accounts of the Ukrainian exchange btc-trade.com.ua
@_date: 2015-03-20 08:38:08
I just failed to put 'bank' in the title. It is still correct as it stands. I said freezing accounts, not wallets.
@_date: 2015-03-20 04:11:33
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:05:09
Confused by your logic. They freeze the bank account of the only local BTC exchange, then they make statements about freezing bank accounts linked to Bitcoin. They are making the claim it is because of separatists, but this seems dubious at best.
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:38:49
Because Bitcoin in only for english speakers.

no. that is an internal passport - Ukrainian standard national ID. Every citizen has one of those. I assume the only reason the OP doesn't want to get a travel passport is that he is dodging military service. They are in fact trying to stop people from leaving as they mobilize the army for what appears will be a pretty reasonable war at this point unless something changes. However, bribing people to get a travel passport here is laughably easy. As I said, I have both a ukrainian internal and travel passport and I am not really a citizen. I don't understand why OP doesn't just get some ID on the black market. Its a bit more expensive, but we are talking about 180 BTC
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:14:24
I'm not questioning your story, but I live in Ukraine and getting a travel passport is neither expensive nor difficult. I have one and I'm not even a Ukrainian citizen.
