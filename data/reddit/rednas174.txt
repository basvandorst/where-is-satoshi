Quick question:
How will the upcoming fork change the price of bitcoin and why?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:38:16
I'll just sleep my stress away because fucking none of any website seem to agree on the price (€1000 in difference I'm talking about)

It is me, I bought bitcoin and the bitcoin gods fucking despise me appearantly ._.

But you're saying "if the price doubles, the amount of items doubles" which implies that if the price doubles within a minute, everyone has 2x as much bitcoin, which makes no sense. What you mean is that everyone has twice the worth of bitcoin, but then your whole statememt would be unneccesary

Kind of a dick move right there
