From the tone of your response. I'm not sure you really care to help me, which is in line with your projected lack of intellectual and scholastic integrity. Not a huge surprise really. Also your attempt to sound infallible comes off as silly as the rest of your bullshit. 
You should reassess your reasoning. There are many many factors to consider as to whether the profit Margins for a business will drop. The profit margins for 'legal' dispensaries is already not great, due to regulations and advertising difficulties which are only a few of the problems faced by this growing field. The difficulties and restrictions of owning and operating a dispensary are reason enough that the prices are not going to drop significantly across the board. 
If i was as intelligent as you seem to be, I could grow many pounds for less than ten dollars. Product quality may suffer tho. But seed, soil, water, and sunlight can be allocated for free if you're frugal. You can drag the buds in the sand around your awesome solar panel greenhouse to cure them. Profit margin will definitely drop.
Frankly Dan, you have no clue what will happen to the profit margins. The demand for marijuana and marijuana related products is not likely to be met anytime soon, regardless of your opinion or how much it costs to produce viable product.

Seems like this same thing happened last year though and you just get made fun of. Are you trying to score karma with a lie? It just seems like satire really. Maybe legit maybe not. Seems not.
