Wow, I have Chase too. That really sucks. I hope you unleash legal hell on them because that is definitely what I would do in your situation.

Huh? I wasn't trying to instigate an argument. 
But anyway, can you imagine trying to explain to Joe Redneck the difference between the "bits" unit of measurement and Bitcoin "bits"? It would be just as (if not more) confusing. Metric is actually significantly more prevalent in the USA than people think--due to "metrication" (only SI units on Nutrition Facts, for example)

lots of people in the dogecoin community don't like him, actually.

That's interesting... why do we use signed ints for date instead of unsigned?

I can't tell if you're kidding or not. For example, the industry standard for ISP speeds is "bits per second" in the USA (and probably elsewhere) .... so, anyone who has ever purchased internet or seen an ISP advertisement in the USA has heard of "bits" as data. *Why* would we want to use the same word? Do you honestly think we could easily establish Bitcoin bits, given that bits is already a well established unit of measurement within the same exact technological context that Bitcoin exists in?

I think you missed the point of his post....

I don't want to kill anyone, but I would definitely like the chance to punch Karpeles in his mouth.

Agreed... if someone started talking about how many bits they had I would immediately be thinking data. So will every other person who isn't intimately involved in the Bitcoin community.
Its a good idea, but can we please choose a different name? "Bits" is really cute, but already taken.

The American system is orders of magnitude more complicated and confusing than the metric system, so I don't really get the joke. :)

Kilo- is the SI prefix. The unit is bit. The context overlap is so large that it is how Satoshi came up with the name Bitcoin in the first place.
I guess we will have to agree to disagree.

They already have facilities and bureaucracy setup to store cash funds; they might lose the bitcoins because they don't know what they're doing
