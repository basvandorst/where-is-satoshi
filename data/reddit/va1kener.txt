I did the same. I got you bro
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:38:14
factually incorrect. at this point I imagine the only reason for the few remaining addresses (below 50k) for bcash is buying antminers. otherwise no usecase
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:13:40
Just a reminder: if you are not satisfied with Coinbase (for whatever reason), you can rate their app on the appstore. This is a pretty significant metric 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:48:18
I just bought more
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:53:30

oh, so they were both 20k and 13k at the same time? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:54:50
So where can I set a sell order based on, "bitcoin goes down", "sell litecoin"? Or is this all custom programming using API's? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:33:53
it's already failed. look at how the active addresses are dwindling. it's just a pump and dump penny stock at this point

Reminder: if you disagree with their policies you can rate their app on the app store (have to download it first)

I honestly don't understand this dipping anymore. Imo the KFC news is a signal that a huge company is doing a trial (and marketing) to permanently accept bitcoin payments. Seems to me that the manipulation is strong if this kinda news doesn't make this technology shoot up like a rocket. Sure transaction fees are an issue but this is just temporary. Really disappointing

you need to also understand more about how Chinese scammers work. basically whenever something new comes out there will be lots of copies within a week, cheaper, but quality wise slightly below par. they just are very good at copying. that's not to say that there aren't any very good products from China, there absolutely are (take the antminers for example). but most of the bch nodes sit on alibaba servers in China. that should tell you something
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:35:58
I don't get how bitcoin isn't going up more after the KFC news. Heck, even Peter Thiel coming out in favor of bitcoin. It feels like there are powerful forces at work to keep it low, or is it just me? It just doesn't make any sense. I get the transactions fees and all that. It's legitimate concern. But it's a temporary problem and shouldn't have this much of an affect imo
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:02:12
NEM can be traded for BTC and then turned into fiat both of which would be a sell-off of the prior... but the market can absorb it within a few days/weeks

No tinfoil hats required, good analysis. But Bcash is deemed to fail as in recent weeks the increased block size has shown disadvantages and openings for attacks. Bcash's market share has declined faster than bitcoins and I predict in about 1-2 months it won't be a big topic anymore.

well BCH's only use case is pretty much the buying of antminer's. it's pretty much just empty blocks otherwise so a really slow death spiral
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:27:00
a lot of the early adopters lost their BTC because of hacks etc. so just because you were in early doesn't mean too much. and it went sideways for a lot of those years too
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:14:58
I'm saying by then bitcoin fees won't be an issue anymore with LN and segwit fully implemented
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:19:37
There's been aggressive buying each time it goes sub 10k
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:53:01
it's a global interest though, cryptocurrency. right now bitcoin is having some growing pains which are being addressed by LN and segwit. once that is fully implemented I can only see it go up. unless there's another coin that can offer better features but I don't see it at this point. the worth comes from more and more people buying into it

you're right, I should ahve been more discerning. *some* people in China believe this. I imagine in a corrupt government, it carries down into society and people start believing they must cheat in order to win big. sure it happens here too, perhaps we are just better at hiding our schemes and scams. but I follow a lot of youtubers who live in China and scamming is UNFORTUNATELY widespread there. one of the youtubers is this guy and he has a lot of videos on scams going on, this is a very sad one here: 
it's a huge problem in every-day life. just google "chinese milk powder scandal". that's one reason why many people now buy their milk powder in taiwan.
that's not to say the west doesn't have scams just as much, perhaps just more elaborately. take for example nestle, they killed African babies by advertising their powdered milk better than breast milk and people believed it. 
unfortunately from what I have been learning is that there's quite a bit of this going on in China, especially the cities.

I've heard more knowledgeable people like Tom Lee speak on this topic re: Japan Debt &amp; bitcoin. It's obviously a bit of a conspiracy theory but you're taking yourself way too seriously.
 I guess you're arguing that their massive debt is a *good* thing and somehow that disproves the bitcoin theory. I never stated if their debt was good or bad for the country of Japan. I just mentioned the conspiracy theory that they are supporting bitcoin as a way to pay off their factually *massive* debt in the future. But you're taking yourself way too seriously here for laying into me, "mate". I guess you wrote a thesis on this topic so you're the authority here.

They also are discussing land-seizure of white South African farmers (who own 85% of the farmland). They did this in Zimbabwe in 2000 and as a result:
"Zimbabwe was once so rich in agricultural produce that it was dubbed the "bread basket" of Southern Africa, while it is now struggling to feed its own population."
Can't believe these "leaders"...

Thank you kind sir
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:21:26
this confirms the conspiracy theory that japan is trying to pump bitcoin to pay off their debt. they have huge amounts (gox) and a lot of their citizens hodl. when bitcoin hits $1 million they can easily pay off their debt 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:01:05
I don't think he exaggerates at all. The old cobra was passionate and a die-hard bitcoin defender. The new one is a bitcoin cash shill. It's not exaggerated to think the owners changed.

One interesting comment to Ver's Response:
*Bitcoin.com wallet user’s funds are already secure. Over a billion dollars worth of funds are currently stored with the Bitcoin.com wallet across nearly 2,000,000 wallets. If there was a major security vulnerability with our open source wallet, those billion dollars worth of funds would have already been stolen.*

*Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!
Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!
spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,
a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!
Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!*
With that he seized a great horn from Guthláf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.
*Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!*
Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them
