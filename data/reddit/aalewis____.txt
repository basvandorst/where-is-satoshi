I am so moved, this is totally gonna make a difference
@_date: 2014-02-13 00:14:17
Because I'm not good in python and its harder to set it up on a webserver.  PHP is supported pretty much everywhere.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:35:39
don't like your kind son, get prepared for the downvotes.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:47:36

@_date: 2014-04-11 03:21:14

@_date: 2014-04-11 04:39:02

Yeah it is cool.  No chargebacks like gaypal so scamming people is ridiculously easy with a little SE.

@_date: 2014-04-03 16:59:50
I know them, the one you use is retarded and barely makes sense.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:54:19
That was one of the threads that legitimately made me cringe
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:26:35
I hope I get a lot of btc today lol
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:51:23

@_date: 2014-03-07 05:33:36

@_date: 2014-03-24 06:07:31
what a faggot you could have been rich
@_date: 2014-01-20 03:58:04
I hate paypal too, so now I buy hacked accounts and cash them out into bitcoins.  Like a double fuck you to them while supporting the underground bitcoin economy at the same time :)
@_date: 2014-04-03 07:23:07
how the fuck does shitting in a park have anything to do with communication lol?  Maybe if the person be yelling shit to your face you can punch him I guess, but I don't get how shitting in a park ties in to this.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:13:18

thanks gave the op some decent advice.  I couldn't recover the original post despite searching everywhere though.
@_date: 2014-04-03 07:57:41
welcome to reddit, where exposing hypocrisy gets you downvotes because people know it's true.

how does this work?  I still need the full blockchain and extra db to view address balances?
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:09:51

@_date: 2014-04-07 08:10:42
No it's a cool bot and it doesn't cause any trouble.  Stop being such a whining little faggot.  You can ignore users if you don't like them; take problems into your own hands and don't go crying to the mods about every little thing that annoys you or that you don't appreciate.
@_date: 2014-04-13 23:00:22
Couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2014-04-03 09:09:55
No I don't need one.  I use a different email address for every site I go on.  you should solve problems on your own instead of whining to the mods to take care of you.
@_date: 2014-04-11 06:17:07
It's going up again now at 402 usd :)

Technically they could, but it wouldn't be very safe or reliable.

it's a hugely popular site so yeah.
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:59:49
What a disgusting person, I would love to do some things to him that I unfortunately can't mention because it will get me banned. (the d-word)
@_date: 2014-02-11 06:40:31
no PHP :/
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:58:42
I thought this used the electrum network, I see I was wrong.  So besides the full blockchain nothing else is required right?  No additional 100GB database like blockexplorer needs?
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:42:53
One thing leads to another, this is a very dangerous path to be taking.  This is just like censorship, if you start censoring one thing, eventually you can gradually start getting away with more and more until everything gets reversed.  Tor is an anonymous, free network where one's experience should not be influenced or controlled by how much money they can dish out. For now people may think it's a good idea and support this, but you'll see what can happen in a few years where pretty much everyone is forced to pay to use tor. It's just like what the ISP's are doing, letting you pay more money to access some sites quicker but eventually making all sites slower so that you are forced to pay. Not to mention how much this can reduce anonymity if the users don't tumble their bitcoins and buy from a clearnet source with their real info. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:26:56
If you looked at my post history you would guess the opposite
