Chase freedom? At least you'll net 1.5 points per a dollar. And then later open up a chase sapphire when you want to travel, etc. You can transfer the points.

Even if they get our passwords, what about the 2-way authentication using sms and Google authenticator?

Okay, but what if he needed that money for an emergency?
No need to call him a pussy.

2 way authentication man!
Someone has to have my phone sms card to log into my email.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but cash advance requires a pin for your CC correct? It's practically using your CC like a debit card.

From the list I read, my Android devices are not affected by this vulnerability, correct me if I'm wrong. So I'll continue to do everything on my mobile devices I guess.

Bmore was being informative and giving a life lesson he learned. His post are useful.
I don't feel like yours adds anything, just saying.

So if a kid truly believes in something like global warming, we shouldn't give them a voice because of age discrimination?
If it's black and white, proven that you're using a kid to sell snake oil, shame on you. 
All I'm saying this is a grey area, one that isn't easy to navigate and age shouldn't discriminate someone from speaking up about what they truly believe in.
EDIT: Clarified first sentence.
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:48:01
Isn't it kind of black and white there? If you understand the meaning that is.

I don't want to get into the political aspect of it, this is the wrong sub-reddit to prove what's right about global warming and what's wrong. 
I said early, in many cases it's not right to use children to expose people's empathy. But in the case of Greta, there's a part of it where she's speaking for herself and her generation to a problem she believes is affecting them in a negative way. It just so happens the party that is giving her that voice is political which I can understand to some can come off as propaganda.

We're not talking about wealth here, we're talking about the planets health.

Sure, but that's not the point. Age discrimination. Why? I'm pretty sure there are 16 year Olds that are far smarter and wiser than the majority of 26 year Olds.
If the subject they're advocating about is a grey area, what does age have to do with it?
So if you had a kid that was Greta's age who shared all of your beliefs, went up and spoke their mind, we should dismiss that person because of their age?
What if we all found out you were 14 and you wrote that reddit comment about how you feel about global warming. Should we all shit on it because you are 14 or should we attempts to pick it apart by trying to prove it wrong? Should we all accuse you of being raised in a brainwashed broken system? I say no!

In most cases I agree, but I believe the issue about Global Warming has to do with Adults putting their own convenience and screwing the next generation over. In this case, at least the next generation gets to try and work things out with the current generation.
