I always accept any payment or debt in MANY MANY different cryptos so should the person choose... Unfortunately there isn't as many people as I like that deal with crypto. It needs to be more mainstream.

I'm using it as currency. Many business except it as payment. It's still currency...
I would agree more people are using it for investments... However as long as some people are using it for currency it's technically still currency.

Dead? Lmao the markets say otherwise. Look at the trading volume.

Well not spacifcly I don't have much BTC, I have alot of other cryptos but that's mostly from accepting them as payments. I didn't like the idea of using them as a investment rather than actual currency. I think the whole investing thing is what makes the price not stable.
I just REALLY disagree with the headline lol.

You can follow all the BTC transactions however if they convert it to a crypto like monero the trail ends there...
That wallet address has been associated with wannacry too so I assume they will be safe about their withdraw.

Depends on your definition of stable. Stable from massive fluxuations like what 6 months now. Stable from smaller fluxuations days.

This is a awesome way to spread awareness.

Yea I didn't even think of that, would've been downvoted to hell in this sub if it wasn't lol

Never said it was the future, said it wasn't dead. Crypto will be the future, probably not bitcoin itself though.

I was like WTF? But then I read the article. Lol

There's no such thing as a stable currency* the value of the USD fluctuates all the time on the world market... Same with everything.

Investing is what causes it to be unstable. It's a currency not a damn stock.
