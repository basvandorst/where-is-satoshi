The story wasn't about a man who allegedly lost 7.5 million BTC; it was about someone who allegedly lost 7.5 **thousand** BTC.

How had I forgotten. Dr. Gene Ray, Wisest Human. It all makes so much sense.

In this stage of extremely early adoption, Bitcoin with it's relatively tiny market cap is still the small fish in the pond compared to many fiat currencies. It only makes sense that, through the growth of the protocol and all of the volatility that mass adoption will entail, the prices of most goods listed in BTC are pegged to USD/Euro/CNY/etc. amounts. 
If Bitcoin ever becomes a major player in the global financial game, we will doubtless see more prices for good pegged to BTC amounts instead of the other way around.

Localbitcoins actually has a neat function that allows you to verify without having to bring any electronic devices along. Once you initiate the transaction and the seller funds the transaction using the site's escrow, you will be given a secret code that only you know, not the seller. Once he signals to the site to release the funds because you've paid him, the site reveals the secret code to him as well as proof that the funds have been released to your account.

The differentiating factor here is that those items aren't software that is being actively improved, patched, and updated by a large development team. They couldn't evolve, and were thus rendered obsolete. With Bitcoin, that's not the case.

Just make sure to take advantage of ant additional security features that are offered, such as 2FA, and of course use a strong password on the site.

I did read the article; I was pointing out that in this case, the business hires bitpay so they are able to accept bitcoin directly, even if they don't handle the bitcoin before it is converted. All the customer needs to do in a situation like this is walk in with bitcoin, as the seller is bearing the onus of taking care of the conversion, even if they are hiring it out to a company like bitpay.
That would be like if a business hired a teller to sit at the counter and accept paper yen and yen from any Japanese bank account, then convert that yen into USD. In that case, you as a buyer could walk in with yen in any form and pay thanks to a service the business has hired, and it would certainly be fair to say they accept yen. This seems like what has happened in the article - as a bitcoin user, you don't have to sign up with any company like MasterCard to spend it in this case. The buyer doesn't have to have a 'Bitpay card' or anything, just access BTC.

This isn't really an ideal analogy. 
The hypothetical business in question accepts yen converted by MasterCard to USD, but you can't walk into the store with paper or coin yen and pay, presumably. 
In the case of the dealership, it sounds like you **can** just walk in with bitcoin and buy a car with those bitcoin; the dealership bears the responsibility of converting (or in this case, hiring bitpay to convert).
