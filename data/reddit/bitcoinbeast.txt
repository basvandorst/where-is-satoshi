This is a little project i am working on.. i call it the bitcoin beast.
I am contacting companies and businesses to get donatations of hardware, and im also buying some dedicated bitcoin mining machines.
Im not really do it to make money, mostly for fun. I just want to build some crazy computer that no one around me can figure out what it does... but it looks cool!
What do you think reddit.. any suggestions?

Hmm this is very interesting.. it would certainly be possible to manipulate the market with bitcoin by doing thousands of useless transactions from one account to another, making it seem as though bitcoin was being used more.
Although as wserd mentioned there are zero trading fees with using bitcoin and Okcoin, and its possible to transact bitcoin without any fee's, making it possible for computers to automatically trade millions of small transactions without any cost and fairly less risk then forex trading for example.
I have only watched the prices a bit, but from what ive seen it can change 3 - 10$ in a few minutes and goes up and down often, it would be possible to make a decent income just from trading with it like you would with forex, buy low and sell high.
Hard to stop manipulation of pricing through fake transactions but i guess its possible.
Thats probably the biggest problem with bitcoin, is all the hackers and people trying to rip the system because its not governed by laws, just by automatic systems. The question is can the bitcoin community come up with a fool proof system that can stop all this automatically with a computer algorithm, without oversight from a government body.

haha.. i just like the look of it :)
I have some usb miners, i think a rig like this would be good for upgrading in the future, as you can replace each usb stick as they get old, and im sure better ones will be available in the future.
Although yes it wont make much, but it does look cool.. i think i will get many women by having this lol..

I wish i was rich i would chuck him some cash.. although it sounds like a very silly move to borrow money to invest in something so risky.. feel sorry for him.
