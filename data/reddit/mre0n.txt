how could Bitcoin be adopted and used at a global scale without regulation?  if BTC allows and continues to facilitate illegal and harmful transactions, then it should for sure be banned or regulated. if you are scared of regulation... you have already lost

craig and the rest of the BSV community will be laughing in the faces of those who do not see the truth. just wait for the flippening.

if you actually think that BTC is going anywhere near McAfree's predictions, you are lost and need to seek help. With the current way that BTC is structured, the technology and blockchain would never be able to handle global transactions. NO SCALING. BSV is the real BTC.

what a poor soul :/. you clearly dont understand the fundamental principles of BTC and see how this scamcoin can not scale whatsoever. and as the block reward halves in 2020 making the block reward around 6 BTC, miners will have no incentive and they will move as a result, making transactions take forever to be confirmed because of the hash power needed and fewer miners, making transaction fees higher, diminishing BTCs value and over all use when most of the market cant even move their own coins. SegWit was the worst thing to ever be implemented into BTC, not seeing the flaws in this currency shows how idiotic and delusional most of the BTC community is. the days are numbered for BTC it is alarming how many of you choose to follow something you have ZERO knowledge about.

look into bsv

Craig Wright is Satoshi, after he proves it in court using the first key from the first block of BTC, and publicized on national tv, BTC will plummet. BTC has zero scaling capability and with BSV already achieving block sizes of 1 GB its clear to see which one will be victorious and which one will actually be adopted for global transactions. Do not let people discourage you from buying BSV (the real bitcoin), listen to Craig and his speeches to actually understand his work and technology behind this powerhouse.
