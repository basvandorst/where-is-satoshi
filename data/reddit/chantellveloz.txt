Yeah same here. I wonder if Spotify would go down the road as well. Maybe not in the near future but it would be nice to have this feature on their App as well.

Can't go wrong with more adoption. Well, in most cases to be more accurate.

Yeah I had a similar thought as well and I think it is. Correct me if I'm wrong but the only difference is that Localbitcoins allows you to trade local currency for bitcoin but in Bisq you can trade it for other cryptocurrencies as well.

Situation summed up in eight words. Well Done Sir!

So according to your analogy, every dollar we spend is accounted to as 'debt' right? 
@_date: 2019-03-06 05:49:57
It hurts but that's the truth.

Heard that the 'bluetooth' feature could open up new ways to attack the wallet. What are your thoughts on this?

Well that's true. But there has to be a rule to govern the amount or number of posts that can be made regarding online shops accepting bitcoin. It should be like 'one and done' for now since we are not seeing many posts stating online shops accepting BTC. But there will come a point where the mods have to put their foot down and come up with a rule.

When you say 'equivalent processes in cryptocurrency', what processes do you exactly have in mind? QE is essentially buying Government bonds worth a lot of money which affects the economy thereby lowering the interests offered by the Bank. I get why this is done, to regulate the money flow through a suffering economy but which process is this similar to in the cryptocurrency world?

Well said but 'no one' using it quite inaccurate. First off, Facebook is one of Insta's competitors. I know Facebook owns Instagram and when I say compete, Facebook is competing against Insta for users and the amount of time they spend using the app. It's not fighting for revenue but for viewership and usage. 
Secondly, Twitter, LinkedIN, Whatsapp to name a few are massive in the world right now and are giving FB a run for their money. There will be competitors for Bitcoin too but cryptocurrency is a whole other ballgame and as of now they are in the lead and look the brightest.

Good point. Serves him right for calling us 'charlatans'. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 05:57:47
Exactly. To most of us who read it in the news, a few Billion as a penalty seems to be a fair punishment but in all fairness that is a small price to pay for what they've done.

Well said. Calling him a dictator isn't precise. He just isn't the leader the people of Venezuela need. They are in a state of crisis at the moment. They have been devastated for years by hyperinflation and a failing economy. And since the opposition made a stand against him back in January, things have took a turn for the worse.

Thanks for the mention.I will certainly check it out.
@_date: 2019-03-05 05:14:17
Well that's accurate.

They published another article that states 95% of the volume. 
95% IS more than 80%.

I'll be honest here that looks like shit...what the hell happened to designers?

LocalBitcoins or P2P on WazirX. Most of the good exchanges are down due to the ban placed by RBI
