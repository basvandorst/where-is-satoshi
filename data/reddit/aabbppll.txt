I read in another post that it would take 1 miner 7 years so I was wondering if putting 7 machines together could solve a block by itself.

I did a similar trip last year, 1000km between Orleans and Narbonne. Took me 30 days, didn’t lose a pound on the trip with all that wine and cheese I ate. I used to be a bike courrier in Montreal, winter we’re hard, especially when it’s wet everywhere. Very hard to keep heat in these conditions. Good Job!

I’d be a lurker because it’s would be very hard for me to improve, I also keep all my secrets to myself
