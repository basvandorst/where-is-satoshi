A partial answer to the question in the title is: it's risky and there can be unintended consequences.
"Since the mid-1990s, monetary authorities in most large developed countries have backed away from foreign-exchange intervention—buying and selling foreign currencies to influence exchange rates. Switzerland’s recent experience goes a long way to illustrate why: Foreign-exchange intervention did not afford the Swiss National Bank with a means of systematically affecting the franc independent of Swiss monetary policy, and it left the Bank exposed to foreign-exchange losses. To affect exchange rates, central banks must change their monetary policies."
"Foreign-exchange interventions cannot systematically influence exchange rates independently of a country’s monetary policy; and, less obviously, focusing monetary policy on an exchange-rate objective can potentially conflict with price stability."

Not exactly.
A bitcoin address is the Base58Check encoding of a 25-byte binary bitcoin address.
In a 25-byte binary address:
The first byte is the version byte (0x00 for bitcoin main network)
The next 20 bytes is a hash of the public key
The last four bytes are a checksum of the version byte + hash.
