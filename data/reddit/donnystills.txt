Well, no.
This post was not about my own preference.  I'm extending my apprehension to others who I'm sure feel the same as I do.  We cheer from the sidelines, but we don't join the game.  If I'm right, it will keep bitcoin from growing, and it will certainly not be worth my individual effort.
I'm still optimistic, though.  If it scales to something that is usable in mainstream society, I'll be in then.. which means I'll have missed out on the early game.  I'm alright with that.

I suppose the definition of 'own' is vague or misunderstood.  Or maybe the definition is in need of an update due to the nature of information and technology today.
Having exclusive access to the means by which a certain resource is used is a form of ownership.
As far as I understand it, bitcoins only exist on the public ledger.  The bitcoins in our wallet are not actually there.  The wallet is merely a way of informing us of how many bitcoins we are able to control.
So, even though the balance in my wallet is merely information of my relation to the public ledger, those bitcoins in my wallet are under my exclusive control.
just because they are not literally in my possession, that does not mean that I do not own them.
Under communism, nobody and everybody owned the means of production.  But that itself was meaningless.  Those who had control over the means of production (i.e., the party) had exclusive control of how they were to be used.  In reality, the party owned the means of production while keeping up the narrative that no individual really owned anything.

That was very '90s.  Movies and TV had better production quality, but doing a video on-the-cheap produced stuff like that.
