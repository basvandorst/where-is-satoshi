Well, no. It can be addressed, but the problem is staunchly political.
The real problem is the centralized nature of fiat payments.
We would need some kind of decentralized peer-to-peer fiat payment system, because that would automatically also solve the problem of centralized bitcoin exchanges.
The real problem is that entrepreneurs in this field still want to get along with governments and their imbecile, self-defeating "regulations". If entrepreneurs just ignored these regulations, and worked their way around them, the problem would have been solved already. 
It is the same problem as with Uber. If Uber just ignored the "regulations", they would be much further already.
Governments are opposed to any solution that does not include opportunities giving them more power over the transactions and the users.  This requires centralization, in order to duly include thefting opportunities. 
These thefting opportunities, however, will not be limited to just government officials. Other attackers will exploit them too.
Centralizing governments are in turn kept in power by the masses of gullible ("Trump") voters, because these utterly dumb masses really believe their propaganda.
It is the aggregate false belief of the dumb masses in the good intentions of centralized thefting organizations ("governments") that gives them their power, including the power to impose centralized thefting opportunities onto bitcoin exchanges.
That is what we are really up against.
We can certainly solve the problem, but it will require completely disbelieving in the legitimacy of "regulations" that would force us to include official thefting opportunities into bitcoin exchanges.
So, the solution first and foremost requires lots and lots of disbelief, and acting upon disbelief.
