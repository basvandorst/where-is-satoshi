In cryptography, there is a distinction between:
* Confidentiality: Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob; no one other than Alice and Bob can view the message.  Verbs such as "encrypt" and "decrypt" are used here.
* Authentication: Alice sends a message to Bob; Bob is certain that the message was sent by Alice.  Verbs such as "sign" and "verify" are used here.
There is no confidentiality in Bitcoin ("encrypt" and "decrypt" aren't used anywhere in the protocol).  In other applications of public key cryptography which provide confidentiality (eg. PGP encrypted email), you are exactly right; public keys are used to encrypt and private keys are used to decrypt.
In Bitcoin's case, we only worry about authentication; your private key is used to sign messages and your public key lets others verify that your signature is valid.  My [ELI5 comment above]( explains the mechanics of how this works, and I'll probably write a blog post soon about how the math actually works.

Thanks for pointing this out; was an oversight on my part.  It's fixed now.

Thanks for the tip and the kind words.  As I said in the introduction, it took a lot of research for me to finally grok the concepts, so don't be discouraged.  I'll try and post more regularly now that summer is over, so stay tuned :)

A not-quite-5-year-old level analogy:
Imagine we have a billiards table.  The cue ball always starts in the same place and you always hit it at the same angle.  You make it bounce 25 times, it goes all over the place, and it's 26th bounce hits the left rail exactly 4.12553 inches down the table.  Your "private key" is 26 (number of times the ball bounced), and your public key is 4.12553.  You can tell the world "my special number is 4.12553" and it's really hard for others to figure out exactly how many times the cue ball bounced to get to that position.
Why go through all this rigamaroll?  It can prove that you, the holder of the private key 26, authored a particular message.  Essentially, you write your message on the cue ball, send it bouncing down the table 26 times, and when the message/cue ball ends up 4.12553 inches down the table, people know it was you who wrote it.  No one else can place the cue ball at that same spot.
How does this relate to bitcoin?  When someone sends you bitcoin, they say, "I give 5 bitcoins to the person who can hit the cue ball 4.12553 inches down the table".  If you ever want to spend these coins, just write a similar message and send it on your cue ball, bouncing 26 times until it gets 4.12553 inches down the table.

Yea, I'm happy with everything except for that section.  I may try and refine it over time, but there's no replacement to getting a pad and paper and going through some of the calculations yourself.  Is there a specific part that you're hung up on?

That is exactly correct.

The designers of secp256k1 picked this point.  Every point on the curve must be some multiple of the generator point, and the total number of points on the curve must be prime (so we can make use of the extended euclidean algorithm, which transforms fractions into integers).  It's really hard to create new curves which meet these requirements (because the numbers in use are really really big), so it makes sense for application developers to use established, peer vetted curves instead of creating their own.

Hello, Simon. Life got in the way, and this is one of the things I had to drop.  Thank you so much for resurrecting it; that's really cool.  Next few months will continue being really busy for me, but I'll get back to my research and content writing sometime in 2016.  I have some really cool ideas germinating....can't wait to get back at it.  Until then...to the moon ;)  (do people still say that?)
