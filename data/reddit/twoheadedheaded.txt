Trezor is the best imo, I even wrote s brief review on it if you want to take a peek. 
Does contain aff link.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:57:54
My preferred list. Kucoin is by far the best imo
Although idk if kucoin supports Norway yet so you maybe have to go to cryptopia for alts, pm me for any questions or ask here
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:27:06
Couple of basic guides available there including one about getting started.
Pm me if you need help

Is this extension legit? Lots of chrime extensions with tracking/phishing built into them lately.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:14:55
Sounds like alot of bitter FUD to me.
But who knows, btc is seeming to lose it's place as king, maybe the coin itself will lose value as the next gen of cryptos take hold?
Who's to say though, it's a speculative market and anyone who claims to know what's coming down the pipe is either lying or selling something.

That means if a single exchange gets hacked then millions can lose their btc. That's why I use a hardware wallet like

Also consider checking out my list of recommended exchanges for btc and alts 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:07:40
 Binance definitely, try Kucoin
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:33:59
You need to get on exchanges
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:09:19
That's also inaccurate, but if you want to hate that's cool.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:16:33
I'd avoid changelly in general, and kraken honestly, lots of trouble from both lately, sorry to hear about the trouble bud :(
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:37:52
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:26:07
This is why I use good exchanges 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:53:02
 best exchanges
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:14:12
Cool scam
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:53:03
Scam is losing value, problem?
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:51:29
Really glad to see someone not hoarding all their btc.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:54:17
If you like alts go for kucoin imo, but be careful, lots of bad projects. If you wanna do alts you'll need to do alot of research.
If you want to see my list of recommended exchanges you can see it here

Most people are fine on LBC, just not worth the risk for me personally.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:52:37
Gemini or coinbase, if you do coinbase you can link PayPal and sell with it directly deposited to the PayPal account.  I'd avoid localbitcoin, it's full of scams
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:42:12
I use affiliate links to pay for the site and part of my time, which is why I don't have ads.
These are the exchanges I prefer and I stand behind my recommendation.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:48:52
Definitely kucoin, see 
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:44:38
Normal bittrex is kind of a scam too lol 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:57:09
Use Kucoin or binance instead 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:16:50
I disagree.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:19:18
Eth is definitely very promising. And I agree, I think alot of people just don't get the whole "digital currency thing", especially alot of old school investors, but you've got to remember that many of these folks started out trading out on the floor.

Other good crypto news - 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:56:40
Gemini imo,
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:54:20
Kucoin is definitely competitive to binance, I honestly prefer it tbh, I wrote a brief list of preferred exchanges here

That's why I never use kraken, use a more stable exchange -

15th time this was posted today bud

Broken English but claims to be crytography expert, hmm.

I'm seeing a lot of "how do I do this" posts so I'm hoping to fill the information Gap for some folks here, any ideas or comments welcome!
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:57:15
Those are shit coins? I'm sure you probably prefer verge and garliccoin.
PS just because it isn't mainstream shill news doesn't mean it's garbage, take the time and research.

I think we need to definitely rewrite the script for how charities work, there's too many bloated, useless charities waiting to snatch up money and spend it on nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:49:32
Wait you mean a slightly modified version of btc that also happens to be way more centralized isn't the solution to all the scaling problems? /s
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:49:40
It's awesome but it really doesn't free people who believe but couldn't invest, think of those of us who don't have speculation money.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:26:03
I'd also strongly consider the gerson institute, they're amazing
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:22:23
We REALLY need a community based crypto advocacy group to lobby for fair laws so it doesn't become an agonizing process to purchase btc + require the government snooping through every transaction, I've been talking to a few others in the IRC and discord channel to hopefully get some movement on this, but I know we could use some funding for not only legal counsel but also to help establish as a nonprofit and so forth and to help bring some other interested parties on board.
Shoot me a pm if anyone is interested, especially if you have ideas on helping to build this from the ground up, you can almost always find me in the  irc channel too.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:32
Idk how anyone could ever trust bch, it's clearly junk
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:57:57
Bitfinex Is junk anyway :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:22:18
Hurr it went up recently so it's better
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:58:39
Glad to see this post, unfortunately I'm pretty broke or I'd give you a whirl.
Best of luck mate, always happy to see some freelance talent.

Yea I respect that, but the freedom part is more or less applicable to those who turned hundreds into millions and now have actual freedom.
Grinding every day of your life to get buy, but having a better/different currency isn't really freedom.
I am a big btc believer partially because its a big reallocation of wealth, but what does that do for the layman exactly? Genuinely curious here.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:51:55
20k by January after a 2-5k bounce during the futures release.

I love RP but he is definitely very cautionary when it comes to speculative investments, which isn't what all the get-rich-quick people want to hear.
Like wutang says, protect ya neck
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:27
With a speculative market obviously it could drop crazy far, but it could also moonshot to 50k this year, that's kind of the nature of volatile markets with lots of young money
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:29:04
Lol @ all the shills and fudsters crying
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:56:58
Yeah you should have a transaction log so you can keep track of your coins, if not then you're in trouble
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:15:05
Because random speculative value =/= usability and function
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:59:07
Bch is centralized and super manipulatable, I'm sure you can make money swing trading it but it's junk
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:49:21
Good luck buddy, I've had a few family and friends diagnosed with cancer thatve all survived it so far, shoot me a pm some time if you need any advice on nutrition tips that I've seen help fight cancer.
Stay strong
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:50:10
It's reliable still, just very slow and costly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:01:35
Ltc is better than both as far as functionality goes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:35:47
Kinda like we need centralized coins spread across multiple platforms to prevent manipulation. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:06:50
That's kinda what I'm asking...
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:54:38
CB locks in your price at the purchase time, basically for you, you'll already have made a bit of gain by the time you get the coins.
Grats :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:21:59
It can take more than a week for a transfer, sit tight.
