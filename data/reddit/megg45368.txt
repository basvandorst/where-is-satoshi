I remember when Bitcoin was $30 and that was too high :\
No joke. It was this new thing at the time, I was like: "Wow this is some cool shit. Too bad it's too expensive though and only idiots will use it. I mean the idea sounds cool but I don't see this going anywhere"
And then the years passed by, and I was right for the most part throughout all those years, but eventually Bitcoin is now worth over $2k. I don't fully understand how because Bitcoin is as buggy and as difficult to use as it was before, despite all the new years.
It is hard for me not to bash Bitcoin because it is very unconventional and there's no good app/wallet/company/exchange that I would fully trust with confidence

Bitcoin is pretty much a ponzi scheme, the people that came in earliest have the most money in bitcoin, and then they hold it to sell it to people years later for more money. These new owners now do the same thing, they hold thinking it will rise, and sell it when it does.

Nah, I think BTC will hover around 2k, going up and down for a few years. It's still hard AF to get and not very convenient to use.

Ha, I was there when this meme "HODL" meme was born. I don't remember it being this thread though, or maybe the guy changed the post? What I remember is that the guy wrote a serious post, but just mispelled "Hold", and then people started posting memes afterwards. 
Yeehh 2013, fuck those were the good days. I've had coins hacked from the online sites I stored them on, and I knew tons of others who lost their coins as well. Fuck. Monay down the drain. Oh well. I've also met people IRL who had tens of thousands of bitcoins, where are they now?

The thing about Bitcoin is every fucking Bitcoin exchange sucks dick. There is not a good one, and there has never been a good one. It's because of the way Bitcoin is inherently traded and handled. I have seen so much shit with bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin wallets, bitcoin stores, and bitcoin software. The idea is great and all, but fuck it is so hard to get our act together because it's not easy to use, and it has never been easy to use.

Eh, I have met people with tens of thousands of Bitcoins IRL. I have a YouTube video where I went to a Bitcoin event and one of the dudes worked for a very large Bitcoin company that every Bitcoin person uses, he was paid in Bitcoin, and he had more than 60,000 bitcoins in his wallet.

Came here to talk about the same thing. Most likely this isn't going to happen. BTC is going to flatten and stay at around $2k. It might even fall below $2k, but it will go up and flatten, then stay in that range for a year or two. 
The reason for this? BTC is hard as fuck to use, and hard as fuck to get. Plus once you have it, it's hard to keep it, plus any number of things can happen and you lose it. It's like having a piece of gold in a locked chest in the hallway of a mall. The locked chest is your only security, and thousands of people go down that hallway every day.
Your BTC can be there one moment, and then gone the next. It is one of the least stable currencies that has ever come out.

Bitcoin can for sure be stopped. Take out the Internet and all the computers connected to the blockchain and voila, no more Bitcoin.
