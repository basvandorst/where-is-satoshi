While Coinbase is among the easiest ways to deposit USD, two drawbacks: One, to buy BTC, transactions within your first month will take about a week, and you will not be able to sell within that period. Two, any time you sell BTC, they send you the USD immediately via ACH. So if you go to fiat, you cannot jump back in quickly. CampBX is similar in terms of ease of deposit, but also allows you to store fiat in the account.

Corrupt employees or even armed robbery are other, possibly larger, risks.

How can I know that a paper wallet service is trustworthy (open source, thoroughly vetted, not scamware)?

Once all the coins are mined, who will verify transactions? Why?

I use a custom email that is not simply campbx and that has not been used anywhere else, and that had only been in use for two weeks, so it's highly likely there was a breach at CampBX.
Edit: and I received the phish.

That's not realistic because of chargeback claims, but I'll settle for cash deposits at several major banks.

Retailers need multiple confirmations before allowing the customer to leave with the goods (or at least they need to get ID or backup payment). Doesn't that make most retail transactions impractical?

FFS, use two-factor authentication!
