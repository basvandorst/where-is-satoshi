Those are responses from Gox's lawyers, not the court. It's quite expected that they would "parrot" what Mark is telling them; they're defending him.

as one of the people owed money by mt.gox, I want to thank you and all your legal team for the awesome work that you're doing. I think there's a good chance those 200k BTC would not have been disclosed if you hadn't taken the legal action you did.

In what sense? These are the documents sent to the court by the Gox and mtgoxrecovery lawyers.

Suppose the lawsuit against mt.gox is successful. Some account holders were only holding Bitcoin (no fiat money) at the time the site closed; are they likely to get anything back? If so, how is the value of those coins likely to be calculated?

You're retarded.

Me too. Replicant looks like the best option for a Free Software phone right now - it's the best I can recommend. The Free Software Foundation are backing it, which is a good sign. Hopefully more people will start looking at this: while we have pretty good free operating systems for desktops/laptops now, the same can't really be said about phones and tablets, and the popular proprietary phone/tablet OSes are arguably much worse (in terms of freedom) than the desktop ones.

Richard Stallman [has been writing about this stuff]( and promoting Free Software for years, and he's called an extremist for his views. I think that's true to an extent - I don't personally agree with all his tactics. But the sad fact is that he really does have a point.
When you use non-free software you put yourself at the mercy of the author of the software - you can only do what they allow you to do, and you have to trust they are not abusing that power to do things like invade your privacy. People talk about "jailbreaking" their phones but I bet few people stop to think of the implications of that word - that unless you do that, your phone is placing you in a jail.
Switching from Apple to Android might solve the problem for now. Who's to say Google won't do the same thing in a few months time? You have not solved the problem and freed yourself, merely switched to a different slave master. If you really want the freedom to do what you want with your phone, you need to switch to something like [Replicant](
[Here's a video]( of Richard Stallman talking about Free Software in the context of Bitcoin in case anyone wants to hear more.

A disgrace to humanity is what you are, you fucking autistic piece of shit.

Thanks for the reply.


But how do you know this exactly? Surely it's up to the court to decide this, and isn't there the possibility that the court will say: "pay all the people to whom you owe actual fiat money, those Bitcoin things are worthless"?
ie. You could have a situation where Gox's remaining Bitcoins are sold to sell its fiat creditors, with "Bitcoin creditors" left in the dirt?

Another Gox address?

Sorry, I was confused. I meant [Replicant]( not F-Droid.

This is probably the number one thing that really ought to be done. From the reports we've seen, chances seem good that Karpeles has personally run off with the "missing" Bitcoins. If that's true, he may be hoping that the obscurity and technical complexity of the system will allow him to get away with it.

Okay; can you elaborate?
The download page on [bitcoin.org]( links to Sourceforge for downloads. Is that the wrong site?
@_date: 2013-05-23 01:43:26
Thanks; I've read quite a bit about Bitcoin over the past few weeks but I wasn't aware of this. To put my mind at ease, you're saying I haven't lost all my Bitcoins, right?
EDIT: Thank you so much!

I'm not too ashamed to say I've spent the past ~30 minutes freaking out because I thought I just lost $300 :-)


Ah yes, I can see this. I didn't realise there was a debug console. Neat.
listaddressgroupings shows me the change address. Are you sure the 100 change addresses are created on install? I've already thought far enough ahead to have created a backup of my wallet file on an external USB stick, and if the change addresses are created on install that's fine, but if they're created on demand then that isn't going to be a very useful backup.


I already did this, but thanks for the tip.
