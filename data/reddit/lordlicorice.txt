If I were that guy I'd totally keep the key around. In 10 years everyone's going to have forgotten about this whole affair and you'd be able to withdraw your 5 bitcoin at 1,000USD with nobody noticing.

I played once and made $100. So, it's a net win for me.
Anyway, for people who enjoy gambling, the odds are vastly better than even Roulette, so it's perfect for them.

Your points about trust are valid. If you can get coins anonymously, that's better. But you're an idiot not to transfer your coins to your own wallet after buying them. It takes 2 minutes.
If you really want to lock something up, put your wallet on a flash drive.

Coinbase just asked me for my bank login and password.

Chances are, if a guy with a badge starts shooting your friends, it's because they're committing a crime.
And yes, if people vote for congressmen who vote to instate fascism, you still have to obey the law.

Save your money. I doubt that developer wants to take money from poor students. Do what I did, and use the heck out of Sublime for free as a student and then buy a license with your first paycheck after you graduate. That's how it's set up. You're *supposed* to use it until you can buy it.

The best avenue is to proceed in an attitude of mutual cooperation and compromise, and to realize that your life is probably vastly better under the current government than it would be under a revolutionary regime.

Because some of us own bitcoins and would like to be millionaires :D
