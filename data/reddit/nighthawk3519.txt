Well I'm not a mind-reader
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:13:34
How much bitcoin if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:24:49
I would if they told me a fascinating story relating to money in their wallet
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:19:37
Sounds like made up opinionated rule. No thanks
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:25:14
Congratulations man. Enjoy

Coinomi if you want to keep your keys is great. CoinPayments is also another great one.

Worst case scenario is that my paycheck hasn't come through in time for me to buy that delicious dip
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:47:29
What exactly are you planning on mining?
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:19:17
Pretty much. Only a matter of time
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:56:02
Or buy a miner, mine profitable coins and trade for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:53:37
That sounds and looks everything like a troll
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:14:38
This same question gets asked multiple times every single day. Are we really that lazy to search before posting?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:45:40
Texas level of dumb
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:07:21
Bitmain is a shit company and one of the assholes behind the whole bitcointrash overtaking Bitcoin and miserably failing. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:10:25
Pay it forward
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:19:34
So this asshole deleted his profile?
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:41:16
Share it with the community 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:33:08
You didn't have 2FA for your Google account?
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:26:52
Probably because a bunch of new millionaires need to buy their lambos
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:39:26
I second the monero call. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:54:53
Nope. Especially with a lot of giant companies adopting the blockchain technology and currency going digital.

Isn't bank of America one of those banks that don't allow cryptocurrency transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:17:27
If that's what every company did, I promise your tone won't be like that. That's what scammers do not a company. I get making money is their top agenda but shitmain has got to be one of the worst companies of this year. Go ask a lot people that bought their miners and watched their money go down the toilet
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:21:51
I was reading on that. Really disappointed silicon valley isn't on top of this already. Sad
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:02:15
I said blockchain technology not cryptocurrency itself
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:12:06
It's made by an egotistical douche who can't market his own product without using the name of the competition he wants to overthrow. And then using bitcoin.com to confuse and mislead people into btrash. Let's not forget the pitiful bitcoincash is the real bitcoin Twitter tags.

IBM, Kroger Co, Dole Food Company Inc, McCormick &amp; Company Inc, Golden State Foods Corp, Driscoll’s Inc, Berkshire Hathaway’s McLane Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc, BP shell, Microsoft,  Samsung. The list goes on man. Even governments are into it
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:17:07
Lol you're an idiot. Goodbye
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:14:51
Good for you man. I'm a recovering fiataholic. I started converting all my money to crypto and now I make hundreds a month instead of 59cents a year interest 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:06:37
It is. A very silent coin that hasn't moved much and still holding the  spot in market cap. Mining is very profitable as well. No idea what the future holds for it but it's been a very stable coin since I've been watching this year
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:16:42
Bank owned. Money is power and banks have lots of money
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:30:29
That his business. He asked for how to earn bitcoins. Do you know a better way?
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:24:04
Are you a bus driver?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:19:05
The keys are only displayed on your ledger not the computer. As far as address redirecting, I always save my transfer address to my Gmail drafts and copy and paste it from there. If you're sending it to someone other than you, have them email it to you or text it to you. Other than that, welcome to the very unsafe internet. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:31:17
You can try but not too sure they'd take it seriously. Why didn't you just use coinbase to sell back into your bank account?
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:10:35
PayPal has a shit security. I'd never trust them with my money
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:01:52
If you don't have a bank in Zimbabwe then it's pointless converting back because it'll just go back to the exchange rates with whatever exchange or wallet you're using. And it's not a scam. It's a very solid exchange that I've used. Maybe I should travel to Zimbabwe to open a bank
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:14:26
Coinbase fees will bend you over with no lube. Buy at least $100 worth at a time. At least.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:50:29
Its been like that for a couple of weeks now
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:51:25
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:18:08
If I go to a different country with different currency, won't I be selling us dollars for the local currency? 
Also it's cryptocurrency not cryptostock. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:40:55
Nope. My Mac came directly from Steve jobs own hands. He promised me it was virus proof. ;). In all seriousness though you're right. I just know I feel my stuff's safer using the Mac than windows pc
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:24:23
Which wallet app is it?
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:49:35
Unless all this argument and bitcoin forks is just a big coin-cidence
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:14:42
Did you look for wallet.bin in %appdata% folder?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:34:58
Yeah I barely use Windows anymore. Too lazy and complacent. I'm currently switching to Mac 
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:33:39
Damn. Wallet.bin would be what you need
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:48:46
Guys,  we need to hash out our differences. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:01:54
You severely underestimate the abilities of hackers in a currency that deals with electronic transactions. You must be new to the internet
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:11:54
Buy an asic miner and go to sleep
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:37:53
Hell no lol. Not even close. But I think all it takes is word of mouth to get around. We're risk takers so this is a no brainer
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:18:01
There's alot more coins out there than Bitcoin.  That's the beauty of decentralization. Freedom of choice. No one is gonna force anyone to use Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:06:02
"Your private keys are safe, that's what the device is for (protecting you against malwares).
What the Nano S will not protect you against:
Malwares that change the addresses displayed in your browser: let's say you are buying stuff on the Web, the webshop displays address "1abcd" and in a split second, the malware changes it to "1zzzz". The idea is that you will then copy/paste the fake address and send funds to it
Validating transactions without double-checking: when signing a transaction, the Nano S will always ask you to double-check the receipient address; if that address has been modified on-the-fly and you don't double-check if what's displayed on the device's screen is really the address you are trying to send funds to, you will lose money
Note that the first case is more likely to happen than the second one right now (there are no known malwares that target transaction building right now) but both of them are valid scenarios and may become more frequent in the near future."
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:45:30
Hahahaha Ponzi. I also hear that here in the States. Well they're missing out. More and more people join everyday. All you can do is make your money and show them the truth
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:34:24
Sell it to me. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:56:11
He's right. You're fucked
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:15:08
I bought my mining rig with litecoin, all the coins I've bought or mined haven't been converted back to dollars. You do realize cryptocurrency hasn't even hit puberty yet right? People are buying houses and cars and other stuff with crypto already and it's only gonna get more adaptation. So yeah it is a currency. Think long term
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:59:54
Ethereum classic is way way more stable. The charts don't lie
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:38:30
He should hodl some more, get to a million dollars, cash out and leave the country. Fuck paying taxes 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:35:15
Ah, thanks for the correction
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:27:23
Us Nigerians do

@_date: 2017-10-27 22:02:29
Normally when i mined it,  i just traded it for other coins. Im able to mine 1 day so thats why i chose it. I'm currently mining monero right now though. Seems to be easier on the rigs
