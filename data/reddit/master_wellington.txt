Yea I saw
I think that's really the only option I have left... I wish someone from CoPay would contact me.
You're not from CoPay are you?

I have no hurry to buy dollars... I'd rather hold my money (btc) and then wait till after April 15th to see what happens.

Yea but why don't you take it out of the retirement accounts first?

I don't think that's necessarily true...

I think healthcare is a big one that is overlooked. Healthcare is definitely shifting towards self-care. People are taking control of their own health instead of depending on the 'system'. 
DaoCloud.com is a new social wellness network that supports this shift.

A few years ago I was paid with a stolen credit card on eBay/Paypal (about $6000). This was discovered after I withdrew the money, and after I shipped the item. Paypal made my account balance -$6000 and I had to pay back the money.

I'm in DC, so I'd go to both. South would be better for me.
We had about 20 people last time.

thanks! now how do I get these...
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:05:01
wait so why don't you just buy real coin?
@_date: 2014-08-02 17:05:40
I've thought about cold storage. I've avoided it because I feel like I'm that guy that would fuck it up somehow... **cough**
We were so careless with CoPay, looking back I can't believe it. I had seen "BitPay introduces CoPay" announced over a month ago, so when we started talking about a multisig wallet yesterday I said, "oh yea let's do CoPay." He said "how do we know if it's secure?" I said, "Well it's made by BitPay who have 10s of thousands of customers."
I was half paying attention when we were getting the wallet set up. Either way, it turns out the error was on their end... It was dumb of me to throw all our coins in the beta product, sure, but there was no warning at all saying "Careful, this might not work." Instead it looks as professional and tested as can be. 
Anyways, what are your thoughts with using a USB stick? My worry is that I'm more likely to lose/break a USB stick, than I think the chances are of Coinbase going down. Maybe I'm stupid to think that.

I have some files in my temp folder but not the right ones. I can system restore back to 1:30 after I first created the wallet - I wonder if the files will still be in my temp folder?

In case it isn't there - should I keep firefox open and leave it alone?

Coinbase is telling me I have to "complete verifications" before sending money... It would have been nice if they prevented my transfer yesterday... Is the point where I have to sell my soul and give them my personal info to do anything with my coins?

my god I don't even know what I did. Not sure if I'm hallucinating from sleep deprivation.

Oops - my mistake. I know the article you're talking about.. I thought Coindesk was one of them.

So it's not about being American-Centric. Dollars have been around long before America. 
Also when you buy something, no one says  "US dollars." It's not about adding a word... obviously people wouldn't say "bitcoin dollars" - they would say "dollars" and everyone would know what they were talking about.
@_date: 2014-07-26 03:28:07
that's what I said

Another note - my business partner has the chrome extension and still has the wallet open on his end... Only problem is any outgoing transactions require both our signatures. Please help!
@_date: 2014-08-02 13:50:40
It turns out I did not cancel the download. I remember opening a notepad file with a string of letters and numbers. Each time I make a new wallet, click create backup, and open, there is no record of the file once I log out and close it - unless I click "save as" instead.
See my last post in github for all the details.

It gave me a wallet address that has never had any bitcoin sent to it. Am I doing this right?
@_date: 2015-09-11 23:51:57
The other day, I was sending $10  to someone from Coinbase. Once I was on the confirmation page, I decided to include a note, so I hit the back button. Coinbase had switched my send amount from $10 to 10btc.... It could have been a big problem. 
Not the same thing, but it's related to how easy it is to fuck up, which is why people (including myself) are afraid to use it.
@_date: 2015-04-26 21:36:59
Cool, thanks.

Search "coinbase high risk" and you'll see countless others with the same experience... Some claim that they honor the price... That has yet to come true for me but I'm still waiting to hear back. 
What also sucks is saying negative things about coinbase gets downvoted immediately.
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:07:13
So where are these million coins, and what happens if they get dumped onto the market at once? You say they're unspendable... Do you mean physically unspendable, or just that if they get spent, people will know? Can you direct me to accurate info on this? Thanks for responding.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:45:14
@_date: 2013-12-22 03:26:55
Short answer: No - you're premises are either inaccurate, or are problems of the current financial paradigm.
First, you don't have to pay a wire fee to purchase from Coinbase (not an exchange). If you wanted to transfer funds into an exchange, you have to pay a wire fee to a bank. This is a fault of the dollar, because you don't have to pay such a fee if you want to deposit BTC into the same exchange.
Second, no, you don't have to pay a transfer fee, because you can always opt for 0 fee. The transaction might take a while, so it might be worth 1/10th of a penny to speed it up quite a bit. People have sent hundreds of millions of dollars through bitcoin for pennies in fees. Similar transactions between banks (or credit cards) would cost 10s if not 100s of thousands of dollars.
Credit cards do cost you something - they cost you the merchant's trust in you. When a merchant accepts a credit card from you, he takes a risk that it could be a stolen card and have the transaction reversed. Because of this risk, the merchant needs to raise prices to protect itself from this risk. Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, cannot be fraudulent, so the risk no longer applies. This is why many merchants offer a discount for using bitcoin.

Well, I had 13 bitcoins ordered from over a week ago that they cancelled. All I got was an apology letter, that it wouldn't happen again. I sent another email asking to honor the trade last week, and still now word.

Number 6 is most interesting imo. Satoshi Nakamoto could potentially have mined 1.2 million bitcoins, correct? "He" has a lot of control over bitcoin. No one mined litecoin before releasing it. 
I'm curious to see what you're answer would be to 6, and I don't understand why it's brushed off.

I was clicks away from buying 100 btc when they were trading at $3 in 2010. Literally clicks away ... all my info inputted on Coinbase, etc. I changed my mind at the last second. 
In the back of my head I remember hearing "You're going to really regret this."
I think about that moment every day.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:00:50
I had 3 btcs cancelled last night that I ordered at $280. I have another 10 that are supposed to be deposited today, ordered at $290. 9 mor ordered after that.... The orders combine to net $2500 profit aleady. I will be so furious if they cancel them all.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:32:04
There's a good chance that if those bitcoins go up in value in a week, they'll cancel the order for being "high risk" and they'll keep the gains.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:46:17
Wait... The Genesis block is only 50BTC, so theres still about 999,950 coins unaccounted for... My main concern is what happens if/when they all get dumped onto the market?
I think its naive to assume a) Satoshi is one person b) whoever created bitcoin doesnt care about money...
And look, I'm extremely pro-bitcoin. But this is a concern that no one seems to be able to address.
