Coming from , I made a post about the benefit of switching to bitcoin from credit/debit cards and got some great answers!
I'm actually going to make my first bitcoin purchase for a digital game when a good one comes out.

What about in chances of fraud or scamming? with CC's it seems like they are sometimes good about giving you your money back in these cases, but with bitcoin it looks like if you give it in exchange and get scammed for something or get hacked there's no way of getting it back?

IDK with how Apple claims to have revolutionized NFC pay with Apple Pay (regardless of other devices that have done it before), they may just accept it and claim to have revolutionized it haha

Thank for all the responses guys. I've got more info from here then I thought I ever would. I can see that as a gamer there isn't much benefit as of now, but it makes sense to invest in it for the future at least. I'm going to try and tip everyone who answered my questions 100 bits each. Thanks again !

Ok, so it's more like a stock currently? Buy it and see if the price goes up to make a profit and if you have it sitting around it's convenient to spend over a CC?

Ok, so after some searching I have another question. Since bitcoins are being mined everyday and blocks are finite, what happens when there are no more bitcoins to be mined? I've also seen some pretty extensive bitcoin farm warehouse pictures haha so I wouldn't expect with all of the miners out there that mining will last so many more years.

True, that' a big plus

Cool, I didn't know the blockchain was that transparent. So you can show that stuff to me about your transactions, but would someone you don't know be able to see what you're doing with your bitcoins at all times or would you only be able to see based on like your wallet address or something similar? Thanks for the info btw 10 bits @_date: 2014-12-12 05:14:53

Good point. I don't think I've heard from someone who was impacted this badly by the Sony leak. In this day and age I don't think any company connected to the internet is risk for holding any of my information.

Cool. Thanks for explaining. I've been googling and (sorry for all the questions), I see that there are bitcoin debit cards. How do these work exactly? I'm guessing they are just tied to a wallet address and when you use them you go through a third party to convert bitcoins to cash on the spot?

Looks like I'll need to contact them and discuss the project with them to get it added. I there anything like kickstarter that I can do with BTC you can think of? I think at this point setting up my own site for donations would be the better route
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:10:10
Came from I started a thread to get more info about bitcoin v cc/debit cards. I've been tipping the people answering my questions. I've also subscribed. I think there are a mix of us
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:37:52
I've read that people have lost or been scammed out of bitcoin before, probably by third-party companies/sites. Isn't it possible to lose bitcoin and not be able to get it back since it is a push system? It seems that pushing and then getting scammed by not getting anything in return would be a pretty common theme, where in a pull system this could be pulled back? I'm interested in the blockchain, but does that make it harder or easier to trace where bitcoin goes?

Yeah, that makes sense, it would be like getting scammed by buying something with cash on Craigslist vs buying something from a major retailer
