Having worked extensively with the VendHQ API, and building 3rd-party applications on top of it, I can tell you that anyone with a few hours could relatively easily write a VendHQ Bitcoin API implementation. Their REST API is very open and lets you control just about every aspect of a sale after the fact. 
You cannot however, to my knowledge, add workflow to their UI, so it would need to be a plugin run separately after a sale is entered where the BitPay invoice is generated and the payment data is then associated to the relevant invoice.

I highly doubt Reddit is losing a dime for accepting Bitcoin on Reddit gold, that literally makes no sense. Kindly link up this information if you have it available.
Also, you describe yourself as a typical consumer, so is it correct to assume you're also a typical employee? Where do you think those 1.5% - 5% "cash back discounts" come from? The merchant, your likely employer, that's who. 
So, the merchant gets pillaged for 5-10% and the bank pays you a sliver of the profit.
Bitcoin is the red pill, it's a small act of revolt against the current system, in which the act of value transfer has become a means of taxing all transactions, everywhere, for the benefit of a small select few.
You have some valid points, but you are wrong to think that the popularization of Bitcoin won't equate to better deals for the consumer. 
Already many companies (most recently Newegg.com) offer considerable discounts for Bitcoin purchases -- the reason being there is almost no cost to process and settle the payment, and there is no potential of clawback or fraud 3 months later, long after a product or service has been delivered.

I understand Bitstamp has definitely fallen behind in the technological side of things as you describe above. I am happy to see other exchanges thriving, and looking at Stamp's orderbook, versus BitFinex, it's telling that larger players are moving to the latter.
Ultimately though, I give Bitstamp credit for achieving what they did with such a small and young team. It's inspiring to say the least, that they've endured and haven't lost anyones' coins. 
You're right though that they may become increasingly irrelevant, but they still do offer a good service for casual traders / hedgers once you give them your DNA sample.

It's all speculation with the alt-chains. The benefit of LTC is that it runs on a different (memory-intensive) encryption algorithm -- SCRYPT. It was originally regarded as immune to ASIC mining and thus more "equitable" for the average person interested in mining, but for how long that will remain is anyone's guess. Another big pull for LTC vs BTC is the block generation time (2 minutes vs. 10 minutes) which supposedly would make it better for a Point of Sale environment, but I am not convinced.

I keep all my funds in my checking account -- there is just absolutely no reason to keep money in a savings account these days.

I would be eager to pick up a coin or two at 150 if the price makes it way there. That would be a very generous retracement. Who really knows though. From what I can tell the big break happened on pretty slim volume. The market reaction around 9 am EST time will tell a lot about where we stand, as the finance guys in New York wake up to trade. 
So long as we stay above $150 I think this was a great and much needed move, flush out the weak hands.

Would you consider yourself computer savvy? Have you opened any .jpeg.exe files lately? Do you run any virus / malware protection?
@_date: 2013-10-19 18:53:03
I would believe this but.... in advanced transaction details you can see the INPUTS and OUTPUTS clearly-- so they have already delegated the funds, they aren't waiting for anything to move.
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:17:37
It's much more likely that bitcoin becomes a tool of the international monetary system, than a nemesis marked for destruction. See the latest interview with IBM's chief computer scientist.

people can claim on Voorhees (blockchain spam, he didn't create SD, etc) but you can't deny the guy has done amazingly well for himself. certainly someone I admire in the cryptoworld.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:47:54
I think they are overrated, risky, and generally not worth the effort. It's much better to just keep your wallet encrypted with a very strong passphrase and keep backups in your email account and USB drives.
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:05:59
this is a very interesting perspective, which needs to be addressed.
@_date: 2013-10-12 14:37:02
I am interested as well. Craig please respond.

from what I can glean from their privacy policy:
If you close your Coinbase account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep your account information in our database. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

I wouldn't bother.... just buy bitcoin, trust me on this...
@_date: 2013-10-04 05:18:42
I think they are referencing the wallet actually on the webserver (not his personal), which by definition must have had the decryption password (if there was one) somewhere so that the Bitcoin daemon could send transactions.
@_date: 2013-08-18 22:02:19
go Jaron!

incase you haven't noticed, coinbase hasn't been doing so hot lately with the price run-up. they quote bitstamp prices but clearly are having issues filling orders at said prices.
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:12:02
 this one is cool
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:27:40
It's all voluntary. I don't expect that fiat is going anywhere, but crypto will evolve as an option for those who decide to accept it as a unit of exchange.

I'm not so sure nitpicking Lamassu's machine is a good way to rationalize the $20k price-tag, as they are entirely different. 
While Lamassu's machine is best viewed in the light of a "dispenser", this Kiosk is more or less an automated currency exchange. 
Will the Robocoin Kiosk be able to handle standard ATM transactions?

I don't watch FOX news or any TV for that matter, and it's easy to see where the ACA raises the marginal cost of hiring the 50th full-time employee substantially. In a free market, quantity demanded is inversely related to price. To me, it makes sense that it will put a serious strain on hiring for most small businesses in what is already a debilitating job market. What's your take?

this happened to me before, I had to use pywallet to extract the private keys. luckily that beautiful little tool exists.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:46:41
I see that. Pywallet will do the trick. If you feel comfortable, PM me and I'll shoot you my email so you can send your old wallet.dat unencrypted where you think the .038 BTC is located and I'll run it through Pywallet to see if I can extract it. Obviously you should never send your unencrypted wallet.dat file to anyone, but I've actually had the same issue with Qt before (basically, it crashed right as I hit SEND, and the transaction never hit the network but the wallet was still behaving as if the funds were spent), and was able to recover the funds with Py.
@_date: 2013-09-11 11:48:02
Raja, I can definitely appreciate your enthusiasm and interest in these matters, but coming up with a unique idea ain't easy! I would say that another bitcoin price feed is probably not of any immediate urgency (check out  Perhaps a bitcoin "stock portfolio" app would be useful? People have shares at bitfunder, btct.co, etc.
@_date: 2013-10-20 05:28:02
Sounds all in all very reasonable given their small support team. Nice to know that BTC went from $100 to $170 and that they still credited you the 2 BTC. It's nice when these errors work out you the favor of the customer.
@_date: 2013-10-17 07:56:06
Thanks for the well-reasoned follow up. I can appreciate what you are saying, I just worry that not many people (myself included) have a full understanding of the law, given the gargantuan nature of the text and regulations it entails. 
I really hope it is for the best and doesn't carry economic collateral damage, but I am not convinced.
@_date: 2013-08-09 06:05:53
Still haven't gotten my bitcoons... it's been 12 hours, I contacted support... wow. I was preaching about how much I loved coinbase but this will definitely impact my view of their operation going forward... it's very simple to send a bitcoon transaction so I don't understand why I am still waiting for my bitcoons 12 hours later....
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:51:02
I wouldn't worry about storing funds at Coinbase. There are actual people behind that company. We know who runs it, and there are serious venture capitalists backing them. They are US-based and transparent, and the likelihood of them scamming anyone or getting hacked and not covering the funds in the event of malfeasance is extremely low.
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:42:32
awesome, I was able to buy some at $106 when spot was $121 because of this... I would be very curious to know the backstory for what was happening. Great work! 
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:54:51
wow thanks

are you affiliated with Lamassu? I see you pop up in every thread, might as well tag your flair

damn, 43 cents per click to send traffic to a subreddit--that's quite expensive.

they have been great however be warned that at least for me currently, I withdrew some coins and the TX hasn't hit the network yet 12 hours later. Also, their sell price has been frozen for me at $123 for two days now... weird huh?
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:28:18
I appreciate the sentiment, but you're worrying about the hypothetical bad financial decisions of strangers on the internet!

I agree that his assumptions and understanding of bitcoin are probably flawed, but there is a scenario to consider (the likelihood of which approaches zero) where the substantial volume of coins Satoshi mined could end up as trading volume. 
The liquidity isn't quite there yet, so an actor with such a large bankroll of coins could potentially control the market in the short term. Though I don't see any guarantee that he would be able to outplay the market even at this level, nor can I think of any scenario where mass-volume selling would benefit a person in that position.
