"...(sic)...the bitcoin price will go higher or lower...it is fluctuating..."

He missed the Internet with Windows 95.
He missed Bitcoin in 2014.

You're an idiot.  Ever hear of Trumpet Winsock?  How did **you connect to the Internet in '95 using Gates' Windows 95?
That's right, you were probably not even born yet.  Punk.

You can say that again.

Long live Armory.
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:22:55
He's is a master coder at burning bridges.

Same question was asked when Bitcoin was at $6.00, $12.00, $32.00, $125.00, $430.00.  
Your timing needs to be spot on.

Credit card transactions have a fixed fee PLUS a percentage of the total transaction.  Bitcoin just has a small fixed fee.  Big difference.

Lawnmower is fabulous.

Of course they are.  If you had the opportunity to flee from holding Rubles, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2015-03-02 03:53:23
Spot on.  If I were either a Greek, Italian, Portugese, Irish, French, or Spanish national, I'd begin moving my money out of the Euro and into bitcoin.

I'm firing up my Armory wallet now to donate funds to the developers.  I hope others join me.

"I have said this all along, that one of Bitcoin's most crucial flaws are the centrally-controlled external exchanges."
Just wait for MasterCoin and others.  Problem solved.
Also, as the Bitcoin economy grows, there will be *less of a need to convert into fiat.

You are right.  It is almost startling that he doesn't grasp the disruptive nature of Bitcoin.  No, it is startling.  
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:32:22
This seems kind of disingenuous.  How can a guy who is considered so "smart" be this ignorant?
Regarding every aspect of Bitcoin, Schiff plays the sniffling stupid "I don't get it" whiner.  
Hey Peter!  Watch this primer:  
If you don't get it after watching this, then there is no hope for you.

Coinbase, you run a service business.

Ummm...regarding J.P. Morgan Chase: 
Money-Laundering Banks Still Get a Pass From U.S. - 
Ban Chase.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:51:19
Already won.

This video should be used as a primer for those new to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:57:25
Agreed.  No reason to get excited about silver again until it gets closer to $40.00.  The gold and silver bugs have been heralding those prices for the past two years.  yawn.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:49:52
Let 'em.  Who is listening?
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:00:38
Got a bunch of sites you can scan.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:56:44
He holds a lot of gold and silver.   He views Bitcoin as a competitor to his stash.
If Peter was like Max Keiser (who invested in Bitcoin early) he would be singing its praises.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:15:02
Really?  
We undermined them with the printing press.  Then the radio.  Then the telephone.  Then the personal computer.  Next came the Internet.  Crypto-currencies will cut an even wider swath of independence and liberty.  It's disruptive.  The *Governments will have to adapt.  Not us.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:52:18
Agreed.  They are well funded and supposedly have great cash flow.  Hire, hire, hire.
Have a great weekend!
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:04:33
The interesting thing is - - Crypto-currencies have made the old world financial paradigms obsolete.
They just haven't realized it yet.
