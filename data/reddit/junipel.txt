My concern is mainly for 
1) the stress their undocumented presence places on the effectiveness of local governments and 
2) their quality of living as residents here (even though they're not citizens)
I don't see many alternatives to amnesty, and honestly it seems like an issue that'd be best solved sooner than later, but that's really just my opinion

The printing money thing is scary af, but regardless of how many illegal immigrants arriving per year, they do have about a $100bn per year pull on the economy. Regarding metrics, local governments 'definitely' pick up on the influx of immigrants, lol. It's not a race thing at all for a lot of people. I'm for amnesty, personally

lol it's distributed throughout local state governments

Only accounts for $100million per year

What's the figure if they were documented and paying the entirety of citizen's taxes? Would you argue that it's best for them to remain undocumented?

Pretty sure he's talking about the U.S. debt to Americans?

Also, well... just all of this page, really: 
tl;dr: it costs ~$100bn/year to support the social services they don't pay for in taxes
