Possible dumb question: what is a halvening?

Mine are on AirBitz... is that good?

Might try out Paxful. But you can vouch for the iOS Mycellium? An earlier reply was doubtful of its utility as compared to the Android version. 
And yeah, I'm skeptical about Coinbase too, but Bitstamp is annoying to use since I'm in the US, and Coinbase was easier. Still, Paxful will definitely be getting a look at by me.

True. I'm new to this, so I'm asking a lot of people their opinions so that I can form my own through those. I appreciate your response!

I'm new to all this. I keep seeing people say "dollar cost averaging." What is this? Is it just saying to buy a small amount each day?
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:32:12
Thank you for the response! What would you consider a large amount?
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:23:52
Fair enough. And are you sure? I most definitely have a Mycelium app on iOS and it's working fine. What should I use in place of mycelium?

What is the name of this tracking site? I'd love to follow along!

Okay. I don't want my coins on Coinbase, and someone earlier in the replies said to not use iOS mycelium. What app would you suggest I transfer my coins from Coinbase to?
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:15:00
Yeah sorry I just did voice-to-text and it made it bit coin's. 
Is Mycellium a cold storage by definition? Or do I have to do something within the app the make it a cold wallet?

What would you consider a large amount? I'm not too keen on dropping a decent chunk of money on Trezor at the moment for the small amount of coin I have.

Not sure if this question is dumb or not, but with the upcoming fork, would Coinbase or Bitstamp be the best place to purchase my coins? I know CB is freezing their market around 08/01, but will Bitstamp to the same? Can I buy on Bitstamp and then pull them into an offline wallet?
