These are very serious concerns we've been researching for months. 
Our primary goal as a community driven foundation is to further the adoption of cryptocurrency everywhere, and to advocate for the industry. We've got a unique history of community action and we felt that was the best home for this message. 
We also carefully tuned it to ensure it was clear this is not as much of a negative for bitcoin or crypto as much as it is for Canada. And innocent users having their bank accounts frozen is a serious concern.

The law received royal assent but interpretations of their application have yet to be arrived at. While we've got Canadian banks freezing accounts out of fear, we have fintrac answering people saying "well, we don't have a clear direction yet so you don't need to register." 
This story is going to continue to develop IMO.

It's going to be really important that we make ourselves heard by our government. I think some voices from the international sector wouldn't help either. 
We sent this out to over 200 Canadian media contacts today, we're hoping it will generate some interest. We're planning more releases as well. With bank accounts being frozen, this is a mainstream media story in my opinion, and we should be capitalizing on that to help facilitate a wider discussion.
