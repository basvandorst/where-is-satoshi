I agree everything is fine, probably the best time to buy BTC!
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:41:03
I guess it is the right time to buy BTC

Guys I have read all the replies, there are mixed reviews on the ***Lightning network***. Some like it while some think that LN alone cannot solve the Bitcoin's scalability. Let's wait and see where LN goes, Thank you for sharing your views. PEACE!

Yes, the crypto market is dynamic we really don't what will happen in the next 3-4 months.
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:10:27
Please read it again. Both have exactly the same meaning irrespective of the words used. And they are grammatically correct. 
Both 'Despite' and 'has resulted in are used for two different things and not the same. 
The heading says the U.s. has rejected the idea but this has resulted in the upward movement. 
The post says despite this rejection by the US, the result is still an upward trend. 
I hope it is more clear to you.
@_date: 2019-10-31 08:19:35
There is always a possibility of it going either way but both are beneficial as well. One for the buyers and the other for the sellers.
@_date: 2019-10-09 12:28:42
Hi there!
Thank you for the constructive feedback. We are looking to modify our blog as we found your feedback relevant.
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:11:50
I agree. But since they are not going to approve it anytime soon, we can be assured that Bitcoin still can experience an upward movement.
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:14:23
Can you share the news? I read it was trading in its current trade range and then after the anticipation and rejection, it rose to 5%.
@_date: 2019-10-14 14:02:34
These news are unsettling, yes. But is it right to blame the organization as a whole for these? 
Did they take any measures after such incidences were found? 
 [  \- He was a former UNICEF Campaigner i.e. not employed by the UNICEF at that time.
 [ \- There were multiple factors that are still unanswered in this news. What is the motive of a non-profit to facilitate miscarriages? Why only some of these resulted in adversaries, why not all if the drug is a proven fertility vaccine? Why the sample tested positive for the given samples and yet there were those who were healthly pregnant? 
And there are so many more for the rest. 
I agree that the organizations should offer responses and explanations for these controversies.
@_date: 2019-10-15 12:45:25
Well, it's hard that's why you hire professionals. And Crypto market is highly volatile, you can never be risk proof as that's not in its nature. But that doesn't mean you can't gain from it either.
@_date: 2019-10-14 14:04:42
I believe those who are worried about their money being misused, should donate in cryptos. This way they can see where their money is used through the open ledger.
@_date: 2019-10-15 09:27:04
Crypto Market does not always have a reason, does it? You understand the market based on what is happening with the regulations, restrictions, trends that are going on in the market to predict its movement. The biggest news at the time was this decision and there was almost an instant spike in the rates of Bitcoin. I would say they do have a relation. 
But yes, there can be other attributes or factors that may have lead to this. I just couldn't find one that was as significant as this at that time. 
I would be happy if you could share some.
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:10:52
I suggest you see the reply too for better understanding.
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:50:53
When it comes to such organizations. There are some creeps that pop up and do these things. We cannot implicate the entire organization and its work due to the same. 
However, if they do not take any corrective measures and precautions to avoid such happenings in the future, the organization as a whole should be liable.
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:12:09
Could you please elaborate?

Way to go!

Preventive would be to conduct timely check on the operations of the banks. Not to shut them up for 6 months to conduct an investigation.
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:44:54
Point noted.
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:00:08
I guess one won't know till they buy and hodl.
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:12:29
Back to below $8K....
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:47:10
Then buy it. It's got a good price for buyers.
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:33:40
True. But revolutions have bought around changes that normal complaining doesn't.
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:38:32
You cannot trust the bank to use your deposits as you want. But you are still the owner of your Crypto Wallet. That's what I meant.
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:35:16
There is more uncertainity than ever in most economies now-a-days. Do you think it will tank to say $4K?
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:11:21
I thought this was the impact of cut in Hash Rewards. Recently read that the hash prices are down by almost 40%.
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:12:23
At least what you have in your cold wallet remains in your wallet in case of cryptos
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:38:30
You got that right. In fact the early investors of Bitcoin are billionaires right now. It may take a while for people to get on board but they eventually will.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:40:30
I am gonna take that advice and see what I can get my hands on!
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:26:38
I hope not. It's a trading chart that helps buy the "dips"
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:20:08
This is an amazing way to attrakkt
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:37:11
That's really.... complicated?
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:22:18
We have some really judgy people here that do not respond.
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:42:27
Well said. If it was easier for the government to control and get some "taxes" they would be more favorable towards cryptos. 
Right now, the governments are like... "You want something new, we can't tax?" "Screw You, we gonna BAN it!"
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:11:39
Before it was don't keep cash when you can save in bank. 
Now it's "Don't keep in Bank if you want access to your funds!" Poor government policies and decisions that the general population has to suffer from.
@_date: 2019-09-24 11:37:42
I wish it was coming to India too. But the regulation here are just..... not favorable.
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:32:31
I guess that's the most common "don't know" or "clueless" reaction everyone has to this question.
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:20:01
As per reports, a law has already been passed that stops Britain from leaving the EU on 31st October. If the EU and UK do not come to some kind of understanding till 19th Oct., this date may be extended. The only condition for brexit on 31st October is that if the MP's vote against leaving the union with no deal.
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:44:48
I can see your point when it comes to Bitcoin, although it decreased today. Do you think it is feasible to wait for long term in case of other cryptos?
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:36:57
I have recently developed an interest in Cryptos, was absolutely clueless in January.
@_date: 2019-09-23 08:57:03
I agree. With the evolution of money from precious metal coins to paper currency to plastic money, the evolution can lead to adaption of cryptos as the next currency for the world .
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:40:07
But whatever the UK proposes should be acceptable by all members of the EU too. So in the end, it should be a mutually beneficial decision.
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:16:14
And the award for the most realist and understandable definition goes to...... "You".
@_date: 2019-09-23 11:55:33
And it gets confusing by the minute.
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:57:54
I know early investors gained a lot when they invested and hodl-ed Bitcoins. But is it worth do it now for long haul?
@_date: 2019-09-26 07:15:55
Do you think only Bitcoin will see a hike or other cryptos may benefit as well?
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:44:39
Otherwise you can always opt for a transplant... in case you get profits :P
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:48:55
For me buying satoshis or 0.011% of a bitcoin seems inconsiderable. And to buy just this much of a whole will seem too small to invest in for most. So,if you wanna buy, buy at least 1 BTC. That's why not exactly affordable for all.
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:43:52
I do hope we don't have to use a Kidney since it has slipped lower than $8K.
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:33:38
That's definitely not a bull!
@_date: 2019-09-24 11:48:33
There are so many countries that are trying to regulate cryptocurrency and blockchain technology right now. I think the regions that are showing favorable policies and are interested in blockchain adoption are the only ones targeted as a potential market for these phones.
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:45:57
Is that a thing?
@_date: 2019-09-21 11:34:50
It is true that History will repeat itself and the crypto market will rise again!
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:35:02
Is that so? FYI there are Hindus all over the world, India just happens to have a majority of them.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:43:40
Let's not taunt a religion here. But the government, that's another story. :P
@_date: 2019-09-26 07:08:21
What are UK's thoughts on Cryptos in general?
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:24:17
But let's not forget the governments love to interfere with EVERYTHING. Especially something that is out of their control.
@_date: 2019-09-28 07:56:55
Depending on your level of patience, choose one of the 25 in-between dips to invest!
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:35:06
They just go around creating uncertainty in people. And let's not forget that people are weak hearted. And hence, the manipulation of market. However regulating is okay, since it means that they are accepting it as legit.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:56:09
I hear you. Read the same news. But I also saw that the restriction imposed were affecting more the customers than the bank or its employees. It's the depositors that are unable to take their own hard earned, saved for years money out from their account. This is because you don't own the bank and just hire its services.
Bitcoin or Crypto on the other hand makes you the owner of your wallet and your cryptos. Here read this:  
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:24:06
Do we have to Hodl for more years now?
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:45:26
You got any relatives willing to give theirs?
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:48:14
Get it by stealing it from someone else's body you mean?
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:21:30
Good for you!
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:33:05
Well I am glad cryptos are decentralized. It would be a shame to have government in everything. And yes, you are right. People will know the difference even if its after suffering a loss.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:58:44
That might work unless they decide to follow their yes with a pile of documentations for statements, businesses and so on and on and on.......
@_date: 2019-09-23 08:55:06
I feel that Bitcoin being the most popular crypto has the most potential of replacing Fiat as a standard of measurement. Currently, there is no crypto that can replace fiat but we need to think about possible replacements.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:45:11
I hear your frustration. Its insane seriously. Let's make sure not to get this government again or we might not get to involve with the cryptos too.
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:43:30
And that's the reason why Crypto was invented as a decentralized currency with no control of governments on it. And yet, they don't stop trying to "regulate" it.
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:40:41
I hear you. What can I say, he has a damn good marketing and publishing team! Not to forget the money his party has to buy everyone.
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:16:13
Even thought cryptocurrency is a hot topic of news and discussion forums, there is not much coverage on the traditional news mediums to update people about it. And with every news, it is highlighted as So volatile and Risky to even consider. That's where the problem lies.
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:29:22
I guess we have to join the  movement now.
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:59:24
A good observation
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:18:03
Do we go invisible in Step 2?
@_date: 2019-09-26 07:06:21
I am hoping to buy some Bitcoins when it dips next.
@_date: 2019-09-27 12:53:26
The current one, or you could wait for the $3K one :P
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:40:04
My bad... Bitcoin it is. But you do know that not everyone can afford to buy it, even at a low price like these days? One should divide and diversify to stay in the game and not have everything in one place, even if its bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-24 11:16:07
I feel that a Centralized one is better. It lets you convert fiat into cryptos while decentralized does not have this facility. 
You can understand the different categories of exchanges better from this blog:-

@_date: 2019-09-26 16:46:35
Bitcoin is definitely not a get rich quick scheme. In fact currently, you have to be a certain level of rich to buy it. 
Plus in is case, you got to Hodl for years before you see a profit.
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:23:02
I prefer [ one. It's new to the scene but the customer support and resolution time is great. I have just invested in their CIP plan and it is beneficial with fixed minimum dividends.
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:42:59
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:42:30
It is still a long way in the future, but setting a particular crypto currency as a standard can work to know a Cryptos worth. Infact, Bitcoin can be the standard all other cryptocurrencies are measured in.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:41:50
Is there nowhere our hard earned money is safe then?
@_date: 2019-09-27 12:29:11
It may take time, but that time will come too.

Yeah, it may be a law that is passed by Britain but they will be able to get a further extension as per the norms of the UN too.
@_date: 2019-09-26 07:55:56
I guess this time they can prepare ahead and invest in cryptos.
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:13:45
Don't say that! They might come up with one and we, the common public will have to suffer or stand in line for hours again.... (Refer to the demonetization)
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:32:21
Where are you from again?
There are illiterate brainwashed BJP followers that believe such sh\*t not the common people. Generalizing them is not good.
And we are on the verge of a revolution. Whether it is to have cryptocurrency and blockchain in India or stopping the government from making such irresponsible decisions.
