Boy how the times have changed. A dump like the one we had, in 2018, would've set the market back for months. I'd say we're now in 2016, back when Bitcoin started rising from $200 to $1000. Luckily we skipped 2015, where it just hovered around $200 for an entire year.

Although to be honest, learn to count your blessings. I would've never believed it would hit 3000 within the year, much less 5000. We're living on the moon already.

Uh, usually demand generates supply, which keeps prices in balance due to increased competition. When the supply can't keep up, prices skyrocket. Bitcoin has a transaction bottleneck, plain and simple, and this has to be solved to ensure its prosperity.

Oh I mean I agree, with the shitshow that Bitcoin has become I would be more than happy if it just imploded, it certainly doesn't deserve its status as crypto gateway right now.


Why is the ability to transact money supposed to be a resource, and a scarce one at that?


Ahahahahaha that's probably the single dumbest thing I've heard in many, many days.
If a theater accepts 100 people, but there are 1000 people who want to attend, you can sell tickets for 1 million dollar each but you still won't be able to fit all 1000 inside. While for a theater that might be fine, for a currency that's death. I don't think there's anyone dumb enough to actually like paying high fees. Eventually Bitcoin will simply be abandoned for greener pastures.
The fact that lower fees are still confirmed simply means that the bottleneck isn't reached yet. It likely never will, because there are much better alternatives to Bitcoin.
