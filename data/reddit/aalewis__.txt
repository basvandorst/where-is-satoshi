I'm an argumentative person but I like to think I'm reasonable. That said. I haven't yet realized that if this wall of text represents my ability to impress my peers and write a personal essay I shouldn't be allowed out of my house much less into an institution of higher education. I value highly subjective measures of intelligence that bias toward my particular upbringing, culture, and way of thinking and are as outdated a means of determining intelligence as phrenology. I am jealous and resentful of my mother for choosing a partner who takes attention away from me. I compensate by taking an interest in the same things he does and compete in a bizarre and fruedian manner for my mother's love. I do have a genuine interest and aptitude for engineering and as my little sponge of a mind soaks up all the awesome things around me I'm lucky enough to have the time and support and material wealth to afford a practical application of my skills that will assist me in a long a fruitful career. This makes me angry. Philosophy is mostly about reading the nuanced ideas of a very diverse set of authors. When most people reread the content of these books after years of study and a lifetime of contemplation they find new and relevant things. I haven't yet realized that philosophy is a companion in the journey of life and not a problem to be solved and discarded. As psychologists enter a new and exciting era of confronting new frontiers such as discovering the continued plasticity of the brain in response to damage or other external stimuli well into adulthood, I've already got it figured out. Who needs a medical degree to even start asking the kinds of questions relevant to this field. I know what's up. I would like to take a moment here to reiterate my interest in Freud while I smoke this cigar. I have never had to make a moral decision in my life. I am subject to other's whims and rules constantly. I resent it and I therefore make bold and principled stands for historical figures who want to slaughter millions and rule the world with an iron fist because that is how I can best cope with my anger and confusion as I pass through a difficult time in my life. It shows no more maturity or moral fortitude than a school bully. I like discussing vague ideas about relativity and perspective and the confusion of the modern condition because it makes me not only sound smart, but like I could write a shitty hollywood sequel to inception. I would really like to get laid. I'd even consider necrophilia or pedophilia. Seriously guys. I've considered it. In an effort to accomplish this I will accept your awful taste in music, clothes, whatever. Seriously. I love everyone. Someone please fuck me. I'm not all nerd ladies. I even have skills and battle scars. I'm a liger. What sign are you? Is your women's studies class full? I'm totally into that in a non creepy way. In closing, do you even lift bro? All that being said I completely derailed this thread by posting a wall of text and I'm going to call you an asshole. I think I knew a lot yous when I was younger. Hell, I was even a little bit like yous. We were ok guys, but a little too hyper for my taste. Wish they'd chill out and be cool.

You still don't get it.  Settlement times and confirmation times are different.  If I pay you with my card the payment is instant and you have your money.  I am able to charge back but only in specific circumstances and you are still able to dispute it.  With bitcoin, you have to wait at least 15 minutes for one confirmation, and double spending is something anyone can do easily, which is why it does nothing but make the transaction not be instantaneous.
@_date: 2014-06-25 10:24:46

ok so let's deconstruct your "reasons"


I doubt most people are really appreciative of you tipping them a couple of cents to spam advertise bitcoin.  And besides we have paypal for that as well as other payment systems that are much easier, safer, and trustworthy to use.


Wire transfer?  Paysafe cards?  Moneypak?  If they've reached the point of being black-listed by all credit card processing, maybe that's for a good reason?


like bitcoin doesn't encourage criminal activity or have a minority own and control a majority of it.

You are taking away the owner's ability and right to prevent other people from making copies of whatever is copyrighted and the benefits they gain from this.

What does that prove?  Obviously people on a website for complaining will have a biased view, while most satisfied paypal customers will keep quite.  I've had my paypal account for years and never had a single issue with them.  It's not like Paypal is the only payment processor that exists.


What does free speech and me working for the government have to do with the viability of bitcoin being useful for the average person?


Its anonymity coupled with no possibility to reverse funds has created quite a lot of scams and thefts since there is no real incentive for accountability.  Not to mention illegal marketplaces for contraband that flourish by using anonymous cryptocurrencies.


I in fact do earn bitcoin and own some myself.

The ecosystem is over 5 years old, that excuse doesn't work anymore.  None of those companies are accepting bitcoin.  Everything is instantly converted to fiat via bitpay and the only reason they "added" bitcoin support is for publicity to appease the bitcoin nerds who endlessly harassed them.  All you have proven is that bitcoin is only realistically useful for illegal gambling which makes it look even more shady.  And bitcoin's irreversible transfers don't give anything back to the people because there is nothing you can do if you get scammed or ripped off by a company.  You don't get the point, please stop posting these delusions.

Why are you people so autistic?  Every single chat log I've seen posted here is similar to this one.  WHY.
@_date: 2014-12-26 16:16:34
It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.
An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.
I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.
Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.
I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.
I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.
I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.
I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.
I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.
I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.
The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.
I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.
That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).
I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).
And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.
All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?

Many governments in fact do ban people from holding large amounts of cash.  Try walking around with 100k in cash and 100k in bitcoin. Tell me, which one is easier to hide?

But the paypal balance isn't a a physical object.  You can simply file a chargeback with paypal so in reality you don't lose anything.  Hacking and stealing passwords is the same as copying; provided you don't vandalize or delete anything, you are only making a copy of the database or whatever information you're after.  As for copyright infringement being worse than stealing, it all depends on the situation.  It's one thing for me to stiff you out of $500, and a complete financial disaster for a million dollar software company to go out of business because someone shared their product and allowed everyone to torrent it for free.

If anything bitcoin needs more government control, because it's obvious you "random internet people" contribute almost nothing accept spamming to pump up the price for your own benefit.








Yes for the most part.  You have brigaded and harassed dozens if not hundreds of companies to accept your scummy currency.  Here is one example, I'm sure I could easily list multiple others but for the sake of time one is enough. 
Here is yet another example of how much you bitcoiners as "users" actually help.
 






Open Bazaar's nature makes it have almost no realistic uses except to allow people to sell illegal items.  MMO currency has no realistic large real world usage to make bitcoin a viable option for the average user.








These escrows and other hoops customers must jump through make its availability irrelevant when credit cards and other mature payment systems exist that offer real consumer protections.
















I have in fact been using bitcoin since 2011 and I have extensive knowledge of the protocol.  You want to drop the conversation because you know you're losing the argument?  So much for backing up what you believe in.




Because I feel bad for all the victims you people attract with your ponzi scheme sketchy currency.  You have no knowledge of my life to be making these ad hominem attacks in an attempt to sway the debate.

You are still stealing his copyright but using it in a different way.  When the owner had the ability to prevent people from making copies he benefited from his copyright.  Now that you infringed his copyright he can no longer completely prevent people from making copies and loses out on profits. You however, benefit from the this, being able to make an unlimited amount of unauthorized copies and use them without paying anything for the owner's hard work.

Bitcoin needs more regulation if anything.  By taxing it, it makes it easier to catch all the criminals using bitcoin.

Because the bulk of the drugs sold on those markets are totally not from the cartels /S
Not to mention the identity theft and fraud related items being sold.
Stop being delusional.

Yes changetip is scammy because after you 'tip' somebody, if they don't accept the tip, the money goes back to the original tipper.  This encourages the spam even more and scams people because the tippers don't meaningfully tip to help someone out, but only do it to spam, knowing that in most cases they will just get their money back.  You, along with the changetip people, periodically brigade other subreddits to continue to spam in them.  I have no personal issues against you, nor do I really care much about you complaining about my satirical demonstrations about the usefulness of changetip.  I simply dislike corruption in the Bitcoin industry, and shit like changetip makes the whole community look bad and gives it a bad reputation among reddit users outside of @_date: 2015-01-02 03:06:30

Do you have any actual definitive proof of me trolling?  Or are your ad-hominem attacks simply another excuse to derail this debate by discrediting me directly?
