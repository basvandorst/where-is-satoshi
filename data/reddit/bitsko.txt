What is the advantage of a 'centralized blockchain' over a spreadsheet?  Is there much of a difference fundamentally...?
If trustlessness is critical to the concept of bitcoin's 'blockchain', what purpose would a centralized blockchain serve that a database does not?

It seems as though you don't fully understand how this works.  You see, the 'XT-coins' are indistinguishable from bitcoins, as they use the bitcoin blockchain and are one and the same.

So is it true we both agreed we wouldn't run a software that lost its trustless and decentralized properties?  That we would either keep bitcoin on its rails of justice or we would use something else right?  
But this idea that node count matters beyond the number of miners in the network, or that it matters beyond offering altered consensus rules a chance to have a network, still puzzles me.
*Why* is 50,000 nodes better than 5000?
It couldn't be censorship resistance, because if it was ever under attack, those nodes could be spun up, and aren't necessary right now.
It couldn't be helpful to the network beyond a certain point, could it? Say you have a well, a kiddie pool, 5 dudes and a bucket.  Say there are enough dudes between the well and the kiddie pool to pass the bucket along efficiently...  
Now let's say you have 100 dudes inbetween the well and the kiddie pool, is it better?  In what way?
Let's say that mining is extremely centralized and networked amongst the centralized groups of hashpower, like it is right now, with those miners not even using the bitcoin network per se to communicate found blocks...
How do the extra gajillion nodes help in this example?!?

The difference being that there is 'x' amount of hashpower that is ideologically driven to mine on the losing chain.

When it comes down to it, hashing on F2Pool is risky.  
They may claim to have updated their code, then you find out they didn't when you help to mine invalid blocks you don't get paid for.
They don't have enough bandwidth to support their operation even now,  and aren't willing to do anything about it other than try to keep everybody else down with them.  So you'll get little profit from transactions mining with them.

It the case of the XT node rush, it was quite simple to see the distortions on the graph of an individual spinning up 20 or 50 nodes at a time. 
In Smartfootballrankings example of a miner being faked into thinking there was support for 10 mb blocks I say no miner with money on the line would just jump from &gt;1mb to 10.  They may try a 1.1mb block or something while looking at their statistics for information.
Miners wouldn't do anything to cost them money intentionally, and if I keep a ledger software that tracks what the longest chain does I don't have to worry about changing my software down the line on some random day the majority of the hashpower decides something.

A fee of four to six cents does indeed impact users. It doubles or triples their fee. 
Miners are engaged in competition, the block reward is the only agreed upon subsidy. Fees should be derived from the market, not central planning like you seem to desire.  
Spam attacks are much easier at any transaction cost if the blocks are nearly full, as they are.

Coinbase is the only way that I have ever acquired a non-negligible amount of bitcoins.  I hold these bitcoins for the most part.  If we were to fuck coinbase, I would not likely acquire as many bitcoins on a regular basis to hold.  Fucking coinbase could then fuck the current price of bitcoin downwards.

Wouldn't It be that they would need to make transactions that transfer the coins onto the new chain?  What would be pre-emptive about a transaction post-fork?  They may be able to say one thing or another, but the blockchain is the real.
From a user perspective, the supermajority means that most of the ecosystem is on board, which would make a difference in a hard-fork, I thought it was relevant.

What in the world is that even supposed to mean?
Node juice to jazz up the nodeitivity in blank spots of the network where the transactions couldnt make it out like a hamster in a fish bowl.
Those are words I chose to highlight my perceived lack of an explanation of the importance of excessive nodes given the original game theory design of the system. 
A miner validates transactions to obtain transaction fees from them, and anyone else that wants to that can afford it.  Just like with the initial wealth distribution being 'unfair', the game theory behind how the system works gives no concern as to who can afford to bitcoin in various forms of node running or mining, which used to be one and the same.  
How would the number of bitcoin nodes ever constrain the system unless it somehow became less than the number of miners ?

Blocks are totes fine, guys. If everyone just gives up on using bitcoin, the blocks will stay totes fine. Lets force a fee market on people prematurely, that will help adoption by making bitcoin unreliable for a handful of its first use cases.  We can just use litecoin, to keep bitcoin ideologically pure and decentralized.

from my limited understanding, bitcoin unlimited is for node operators to track consensus of the longest chain, whereas mining operators would be running something like bip101.  And there will likely be a flag in bitcoin unlimited to match bip101's linear increase in blocksize.  Furthermore there is discussion to have Bitcoin Unlimited default to core settings, which would be not 'dangerous' at all.
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:58:10

DEFINITION OF 'SKIN IN THE GAME'
A term coined by renowned investor Warren Buffett referring to a situation in which high-ranking insiders use their own money to buy stock in the company they are running.
INVESTOPEDIA EXPLAINS 'SKIN IN THE GAME'
The idea behind creating this situation is to ensure that corporations are managed by like-minded individuals who share a stake in the company. Executives can talk all they want, but the best vote of confidence is putting one's own money on the line just like outside investors!

Small miners in a large pool chose that pool For economic reasons. The pool operators incentives are not entirely aligned with the pools miners.  A pool operator of say, 20% of the hashrate, would then have undue influence on the process.

Do you not think the losing side of the chain would not trend to near-zero rapidly?  The effect of so many actors all not wanting to lose their money makes the lesser chain very unimportant.

BIP 100 was put on ice by garzik, although bitpay i think just released a modified core client that does something similar.
XT support is still about the same, Mike Hearn got a job with RC3V and will maintain XT, but maybe not be working on it all the time.
Bitcoin Unlimited is gaining popularity.  It lets the client track the longest chain in the event of forks, based on configurable settings.
The bitcoin core developers will not increase the actual blocksize, but plan to add layers on top and switch things around to improve the efficiency of things.

[SegWit only increases the capacity for typical transaction loads {mostly P2PKH, some multisig} to a maximum effective size of 1.75 MB. Achieving this increase requires 100% of new transactions and wallets to use SegWit. With 50% adoption, the capacity increase may only be 37.5%. {Previous rollouts of new transaction formats have taken about 1 year for widespread adoption.} On the other hand, SegWit increases the capacity for blocks full of specially crafted multisig transactions to nearly 4 MB. This means that it eats up a lot of our safety headroom {e.g. for adversarial conditions} while only providing a very modest increase in typical capacity.](

I was almost certain of that.  Just wanted to make sure you were too.


What say you of the developers who have not signed onto the roadmap?
Whether or not you are correct in your set of assumptions about bitcoin,  your approach is a failure.  


If bitcoin fulfills the role it was designed for, consider the overlap necessary with other knowledge to see it through.
This is the if you only have a hammer every problem is a nail situation.  You can't produce perfect enough code that stands contrary to a correct understanding of economics and expect it to work.

@_date: 2017-03-13 16:48:18
When you say ecosystem It seems there ought the be clarity around what you mean.
For instance, there are highly relevant economic actors in the ecosystem which logically would support a trend aligned with their business model, and there are a vast amount of volunteer full node relays operating out of self interest, which functionally the network doesn't require.  And there are enough of those on either side to allow the network to operate either way.
@_date: 2016-01-06 07:19:44
I hope that was cathartic, and thanks for all your hard work developing bitcoin, I understand what people are saying in as much as I need to. I question the very premise of the argument, that it's even necessary or desirable to have excessive low resource nodes on the network.

In the context of a user operating a node(who isnt mining) you don't go to a different chain.  If you reduce the setting, you stop accepting blocks.  If you increase the setting, you keep accepting valid blocks and following the most work chain.

For people using money on their mobile phones, running a node isn't something they are going to want to do.  
Nodes can be plenty decentralized in major cities along the fiber optic lines. Hobbyists, organizations and businesses that people choose to trust in such matters will be able to run nodes.  How many nodes qualifies as decentralized?  A few more than the groupings of hashpower we have?
As long as those who verify's interests don't diverge on screwing you over it doesn't matter who they are, they are from all around the globe upholding this trustless system and would seemingly stand to by lose fucking that up.
Do you live somewhere remote, are you concerned you would simply no longer be able to run a node due to bandwidth?
I think, to incentivise adoption and encourage more use cases individual transaction fees should stay trivially small.  Only their volume ought increase.
I think it is reasonable to assume running a node will cost more than transaction fees, a node after all is a high bandwidth network connected computer which records a massive ledger(and conceptually was mining it) and performs computations upon it.  A transaction fee is a payment for a brief moment of work from such a computer(that mines it).

The reason companies arent supporting it outright is because of fearing the damage guys like you will do to their reputation. Make no mistake, if the business model benefits, the support is there.

We both put quotes on law.
The availability of bitcoin isn't constrained by bandwidth, given SPV.
The availability of bitcoin is much more likely to be constrained by fees.

@_date: 2017-03-06 17:26:13
'rethinking consensus'
UTXO can be tainted in a way that does not involve theft.  A split will result.  Bitcoin network does not require a high number of nodes to operate.  Going against the hashrate means that this will be a split and not the longest chain.
As such, exchange tickers will default to the incumbent.
Further, this is in no doubt a contentious fork attempt.  However, I fully support the action and can't wait for this catalyst to increase the respective consensus on the BTC and BTCSW networks.
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:04:19

This is incorrect, and It gets me wondering how much you know about the protocol.


Appeal to emotion.


You need a PoW change through a hard fork, so you can run a conservative blockchain on a GPU.  If you want to change bitcoin in this fashion, that is.


Youre pulling shit out of thin air.  You have no idea how LN would work, nor how 'centralized' it could be in use.  Tell me more about which bank you use to transact on LN? Or do you prepay your coffees months in advance? 


You are woefully incapable of delineating the point at which node count goes from decentralized to centralized.  You don't seem to fully grasp what it means to be decentralized, and you seem to be mistaken that your cheetos encrusted alienware laptop is of any benefit to the bitcoin network. 


The pooch has already been screwed.  You need a PoW change to fix it.  Get on that and quit promoting the fucking up of bitcoin.
And try for better insults...  
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:47:50

"bigblocks" in itself is just a patch.  The BIP101 'bigblocks-only' version of XT is actually Core, with the bigblocks patch.  If you are saying they pulled the bigblocks patch from the XT repo, this is fine and well, it's clear what the code is.  When we talk about 'XT' we're of course talking about the feature set Hearn selected that differ from core.  The bigblocks patch was after the fact.  
IIRC, Hearn wouldn't make packages for bigblocks only (core+BIP101), because it wasn't in his personal interest to do so.  Yet Andresen placed it in the XT repo for anyone to compile.

Does it make sense that the miners can build on the chain without needing your node as an intermediary?

I think there are ideas on each side of the debate that are fundamentally irreconcilable. The most basic one that comes to mind is whether one thinks its absolutely necessary that bitcoin works over tor.

@_date: 2017-01-30 23:29:14
Litecoin has always been capable of processing more on chain transactions in a 10 minute window than bitcoin, hasn't it?
Litecoin blockchain consists of a cricket riding atop a tumbleweed...it's purpose is to be bought and sold against bitcoin on an exchange... it doesn't actually need a blockchain to do this.
Bitcoin has a testnet, segwit doesn't need to run on a 'live' system for a bounty.  The whole purpose of this thing is to fool people into buying litecoins.. I must advise against being the greater fool here...  
0 day exploits are often kept for the right time or the right price... potentially exploitable segwit transactions on a network with no volume is peanuts compared to a network like bitcoin with full blocks... think about it... the incentive is not there to use a potential exploit on litecoin...

Yeah but their blocks aren't full and their parameters are a bit different to be meaningful to bitcoin, and also bitcoin has a testnet which serves the purpose of testing.  If you wanted to test it on a live network, the conditions would need to be similar, like fullish blocks is the biggest one.

Ah yes, ive seen that argunent presented.
I had countered that such an exploit would have an even greater value if held until it could be used on bitcoins main chain.
 but my lack of in depth protocol knowledge and code security leaves me wondering if there is any such potential attack that could compromise segwit and not bitcoin itself. 
 And if it is only the segwit transactions at risk, they will be penny shavings on litecoin (a coin used for exchange trading) and a slow ramp-up on bitcoin due to users being advised to be cautious and integration.

Not signaling for something is not the same as blocking it.
Also, the miners shouldnt be political.  Pools should set themselves up like Slush, and let the individual miners signal. Pools like BTCC think they know whats best for everybody.

@_date: 2016-11-19 20:58:36


Oh, right. 


I don't completely understand the mechanics around this, but it does seem as though if a block is excessive in size, it creates an orphan risk.
As far as a work around to the relay problem, I thought that the miners were given one by Matt Corrallo, and it is on its 2nd generation and doing well.  And if that is indeed the case, I fail to see the incentive to centralize remaining...
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:47:46

@_date: 2016-11-19 20:28:51
Let's not forget the efforts of Alex Petrov helping other miners reduce orphans as well.
Also I should keep in mind that the post from cryddit is over a year and a half old, and so, as someone who likes to read the reasoning of those with more experience than I, I would be interested in seeing if cryddit's opinion has since changed in regard to a miner's own configuration being an effective means to keep the blockchain bloat issue in check.
While I would agree with a general centralizing pressure stemming from the issue of orphaned blocks, I would add that the human component of bitcoin does well enough on its own in things like protecting the 21m coin limit and limiting the size of a pool even. (will you call me stupid again for this notion?lol)
Also I do wonder, given the advent of things like compact blocks/xthin, are you sure that this design would still incentivise miners enough to centralize in order to optimize their profit?

Not true.  Its just that security doesnt provide as much utility to the end user as you would like. Not very many people care about maintaining their own copy of the ledger as you would like.

Monero is still quite matrixy(no gui in the ref. client) and afaik has negligible merchants even in the dark markets.  (someone who actually uses the dark markets please chime in and correct me if I'm wrong)
More to the point of your question, it was incredibly simple to acquire monero via shapeshift.io, although that's generally not leaving bitcoin, bitcoin in this case being the gateway to monero.
@_date: 2015-08-11 20:31:07
Yes, I would like to see miners support the bigblocks patch specifically, if they would not support XT.
@_date: 2015-08-15 01:21:12
Would you agree that it is accurate to define Bitcoin as the consensus rules which add to the best chain?
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:45:46
One of the changes xt has is to stick to first seen transaction.  Some core developers want unconfirmed transactions to be entirely useless via replace by fee or parent. Those systems encourage double spending to deal with 'fee market'.  But some merchants use risk models to work with zero conf.  We need zero conf to allow 'instant' services.
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:49:13
I'd prefer the absence of assumption.  


And this: 
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:21:38
In the idea, it would prevent a miner from making a ridiculously huge block that all the other miners choke on while they mine a bunch of regular blocks.
But since miners could game a dynamic system, the limit could be pushed up and up to force other miners to orphan.  Kinda defeats a limit...
Sounds like you advocate a 'fee market' though.  Without widespread adoption a fee market will choke out adoption.  It would inspire alternative choices, where there aren't onerous fees.
@_date: 2015-08-20 20:24:36
I am confident in the bitcoin development team's efforts to employ 2 way pegs, implement LN, make excellent secure code changes to increase the efficiency of the protocol, but I'm confident in the chief scientist /previous lead dev of the core client to keep bitcoin cheap and fast in chance a wave of adoption hits this next winter/spring.
Mike Hearn has capacity management experience at google iirc.  So I would trust his opinion on bitcoin's capacity needs over say, somebody that prioritizes decentralization of mining or extremely low bandwidth use cases.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:55:53
You'll be rich with non-contentious 'decentralized' value! 
It would be unfortunate if, on the lesser chain, you did not have enough transactions to engage in a 'fee market'.  Those are fun to have.

Step 2:
-Take the molasses into a walk-in freezer and turn the jar upside down. When it runs out of the jar, then change bitcoin.

The bigblocks patch isn't even in XT currently.
Given that there's been history of pools saying they approve code and then not installing it i'd find it likely.

I got your point the first time you posted it. 
My point was, when a market is *created*, when two people can do business where they couldn't have before value is increased.  Not that it has anything to do with PR.
Then I said; if a person was to receive small amounts of bitcoin, and use it to buy day to day shit they needed or rent, or whatever, they wouldn't be simply transferring their money to neckbeards, they would be *using* their money.
Your concern that any neckbeards get money is beside the point, which is why I would say don't be jealous.

This is where I believe the blocksize change would happen, although its a loosening of the rules it seems.




So there's clearly a difference in an 'economic consensus' and consensus of all Bitcoin holders, is that difference just a percentage of holders?

I read the list, but I dare not post without technical knowledge, for fear of flooding the list as you describe.
Ive seen many arguments against the blocksize. They are scattered; there is no cohesive line of dissent-- they pick and choose where to snipe.  They dont rebutt all the points made for the blocksize increase in a clear fashion.
It would be helpful if the dissenting group got together and made a list like the people pushing for change have.  But from an outsiders perspective, this is happening because the anti block increase group simply appear to be stonewalling...

For the bigblocks patch to work, the miners would have to have it in their codebase.  It seems as though the miners are simply throwing '8M' into their coinbase scriptsigs without running XT or bigblocks patch.  If 100% of miners did this it would not result in a change.  
@_date: 2015-08-23 23:59:51

I'd like to see a source anywhere resembling that sentiment from a person explaining XT to you.  I don't believe that statement at all...
The likelihood of two chains is small given the grace period, the ease with which to poll the economic consensus, the clearly verifiable mining consensus (no big miners will skew results with notxt).
All the money on the line if they all move to change the codebase there _will_ be solid communication.
So the likelihood of 2 chains for more than a part of a day is very small, and the likelihood of 2 chains where both intend to persist is irrelevant considering one will have the merchants on it and the other will be used solely to count the volume of sour grapes in la la land via dsl internet connections on raspi. 
Quite frankly, my chain will be the chain coinbase uses.  How many coinbase users do you think that applies to?

No, Electrum is perfectly operational with the 1MB block size limit intact.
Electrum is not a centralised client and you will always have control and options with what to do with your coins. The client can't operate as normal without working servers, but you will not lose money if they do not exist. You can always convert an Electrum wallet into another type if desired.
So if supporters of electrum don't want to pay for the servers, they won't have the servers, they could at that point either get the servers or take their coins and move on.

If burning a value on bitcoin's blockchain convinces *anyone* of the valuation of the new asset to be as such, then the market was made.  
Burning a coin does not establish the value of an asset in anything more than the minds of the people making the market, just as the coin itself that was burnt has no value -- except in the minds of the people who made *that* market.

Hella dollars value.
Say for instance the BRICS switch to a gold based currency and a bunch of other countries in the world debt collapse, say the dollar goes to shit (will it really last forever?)
At that point if the dollar is worth almost nothing, saying a bitcoin is worth a certain amount of dollars isn't a helpful indicator of the value of a bitcoin.
The percentage of gold's market cap sounds good, unless maybe the paper gold market collapses, or they find a way to get space gold without it costing so much.

Whether or not a website is a scam is not subjective. 
This assertion that is is a scam *for you*, to sidestep the use of any objective facts to back up your claim, or that you could loosely define what a scam is as you see fit is not the proper way to go about presenting a negative opinion of bitcoin.com.
More likely it would seem you are against a pay to play model for information display or the capitalization of the bitcoin information space?

More lost coins means more value for the other coins.  Two way pegs will probably happen at some point, maybe adding a disincentive to some coin-burners.
If it got so bad as to mess up the currency flow of bitcoin, couldn't more decimal points be added to increase the granularity?
So it really doesn't matter much.
And maybe they don't want to have miners, considering network effect and the difficulty in just bootstrapping bitcoin itself to get beyond security weakness, maybe they don't want the attack vector?

@_date: 2015-08-18 17:27:59


Did you say this because they have sizeable fees or because they have a sizeable volume of transactions?
Your statement hinges on two things: 
* a safe level of decentralization
* when it will become viable
Both of which can be used to stonewall, or you could keep moving the goalposts.
And that sort of approach certainly doesn't 'keep up with technology', unless you're only considering the weakest possible link in the chain dictating the thresholds for fear of 'centralization'.

This can also be applied to the blocksize debate.  Quick let's generate a tower of dialogue but ultimately a lack of complete consensus makes it just a taller tower of the same inaction in the end.

"A hardfork bit that prevents the old chain from overtaking the new chain will provide a much safer hard fork, as a minority chain getting lucky does not harm the new chain."
digitsu [7:29 PM] 
I don’t see the necessity for that really.
[7:30] 
isn’t that just another way of saying to softfork in a hardfork?
1  
[7:31] 
(a consensus rule loosening, but implemented in a way which makes it compatible with the old chain, so that the old one will accept the new blocks)
[7:31] 
or is this referring to another method to “prevent the old chain from overtaking the new chain”?
bitsko [7:32 PM] 
good question. 
 
digitsu [7:32 PM] 
(once again, I don’t see how this is possible or why this is necessary, given that 75% means that the old chain cannot statistically overtake the new one)
[7:32] 
I shall read.
[7:37] 
 Okay interesting read.  But here is the key:
```"Minority" hashpower will always mine the old chain.```
bitsko [7:37 PM] 
so the chain will be behind right?
digitsu [7:37 PM] 
that is a gross simplification, and invalid assumption.
bitsko [7:37 PM] 
digitsu [7:37 PM] 
UNless you also show the orphan rates for the minority chain
[7:37] 
which I assure you will be much higher
[7:38] 
(all you have to do is to invert the ratio)
bitsko [7:38 PM] 
Ah, I get it.
digitsu [7:38 PM] 
and the results assumes that given almost 100% minimum orphan rate for the minority that they will still
```"Minority" hashpower will always mine the old chain.```

I'm aware of that mr. segwit salesman.  I'm saying that if litecoin needed to scale it would HF.  Further that segwit is not the solution.

I believe that this is an unproven assertion, a 'slippery slope'.  There are a wide array of political and corporate alliances within bitcoin and the viewpoints of some are contradictory to each other.  The likelihood that 100% of the network would collaborate on a blacklist seems unlikely given this -how should I say, *geopolitical* distribution of miners.
Ok, off to read your linked article.

This isn't an appeal to authority argument.  
Bitcoin involves economics, although the majority of people involved in the development of bitcoin are programmers.
Therefore it is likely that there are insights to be gained from someone who can explain bitcoin from an economic perspective.


Studies are very valuable. They offer something more than an *opinion*.  
Being self taught is admirable, facts in support of a claim are still necessary.
@_date: 2015-09-27 00:37:17


If [a fee market exists without a blocksize limit]( then the upwards scaling of the limit should not 'create an instability of cost of using bitcoin in relation to the available bitcoins.' it would simply be cheaper/faster to use than a constricted network.  Unless the network was severely backlogged this difference would be negligible.
I enjoyed reading your articles and analyses of nash's and szabo's writing as well as the excerpts themselves however I am failing to see the link I believe you are implying between full blocks and a digital gold.
I still don't see the validity in the proposition that a digital gold can have a payments network but a payments network cannot have a digital gold.  I would say that it is possible to have a digital gold payments network(all layer 1).
@_date: 2015-09-23 10:14:28

What's the necessary level of decentralization?  
Raspi's on DSL?
If the tradeoff is between the technology having use for the unbanked by delaying the fee-market at the cost of nodes mostly only being run by groups--or maintaining the current level of miner 'decentralization' (silly ASIC's ruined it already) at the cost of bitcoin no longer being near zero fee, fast, etc, the better option for the user is to let this piece of mining decentralization go.
It still qualifies as decentralized if it does not have a center, and is distrubuted.  Making it as granular as all the sand on the planet won't make a better system, but a more expensive, slower one.

Bitcoins "economics" and gold are similar in that they are a scarce asset which can be seen as a store of value, but the digital aspects of bitcoin mean its transfer costs can be signifigantly less than that of physical gold.
It's not necessary to restrict the network transaction capabilities to achieve such ends, nor are the two concepts  of a payments network and a digital gold mutually exclusive. Nor does one need to precede the other.
Ill click the links and read whatever, it would be nice if you could point me to some specific part of the lecture series, as I dont see why layer 1 cannot provide both functions, nor why market forces wouldn't  make sure of it, leading to the abandonment of a self-limited bitcoin.

Given that a decent portion of front page news on is directly related to the blocksize debate, you either have failed to draw a reasonable conclusion given the present data, or you *were* being sarcastic and your denial of such makes it disingenuous. Either way its no good for you.


As long as the conflict of interest isnt damaging to bitcoin, like trying to restrict its use to gold 2.0.

If you make it so that people can't use bitcoin, before most of them even start to use bitcoin, they will use something else.  This would create an environment where the value never makes it into bitcoin.  With such a low marketcap, high value transactions being sold for other currencies would cause great volatility.
At 3tps the market penetration available is a non-starter for an ideal money. Nations cannot conduct their business with each other on a middle ground smaller than the collective shoes on their feet.
To quote Nash:


My interpretation of Nash's comments framed around the blocksize debate is this:  
The beer cup hat wearing bitcoiners on the sidelines sincerely believe that for bitcoin to succeed it needs to have both the digital gold and payments network attributes in layer 1.

At one point shortly after that quote, Back proposed a concern for the regulation of miners by governments, which Andresen countered with something like 'if 40% of the hashpower blocks your transaction, 60% of the hashpower will still process your transaction, if it is even identified'
[Back went on to claim]( the risk of a ['slippery slope']( trajectory of centralization.
Gavin countered that the massive economic entities able to transact on a extremely restricted blockchain are a much greater centralization risk.

The governance model of bitcoin core allows any of the core commiters to 'NACK' and then the changes are not added to the code.
Allowing one 'NACK' to stop changes is similar in function to a 'veto' which is 
'the power (used by an officer of the state, for example) to unilaterally stop an official action, especially the enactment of legislation.'

Massive investments of any type would increase the value of bitcoin, thus increasing its utility in transferring such large amounts of value.  Massive investments aggregated from many many sources would increase stability, as any individual actor moving out of the ecosystem would have less of an impact.

There's quite a few ways you could fuck this up by not predicting the future accurately, and people possibly losing money without even losing the bet...


Your shilling for your thread could be seen as a scammer looking to scam funds off people.
My thoughts on what will happen are as such:
The merchants and exchanges will ultimately determine the consensus code; once they are all running the same code (they will, cutting their ecosphere into pieces will fuck up their money) then the other chain will die so damn fast you'll drop from XBT to LTC to VTC to DOGE in value in a short period of time.  
Then I think a few assholes will keep mining the lesser chain and running the software and It'll be some DOGE level niche altcoin.
But actually I think it's more likely core puts something together.  It's what the miners want; core consensus.

I'm just making this up, however, here it is:
Say you make a small site to host a card game you created and are selling for bitcoin.  You have a few satoshis lying around, and you maybe take small groups of your satoshis and use it to record the cards on the blockchain.  Perhaps your site itself uses them to record login identities and somehow the user doesn't have to input a password, they just have to possibly click once or twice...
Say you make a site that sells tickets to an event, you host the info and you sell the tickets which are recorded on the blockchain.
Maybe you host a silly little game that rewards users 49% of the time...
Maybe you make art and tie it to the blockchain in some fashion, so people can see the 'limited' and can prove it isn't from the black market.
It's just a 'package deal' with stuff preconfigured.

2 chains is a rapper, not the fear mongering , dystopian future of bitcoin you paint. The second chain will be suckage by such a large degree that it will be irrelevant.  You can have a good time mining it, and maybe tell people you meet at the supermarket about the 'real' bitcoin.

Those linked projects all would keep bitcoin as the center of value while gaining the advantages of different rulesets like etherium...

I think it would make the network more resilient.  With different implementations,  exploits and errors in coding are likely to be not as wide spread as with a monolithic codebase.

Is Bitmain Using Covert ASICBoost or Not?
As I’ve shown, $2M really isn’t very much for them and given their scale, they probably have a much better return on investment on other projects. We know for example, that they don’t liquid-cool their miners which BitFury does. If we assume Bitmain could get the same increase in hash rate (30%) as BitFury does through liquid cooling, their mining profits would increase at least $20M, a much better return on investment than covert ASICBoost.
Hence, while it’s possible they are using covert ASICBoost, if they don’t it wouldn’t be surprising. Let’s just say that it’s probably not high on their list of priorities if covert ASICBoost hasn’t been done yet and not a high priority to keep if it has.

I validate the blockchain twice too.  With wallets that I never use, because I am a hodler.  I just like to have two copies running you know, just in case one of the storage mediums fails, you know, how would I then know as to whether or not other peoples transactions were valid, if anybody doublespent or something, and the blocks, you know,  you gotta make sure those are valid too.  This is really the only way to actually use bitcoin.  Anyone else that is not doing this i mean how can they even really know for sure like that the government hasnt like taken over the network I mean its decentralized so everybody needs to always check every other thing or else its not bitcoin.

Considering the difficulty in moving around a single satoshi, and the low cost of say, 10000 satoshis, I don't think they would use such a low value token.  Not that I am implying the value of bitcoin is increased by tying up such meager amounts of funds, rather, that an increased utility of the blockchain boosts the speculative value of the currency. 
 Also the idea that if you have your stocks or house on the blockchain, you likely support and invest in bitcoin otherwise.

I've seen nothing beyond conspiracy theories so far with this... do you have any proof?


The solution is not some radical change to the security model of bitcoin, but progress on the decentralisation of mining.  Not a change to some kind of nodecoin, but an increase in the number of mining nodes.
If you want to help bitcoin's decentralisation, instead of contentiously softardforking and costing us all money, mine at a loss.
There is no economy that I have seen to be backing UASF.  It's a ridiculous proposition from a business standpoint.  I've been looking for even users to pledge they would put all of their bitcoins into SW tx, as i've seen supporters encouraging other supporters to use their wallets, yet, noone has made a pledge to move their money so far.
I still see it as a game of chicken... the whole point is to force the hashrate to do something, yet if that fails, the whole thing is a failure.

We could easily be doing 20mb blocks right now. Also, low bandwidth block relay using thin blocks looks to be just around the corner.  "A full 1mb block would drop to about ~70 kilobytes, in theory, if you were online for the whole time since the last block."

Only when their arguments support the validity of their experience.  And my mechanic is not doing my plumbing, my plumber is not tasked with my electrical work.  I appeal to the authority of those I trust, as I am not expert in all facets of life, does that make me wrong?
Looks like some of the readers who enjoyed 'fooled by randomness' were quite critical of the shift in focus he took in Black swan.  From the Amazon reviews:
"...As for the "Black Swan" concept, it is theoretically worthless: since any event can be explained ex-post, a "Black Swan" is merely a pretentious term for "unforeseen event with major consequences". Incidentally, I find it paradoxical that someone who endeavours to write on uncertainty should be so certain of himself.
And don't try Taleb's approach to risk management, which is essentially forgetting about unfavourable events since they are not predictable. I seem to understand that the author takes a dim view of planning, but he should think again. Planning is what people do when they have to prepare for an uncertain future (like the military does, for example). One of the keys to good planning is general knowledge: reading the newspapers for example, something Taleb takes a misplaced pride in not doing."

You want to know what I think you mean?

Fallacy of specifics, lol, you literally cannot support either of those claims with evidence, if you tried.


Of course not.


Mike Hearn is trying to get the 'lead merger' to step up to the plate and make some decisions, like a lead of any other software project would.


He said XT is the only scaling option that *is* coded, can you see the difference?


I have a hard time with continuing this reply when you keep bringing up propaganda sprinkles, lol.


Gavin Andresen ran some tests to see if 20 MB would work, and he concluded it would.  I've not seen any statements of any miners behind the great firewall having ran any tests to come to the conclusion that 8MB would be ok.  I've only seen a joint statement with cool red ink stamps that had a bunch of miners signing on 8.  8 is in fact a lucky number in china, not terrible, lucky.


Bro that's a fallacy of inaccuracy.  Did I just make that up? LOL

Is your statement then meaning that higher interest rates were revolutionary because they had been outlawed for so long?  
I don't see how people think bitcoin is a quasi- religion.  To me, it embodies the idea that if you don't like how things work and want them to change, the best way possible to spur a _revolution_ is by creating a better way of doing things , and if it is truly better for people, they will naturally want to be a part of it.

Interesting story about the miners.  I tried to look it up and found a 3\12\2013 reddit post explaining something similar, but not quite the same. 


Which would imply that a developer made a fix and asked miners to use it.


I see your point.  In the current space, this isn't much a concern, as all development is concentrated on core, and a little on XT, which is based and would likely be rebased upon core as needed , and I have no idea how much development there is at all on bitcoin unlimited, but again, it's core, and would be redone if core changed significantly. But the risk in the current space then is btcsuite, who have a good track record so far for what it's worth.

The problem with the battle against 'centralisation' and the advocacy of promoting the importance of relays(despite their lack of proper incentives) leaves the network with a distance of connectivity vulnerable to Sybil attacks. 
Miners control the propagation across the network. They are central to the network, not centralised.
The solution is for you and others to procure mining hardware, not to weaken the security model of the network.

As long as we're clear that by 'almost zero adoption' we mean, among other things, 13,000 subreddit subscribers and  500 nodes. Obvious fake nodes are obvious.

No. A 51% attack is when 51% of the hashrate is controlled by one entity.  This would put the blockchain off of earth, which would increase its immutability.  And maybe let anyone access the net with bitcoin and a dish?

Low fees are important for mass adoption, mass adoption for the volume; number of transactions is important for miner income phasing away from block subsidy.  Why not high volume of transactions on a network that also serves the purpose of wealth storage?  Why do you see that as incompatible?

Yes I run a node, and I increased the amount of free transactions it carries and lowered the min relay fee.
[Global average upload speed is about 5Mbps today (source 1, source 2). This means 50% of the internet connected world could in theory handle the bandwidth requirements of 90MB blocks today. Don't believe me? Math is easy 5Mbps / 8bits X 600s = 375 MB every 10min. Since you will need to download and upload that many blocks and transactions from 1 peer and to at least 1 peer 375 / 4 = 93.75MB blocks are possible to run a neutral (non-leaching, non helping node). To help the network and upload to multiple peers you would need more bandwith, but 35 countries around the world have more than 5Mbps bandwidth (source 3). Let's say all users are only willing to use 25% of their bandwidth to run a node, 23MB blocks are still possible today for half the world, and that's if blocks are 100% full 24/7.](

It's comforting to have a place you can trust.
It's important however for the health of bitcoin to have multiple places for people to have discussions, to mitigate such abuses of power.  I never much visited bitcointalk, but after the gold down bitcoin UP thread was migrated to bitco.in, I noticed some interesting discussion going on.
I've seen other kinds of forums go through turmoils wherein a large part of the disgruntled userbase is given a safe haven under the auspices of greater freedoms, sometimes it pans out, sometimes its the same old shit or worse at a different place.  
I'm with you that the ideal is to have a decentralized forum, and i'd like to hear of any attempts to solve the pedonazi problem...  
bitcoin.^com's subreddit is Your preference to be overseen by theymos is questionable still to me simply because I feel moderation should avoid bias, and bias has clearly been shown.
I believe Ver let a highly detailed anti-Ver post stay on the boards, when there wasn't even much else on the boards...

You point out that there has been an XT block in the past two weeks.  You point this out with a clear intention to imply this is insufficient for success.  How many blocks are mined right now isn't relevant to what's coming.
You also make claims of 'XT vote manipulation', but for this you fail to provide 'facts'.

Cool story then bro.


I don't need you to pass along my tx.
UASF is an entirely different beast than SW.  It's a risk to funds, and hilariously it is a plea for people to put those funds at risk.  How likely is that?  Bitcoin was built on incentives, and theres no incentive to risk funds for UASF.

@_date: 2017-05-18 22:55:32
No really.  I contend that it is contentious.  
The UTXO solution being billed as a blocksize increase is a poor blocksize increase, and there was inadequate involvement in that decision making process.
Can you prove to me that malleability is something that *needs* fixed?  
Can you explain how the deal which luke was party to did not result in HF code, *in a core release*, and can you see how this is why it lacks mining support.
Can you explain how a bitcoin miner would be incentivised to allow a discount on signatures?
Can you explain what happens if the miners signal for segwit, but continue to mine regular blocks and do not validate the witness data?
Do you understand the the idea behind a softfork for segwit was to avoid getting more people on board with it, a way to slip in a change by working with bitcoin miners?
Do you recognize that the attack surface segwit creates with its block weight scheme hampers future increases of the max_block_size?
Segwit is contentious.
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:11:17

No, 'centralisation' won't become unstoppable.
Mining pools can be seen as a sort of a firm,
"Coase argues that the size of a firm (as measured by how many contractual relations are "internal" to the firm and how many "external") is a result of finding an optimal balance between the competing tendencies of the costs outlined above. In general, making the firm larger will initially be advantageous, but the decreasing returns indicated above will eventually kick in, preventing the firm from growing indefinitely."

I don't care much for the software trickery, no matter the activation method it compels its use by making the original software unattractive.  This is the 'fee market' and full blocks at work.

It does not have to be a zionist plot for people to be financially motivated to see their vision succeed.
Of course I don't understand bitcoin fully, but I am confident in my assertion that this direction will stifle and damage bitcoin.
The solution to miner centralization is to decrease it by increasing the number of miners, not to rework the system's security outside of the byzantine generals problem.
Centrality is not centralization and the network topology was designed a certain way for a reason.   These people looking to change it don't understand the maths behind it.  
You ought to know that lightning will not work for much with such high opening and closing fees, and further, that it should compete on its own merits, and not a twisting of the incentives so that it becomes favorable.

I'm literally drinking coffee right now and if it was not so delicious, and if I did not wish to keep my screen cleanly, I would spit this coffee onto your post, as it is total shit.

Excessive nodes are unnecessary and the burden of accounting lies on those who decide they need it.  The less useful something is to someone, the less likely they are to do it.  The less useful bitcoin is, the less people will want to be an accountant for the network.  
Im sure the backpage escorts and lsd trippers will pick up the node count for you, lol. /s

There is a block subsidy for the miners and a fee market exists without a blocksize limit.
Layers are the solution to capturing bitcoin, not to scaling it.
Your constraints are based on a false understanding of the tech.

Do you want to kill bitcoin?

As a user, I can understand why miners would be 'actively hostile' to you.

It's how the damn network was built.
