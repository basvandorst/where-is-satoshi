Would you consider releasing your book on Amazon?

Maybe this may help:

BitPay and BTCPay are not quite the same -  [  It's an open-source server that will allow you to add bitcoin payments to a website easier. There are some places that will rent a VPS out for you and install it. I would also advise getting a hardware wallet too, as you don't want to have your money (private keys) stored on the payment processor in case someone hacks the shit out of it.

Hm, equating the premise that wealth equals intelligence, I think is dubious at best.
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:41:21
Just some context - this is one of the good things about Bitcoin, every transaction is public.  You can search by the address or the transaction id. u/FastSellerService sent you a link to what is called a blockchain explorer it's a website so you can search for transactions easily.

I use [bitwage]( and I live in Washington. It's not an exchange but you can get your coin.

It's pretty simple actually. You can set it up to buy via direct deposit or you can deposit money into the bank account they give you. Your purchase shows up a few days later. It's not an exchange, but it gets the job done.

If it wasn't for his book I wouldn't have a clue. I would have no investments, period. My parents were clueless about money. My dad wasted all his money on penny stocks, comparing "investing" as gambling. I didn't buy it. A friend of mine just so happened to have his first book.  It opened a path to prosperity for me and I things are working out great these days.

How did you or someone else design the immersion tank (unsure if this the right word). I've been very interested in Novec, but I don't know where to start on creating such a system.

I would sell however much to cover your initial costs, and perhaps take a small profit and hold the rest.
@_date: 2019-11-16 05:10:51
This is pretty amazing. It looks museum-worthy.

Only if you promise to dump it to 2k or below.

Damn, I was thinking you'd etch onto the crystal :) how much are you selling them for?

Would you consider growing miracle berries for the US market?

That all sounds good, but it seems most of the jobs are focused on either Javascript people or C++ people. I'm not in either camp

I  wouldn't say that no once cares. I am deeply interested in what you are doing. I would do something similar but I have no capital or direct experience with aquaponics to even attempt this. How do you even get started?
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:11:58
How are the keys/data stored?
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:49:44
Have you considered growing endangered crops like bananas or experimenting growing staples such as wheat, rice, or corn? My thoughts is that controlled environment farming will be the way forward in food production using things like the food computer

It's a business card from one of the devs. I thought it was cool :)

I think this is some really great technology, it uses the same language &amp; dev environment as ethereum but with bitcoin instead.

Don't tell them a damn thing. When I was a kid, I brought my own video game systems, toys etc. Always got taken away or given away. Don't let them know about it, and don't tell them unless it's a dire emergency.

Wow, that's an amazing deal!  Are you profitable after rent or did you pay upfront?

Why on earth does the current situation in France have anything to do with Africans or their descendants? What a shitty, simple-minded argument.

I suppose I wasn't clear in my question - I meant how much it's costing yourself to rent a physical location to house your mining gear? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 01:41:35
How much does it cost to rent out your location? This sounds like a doable thing for myself so I'm trying to get a rough cost estimate.
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:09:15
Thank you, you've given me some information to chew on.

Youngin,  
I'm not a European, and I don't know your life, but here is my advice for you: Learn web design (or some other skill with low start-up costs and high-profit margins) and try to develop a small business for yourself.  If you can make it work, you can then save some of the profits.

I told my wife about my crypto holdings for two reasons:
Untimely death
Investment Opportunity
I want to be sure that she will have something even if we don't make it. I'd rather her know something about it and then tell others then to try to be selfish with this incredible knowledge &amp; opportunity.
Got her own hardware wallet, it's up to her now.

Wow, tcrypt. You're a bit of dick. They way you're treating this guy, talking down to him doesn't make me hope much for how you and others at openbazzar think about other people that are not making software. 
You might sit here and say you don't give a shit what other people think but you keep replying. Knowing when to shut one's mouth is a skill too.
