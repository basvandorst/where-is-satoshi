A CANVAS ILLUSTRATING BAIE-SAINT-PAUL WILL REMAIN AT THE MUSEUM
Wednesday, August 31, 2016 by ÉMILIE DESGAGNÉS
The enormas painting "The Immersion" by artist Thibault Laget-Ro is now in the private collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Baie-Saint-Paul. 
The huge canvas "Immersion" by French artist Thibault Laget-Ro remain in Baie-Saint-Paul, a city that inspired the artist who painted during his stay at the International Symposium of Contemporary Art.
Indeed, thanks to a fundraiser organized by David Mancini, owner of Gite TerreCiel, $ 150 CAD and $ 5,000 in bitcoins - a virtual currency increasingly used in the world - was raised for the purchase of 'colorful work which now belongs to the Museum of Contemporary Art of Baie-Saint-Paul.
"The artist was selling $ 6 500 but accepted this amount," says David Mancini.  The painting is a good representation of the color and diversity of Baie-Saint-Paul, he said.  It's good that the painting can stay here and I knew that the museum did not have the means to buy it, "he said.
In the scene taking place on St-Jean-Baptiste, on the canvas of 3.2 meters by 1.3 meters, one can recognize silhouettes including that of the Director of the Museum of Contemporary Art Jacques St-Gelais Tremblay with, in the basket of his bike, his dog Willy.

I used to pay one of my suppliers in bitcoins but I switched back to Canadian dollars.   I prefer to hold my bitcoins which I believe will go up in value and pay my bills in magic government money which historically loses it's value.   Maybe once it becomes easier for me to obtain bitcoins (circle, I am waiting for you), I will return to paying my suppliers in bitcoin.

Follow these steps:
1) Pick a restaurant in Montreal that you want to eat at. 
2) Call them and ask them if you can pay with bitcoins.  (Usually works best if you know the owner or are a frequent customer.
3) Set them up with a paper wallet, print them a we accept bitcoin sign with their QR code (perfect for future customers)
4) Go eat there and send the payment to their QR code
5) Be available to answer any questions they have in the future.  Also show them coinmap.org so they know they are no the only ones.

I have been accepting bitcoins for over a year at my business.   There are services available (bitpay) that can transfer the bitcoins to your local currency if you are worried about the fluctuations.  Personally my business is holding them since we are clearly in the early stages of bitcoins growth.   The free publicity just for accepting bitcoins has more than outweighed the fluctuations.
Also, you can start accepting bitcoins today!  It is really easy to start.

Ok, I found this text from bitcoin.org that fits perfectly to the question:
*Bitcoin is money, and money has always been used both for legal and illegal purposes. Cash, credit cards and current banking systems widely surpass Bitcoin in terms of their use to finance crime. Bitcoin can bring significant innovation in payment systems and the benefits of such innovation are often considered to be far beyond their potential drawbacks.
Bitcoin is designed to be a huge step forward in making money more secure and could also act as a significant protection against many forms of financial crime. For instance, bitcoins are completely impossible to counterfeit. Users are in full control of their payments and cannot receive unapproved charges such as with credit card fraud. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and immune to fraudulent chargebacks. Bitcoin allows money to be secured against theft and loss using very strong and useful mechanisms such as backups, encryption, and multiple signatures.
Some concerns have been raised that Bitcoin could be more attractive to criminals because it can be used to make private and irreversible payments. However, these features already exist with cash and wire transfer, which are widely used and well-established. The use of Bitcoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems, and Bitcoin is not likely to prevent criminal investigations from being conducted. In general, it is common for important breakthroughs to be perceived as being controversial before their benefits are well understood. The Internet is a good example among many others to illustrate this.*

Since  I use square in my business and accept bitcoins, here is what I do.
I use the square register to calculate taxes and total.   Customer then sends me the proper amount of bitcoins to one of my wallets.   Then I click the "other payment" option in square so the receipt is sent to the customer,
When it is time to do my accounting, all of my transactions are there.  
Creditcard, cash, and other(bitcoin)
Pretty simple.

I think people are slowly starting to understand bitcoin.  It is a very new concept for many people.  Also there is not very much information available in French.  
Every morning when customers check out I say, "we accept bitcoin, cash, or credit card"  A conversation is made each morning usually after the customer repeats, "what is bitcoin?"
From what I see in my town, most people are holding their bitcoins as investment and using it less like a currency.

I own a B&amp;B that accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:58:57
here is my response for the moment...  ... what do you think?
Money Laundering, gambling and illegal activities happen more often with US dollars and Canadian dollars.  There is just a small percentage of people that will use bitcoin for that.  
If people are using bitcoin for illegal activities, that alone gives bitcoin value.

Hello,   I run a small hotel in canada that accepts bitcoin since October 2013.  We offer a 10% discount for the customers that pay in bitcoin because the transaction is instant without transaction fees.  We keep all bitcoin payments in bitcoin and do not "cash out" with services like bit pay.  Just set up a free bitcoin wallet and customers can start paying you in bitcoin.   For the first time we have an international money, that is great for tourists.  Best of luck!   Do not forget to add your business to coinmap.org

Bitcoin is an internet money.  I think it would be best to send links to informative websites (maybe even youtube videos).   Also, printing publicity is not very good for the environment, some inks are toxic.

The rule I hear often repeated here: never invest more than you are willing to lose.
Bitcoin is an experiment that has been going on for 5 years now.   Buying bitcoins through an exchange or through a bitcoin ATM is the easy way.   You could also try mining, but it is not worth it at this point.

Scan the private key with your telephones camera to import.
@_date: 2016-06-04 02:52:16
You can buy special computer hardware (ASICs) to mine bitcoins.   It is often not recommended because you first need to buy the hardware, then use electricity to use the hardware.   It is a very competitive space and it's best to just buy bitcoins.  
I usually buy mine at a Bitcoin ATM (which are in most Canadian cities)
@_date: 2016-06-04 02:02:04
What are miners doing in China to prepare for the halving?
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:24:40
After every 210,000 blocks, the reward for the miners drops in half (about every 4 years).   Currently miners receive 25 bitcoins, and in less than a month it will be 12.5 bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:23:32
I mine with slush, and I have no idea how my miner works.  Maybe I messed something up!  I hope I didn't break Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:12:55

Do you know what address you sent it to?  Contact the owner of the address.  One of the good points in Bitcoin is that transactions are not reversible, unfortunately you experience the bad side of this.  
Please post a link to the blockchain.info page with the transaction details.
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:59:01
I've seen prices of things around me going down as Bitcoin gains value.  Like coffee, etc.   this will just continue.  One day people that hold one full Bitcoin will be rare.

Rather than taking direct profits for me now, I am guaranteeing better value for me (and everyone) in the long term.
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:55:39
Welcome back friend.  
The halvening is happening in less than a month (Bitcoin miners receive half of what they were earning per block).
China is buying Bitcoin like crazy right now and the price is going up.
There is a debate going on about block size, so the blockchain can accept more transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-14 01:48:57
If you do not have possession of the private keys, then you do not really own the bitcoins.  Coinbase is good for buying bitcoins, but store them on a wallet on your telephone or tablet, or print a paper wallet at bitaddress.org

I suggest buying bitcoins for long term savings.  You can send them to a paper wallet that you print at bitaddress.org 
The price has always gone up and down, don't panic over the fluctuations.

What percent of bitcoins do you have to sell to pay fees like electricity, etc.  what percentage of bitcoins are you holding?
@_date: 2016-06-14 01:50:29
If you are in the U.S., I heard it is easy with Coinbase.com  It is always best to store your bitcoins in a wallet, and not on a website like coinbase.   
If you have an apple product, i suggest the bread wallet.  You could also store bitcoins on a paper wallet that you can create at bitaddress.org
have fun!

Coinbase and coinbase are actually 2 different things.    One is an online currency exchange and the other is part of the blockchain code.
Blockchain (2 different things)
Coinbase (2 different things)

New Bitcoins will continue to be added into circulation, even after you are dead.  We will eventually arrive at 21 million,  then it will stop.   As more and more tech starts implementing Bitcoin, their value will continue to go up.   Eventually we won't be comparing it to the U.S. Dollar, as the US dollar will lose almost all of it's value.

The Bitcoin halvings happen after a certain number of blocks (210,000 if my memory is good).   Each block is mined around every 10 minutes, but not precisely.   We can only estimate then at what time the halving will occur.
