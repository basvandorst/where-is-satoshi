I insult because I'm an asshole and mostly a troll.  In this case I do believe what I'm telling you though.
You realize you were wrong about the monetary inflation.  I honestly forgot where I got the Coinbase info from and don't feel like searching for it.  It is common sense though.  Think about this.  What are their costs to transact with bitcoin--they literally approach zero.  They do have programming costs but at this point a lot of that is baked in.  Their main costs are transaction fees with banks and credit cards.  I suppose you could make the argument that the employees cost 1% but I would seriously doubt it.  
It is just true that current regulation and banking fees are exorbitant.  At the minimum bitcoin will help with that.  Even if you aren't a fan, that should be cheered.
As far as the 1200 by the end of 2016.  I just feel very confident about that.  Right now, imo, 250 is EXTREMELY suppressed and due to way too much fear because of last years implosion.  I would put the real value somewhere around 500.  So assuming this is true, what happens when the daily supply of bitcoin is halved (happening next year). If only the same amount of commerce continues to happen with bitcoin that sets the price around 1000.  Now, assume commerce increases some and the overall economy expands and you see where I come up with my numbers.  Is this a wag, overall, yes but I think it's a reasonable one.  Once bitcoin hits 1200 with an expanding base and a shrinking supply, you can see how confidence could push it up much further.  Marry that with all the institutional investors getting on board and I think going into 2020, you're looking at some rather cheery numbers.  Another thing to consider is the reputation of many of the new exchanges, etc.  The days of only having to deal with shady ass businesses like Mt. Gox are over.  
Couple all this with the fact that bitcoin is STILL not even a known quantity by most people and a large push into remittances and yes I'm extremely optimistic. 
The main thing against bitcoin is skeptical critics and parties with a vested interest in it's failure.  I don't think central banks are going to be too happy about it.  The critics will "adjust" their viewpoints with success.
We'll see but I think I'm right and reasonably conservative.

You guys are about dumb as shit.  Welcome to the end of bitcoin.  No fungibility, no bitcoin.  
My guess is the folks pushing this kind of sneaky attack on fungibility know EXACTLY what they are doing.
I hear all bitcoins are stolen.  No one better accept them as payment for anything.
@_date: 2015-03-22 22:10:10
Sounds like as long as some company is charging you a fee to use your money and of course inflation tax then you're all set.  
@_date: 2015-03-27 04:29:33
The inflation is less than USD next year.  I've already done the math.  The coinbase fee is minimal and based on the fees your bank charges--sorry play again.
By the end of 2016, bitcoin will be higher than 1200--if not sooner.  Everything I told you was fact.

You're married?  Jesus...a family of monkeys.  Are your kids as retarded as you?  Do they get picked on in school a lot or have you been unable to have children?  Maybe one of them died?  Dumb kids from idiot parents tend to die more frequently.

fungibility....I agree.  Take that away from bitcoin and it loses it's power.  Op knows this.  That's what he wants.

You still don't understand anything.  It doesn't matter how you "feel" which is what you are going by.  The only thing that matters is what is.  I should have explained what the take away was. 
1) White genocide is occurring.  The reasons don't matter.
2) Zionists Jews control WAY more than they should.  They exploit other nations by encouraging "multiculturalism".  They do this to divide people so they are easier to manipulate.  Ask yourself why Jews make up 2% of our population yet control 60-80% of our congress.
What do you think bitcoin is fixing?  Lmfao.  Bitcoin takes away the Zionists power to control through the power of creating money.
Anyhow, I can see that you are thoroughly brainwashed and just want to feel good so good luck with that.
Also, I don't hate anyone.  I don't hate black people.  I just don't want them robbing or beating me.  Perhaps you should take a look at what coontown is talking about.  Did you even know that blacks commit over 50% of all murders yet make up only 13% of the population.  Go look at the stats.  This is real.
As far as me being an embarrassment, I think you need to read what's happening in Europe and elsewhere.  The world is waking up to the Zionist ways.  Europe is starting to lean far right.  What this means is nationalism.  There is nothing wrong with nationalism.  There never has been.  It's only the elite bankers that dislike it and attempt to characterize it as something it isn't.  
 
This is what's happening before your very eyes and you don't even see it.
Soon in this country you won't be able to legally deny the holocaust.  If you don't see what's wrong with that, I can't help you.  If you want to know who controls you, just ask who you can't criticize. 
I'll leave you with this:

It'll be 10 damn years before you see SSDs this size.  This shit has been predicted forever now.  Other developments have already been made that would allow for this but haven't come to market because the competing forces just aren't there.  He'll, Moore's law itself has been broken years ago.  Companies have simply stopped putting out new and better products.  We've been in a rut for 5 damn years.

Trolling bitcoin since 4 bucks.  has to be the most unsuccessful venture ever.

WinkDex...I don't think so.  I feel dumber for saying it.   I could understand VossDex but WinkDex.  The term wink is just stupid in this context.  Winking is not professional.  
Here is the WinkDex.

I have no clue what you're talking about.  Who are these hoards?

That's the point of my post.
@_date: 2015-03-28 06:48:34
You dumb ass.  You're comparing two different types of inflation.  We're SPECIFICALLY talking about money supply inflation not consumer prices.  MORON.
If you can't see how the monetary base is growing like gangbusters then I can't help you.  
As far as Coinbase charging you 1%, that's not that bad but STILL it is because of fees imposed on them for DOING BUSINESS WITH THE BANKING SYSTEM.
I'm not trolling you.  You're just dumb.
Also, no one is looking at this now man.  It's just me and you.
@_date: 2015-03-29 04:20:04
You've been brainwashed about that as well.  I understand your reaction.  I would have told me to go fuck myself two years ago as well.  I suggest you go to every once in a while and try to look past the hate and start listening to the posts and the history of "race relations", especially as it concerns Zionists Jews.  Often the truth is very ugly and hurtful.  I don't want to be racist but I'll tell you man, if you're white, you better consider it.
  
Many people think Bobby Fischer went crazy in his later years.  I use to think that too.  Now, I'm not so sure.

Honestly what we need are more payment processors that accept a LOT of different payment options and the store owners wouldn't give a shit if they didn't even have to deal with it.

You dumb ass.  I'm not a buttcoin troll.  Anyone that thinks bitcoin exchanges should freeze "stolen" bitcoins is a buttcoin troll--probably you.
If you kill bitcoins fungibility, you kill bitcoin.  Some of you people are either so fucking stupid or so fucking deceptive--I can't tell which.
@_date: 2015-03-21 23:00:58
You're just a dick.  Own that shit.  You started the conversation off by saying I'm a buttcoin troll.  I really have nothing further to say to you because I'm pretty certain you're either deceptive or don't know what the fucking implications of loss of fungibility are.  
Just to get your pea sized brain thinking what happens if all exchanges randomly label any bitcoin they choose "stolen" or "bad".  Who the fuck wants bitcoin then.  THEY WON'T BE FUNGIBLE.  Go look that up then ask yourself why you're a fucking retard.
Edit:  Previous paragraph was mostly for other idiots that may think you're actually good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:53:18
So in essence your point is bitcoin inflation is greater than USD inflation for one more year and banks suck because they charge Coinbase fees for buying bitcoin.  
In one year half of that problem is fixed and the other half is still because of banks.
I'm going to clue you in also on what I believe is going to happen in the bitcoin space.  Bitcoin has a lot of negativity mostly because of the fact it's seen highs of 1200.   No one really cares about volatility so long as the general path is upward.  The only reason it jumped to 1200 was because the criminals at Mt. Gox scammed the system and got away with it since they were the only real exchange at that time.  Now that more exchanges are coming aboard and the mining rewards are halving next year, you can expect bitcoin value to go up significantly.  When it finally reaches a stable 1200, it will not shoot up to crazy amounts any more because of one exchanges criminal activity.  It is going to incrementally continue to climb.  Expect a LOT of people to take it much more seriously at that point and a TON of infrastructure to build around it.
No one is going to want to hold money that goes down in value when they can easily exchange to money that goes up.

So uhh....what kind of information can these folks get from me?  I publicly admit I like watching midget porn.  I have t-shirts that say it.  My grandma wears one that says, "I'm with midget fucker" when we hang out.

When the reward halves, there will be less bitcoins put up for sale every day (from miners) but the transaction volume will remain the same.  Something will have to give.  I think it will be price.  It is a wag but I think a good one.  Also, historically, this is what has happened in the past.
Remittances just put more pressure on BTC purchases.  BTC has to be bought and sold for remittances to occur and it's just another organic way people enter the market. 
As far as security goes it really doesn't matter as much as people think when mining power is concentrated.  Look at the section here under "an attacker has a lot of computing power".  
Anyhow, in the end, any currency is mostly about confidence.  The real question is will people slowly learn to have confidence in bitcoin.  We'll see. 
Take care.
