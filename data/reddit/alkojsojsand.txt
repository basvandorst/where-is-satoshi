Yes that's because bitcoin is not real money and the miners fee is actually measured in USD.  Since the btc to usd price rose over the last 2 years they had to lower the btc fee.  If they kept it the same that would mean fees would be $2.33 per transaction + subsidy.  You are either awful at math or you're being intentionally deceitful.

No, you just completely made that up and have no evidence to back that up.  As I said earlier, most bitcoin transactions are simply junk/spam and they will not pay transaction fees.

Ok so 2 years ago there was 40,000 transactions per day.  Now there are 110,000 per day.
2 years ago there was 5,000 a day in transaction fees going to miners.  Now there is 4,000.
End of story.  Transaction fees do not get higher just because number of transactions does.  The entire argument that 20mb blocks brings increased transactions and thus increased fees is nothing more than a lie.

And a large number of transactions doesn't increase fees either.  Over the last 365 days transactions per day has doubled.  Over the last 365 days fees from transactions actually declined.
The elephant in the room for 20MB proponents is that transaction fees for the network have not gone up in 2 years despite a massive increase in overall transactions.  
The reason for this of course is the majority of transactions on the bitcoin network are simply junk/spam.  In all the debates for 1mb/20mb, I never see a 20MB proponent bring up incentivising mining.  Probably because the current method of high transactions paying low fees is just demonstrably failing.  99.5% of a miner's income at the moment is a subsidy which is exponentially decreasing.  But sure, let's jam more useless transactions that are unwilling to pay fees on the block chain...
Problem is most of you drank the "world currency" koolaid, and the simple fact is that bitcoin will never operate as a currency to pay for small ticket items with.  What that also means is that your investments will likely not pan out.  20mb is just a desperate attempt to keep the illusion of "world currency" going for a couple more years.
