I don't mind botnets mining. They still serve the blockchain making it more robust - and as a nice side effect the people owning the computers that are part of the botnet might due to the power draw/heat actually notice earlier that they are infected.

Indeed, and at some point the class of functions is so big that the ASIC that is optimal to solve all of them is actually a general purpose CPU/GPU - which everybody can buy off the shelve already. Voila, problem solved.

Let us say there is a new algorithm that is more ASIC resistant and a very well designed ASIC made to solve this algorithm gives about 2x the performance while using 0.5x amount of power in comparison to an off the shelve GPU/CPU.
Yes this is an advantage for whoever builds it - but a) they do have to make up that investment, which will take a while and b) the advantage is not big enough to kick everybody with off the shelve hardware out of the game.

I'm just not happy with the justification that ASICs kill botnets. ASICs are a threat to the security of bitcoin and other altcoins because they make it impossible for ordinary people to mine and contribute to the blockchain. The idea that everybody can contribute is an integral part of the idea.

There is an analysis out there that shows that the first x-blocks are very certainly mined by satoshi due to a very specific pattern in the nonce value.

Orphaning valid blocks and the problems for users and merchants actually using bitcoin (and nearly all of them are using core implementation) that go along with switching back and force between different chains would be a PR disaster for bitcoin as a whole. The price would tank pretty hard since the news would be dominated by how BU is disrupting the function of bitcoin and how unstable bitcoin is.
Just imagine what would happen if core pushed out a new version that ignores all blocks from miners that signal BU support. Actions like these would damage the bitcoin image beyond repair.

If a block is too big it won't be accepted by non 2x nodes - so a bigger block will be the point where 2x and core diverge.

You're missing the point that it will convert power into small amounts of bitcoins that can be used for transactions done with the device - and doing transactions is the idea behind it. By generating a small amount of bitcoins one prevents that the users have to give their bank/credit card data to some dubious online service to buy bitcoins just to get started with the whole system.

I thought about the same. Should be more durable than the what comes out of the typical inkjet printers - and every letter also leaves an 'impression' in the paper, makes me feel safer about recovering the key in case the color faded away.

I didn't find the code very impressive. The whole system and idea is amazing and fascinating. But for example the whole code for validating and accepting transactions and blocks is more on the ugly side - due to changes, fixes and exemptions that had to be added.

Actually not all transactions. All transactions that are somehow based on the bitcoins that were generated by the blocks in the now disbanded blockchain are now invalid.
This could actually be pretty bad for someone running a mining pool and not being careful with sending out reward to the miners. If he pays the miners from any other bitcoins than the ones from the solved block the mining pool owner would lose bitcoins because suddenly the mined bitcoins are gone but the reward is already sent out.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:06:41

Yes, whenever you spend your bitcoins you publish the public key to authenticate that you 'own' this address. As soon as this public key is published one could calculate the associated private key using a quantum computer and also gain access to funds at that address.
Since QC with the power to do that are still far away and bitcoin could simply switch from ECDSA to a QC save signature system there is nothing to fear.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:55:15
I wouldn't go down to Satoshis. mBTC is perfectly fine for now. If exchange rate continues to skyrocket one could still switch to uBTC and keep it there. People are used to something like cents and with uBTC a Satoshi would be the equivalent (1/100 of a uBTC). I would just stay away from the using Satoshi and stick to SI Units + BTC - much clearer that way.
@_date: 2013-03-20 10:11:46
The IP is not really that informative it, I think it is only the IP that blockchain info received the block from - not the IP of whoever pool/miner found it.
Better take a look at the payout address that is used in these blocks:
39 solved blocks in the last two days -&gt; ~13% of all blocks -&gt; ~13% of the hashrate:
5.8THash/s... that is quite a lot. So which pool/miner is that?
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:48:18
it's also possible to include messages in bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2013-10-15 09:50:20
Depends on how much you could sell the miner for.
@_date: 2013-05-08 15:13:31
But why?

I looked into hacking the fuelband myself and what I found so far is that the firmware on it gets uploaded to it in an encrypted proprietary format.
It should be possible to reflash the bluetooth and main firmware via JTAG - but that would mean ripping apart the fuelband.
@_date: 2013-07-12 06:56:57
The way I understood it: the SHA256 rounds are not rolled out so the block can really only do one hash in 66 clock cycles. At 152MHz that would be around 2.3Mh/s (singe SHA256, so half that for doble SHA256).
Correct me if I'm wrong.

While I agree with your statement about premature optimization... I didn't talk about writing inline assembler or optimizing data structures to fit the cache. Since when is writing in C a premature optimization?
I also find pure C much more readable than javascript.
@_date: 2013-03-18 22:51:28
Bluetooh would be perfectly fine. The device would just sign transactions and would never send the private key through the air. The display+button(s) would be used to see and approve the transaction before signing it and ideally also to display the private key for off device backup.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:52:52
I think it's always confusing to tell people that one can mine bitcoins - because average joe won't be able to do that. Instead one should explain that the miners are building the backbone of the system and as a reward they get a few bitcoins.
Also mentioning Silk Road and Tor is not a good idea.
@_date: 2013-07-31 13:34:50
For this to be an issue someone needs to calculate the private key from the public key using a quantum computer before the transaction is included in the blockchain by any of the miners/miningpools. How long does it take for the average transaction to be included in the blockchain? 10minutes.
So the question is: can a future quantum computer calculate the private key in under 10minutes?
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:16:11
There are tons of open FPGA implementations for bitcoin mining around. These can be more or less be translated 1:1 to ASIC designs. Problem solved.

But two of these three blocks have the same payout address for the generated coins - and this miner/pool seems to have an impressive hashrate. See my post.
