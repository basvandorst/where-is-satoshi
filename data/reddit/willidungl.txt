What the hell


Classic Satoshi... 
This guy is such a douchebag I hope he gets what he deserves for his actions. I'd still be interested to know if Matonis and Andresen received financial incentives to participate in his charade or if they actually fell for this obvious fraud.
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:35:56
It's hard to understand, they received $105 million venture capital and are still this incompetent.
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:17:46
I'm quite interested in what they told VCs, I mean what did they expect?
@_date: 2016-04-20 19:59:18
Thanks for the information Peter!
Gavin works for MIT, it will be interesting to see how many Classic and former XT supporters are behind this initiative.

Stop using Coinbase!
If you have your Bitcoins with them you don't actually own them
@_date: 2016-04-22 10:02:01
The investments managed by the fund are owned by the investors. They can be withdrawn etc . It is a different legal structure.
@_date: 2016-04-11 16:15:04
Well, Jon could immediately confirm/deny this without hassle 
@_date: 2016-04-20 18:54:37
Their CEO smears Bitcoin developers almost on a weekly basis. Why don't you care about that?

@_date: 2016-04-11 15:15:01
I know but the 1st is over and quite a few other publications have mentioned the increasing rumour of this upcoming reveal since then.
Additionally I see no reason why Jon would play part in an Alphaville april hoax especially over such an extended period of time

That's the r/Buttcoin way
@_date: 2016-04-10 15:26:51
There are continuous rumours of an upcoming reveal by Satoshi. Jon Matonis for instance has claimed to be under a strict non-disclosure agreement with a private group in this regard. To me this has the stinking odour of an elaborate scam, as for all we know about Satoshi, he would never choose to out himself, nor would he need to do it with such an elaborate effort.
So we have to ask ourselves how someone could profit from claiming they are Satoshi Nakamoto. As we have seen with Wright, he made quite a tremendous effort to place clues even a couple years back and he is also the most likely candidate for this 'reveal'.
My best guesses are:
* This 'Satoshi' is a sockpuppet placed by a group who wants control over Bitcoin. This could even be a simulated fall guy with an intentional unpleasant image, that would serve to undermine Bitcoin's credibility (Wright would work perfectly in this regard)
* A massive fraud to lure in investors who would want to acquire the alleged Bitcoin stash that goes with the name.
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:29:27
People complain about them basically everyday here. Try out alternatives like Kraken or Circle!
Additionally their CEO continuously displays disrespect towards Bitcoin developers, which in itself is appalling enough to discourage the use of Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-04-24 08:03:35
I believe the majority of bitcoins is held in russian and eastern european hands. Most of the very large thefts for instance have some connection to these places.
@_date: 2016-04-22 12:31:05
That's certainly possible, I am always eager to learn! :)
I see, do you assume a business that would simply hold Bitcoin until a certain price after which it liquidates and dissolves the company would be forced to obey rules set for funds?

Coinbase is pretty much a bank, exactly what Bitcoin was created to overcome.


@_date: 2016-04-07 08:55:14
Stay away from Coinbase and try alternatives like Kraken and or Circle.

It is good to see that more and more people are starting to speak out against Brian Armstrong.

They raised $106 million from VCs and will milk this easy cow as long as they can.
Of all the money they raised, how much have they contributed to Bitcoin development? They don't even offer a functional support, this is why users need to come to Reddit daily with their issues.

Yes I agree he has a VERY likeable appearance. I always think to myself that his looks could not be more perfect, he is exactly what I imagined Satoshi to look like! I just hope he can leave all this behind and find the peace that he desires.
Many journalists are beyond appalling.

Possible. But I doubt that Nick Szabo wouldn't know about this article written about him, considering the fact that he is very thoughtful about his online identity and reputation.
I like the mystery that surrounds this man. By now we know that many developers have met him. Then again there was L. Detweiler who already back in 1994(!) doubted Nick Szabos existence on the [cypherpunks mailing list](

That's what I assumed at first. But in the transcript it is claimed that they 'received the transfer'. I guess it could mean we received the wallet.dat or the key itself but it sounds more like an actual tx on the network is implied

Bitcoin is a public ledger.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:21:35
Yes bloody hard is a phrase. I would also not be surprised if Satoshi said: 'that steak looks bloody'. But Wright would be more inclined to say: 'I'm sitting on this bloody chair, because I am the bloody foremost IT security expert.'
Wright says things like 'the world will bloody know' and 'Always the assumption that SN must be a bloody yank' (written by him in an Amazon review), which is certainly a more primitive language and very different usage of the word.
Do you now understand what I mean?
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:06:42
haha good catch
@_date: 2015-06-03 13:48:08
So he lied? : 
Edit: No it's true, the theory regarding the word 'recently' was correct.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:59:49
Additionally, has there ever been a transaction as large as they claim (1,1 mil BTC) at the time of the establishing of the Tulip Trust Fund? Where would be the best place to search for that?

I think the 'stress test', even if it wasn't carried out in the noblest fashion, opened a lot of eyes regarding the low fincancial commitment that has to be undertaken to disrupt Bitcoin's day-to-day business.
Lets presume that the hardfork to 8MB happens and a two very political early adopters, with low financial interest are appalled. Then trust in this chain can be destroyed in a matter of days, especially since the biggest incentive to the blocksize increase is a financial gain through new users. If supporters now see their main interest demolished then all hell will break lose.
Don't forget, there are still people out there with +100k Bitcoins in their possession.
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:30:50
I know that they did one last week, but I am talking about the next stress test they proposed for today.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:36:19
So they mined 1.000.000 USD worth of Bitcoins in a little over a month. Pretty neat.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:13:34
By that I mean he was not constantly using words like 'bloody'  and kept his comments to technical issues.
Again, the biggest giveaway for me is not the differences of the personalities between Satoshi and Wright but Wright's character itself. He seems to be obsessed with himself and inclined to exaggerate to extremes.
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:09:58
I think he was. He rarely if ever touched the personal level and kept to the technical side when having discussions with users.
He was of course a bit sharp at some points, but if you consider the magnitude of his project and the time it consumes, I'd say he was in fact extremely polite.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:31:06

What about the 1Feex address?
It also contains never moved bitcoins since 2011 and is rank 3 on the [rich list](
It looks like a vanity address ('fee') for an exchange, but I could find no information about it
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:38:44
Yeah looks like their servers crashed again
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:20:26
Not everybody has to use everything to justify its existence.
Bitcoin in my eyes is an amazing tool for transfering funds across borders and for storing wealth that cannot be confiscated.
I say the position of buying Bitcoins and then hoping others will buy after you to increase their value is idiotic and detrimental to Bitcoin itself as we are seeing in this debate.
Edit: It is time to reflect upon Bitcoin's very nature and the things that actually make it what it is, especially decentralization.
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:05:27
**unconfirmed transactions:**
  
**node stats:**
@_date: 2015-06-29 10:44:47
On Bitcointalk they wrote, that they would change their setup to 32 Bitcoin servers sending 1 transaction every second for today's test.
Surprisingly nobody seems to talk about this, maybe it is simply not going to happen.
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:24:54
They spend 20BTC on a Stress Test but are too frugal for decent hardware
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:56:17
More users =/= centralization
Discouraging users to support the network by increasing requirements = centralization

@_date: 2015-12-06 21:16:15

It would mean that a significant fraction of the public engages in the use of the Bitcoin network. I agree, no regulation attempt could completely stop it at that point.
@_date: 2015-12-10 23:08:13
Ahm LOL, does anybody really use the most high profile spammer of the Bitcoin network for it's wallet services? 
Why would anyone use them?
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:40:17
Correct. I see, thanks!
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:19:16
In my opinion Bitcoin is not really suited to be used at retail level. 
It certainly is an amazing technology for moving larger funds around the globe in a way that traditional companies' services simply cannot compete. Once you are in Bitcoin there is virtually no regulatory framework that could interfere with and place limits on your personal choices regarding the movement of your own funds.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:16:21
Probably because of the Stress Test.
Mempool is now 20Mb. +16000 unconfirmed transactions
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:35:41


I don't think it does. Bitcoin (still) requires a relatively high amount of knowledge to really use it securely. Most people do not want to engage in the hassle of buying a seperate currency online to load on their phone to then pay in the restaurant where they could simply use the currency they already have and don't lose value to conversion fees.
This only makes sense for international travellers.
@_date: 2015-12-19 20:35:46
What! These ATM fees are ridiculous. Who in his right mind would pay that much?
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:36:10
Already fees above 25 BTC to be collected 
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:09:02
This debate is slowly reaching a boiling point
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:06:47
That's normal..
@_date: 2015-12-19 22:08:39
Chill you have received your bitcoins. Your wallet just needs to sync, which will take a few days. I can definitely understand how newcomers can become confused by Bitcoin.
(Just a tip:) You really should have chosen a light wallet, these do not need to sync the whole blockchain.
In the meantime, check your address, for instance on blockchain.info, to verify that it holds the bitcoins you sent, that will give you peace of mind
You could also use dumpprivkey to export your private key and import it in a light wallet that syncs in a matter of minutes and you would be good to go.
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:12:00
That's not really unusual. Let's see if they actually stand up to their claims:
*'By 13:00 GMT Monday June 29, the mempool of standard fee transactions will be 10mb By 24:00 GMT Monday June 29nd, the mempool of standard fee transactions will be 130mb By 13:00 GMT Tuesday June 30, the mempool of standard fee transactions will be 241mb'*
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:44:40
too epic to go to bed. damn this will be a long night
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:20:13
Bandwidth and storage.
You know what, the more I think about it, the more I understand that this debate is impossible to sufficiently answer currently. Bitcoin has to scale but doing so could risk its decentralization among others because the technical capacity seems to be far slower than Bitcoin's growth. Perhaps we should just let it play out.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:46:27
That's totally normal. For me it was G. Maxwell: 
*Gregoryyyy call on mee. Call on meeee Gregoryyy*
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:08:22
It is visible for me.
But just a few minutes ago they showed the combined fees of unconfirmed transactions as +50BTC... which apparently is also nonsense

Yes and depending on their position and their involvements it might make sense to utterly damage the perception of one chain.
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:04:43
I am not claiming that Satoshi never used the word 'bloody'
What I mean is that Wright's use of language is far more primitiv than Satoshi's. I have read about 5 or 6 sentences of Wright today containing the word 'bloody' for instance and this is the first time I have heard of this person. I know one example of Satoshi and I have been reading this mans work for years now.

Thanks for the reply!
So I would simply activate Tor (TorBrowser?) and then all wallet traffic is tunneled through TOR?
Also is it possible to figure out corresponding IP addresses of past transactions via the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-10-23 19:11:13
May I ask why exactly you oppose my stance on this subject?
Posting blind and mindless accusations is one thing, having a rational discussion and actually understanding the matter at hand another.
As I understand it:
The development is aimed at transferring value and the userbase of Bitcoin to a competing system controlled by a centralized corporation while the developers of said system are simultaneously the core developers of Bitcoin. Since both systems compete you can imagine which one they will support - my guess goes to the one they are financially incentivized to build.
Since I am using Bitcoin for it's decentralization I am skeptical of this group. You on the other hand seem content with having just a more advanced Paypal.
Edit: Moderated my tone a bit, thanks to comment below.

Also the way you try to introduce Circle's features through the casually staged conversations below is just ridiculous :D

Those are exchanges cold storage, so while it theoretically good for the wealth distribution, in essence the many owners of those bitcoins have given up direct control of their private keys

Could you please post an additional 6th numerical example to further illustrate your point. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:27:17
You seem to fail at the basic level of logic reasoning.
I give you a homework now: Spend the next 24h to think about the possible negative implications of the bitcoin userbase transferring to a chain that is controlled by a centralized corporation and whose developers are also the core-devs of bitcoin. Then come back and show the group what you came up with. I am sure you will be able to think of something.

They are not at all meaningless. Because the psychological component of the market is one of the most relevant factors, clever traders manipulate extactly this aspect
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:33:52
None of which I have said is wrong. I think your ego is the only one that profitted from your comment.
My hint was obviously towards the injection of external capital as well as company downsizing.
And no I base my knowledge on Austrian law.

No they are not. Bankruptcy protection puts a halt to law orders, liquidation procedures etc, and is filed if it is believed that the company can make a turnaround with restructuring measures and time

I didnt catch the decline to 30. But yeah this dump to 17 was insane and a great way to make some easy BTC
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:21:29

@_date: 2014-04-29 20:53:51
yeah dude, as if the shipping would not be more then 3 euros..
It's 3 euros for gods sake, ask your parents or your granny or sell lemonade on the street
@_date: 2014-09-30 22:18:30
Dude, it was absolutely intense.
It started off with increased government interest and around May they already started the proposed merged mining for bitcoin and the freshly introduced Federal Reserve Blockchain. Shortly after shit basically hit the fan and bitcoin shot to a height of around 25000 USD per BTC. After diplomatic interventions from East Asian interest groups the Federal Reserve Blockchain was irreversibly declared illegal by 85 countries to prevent a sudden, mysteriously linked, interest in red panda fur from bringing the species to extinction.
As for Dogecoin.. well at this point it is more or less recognised as confirmed that most developed countries have their hands at play to maintain control of the ever increasing Dogecoin mining plants in the Mediterranean region of Northern Africa. 
Apparently (according to an eye-witness story by coindesk) there has been no oil in the region since 1990, most if not all major conflicts and wars in fact seem to have revolved around a military cryptographic system code named 'Doga K'hoins'. After leaked documents made the rounds that apparently supported this version of dogecoins shocking past, it's value dropped to around -0,01 USD and known dogecoin holders were urged to come forward and pay their debt to the international community.
@_date: 2014-10-18 18:46:55
Oh THAT is sad :(
I'm sorry for the man. Really, that is a hazard I did not know about
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:12:03
This is my opinion as well
@_date: 2014-05-26 09:49:41
If this is really what happened, and I consider it to be factual, then the BTC price is not close to finish dropping. 
Who knows what is going on the remaining exchanges, could be far worse for all we know. That's the free market baby
@_date: 2014-06-12 11:11:13
OP has a fair point. Paypal integrating bitcoin would be akin to people capturing and taming wild horses so tourists can ride 'wild' horses...
It utterly defeats the purpose of bitcoin, which is to be a self-sustaining decentralized network that allows value transfers globally without a middle man.
Buying bitcoins to then use paypal would be retarded to say the least. Maybe interesting to people who like to run in circles.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:53:11
my calculations say it's in fact 91.32%
@_date: 2014-05-26 09:45:30
yes they 'added' the fiat, GOXfiat that is, which users were not able to withdraw because it didn't exist.
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:30:42
And do people need 'a fuck ton of wallets'? Really, 'all' the development is happening with bitcoin? If you are talking about bitshares, you obviously do not understand it. It is not necessary that merchants accept it, it's a financial ecosystem.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:53:54
Yes I agree that sounds reasonable
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:59:13
Not everybody has known that and you may have heard about the fact that many people tried to withdraw since 2013 but it was not possible.
If you invest a little more energy in contemplation and less in mindless swearing the quality of your conclusions would possibly be noteworthy.

And what everyone here should know and do by this time:
Do not leave coins on an exchange! Buy them, sell them but immediately withdraw afterwards.

How I became a bitshares non-believer in honest words: 
Take a look at all the empty promises of which none has been fulfilled, 
the ever changing of plans to draw even more money in 
and the highly dubious angelshare 'donations' (just trace the majority of a couple days over 3 transactions in either direction [incoming and outgoing] and you will see for yourself).
The only thing that will come out of this eventually will be an exchange for trading various altcoins that are based -again- on promises. Just slightly better than your average bitcointalk altcoin scam. The only positive posters are delusional investors who try to push their 'product'.
I feel honestly sorry for everybody who has invested.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:07:09
I am really wondering why people should really claim how many BTC they bought/mined. There is no way they (authorities) could ever find out

@_date: 2014-07-08 00:03:00
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:32:36
That is really dumb.
Now anybody can claim that funds from any address are stolen, fake evidence and prevent them from using bitstamp.
Since bitstamp is in no position to verify or disprove such claims, blacklisting coins upon suggestions is a new attack vector for malicious, anti-bitcoin parties.
Anyone controlling multiple email addresses could now contact bitstamp to please refrain from accepting bitcoins from various major addresses and suddenly bitstamp would find itself in a weird spot of either trusting stranger's suggestions or losing income.

Well as the deviation increases so does the incentive to trade.
If the price of 1 bitUSD gets higher than that for 1 USD the sell pressure on bitUSD will increase.
On the other hand if the price of 1 bitUSD decreases compared to USD more people will want to buy bitUSD.
It works sort of like a prediction market

But could you then not simply start with the lowest possible number (e.g. 0.0000000001, or so) and thereby ensure that you are below the limit? Why the guessing part?
@_date: 2014-05-26 09:53:13

It really is a useless number. Many people assume it implies that this amount of fiat money (7.6 billion as you state) has been invested in Bitcoin, which is simply not the case. This number is actually far far lower.
It also builds off the assumption that every bitcoin is worth the current market value, which is impossible because the demand is too low - i.e the high price is only established because a vast number of coins are retained from the market
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:51:15
That would interest me as well. Is anybody tracking them? Do we even know the respective addresses?

Well because it means, that MtGox is NOT liquid and the word bankruptcy alone is reason enough to believe that others will sell so you sell before they do if you can.

He does not talk in a way I would imagine somebody who would suddenly find himself in the center of the world's media about a topic he has no clue about.

I disagree. As soon as the majority of hashing power chooses the higher paying chain, the bitcoin clients will accept this as the valid chain since it is the strongest. This then is Bitcoin
The other chain will be a very weak and unsecure one that is only supported by enthusiasts.

Do not keep your funds on exchanges.

The way I understand it is that the problem lies in the fact the being core-dev for bitcoin and at the SAME TIME for another project that pays you money and tries to attract Bitcoin's userbase is something that is just not going to work in favour for Bitcoin. And in the end this will mean that everybody who uses this chain uses a chain controlled by a corporation and we are back to centralization.

Since we continue to get delighted by people proudly proclaiming their hodl activities and all the other self-help threads we are still far off from capitulation. I feel desperation around me but nothing stronger.
Capitulation will come when it is accepted as the general notion that Bitcoin's price is not going to rise anymore and that everything that could be done about it would prove a waste of time. It will be the time when there simply is no light in sight and no future event to hopefully cling onto for a price increase.

I tend to agree. While it is certainly attractive to spread risk by using multiple exchanges, a simple look at the daily volumes suggest that only a handful are actually used. The others have neglectable volume and I wonder how they even survive as a business.

@_date: 2015-01-05 12:06:27
RNG = random number generator. It probably refers to the random number that is generated as the bases for key generation. 
A Bitcoin address is created like this: random number -&gt; ECDSA private key -&gt; public key -&gt; SHA256(public key) -&gt; RIPEMD-160(SHA256(public key)) -&gt;... -&gt;Bitcoin address
A potential thief would have to break the various encryptions to get to the private key which he could then use to spend the bitcoins associated with this particular address.
So if the random number is in fact not as random as perceived, an attacker may be able to guess the random number and derive the private key for a given Bitcoin public key from it.
An analogy would be that you can have the strongest security doors on the market, but if a potential burglar knows important details about the shape of your key he may simply try a couple variations until one fits.

Is Coinsetter in such a bad shape?
What percentage of Bitcoin's whole trading volume have you originally set as the goal for Coinsetter? Even if Chinese volumes are fake (I tend to agree) they still need to survive as a business and therefore I assume they have enough volume to be profitable.
Is Coinsetter profitable or does it run on investor's money? I am seriously interested in these questions, because to me it seems the exchange market is far too crowded for the little volume that Bitcoin has.

Wrong. They are a guarantee of increased probability.

I think your observation could be correct. Could be the reason why the CEO of Coinbase is pushing so intensely for multiple forks.
I'd say at this point Coinbase could almost be considered an enemy of Bitcoin. They will milk the userbase as long as they can extract some funds then convince their investors of the virtues of private chains.
Don't forget, the CEO Brian Armstrong also supported the latest massive attack on Bitcoin via XT and Hearn.

Ehm the issue is not that his statement is in contradicion with that of the CEO, but rather that it supports the outrageous lie of them storing close to 10% of all mined bitcoins. 
And surprise surprise it now has been deleted like the other incongruencies I caught in their claims.

Promoting a sybil attack and continuous lies and complete disregard to the people who develop Bitcoin by the CEO of Coinbase, has led me to the conclusion that Coinbase is a company that should be avoided.
I don't know how well you are versed with the technical aspects of Bitcoin, but simply take a look at Brian Armstrong's twitter account. It is a terrible sight and his lack of knowledge and deeper understanding is astounding to say the least.

That is what they claim. Don't forget they also claimed to have stored 10% of all mined bitcoins and got caught in cover-up attempts when incongruencies were revealed.
Coinbase has less than 5% of daily BTC volume and less than 3% of daily ETH volume... I wouldn't be surprised if 70% of these 'users' were created by themselves.

No need to make assumptions.
Kraken, OKCoin, Bitstamp, Huobi, Bitfinex, Xapo... they all use multisig
So now it is your turn. Do you *assume* that Coinbase holds more BTC than all those combined?
And: While you claim I didn't 'catch anything' they deleted at least two posts after I revealed their dubious claims. What more do you need?
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:01:27
As I wrote, on the one hand you (Coinbase) claim that 97% of user funds are stored in multisig on the other hand you claim that you store 10% of all bitcoins. Considering that many other services use multisig and the total number of bitcoins in p2sh addresses is around 12%, something doesn't quite add up.
Kraken, OKCoin, Bitstamp, Huobi, Bitfinex, Xapo... they all use multisig afaik
So are you honestly trying to tell us that the funds of all other Bitcoin services and private people that use multisig combined only adds up to 2-3% while Coinbase's funds constitute 10% of all Bitcoins?? Oh the webs we weave... 
If repeating your claims is FUD then you should contemplate about this. Why not counter the 'FUD' and simply state the exact number of bitcoins Coinbase holds?
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:28:06
Just sell them on exchange with high liquidity. For 10s of thousands this is no problem.

Edit: Charlie Lee just confirmed they do actually claim to have held **10% of all mined bitcoins at that time.** HA!
[Link to comment](
Your best bet now is to claim that you define 'in circulation' very narrowly. Unfortunately in the same breath you will have to reveal that your Bitcoin holdings are not exactly substantial.
And it is still completely unbelievable that the funds of all other Bitcoin services and private people that use multisig combined only adds up to 2-3% while Coinbase's funds constitute 10% of all Bitcoins 'in circulation'.
Kraken, OKCoin, Bitstamp, Huobi, Bitfinex, Xapo... they all use multisig afaik

How exactly is uncovering lies that could potentially endanger other users 'shitting all over them'?
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:35:41


Also yes it does mean mined Bitcoins. They can claim and estimate what they want if it supports their lie. The only bitcoins known to be not in circulation are publicly known lost coins (not even remotely enough to justify their claims) and coins not yet mined.
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:36:56
True they claimed it was 97%. What is your point exactly?
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:16:25

I care about the community and everybody should have the right to know if exchanges lie to them.
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:00:17
97% are allegedly held in multisig. Coinbase made these allegations, not me. I have linked the post and suddenly it has been changed. But I have read it on other places as well.
@_date: 2016-06-09 17:21:38
And just recently they got caught in their own web of lies while shamelessly claiming they stored 10% of all mined bitcoins. Soon after their Director of Engineering deleted his comment again, but I took a screenshot( as I expected their coverup attempt.
Their ridiculously small trading volume makes this even harder to believe. I expect a couple VC may soon start questioning the validity of the claims regarding growth and userbase that Coinbase has presented them in order to receive $100 Million+ of venture capital.

It is about the word 'multisig' obviously.

Is it believable that the funds of all other Bitcoin services and private people that use multisig combined only adds up to 2-3% while Coinbase's funds constitute 10% of all Bitcoins 'in circulation'?
Also yes they'll probably seek refuge in the definition of 'in circulation' now, but in the same breath they will have to reveal that their holdings are not exactly substantial.
@_date: 2016-06-20 15:34:54

I write code (for a living actually), what is this ridiculous statement about?
Coinbase wants money and power, nothing else. They do not care about the ideology behind Bitcoin, as they have shown on many occasions. This is now the second take-over attempt they are supporting. How many more do people like you need to realise what they are doing?
Why are you even interested in Bitcoin? I am, because it offers people a chance to have sole control of their finances and to evade traditional regulatory power structures and to not need to rely on companies. What does Coinbase do? Well they represent exactly that which Bitcoin was created to avoid.

I really have enough of Gavin Andresen.

* Then he tried his first take-over coup via BitcoinXT, which failed.
* Now he tries his next move with Bitcoin Classic.
The only interesting bit is, how he continuously manages to be close to extremely dubious characters and projects, but always come out clean once it falls apart. He made Hearn the fall guy for XT and Toomin the fall guy for Classic.

[old Bitcoins](  --&gt; This address holds almost 80,000 Bitcoins and has never been touched since the deposit in early 2011
[very rich entity](  --&gt; This transaction links 9 addresses each holding 66,000+ BTC that most definitely belong to the same entity (lets hope not a single person) and the 10th address in the blockchain with the same characteristics is likely part of that.

Why are you still supporting this man, are you intentionally delusional? He just tried to sell everybody a fake Satoshi. He talked to the CIA, he now works for MIT who tries to introduce KYC into Bitcoin, he was involved with some of the biggest scammers Bitcoin ever saw in the Bitcoin foundation, he supported Mike Hearn who harmed the public perception of Bitcoin and the stability of its userbase like nobody else.
At what point will you start to question the integrity of this man? Would you still search for excuses and justifications if he gave the repository to a known scammer?

That guy is pretty interesting. 
He was/is in possession of [371.000 BTC]( that he bought from an employer very earlier on for $5k after they abandoned a project for I believe a Bitcoin prepaid card. 
He also somehow [defrauded people]( from an e-bike forum.

You can also simple create 'organic' transactions instead of single transaction chains, that does not make this more reasonable.

Still no strong proof. Just publicly sign a message with the private keys to the genesis block and all is done. This guy is just milking the Satoshi myth and many fools believe his deceptive tactics.

@_date: 2016-05-02 07:25:12
No he allegedly signed something with the private keys corresponding to block 9. But he may have fooled the economist and the fact that he didn't simply do it publicly and with the genesis block says everything you need to know about this story

He is a fraud that hopes to make money via claiming to be Satoshi. First he sold the rights to this news story, next he will sell his consultant work to Bitcoin business like Coinbase to further influence the block size debate.

@_date: 2016-05-03 14:54:18
Are you intentionally delusional? If Satoshi wanted to proof he is somebody, he would simply sign a message and publish it.
After the show this fraud put on, after the 'evidence' he provided was proven to be fake, after his lies regarding his titles and company, after his claims that he wants to be left alone while posting oversized photos of himself and doing an international press tour you still *believe*???

@_date: 2015-03-03 23:49:55
The problem is that transactions can be easily and cheaply created by any entity determined to make Bitcoin's user base appear larger than it actually is. Therefore transaction counts are also to be dismissed as a viable option for determining adoption.
There are many possible actors who would stand to profit (at least short term) from such an artificial inflation. For instance companies on the verge of a venture round, etc
@_date: 2016-05-05 09:37:43
Are you able to speak and think for yourself or is your ability limited to quoting?
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:16:49
That's not the issue. The issue is that they are actively distancing themselves from Bitcoin after their CEO has discredited and blamed Bitcoin developers for years. Many of them are people who volunteer and work in their spare time without any compensation to improve the protocol this guy's whole company is/was based on. Instead of offering funding from the +100M venture capital they received, he chose to attack and blame the people who actually maintain and improve Bitcoin.
Oh and don't forget Coinbase actively promoted XT and Classic, two failed attacks on Bitcoin that involved highly dubious tactics of mass manipulation.
@_date: 2016-05-05 09:29:57
This is rambling nonesense and not 'the truth'.
Can you not see how hard he is trying to twist the story away from the fact that Wright cannot provide an actual proof? Are you intentionally delusional?
@_date: 2015-03-02 15:02:57
I think names associated with hashrate are irrevelant, aren't they?
Simply because one entity could spread his hashing power among several pools and there would be no way for anybody to know. 
For all we know the majority of Bitcoin's hashing power could already be in the hands of a very small group of people
@_date: 2015-11-23 13:22:04
Yes I don't know why, does it load the full chain into memory?
Thanks for all the info, I think I'll look into building a little server locally. I wonder if all the other people who regularly use things like the parser all have such powerful machines at home.

No I wouldn't mind. You have to be particularly stupid to believe that Satoshi would want to out himself and if so why he wouldn't just publicly sign a message with the private key to the genesis block.
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:57:49

Were there any benefits offered for taking part in this procedure?
@_date: 2015-11-23 12:28:53
Yes only for myself. Thats what I fear, but because I also want to run the block parser I'll need a memory optimized server.
[I found this report]( where the guy claims it cost him $42 to run a node on EC2, which I already find a lot especially because I then would also need additional memory for the block parser

If Bitcoin requires people to not use Bitcoin (off-chain transactions and banks) to function then it is redundant and we could just stick to the wire transfers we already have.
Long-term Bitcoin can only be sustained if the user base grows significantly and I think the best chance of that happening would be another financial crisis coupled with dramatic govermental usurpation of private funds.

Satoshi is a smart man. He would simply sign a message with the private key to the genesis block: 'I am Craig Wright', publish it and no further discussion would be necessary. 
Sorry if you still believe anything that Gavin Andresen says publicly does not have an agenda.
@_date: 2015-03-27 10:58:40
I once stumbled upon a conspiracy theory somewhere on bitcointalk, I think. A person theorized that Bitcoin was constructed under the disguise of being a financial system, when it in fact served a completely different purpose. He portrayed Bitcoin as a scheme to let unknowing users participate in large scale crowdsourced cracking, or something alike.
I think it is an interesting thought, though probably easy disproven.
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:42:22
Well, I am sure they offered Gavin something in return for signing the NDA and working on this 'reveal'.
So perhaps they planned to profit by shorting, or maybe they simply payed him nicely for his assistance. Whatever they offered him, he seemed to be satisfied enough to risk his reputation, so it must have been quite substantial.
I am sure Jon Matonis wasn't there just for fun as well. It is always about money and power.

The issue for me is of course, the somewhat prohibitive costs.

@_date: 2015-03-27 10:46:33
Why don't you send a normal Bitcoin transaction?
Bitcoin is about sending and storing value without needing to trust a third party. Why would you buy Bitcoin, then send them to Changetip and then send them via Changetip to a person when you could simply send a Bitcoin transaction directly to that person. Makes absolutely no sense.

At this point Gavin Andresen should probably personally approach the Australian tax authorities and state that he has likely been manipulated by Craig Wright. Otherwise it may be assumed that he has been promised a share of those 54 million dollars
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:13:22
No he showed a document that was signed with the keys to block 9. There is no proof that he signed it, nor does it proof that he holds that keys. The fact that this is so strange and not precise gives way to the reasonable assumption that he is a fraud.
Otherwise, why not simply sign 'I am Craig Wright' with the keys from genesis and publish it? All discussion would be over.

@_date: 2015-02-20 09:15:44
Yes that is possible. A single private key should correspond to two addresses : compressed and uncompressed. Also there are multiple private keys that correspond to a given address (around 2^96 per address I think, please correct me if I'm wrong).
Anyone who has the private keys for an address can spend the associated bitcoins. The only thing prohibiting someone else from finding the private keys for an address with unspent transaction outputs is a very very very low probability.

There is no story we can hear out. They conducted some kind of fraud that should be clear by now. Perhaps they simply shorted, perhaps something more complex and profitable. We won't know, the show is over and all we are left with are vague and deceptive words.

I am also interested in this, it seems like the most efficient way to keep anonymity while sending a transaction. Could somebody give us a walkthrough?
@_date: 2016-05-05 09:05:25
What a rambling nonesense.
We now know that Ian Grigg and JVP are linked via Uyen T Nguyen to Craig Wright. It is a tight-knit circle that is spinning this fraudulent story with many many words in every direction to distract from the fact that Craig Wright cannot prove he is Satoshi because he is not Satoshi.

Brian Armstrong has never let an opportunity pass to reveal that he has not the slightest understanding of blockchains and cryptocurrency. Let's see what he tweets next. One thing is guaranteed: It will be nonsense.

The most likely reason: money.
Gavin is not dumb. Believing even for one moment that he fell for Craig's primitve charade - that would be dumb.
Have you ready the story about the company that bought Craig Wright's debts and rights to his patents? They planned to celebrate him publicly as Satoshi, to later profit from selling 'Satoshi Nakamoto's patents, which they estimated should be worth a cool billion $. It is not unlikely that they offered Gavin and Matonis a substantial sum to participate in this annoying deception.

Wow how can one fabricate such a baseless accusation in one comment?
Disprove his/her points with the facts that you possess implied knowledge of instead of using blind criticism.

Is Circle an option for Canadians?

Impossible. I, for instance, have probably created a couple hundred BTC addresses so far, because I use a different one each time.

I believe a canadian company bought his debts and patents and wanted to profit from selling patents of 'Satoshi Nakomoto' which they estimated should be worth north of a billion dollars.
If I remember correctly... only read that article once a couple weeks ago

Of course it matters. Your whole perception of this case is based on the assumption that Ian Grigg is telling the truth and has no hidden agenda. And that is extremely naive. Think for yourself!
Evidence to the contrary: He is closely linked to Wright. He is a supposed expert cryptographer and does not question the useless/fake cryptographic evidence Wright provided? He puts a surprisingly large effort into twisting the narrative with many many words away from these points.

You will get a code from localbitcoins. When the other person tells you the code (and it's the same code you got) then you know the funds have been sent and you can give them your cash.

DDOS, SEC complaints, warnings for new users, hacks, attacks, boycott movements. Goodbye Fraudbase, I can't say I feel sorry.
A little side note: 
I busted them a while ago publicly lying about storing 10% of all Bitcoin in existence (LOL). Which is so obviously a lie that one really has to wonder...
Then they sneakily tried to hide their lie
Charlie Lee later came out of the bush to confirm that they in fact claim 10% of all bitcoins *in existence* but later deleted his comment, because the lie was too obvious. But since I understood their lying nature by then, I was fast enough to take a screenshot:
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:20:49
They lie. They have also publicly lied about their holdings and once I outed them, they came forward but later deleted their comments

Gavin Andresen has lost all respect by now.  From another comment:
Gavin co-founds the Bitcoin Foundation with Karpeles


He doesn't ask questions when the MMMGlobal Ponzi scheme is added as a Bitcoin Foundation Member


He publicly vouches for Peter Vessenes as Chairman of the Foundation, who is accused of taking 20 grand, and has various other court cases pending, accused of taking 5 million from MTGox


He includes Charlie Shrem as a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation, who was later found to be coordinating with a darknet drug money launderer, with full knowledge


He attaches himself to the Bitcoin Unlimited project, and promotes Peter R's work, who is accused of being a plagiarist on various occasions


He promotes the MyBitcoin service as where users of Bitcoin of the future will store their Bitcoins safely, the service later disappears with people's Bitcoins


He promotes the work of Mike Hearn, who later turns on Bitcoin and calls it "failed" and then does a press tour and blog posts slamming Bitcoin


You have to be particularly willing to ignore evidence to still support this man.

I remember reading a while ago that currently for bitcoin mining to be profitable you need to invest + $10 million. But mind you I can't remember whether that was a credible source either.
You could calculate it yourself with these factors: cost of electricity, cost of miners, electricity usage of miners, bitcoin difficulty, hash rate of your miners, bitcoin price
Edit: [Here is a link to a mining calculator](

The Ethereum hardfork wasn't properly prepared, so now many transactions are relayed on both chains. Meaning if people withdraw ETH from exchanges that don't properly split the balance than they'll likely also withdraw ETC.
BTCE, Coinbase and others were and maybe still are affected. Because they are being depleted of their ETC holdings it could turn very nasty once all users who had ETH pre-fork on these exchanges rightfully start to demand their ETC.
@_date: 2016-07-30 20:20:14
Because it belongs to users, not them
@_date: 2016-07-04 19:58:58
Failbase strikes again.
Sorry about your experience. I really don't understand why they don't employ sufficient support staff, considering they received more than 100 million USD in venture capital.
@_date: 2016-07-27 01:22:43
Wow major fail by Coinbase.
This means that ETC was sent whenever ETH was sent from Coinbase. So some people may have lost their ETC although actually Coinbase never gave it to them. What will Coinbase do once users rightfully start demanding their ETC?
@_date: 2016-07-30 21:00:52
Do these chains still run and are the nonexistent tokens worth anything? No.
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:09:02
They have far less than 5% daily trading volume of both BTC and ETH, I can't see how they are even relevant.
Maybe poloniex should hold this growthchat, then we could all actually learn something.

What's going on at Coinbase? 
Each day at least 5 users post here because they have serious issues with the site or funding and cannot get help from Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-07-12 19:08:03
Arg something is not right. The site constantly looks weird and I have to refresh it and also prompts cloudflare issues.
I have tried multiple times to withdraw now, but it failed each time. At the same time my Bitcoin balance has been slightly reduced (from the fee I guess)
@_date: 2015-02-20 10:03:19
Yes I should add 'theoretically' possible
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:06:57
True, they must burn through their venture capital really fast given how low their trading volume is. 
Quite funny that a random altcoin exchange like poloniex is far more profitable than a company that has raised more than 100 million USD. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 04:16:41

Not many people do, they have extremely low volumes.

It is dependent on the block and the exact time when that block will be found can only be estimated.

Sure, just a regular guy who defrauded the Australien tax authorities for 54 million dollars, then set on a world tour of fraud and deception, claiming the possession of a supercomputer that doesn't exist, claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, posting fake proof left and right. Just a regular guy.
If you still call this a conspiracy, then you need to start asking yourself at what point you will be able to accept the true nature of this situation.

Wouldn't surprise me. 
They openly lie about holding 10% of all bitcoins, which is utterly unbelievable. I feel sorry for the investors that fell for that crap. 
Now they removed 'Bitcoin' from their Twitter bio (strange move if you hold 10% of all BTC) and are trying their luck with Ethereum. Just wait until Brian Mindweak (CEO) starts promoting Ethereum XT

No they did not split properly and they did and perhaps still do suffer from replay attacks. Users were still draining them of ETC yesterday
