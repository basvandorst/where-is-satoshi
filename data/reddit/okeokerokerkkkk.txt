Because there's a mistake in thinking that increased adoption rate results in higher prices. 
It's pretty naive to think that it does. Yet, it's the gamble that most people here seem to count on.

If you believe in Bitcoin, invest in Bitcoin-related businesses. 
Don't just buy Bitcoin, sit on them, and hope for their value to go up. That's naive.
Too many people here are simply gambling on the flawed idea of "bitcoin gets more popular -&gt; value of bitcoin increases". It's not that simple.

has it ever happened to you that you thought "it's very simple", but then it turned out to be not so simple after all?

I agree that BTC is unlike the dollar. BTC is not a fiat currency, it resembles a gold standard-type currency.
It's very easy to establish that one thing is UNLIKE another thing. All you need is one difference.
But my point remains. To simply think "increased interest equals increased value" is just too simplistic. Many many factors determine the value of a certain currency, even the value of new currencies such as BTC/.

Does good news about the dollar increase its value? Nope. Why don't you read up about how currencies actually work.
'Good news' (whatever that may mean) about a currency does not increase the price of that currency. Nor does the adoption rate of a currency increases the price of that currency. The two aren't even closely related. Money is different from stocks or holdings you know?
