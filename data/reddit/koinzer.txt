No, you just don't have good memory.
But luckily we have the forum, at least until theymos&amp;al will begin to modify old posts to rewrite history (that's why I saved the pages):
In particular, his vision was quite clear (and obvious):


@_date: 2016-04-15 04:48:58
Because a bigger block means more people will be able to afford on-chain transactions.
If Bitcoin can still succeed with a tiny block like the actual, it will push the users to only transact into the LN (if it will ever work), and lock their funds there forever.
Since LN dynamics favors big hubs run by big organizations, this will centralize the payment system in the hands of a few, big "banks".
On the other hand raising the maximum block size will force bitcoin nodes to update their old code to ensure we all are on the same page, and it will allow more business to put Bitcoin in their roadmap.
The bitcoin quotation is dragging because no business wants to invest in a technology with an artificial limit on the capability to process transactions.
@_date: 2016-04-23 09:14:35


No, because There’s No Political Freedom Without Economic Freedom
@_date: 2016-04-16 16:35:21
The limit put in place by Satoshi was arbirtrarily small and *temporary* , just because until then bitcoin was a toy and a spam attack would cost nothing.
He declared that, and also that he envisaged to lift the limit, eventually.
@_date: 2016-04-15 19:10:19
I don't think you can decide what Bitcoin is.
For that same reason nobody should impose _artificial_ limit on its processing capacity.
Time will tell.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:59:39
Instead of bcash, you should have tried Bitcoin Cash: insanely low fees!
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:07:49
Yes, you can, at least until technology continues to evolve like it did in the last 50 years.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:51:42


I think this is the perfect (counter)example for who says that "miners are in control", "they are the enemy" and such other wrong claims.
They have a part of the power, but they won't use it to go against users because that would harm Bitcoin, and hence their (enormous) investment: nodoby has more to lose in Bitcoin than the miners.
So, it's both things at the same time, and other initiatives like the folkloristic UASF would the same effect: zero.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:10:02
We should adopt the proposal of Luke Jr and shrink the block to 300Kb: this would raise fees even more and celebrate even more for the added security!
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:06:53


No, it's not: only miners produce new blocks, if the users do not agree with the rules their chain stops, that's it.

Like all BS bullshitter you fail to understand what is the message and you drag the discussion to some other stupid things.
I repeat: I'm talking about number of users, and you reply about coffee, probably you are simply too dumb to understand.
I'll elaborate for the benefit of other, more intelligent people: 300K tx per day limits the access of the blockchain to 300.000 users once a day (and a LN access requires two of them), otherwise 9 millions of people can make ONE transaction per month.
Facebook has 1.5 billions users.
People is what gives bitcoin value.
@_date: 2016-03-16 19:33:33
That site is not very useful: it hides the classic user agent and writes a white label instead, why?
@_date: 2016-03-03 18:36:57


A defined block size limits the maximum number of transactions per period (for example, per day), and hence maximum number of users for the same period.
So, yes, a small block size would limit adoption since it effectively caps the maximum number of users.
Since software (bitcoind), hardware (number of cpu cores and speed) and internet speed is much, much higher than 6 years ago, the limit can be raised.
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:13:57
Yes, the problem exists for billions of unbanked people which have to access to sofisticated financial networks.
Also, cutting the middleman helps disperse the power from the institutions to the people, that is a good thing and usually brings down quite dramatically the cost of the services.
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:08:55
If people would not value Bitcoin, his value now would be zero, simple as that.
I see you skipped the part about the number of users, let me guess why...

Source? Do we have to trust you on this one?
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:25:07
tech stagnating?
LOL. Since 2010 we have:
* rewritten code 10x faster, and multicore
* bandwidth at least 10x
* typical ram size 4x and 2x faster
* number of cores 4x
* cpus (each core) at least 2x faster
* hard disk seek time 1000x faster thanks to SSD (and access time is really important in bitcoin)
and probably a lot more I'm forgetting
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:59:28
Bitcoins will be on the only surviving chain
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:30:46
Theymos is spot on.
Of course that is why the block size MUST grow, otherwise there is a cap on the total number of users that can pay their "subscription" to the miners.
Let's fork Bitcoin, augment the block size, and create the LN for the whole world.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:00:32
Then, better to put them on the exchange before the fork, because after, the old chain will be unusable: you will be unable to move your coins, and hence to sell them.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:45:35
I'm running seveveral full nodes on SSD since ages. No problem whatsoever, ever.
The problem you indicate is almost gone on modern SSDs, and if still manifest them you just have to upgrade your disks every 2/3 years.
The cost is really negligible today, and lowering, as always.
@_date: 2017-03-02 10:08:33
just a note: if the hard fork happens with a supermajority, it's not an altcoin, it's Bitcoin as usual :-)
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:19:29
No: Bitcoin has very different retargeting policy and a chain with a small minority of hashing would find a small number of blocks for a lot of time (months).
So, if BU forks the network for example with 80% hashing behind, the old chain will surely die if they don't do an hard fork changing the difficulty or the mining parameters.
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:04:27
No hope, they won't disclose their "master plan" with all that AXA funding.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:47:42
LN requires a lot of transactions to open and close channels.
Also, the LN is not yet there and must be created. If txs are expensive there is no incentive to lock his found to run a node, even for simple testing.
We need to create the LN *before* the cost of the transaction goes too high or the LN network will never start.
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:27:02


Yes of course. But a "block size limit" does not mean "the same small block limit put in place 7 years ago when the tech was 1000 times slower. The block size limit must adjust together with the evolution of the technology (hardware, bandwidth, code, etc)


Of course not: this is being said only by Core supporters because they are unable to distinguish between a monetary function and a technological limit.
I, together with all the people advocating bigger blocks, are not.
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:16:21
Yes, power to the users!
And without broad consensus changing it is useless.
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:22:32
Yes, and I agree with them because the other (now official) chain was created to handle a bailout.
BU does not change Bitcoin rules like the DAO fork, it merely lift an artificial processing limit put in place in the early days when the both the code and the network was very young and fragile.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:26:24
It's not hidden: it's LN, and LN it's great for Bitcoin because it will renderer all altcoins useless as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:20:14
Only if BU forks with a supermajority (I would advise at least 80% of hashing rate)
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:03:17
So, what all of blockstream employees do?
@_date: 2016-06-14 07:20:06
I've checked the details and it's far from different: compact blocks are a quite similar ideas, with some pros and cons relatively to xthin.
In my opinion they are very similar and no matter which one will be used, the outcome for bitcoin will be very good.
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:23:25
And how can you prove that the server you are connecting to has these characteristics?
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:50:39
No they don't, if the miners use BU
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:23:23
You are right, instead of simply change a constant, much better to change the heart of the transaction processing with a completely new system that takes months (if not years) to review.
That would a better choice, right?
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:17:46
That's part of Core strategy: they want to boicott S2X so the more people go to BCH, the better in their eyes.

And, guess what? Liquid would be mostly irrelevant if the Bitcoin network would not so congested.
Also, with a functional LN, liquid becomes irrilevant: not so good for a long term plan for BS investors...
@_date: 2016-12-08 09:32:29
While I appreciate all the work done so far, I would correct this one:


Satoshi vision was to have no block size limit in order to scale number of processed tx with the evolution of technology, as it should be obvious.
@_date: 2016-11-20 08:51:57
If only Core would be open to a compromise, this rift in the community would not have been opened.
Sadly, they are not.
@_date: 2016-12-07 14:33:24
segwit solves the signature problem for new txs, not for old ones, so it's not safer at all.
@_date: 2016-11-20 18:00:30
And it seems like a compromise is needed to evolve bitcoin:
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:38:55


Of course it is, if you don't want it to be for us you have the old world: the banks and fiat money is waiting for you. You can be assured they do not work for the users.


I bet I'm here in Bitcoin since way more time than you. Always happy to learn, and very happy to always have predicted how things would happen, until now.


Yes it was, but since I'm equally invested in BTC I really don't care: I simply care that one of the two versions of Bitcoin wins on all other altcoins.

@_date: 2017-11-11 07:25:08


Right! And those are not economic policies.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:21:22


You can have both of them: if you are not born today you should know that technology evolves, and the cost to process 1MB 5 years ago is not the same of today. And it will be less and less in the future. Spoiler: that's normal and it will happen for a long time.


Augmenting the block size a bit does not change that, for the aforementioned reasons.
Also, with the hash power moving from BTC to BCH there is the risk that the legacy chain will be stuck forever: maybe you meant that with "immutable ledger"? :-D


Every kind of bad behavior: from name calling to character assassination, censorship and so on. You can check r/btc to take a look a the reality.


It's many years that business owners desperately ask for a signal from Core that they hear their requests. The reply was "f*ck off".


Wrong: while everybody knows that we can't scale ad infinitum, a LOT of people asks for a small increase, technologically more than feasable.


It can remain strong only if its value remains high and the miners keep mining it.


We'll see for sure, I see Bitcoin Cash (not bcash) as an insurance for Bitcoin, in the case their developers continue to behave like religious fanatics.
I don't like fanatics, do you?
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:35:13
Maybe I do, who knows? :-)
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:44:30
I seem to remember that there was code to drop certain type of transactions, is it there yet?

@_date: 2019-04-05 18:23:49
Every bitcoin cash proponent was like you, initially. Until they realized the core cult was acting religiously.
And, btw, having a bigger block that you leave empty make no harm to your blockchain, exactly like in Bitcoin we had the 1MB limit in place for years even if blocks were almost empty.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:01:12
I would call that a blacklist.
Wait... you called it the same way, I wonder why? :-)
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:49:05
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:57:05
So the source of assertion "largest private mining operation spreads across multiple pools to hide it" is "try it for yourself"?
I would say that's clear evidence!
@_date: 2019-04-17 13:45:52
I don't want to waste money on CSW stuff, thanks anyway for your detailed response, I'll take your word for it :-)
@_date: 2019-04-17 14:01:03
I agree with you that forking every 6 months it's not a good strategy, and I would gladly get rid of that.
Anyway, I found even more troubling how the block size debate was handled, and the modification to bitcoin with the stupid and useless segwit.
It added way more code of any modification made by the BCH team, and made BTC not better, still castrated by a too small block.
@_date: 2017-04-04 09:47:06
So you just have to keep block size limited to what a mainstream PC is able to handle without problems.
And that means blocks a lot bigger than 1MB.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:04:30
I support Luke-JR idea to lower the block size limit to 300Kb. This will:
* force maximum utilization of LN
* drive out spam transactions
* force most service to optimize their service as much as possible
* enable maximum decentralization, since everybody will be able to run a node
Plus, it's just a soft fork, very easy to implement.
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:41:51
Adam's proposal seems to miss the point on why segwit has not yet activated.
The majority of stakeholders - devs, miners as well as users - want both soft-fork SegWit and a hard-fork TX block size increase, but favor one over the other and want to perform their favorite fork first out of fear that activating the other prevents their choice from being activated at a later point.
Segwit2Mb is a proposal to solve this stalemate by providing a path to activating both.
While segwit is not a compromise (it gives nothing to who asks for bigger blocks), this is a *real* compromise, i.e. a proposal that gives something to both camps: the one wanting segwit and the one wanting bigger blocks (and not only special handling of space discount for some txs).
Since to activate segwit2mb we need 95% miner consensus there is really no problem in proposing it: at worst it won't activate, but it has a real chance to be a practical way to end the stalemate and go forward together.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:56:53
Speaking about asicboost is nice to know that an hard fork raising the blocksize and implementing segwit without hacks could also solve solve the covert optimization.
I hope Core can push this, so that miners will have no more excuses to avoid segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:53:14

if fees rise to $10, every channel with $10 or less become unusable, or you need to trust the node you are connected to to now get your funds.
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:51:27
Most last century home connections with shitty connections do not need a node on his pc: most of users can happily use hosted wallets while controlling the keys.
Power users, payment processors and all the others needing a node without a normal ADSL/fibre can rent a very lowend vps for a few bucks/month.
For example right now, modem users with old modem are unable to run a node, but we don't care: they can use Bitcoin in many other ways.
@_date: 2017-04-04 10:03:42


It's funny, back at the time of bitcoin classic, since there were many classic nodes you said that node numbers does not count because they can be faked and it's the hash rate that counts.
Now, it's the opposite, as for any narrative change lead by Core supporters.

@_date: 2017-09-11 13:28:22
Only initially, otherwise it would be really limiting for Bitcoin (the block size is not big enough for a lot of users).
And there is no implicit limit on the amount of bitcoin locked into a channel: you can put as much as you want.

Wouldn't this be the point of the LN?
All the exchanges would be big hubs exchanging high speed txs between them without paying a fee to BS for their services.
Also, it would be permissionless and hence better in *every* aspect.

Bitcoin has reached its maximum growth because of the block size issue.
New users (and there are a lot of them) are all going to altcoins.
It seems like this obvious and simple thing is not understood by the developers that are blocking the block size increase since years.
Most of altcoins would be irrelevant by now if Bitcoin had bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:37:45
I see no threats, only miners unsatisfied with current proposal, hence keeping the good, tested rules.
Segwit is good as concept but an ugly hack as implemented, and it could, and should be implemented in the right way, with an hard fork.
Most miners are in favour of this, correct and safer, way to upgrade the protocol.
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:14:18

And that's why so many new users are flocking toward various shitcoins,
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:15:00
Well, you have a point there.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:35:31
I would say in this case more than ever.
If you want to fork off bitcoin change the PoW, for your protection.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:46:32
Safety is where miners are
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:18:25
One would have 10$ transaction fees, the other 0.01$.
Go figure which would win the market :-D
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:00:50
Let's do it and go to the moon and beyond!
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:44:23
Big scale is attained by means of many ameliorations, and a bigger block is a key component for that.
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:27:16
Because they are ready to do a hard fork with a minority of hash rate to avoid an hard fork with the majority behind it.
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:41:10
Is there any plan from Core plan regarding integrate this tech into the reference client?
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:23:51
And all that to avoid changing a constant in the source code
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:14:16
Intesa San Paolo is an italian bank
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:30:29
I'm not speaking about BCC, but Core.
They won't honour S2X and won't fork to 2MB, thus creating two chains.
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:19:41
And that's only for 10 million users, such a small number of users can be served on chain without any problem (eth network already does it now).
I thought that the plan for a L2 was to serve 1 billion users?
Also, another totally unrealistic assumption is that each user would open 14 channel, that would need one person to divide its funds by 14 and keep them locked for an year.
I can't even begin to explain how unrealistic is that.
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:39:22


Jeff is leading the effort to implement Segwit2X so you can put your conspiracy theories to rest.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:13:24


That's an interesting catch: if you would not block onchain scaling we would already have it deployed.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:58:02


Of course, since block increase by segwit is marginal, only when the whole ecosystem has upgraded to use the less secure segwit transactions, and only once.
Also, block increase is a side effects due to the over complicated weight formula for block size.
But more to the point: what were the objections for a _normal_ increase of the block size?
Maybe you remember that every technical argument brought by (core) devs has been demonstrated bullshit by facts.
So, again, what is the narrative nowadays for not raising the block size? I ask because it continues to change with time since it holds no water.
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:52:37


Maybe the problem is that segwit is this overcomplicated shit because of the unnecessary need to do it as a softfork.
A much cleaner and technical sound design could be made and it would be already accepted and deployed by the network by now, but your goal is to add as much as technical debt to Bitcoin code with the clear intent to limit the number of new developers.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:09:21
I really don't care about Visa and I can't understand why bother with it.
Hardware, software, internet speed and everything in tech is much, much evolved since 2010 so we can raise the block size and serve more users, that's all.
It's quite simple even if you try to make it complex speaking about Visa and other unrelated things.
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:43:19
All the miners will be forced to run non-core binaries to implement segwit2x if core does not merge it, and so will do the users that still want to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:38:37
A limited block size will be the end for BTC, sadly.
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:36:43


You live in a vacuum or in a echo chamber: every Bitcoin user I know (not working with core) wants bigger blocks. And I routinely attend meetups over a very vast area.


I know: everybody would welcome *both* a block size increase and segwit, except for fanatical core/BS devs. So you should tell that to them.


The devs more equal than others that can decide what is the policy of the moment, and that mandates it to all the other (core) devs. If someone does not fall in line as the Big Dev demands, he gets expelled and ridiculed so that the remaining devs can learn to behave.
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:30:33


All those who make decisions for the others.
The others are free to adapt to what the masters say or be thrown away from the devs, their character assassinated and emarginated.


I fail to see how millions of potential bitcoin users for you are "2 big companies", but maybe you was referring to devs that pushes changes only for what BS requires?.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:40:20


You must be new here. A block size increase was available months/years before, ready and coded by Gavin.
You know, the man that helped Bitcoin grow to today's levels after Satoshi left.


They, together with most of users, simply requested to _also_ raise the block size instead of leaving it to C64 era.
They did not listen, because they don't care if bitcoin succeeds or not.
We do.
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:27:47
I would not open a channel: it's really expensive and I can't use it for anything because it's not useful right now.
You see, the high cost to open a channel prevent the LN networking to grow and be useful.
The Bitcoin network grew when it was not expensive for a new user to join.
I stop there because I know that no amount of economic good sense is useful for people that has a religious approach to technical matters.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:10:50


I would say that there is much, much more community support for an block size increase than segwit.
Still, they don't care because they think they can decide what users and (other) devs want.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:34:17
No, they don't, the "contract" was no legally binding.
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:23:08
I hope they pay you enough for all those lies: everything you said is exactly the opposite of the truth.


LOL, this one is really too nice :)
gmax and friends' salary is hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, you have a strange concept of "receive nothing".
Also, they're paid in dollars, not bitcoins, and they really don't give a fuck if Bitcoin fails, they're rich anyway and they can move "developing" the next coin.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:37:10
I blame Core because they stalled bitcoin adoption and growth.
Segwit does nothing to scale on chain apart from a sideeffect that could stuff maybe 70% more of transactions in some years (i.e.: after the whole ecosystem has upgraded).
There is no technical reason to avoid a (limited) block size increase, so I rightly blame the people that are preventing new users to use bitcoin and directing them toward altcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:56:15
segwit is a soft fork, but UASF is not.
UASF is a contentious hard fork done without miner support: the worst of both worlds.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:37:42
0, because no economic activity is on the LN
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:14:49
Not everyone: only who tries to profit with offchain transaction alternatives.
Every user is happy to pay less fees to transact in Bitcoin, and we should raise the block size as technically possible, not keeping it castraded for political issues.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:01:18
Character assassination is a fact, do I need to remind you the holy wars against Gavin et al?
Bitmain is not the only miner company, everybody can use their chips, and anybody can start a new one.
While no one can become a core developer if his idea is to raise the block size because this goes against BS roadmap.
Do you get the difference?
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:19:44
I'm talking about the increase in block size that you were inclined to raise at the HK agreement but that you recalled after greg called you a dipshit.
Anyway, it's even too simple to understand the consequences of your actions:
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:35:33
Yes, both on chain and offchain scaling is good (and needed).
As for miners blocking network upgrades, please be realistic: miners at the HK meeting all agreed to hf to 2MB *and* segwit and we would have both if some folks at BS decided to keep the 1MB cap forever.
So, please accept that all the fault for this is totally and completely in the hands of core developers (BS mainly).
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:37:00
Yes, we would need a (much) bigger block because with fees up to 5$ and beyond, nobody would open a channel to use the LN.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:39:02
Bitcoin has always worked perfectly well before the blocks were full.
Actually, it worked way better when transaction costs was 10 times lower and confirmation times were predictable.
