The agent de-dupes client-side. It won't upload any parts of the file that are already in the cloud. In addition, we use basic gzip compression.

Dwolla makes you wait 30 days after the 1st deposit to send any money to any Bitcoin exchange. No one will accept PayPal or credit cards due to chargeback risks. Maybe someone local to you will sell Bitcoin for cash.

You can run CopyConsole without running the GUI, it's included in the download. The linux version has a readme, and the flags are basically the same on Mac and Windows. We're working on getting better online docs for it.

We have our own syncing agent. All data is transfered as HTTPS and is highly encrypted on our end. We use our own de-duping algorithm, not Rsync.

You're welcome. Just be careful not to get scammed.

Yea, I'd say deal in person, or go with something like bitinstant where you can wire money via redphone by paying cash at many convenience stores. However, I think I saw that they charge 4-5% right off the bat, so it's an immediate loss.

We have no file size limit, but you need our software to reliably upload files over 1GB due to common browser restrictions. You get 5GB for free, 10GB if you sign up with someone's referral link, and an extra 5GB for anyone you refer (no cap as of now, we have some people who have earned 1000GB with their blogs, YT channels, etc).

Yes we do. There is a file revisions button on the details view of every file.

Awesome. No problem!
