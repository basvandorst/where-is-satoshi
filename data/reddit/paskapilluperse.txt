Next decade, sure.
Next week, no.

That's the true beauty of bitcoin. Government can't dictate how to use your coins and the central banks can't just issue more coins out of thin air.

Comments here make me a bit pessimistic about the future. I'm here because I believe in cryptos and want to see them succeed and give people back the freedom from the central banks. Crypto currencies have been the wet dream of cyberphunks since 90's and now it feels like the time has come.

I live in EU and my bank transfers have always appeared the next day on CB pro ready for purchasing. Sometimes even same day.
I've never had any issues with Coinbase (or cb pro / gdax), but I've heard horror stories about their customer support.

And I like to think I'm a living proof that you can live solely on bitcoin savings ! :D

Maybe plenty of people driven by a wish to get rich and thus come here will learn here why the modern central banking is bad and why cryptos are the answer.

"I think BTC is valued too high"
Bitcoin price 18th of October 2017: 5500 $
Bitcoin skyrocketed to 20 000 $ 2 months after the post.
Now Bitcoin price is 7200 $.
Other than that good comment, but you were just 2 months too early.

Majority of people dont know how to securely hodl keys. Guides should be taught aswell.

I'm quite sure it was just an unintended result of the block halving (50... + 25... + 12.5... + 6.125 ... = 100) and the time set between the block halvings (4 years aka 210 000 blocks).

I had to live solely on my bitcoin savings for the whole of 2018, ended up spending and selling plenty of coins. Now it's time to earn the spent and sold coins back.

Despite I have a respect for Ulbricht for what he's done, I'm not sure if I agree with his reasoning over here. I'm really not a fan of Elliot waves and he seems to base his estimation solely on them. I'd had wished to see some other reasonings as well.
Thus, I do not believe in 100k in 2020 or even 2021. 2022 or after, sure.

According to WHOIS records ( [ ), seems to be a bunch of Nigerians running it. "Alex Livingston, No 72 Abba Johnson off Adeniyi jones Lagos, 100001, ng", wouldn't wonder if that's the scammer's real address. The same IP seems to have hosted a plenty of other crypto-related scams. Please, feel free to contact the host which seems to be [ .

So it was never btc's fault that he got scammed.
If one were to invest USD's to a scam, it wouldn't be USD's fault.
I expect people to be rational about investing in Bitcoin, and extra-rational when investing in any other crypto-related than Bitcoin. Always investigate, study and research where you're putting your money on. And the thumb rule: if something sounds too good to be right, it's most often a scam.

Sorry, it wasn't my intention. I phrased my comment badly. What I meant is that now that the tide in my life has turned, I'm trying to buy back all the coins I had to spend on living. And that the tide will always turn, no matter how bad it seems.

People should remember that bitcoin is for usage and not only for hodling to get rich fast. The purpouse is to be a currency and not only a store of value. I have myself used, gifted and spent a total of 30 bitcoins in my 6½ years in bitcoin, and I don't feel the slightest bit of bad or sad. I'd like to think that my usage has been helping bitcoin/cryptos to validate its position as currency.
@_date: 2019-12-04 09:33:53
I'd expand the time span to 2026 and wider the term to cryptos in general, and then yes.

I am sorry but getting scammed has nothing to do with BTC. You're not the first one, and you're not the last one to get scammed. I know a plenty of people who've been scammed in a variety of ways and they must all share the thoughts with you. 
Some examples: My friend's single-mother fell for a Facebook love affair scam and ended up wasting all her savings and she became homeless and indebted for the rest of her life. One other family member "invested" in Onecoin in 2015/2016. I tried hard to make some sense to his mind but he was so blinded by the ever-increasing Onecoin price that he ended up preaching onecoin to others and put more money on it. He lost his savings as well. He's been completely shut about it afterwards so I won't bring it up, realizing having been scammed is enough, no need to rub salt in the wound. 
You must look forward and realize it's not the end of life, in the end, it's just money. There's other values of life than that.

Maybe I phrased my words wrongly reading the responses. Meant that usage validates bitcoin's position as a currency and the usage is the key to mass adaption which is the secret for bitcoin's price increase. I didn't mean it's "only" for usage, just meant to remind people that if all used bitcoin only as a SoV instead of currency, it wouldn't really see a price increase in the future.

Well, the exit node can be malicious, so in that sense the warning is true.

I dislike the deceptive forbes.com/sites  . Many people seem to think those blogposts are truly Forbes articles. 
It's not just Bitcoin. I've seen people referring to those Forbes blogposts as Forbes articles so many times. I've seen even major newspapers falling to it.
I believe we should take the feedback to Forbes.
