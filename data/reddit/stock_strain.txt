My God, this is astonishing. Astonishingly sad really. What actually happened in Venezuela? The condition appears to be lasting last longer than expected. Is it ever going to end soon? I hope it does. But are we sure Bitcoin will not metamorphose too? Inflation may not be a problem now but some other might arise.

Bitcoin could be significantly impacted by an election for perhaps the first time ever today as Québec voters go to the polls in the French-Canadian province’s parliamentary elections.The general elections are the province’s first since tensions arose earlier this year over how electricity should best be allocated for bitcoin mining.
Bombarded with demand in early 2018 by miners from China and elsewhere, the provincial government – headed by the Parti Liberal du Québec - quickly applied heavy brakes to the nascent mining industry by ordering Hydro-Québec, the state-owned electric utility, to restrict the sale of power and charge higher tariffs to customers in the blockchain industry.  
The government pointed to grid capacity and economic development concerns to publicly justify its actions, but that explanation didn’t resonate well among many in the local industry who saw the move as a political crackdown that has chased away investment and innovation.
“These measures immediately damaged numerous mining operations in Quebec and deterred investors who went elsewhere,” François Remy, a former columnist at Les Affaires, a Montreal business newspaper, told Forbes. “The crypto community is really not happy about that.”
“The Québec Bitcoin eldorado is dead,” Francis Pouliot, a voice in the Montreal cryptocurrency scene, tweeted in June.
