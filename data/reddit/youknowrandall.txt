@_date: 2014-01-06 18:57:52
haha yep
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:40:36
You absolutely know me so well. Great job.

I havent watched the market I'm just sick of dogecoin
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:36:43
Bitcoin is bipolar. In the best way
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:09:33
twitter and are the best bets in my mind... maybe a post in the dogecoin sub
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:11:06
I've been hearing about Digitalcoin
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:46:13
Makes sense. I am talking more about coin devs whos goal is to make a pump and dump coin with no innovations 
@_date: 2014-01-17 18:46:47
much sattire. such thanks to dogeconomy. LONG LIVE THE SHIBENATION
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:40:14
none I invested time through sharing my music and getting tipped and such
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:13:14
I heard of bitcoin first, but received doge first- so thats what I started with 
@_date: 2014-10-26 19:34:05
good point, anonymous ransomers is a new phenomenon. Before btc there would be paper trails... now if you know what you're doing you can be completely off the grid 
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:43:05
Just a lot of time since Christmas 
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:04:49
I got scammed out of 10,000 doge recently (payed 10 dollars for it- grossly over priced, never received it)
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:33:12
I have a few hundred fedoracoin is that better?

Keep drinking the punch my friend
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:56:30
because it was easier to access

@_date: 2014-01-08 16:24:49
Yeah I think so too but my girlfriend is a different story. Damn cultural norms
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:12:25
Ive been tipped doge a lot... never bitcoin. Doge people are nice people
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:54:50
I'm still working on getting the BTC for it, but I'm surprised there isn't a jewelery market already in place- maybe a good move for someone in that industry. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 15:27:30
I guess thats one way to look at it lol
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:34:57
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:30:43
Guten tag
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:59:15
I dont mine thats why it was easiest for me, because I could give out songs and receive doge for it... people seem a bit less carefree with BTC 
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:26:24
really thats awesome! I will be contacting you soon
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:53:32
We need a cryptoressurection
@_date: 2014-01-18 16:58:48
I didn't sell yet so I still have most of my coins invested
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:57:53
interesting... I wish I knew some jewelers to convince!
@_date: 2014-11-04 01:40:17
yessir. god bless. (love the pretty blue text, neat trick)
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:31:30
+5 doge
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:17:09
What do you think about Vert?
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:52:05
I think after 8 years of dating it probably has to be a real ring...
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:48:07
thank you... I'm considering investing in it... I just would want to catch it when it dips to buy one
@_date: 2014-01-18 16:59:37
no 42 coin dropped(new coin)... BTC is still good
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:48:40
I'm almost convinced 
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:45:15
My question is more about what the computers are doing, could it be a big net of computers doing tasks uncovering bitcoins but at the same time making other computations or code for the benefit of someone else
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:04:06
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:42:50
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:24:18
is there a general crypto news source in one place to keep up with what the devs are up to and the publicity they're getting etc..
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:35:28
I am. *MIND. BLOWN.* :^o

Learn about cold storage
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:53:35
nice! I want to get into mining but dont have time/money/know how
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:39:01


Interesting idea
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:40:21
thats what I was introduced to first yeah
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:26:58
*I DIDN'T SPEND ANY MONEY* Why don't people listen
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:26:10
Bitcoin seems like the most reliable... and because it is accepted by new businesses daily I think it will be around for a long time 
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:45:41
Everyone love everyone
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:54:37
upvote. doge community is best
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:10:30
I didn't invest I worked on being donated coins because of sharing my original music. I could have sold them but I had more fun just randomly giving them to reddit people... perpetuating the coin I know but it's still nice to be appreciated every once in a while
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:49:00
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:58:27
Yeah I just wanted to share without begging
@_date: 2014-11-01 04:57:41
BITS! better than candy
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:15:20
hahah and what's your reasoning behind that?
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:13:33
I would buy gold with bitcoins, but I only have $0.20 in BTC right now! LONG LIVE REDDIT
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:57:28
definitely. Especially if you have a big amount of BTC. I don't really know how to do it since I don't even have 1 whole coin but I have heard about it a lot
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:05:38
Not per se but I thought it could gain a little value because of the novelty... which it did but not much. Dogecoin got me into the crypto thing so I do appreciate how easy it is for people new to cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:47:26
Its the process of storing your bitcoins on an offline wallet off your computer. Usually stored within a thumb drive. Makes it so no one can hack into your computer and take them because they arent in your main (computer) wallet
@_date: 2014-01-03 01:49:03
I am GOD
@_date: 2014-01-01 20:29:54
