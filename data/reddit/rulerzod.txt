Can someone pull up the weiss ratings data of the fraudulent mortgage backed securities of 2008.
I suck at google.  Aka these ratings are meaningless. They gave a memecoin a rating...

No the bch elites were glad coinbase didnt make it available.  Lots of people became involuntary hodlers of bcash because of it.  
Bch would of plummeted to nothing a long time ago when people dumped it  if not for that.

Study the price history
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:27:24
Even if your myth were true. Ethereum is vulnerable as fuck. The ethereum of today is not the real ethereum. Its a hard fork because people panicked ethereum itself was hacked 50 million was stolen in 2016.  Bitcoin blockchain has never once been hacked. Exchanges have been hacked but never bitcoin itself.
The real ethereum is ethereum classic.
Tell me again how its more technically capable?
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:45:37

There was so much more he could of touched on.

It was a ponzi scheme by loaning out your real btc for bcc tokens in exchange for an alleged compounding interest.  
Everyone in the crypto community said it wreaked of a scam. Classic ponzi think LIFE and Monavie. And they might take everyones btc and do an exit scam.
Turns out thats exactly what happened.
Everyone who was silly enough to fall for their paid youtube ads and marketing lost a ton of money.  
Could be them offloading the stolen btc. 
Bitconnect and bcc is a scam not btc.  Was a scam to get peoples bitcoin.

Wrong. incorrect. Your analogy only works if we called bitcoin bitcoin classic.  And bcash bitcoin.
Plus the reason behind it was ethereum was hacked. The bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:52:18

Its on purpose they're not transaction batching. can save up to 80% on fees/blockspace. Its crazy. Now if you add SegWit on top you basically get almost twice that. Im not sure what the hold up is.
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:17:40

Bcashers gave up on bcash. They're now backing ethereum hoping they can accomplish the "flippening" that way. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:41:20
Thats coinbase fees not bitcoin fees
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:10:15
This is just like them getting paid off to  give a false rating in the big short.
They will give bitcoin a shitty rating and a piece of shit a good rating.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:30:59
How much is a lot?
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:30:52
Could be to accomplish the flippening with ethereum since bcash is on life support.  Or to fulfill short contracts. Or to try to kill bitcoin.

Hmm wonder why bitcoin and litecoin are being manipulated and suppressed. And eth is not.  Eth and bcash are in bed together just like roger ver and brian armstrong.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:28:09
The problem is coinbase. The newbs that dont know what they bought are transacting on coinbase which is not segwit.  
And bitpay and blockchain.info

These people selling at a loss need to understand time in beats timing.  Calm down. It will retrace.
Listen to shallow hals tony robbins on the 2008 market crash. It was so bad because people cashed out at a loss instead of chilling and waiting for a retrace.  
Trying to time a crash or timing a surge will only ever hurt you.
Markets seldom ever crash to zero. Wait for a recovery and then get out if the volatility is too much for you. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:32:53
Im not blaming the sticky at all. He said part of tho.
I think its all a combination of whales buying in so they had holdings to manipulate when they shorted it.  
Plus the whole bitconnect thing is bad press. 
I think coinbase either didnt have liquidity or was manipulating.
Plus all the other fud and media manipulation. Not to mention roger ver and sock puppets making crypto look like a ponzi scheme.

Because theres no blockchain without an incentive coin.  And the most secure, most decentralized, most censorship resistent, highest hashpower coin is Bitcoin.
Without that you just have a regular database.  It seems blockchain is just a buzzword to you. You dont actually understand what you are talking about.

Are you retarded? Im sure the lawyer wont contact the police.  Can you read? The lawyer only has half the seed. You know how bitcoin works?
They need the other half of the seed too which is in a safety deposit box that only the person kidnapped can access. So how is the kidnapper gonna be comfortable letting them go into the bank vault unattended with the bank clerk where you can rat on them.
You know whats just as easy or even easier to steal than bitcoin? US dollars.
Most banks can send a large wire over the phone.  We also know the addresses of a shit ton of celebrities leaked online. We also can do a simple google search of their networth.
You know why they are not getting tortured and robbed constantly? Cause   they are not unsecure and most people are not fucking idiots.

Just want to mention the kind of shady tactics used on newbs by rbtc.
I remember when I first started posting on rbitcoin I got several pms from users I'd never spoken to claiming that some of my comments had been deleted and that I should use rbtc instead because rbitcoin is censored.
I could not find any deleted comments and figured usually when someone talks to you out of the blue its because they want something.  
And this was before the massive propaganda campaign thats been going on the last 6 months.  
So stay smart, beware newbs dont be a grandma falling for a nigerian prince.

It doesnt matter that its gemini custodian they still own your bitcoin while they have them. Read the terms of service and all the shady things in it.
Also they recently stopped giving 6% for anything over 10 bitcoin when it used to be up to 25.  Not a good sign for the company.

Gemini is holding blockfis bitcoin, not your bitcoin. Its no longer your bitcoin once you send it to them and sign the terms of service.
They only are able to offer that interest because of their loan program. And no one is taking their loans because it requires trusting them with custody of 3x the loan amount.  Hence the multiple interest rate cuts in their first less than a year of operation. So they couldnt of made you that much bitcoin.

Thats like saying everyone is gonna rob everyone because they might have possibly have a hidden stash of gold.
Its like someone holding someone at gunpoint and saying i will take you to the bank and wait outside while you dont tell the bank people you are being held hostage.
No one with that much value in bitcoin is gonna keep it all in one place and the seed that readily accessible to even be able to be coerced into giving it up.
And no criminal is gonna take that much gamble with their life without knowing they have it or for sure even still have it or even have direct access to be able to give it to them if they wanted without endangering themselves to be caught.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:38:05
Ok ive seen multiple people explain this to you. And judging by your other comments you are just a concern troll.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:29:28
Did roger seriously just say lightning network would work better on bcash?
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:51:41
I say sell it. The best way to feel comfortable investing in something is to fully do the research on it.
I spent days reading and watching multiple books and hours of footage about bitcoin before i decided to invest in it.  
I did the same for a couple of the top alts. Ultimately I came to the conclusion they were shit. Ethereum specifically has questionable security and [Vitaliks personal views]( are pretty bizarre and he served too much as a central authority.
Its also an ICO scam coin launching platform.
And at the end of the day if Bitcoin fails then the entire idea of a hard money cryptocurrency ever working fails. Because it becomes an infinite cycle of new currency and inflation. Its Bitcoin or none and the fact you dont seem to understand that yet means you havnt done the research.
The whole myspace facebook is a false equivalent.
Read the bitcoin standard.

Makes me sad that Dan Bilzerian has 150 million and could buy more bitcoin than I could ever have with pocket change.  ��
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:27:14
Lots of reasons. They havnt implemented segwit yet, they are guilty of price manipulation with the fake bch price of 9500. 
They conspired to surprise launch bch on the same day of bitcoins difficulty adjustment which is always when bch attacks the bitcoin network.
Then there is the leak of bcash insider trading. 
It was speculated they were delaying segwit on purpose to hurt bitcoin but all the recent events confirmed it. 
When ceo was asked about it on the news he laughed and said couldnt commit to a time.  
Use gemini or bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:44:07
Its owned by the owner of bch who is the owner of bitcoin.com.  the scam artist roger ver

Coinbase can enable buying bcash but they cant implement segwit? 
Everyone use gemini.

I think bitcoin is super undervalued.  And I think the price wanted to skyrocket but big institutions were and are suppressing the price while spreading all the bad press.  
This feels like the part of the movie when the cdo's were failing but still getting a good rating.

Sweep each private key in the coinomi app.

Segwit is a blocksize increase. Not devs fault coinbase and bitpay and so many users are still using legacy addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:06:51
Tell their buddy jihan and his mining pools to stop spamming the mempool with small transactions to increase fees on real transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:02:47
The whale is proven malicious. He took half of his 20k sell wall and put half that at 18,900 and the other half at  19,500.  
Hes been struggling for over a week to keep the price down.  
Meanwhile bcash is pumping. Very well could be roger playing games with the last of his Bitcoin.
Any whales reading this.. be an angel and buy up the last of this douche whales bitcoin!

No one will buy bcash. Someone who lost money will tell all their friends and they will tell all their friends.  No way bcash will succeed with bitcoin in the name.
And all the other coins will never get mainstream adoption.  People will be coin? Internet money? Oh like bitcoin? No thanks.
What is even bcash and litecoin etc solution to scaling when they get to bitcoins level of usage?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:02:00
More word of mouth. People are lazy and dont shop around.  
You can buy with a credit or debit card. 
Gemini bank transfers only but they dont make you wait. They credit your account same day.
I think coinbase is maliciously delaying segwit and is pro bch as they were pro 2x
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:05:50

Roger ver's war with bitcoin is bad for all crypto.
How does he not understand that even if hypothetically bitcoin goes down and bcash replaces it. That he has permanently tainted crypto and the bitcoin name that he wants so much!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:56:05
No what they do is lets say the price is organically on its way to 20k. 
Way ahead of 20k they put a sell wall for 20 million at 20k.  Then when it hits 20k we cant fulfill that sell order so the price drops to like 19,800. 
At which point they move some of that or place another sell wall of 2-6 million at 19,800 which slides the price to 19,500.  Then they take half of their 20 million sell wall at put 10 million at 19,500.
Which dips us even further.
Normally we would organically eat through these sell walls. But you will notice that as we try to they top up and stack more on the wall. Then when the price falls they move the wall to a lower price point.
Their reasoning.  Maybe they are pumping an altcoin, maybe they put a short on bitcoin, maybe they are keeping the price lower longer while they buy more through arbitrage.  Idk. All i know is they are maliciously manipulating and fucking with peoples money and it aint right.
I would say its been roger doing it for over a week in preparation for his bcash pump at the difficulty adjustment. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:47:33
Most of those are paid ads. And they are trying to get referrals cause its a ponzi scheme like mona vie and life.
You will make more money holding your own bitcoin in cold storage than with bitconnect.  
Plus with bitconnect you dont actually have the private key of the coins in there.

Just buy now. If it dips buy more. If you wait well.. havnt you seen the skeleton meme?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:47:56
Well they disabled buys cause they couldnt handle the traffic and id say coinbase/gdax was atleast partly responsible for the dip. Considering we were caught up with bithumb.
Now we're at 17k and bithumb is at 20k+
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:05:25
I see 22k by tomorrow

You're not making sense dude. Scaleability would mean the price goes up due to network effect. And bitcoin is the only one working towards scaleability and that is even  working at all at this scale.

You were just told. But I will break it down for you in the slight chance you are not just concern trolling
They set a fake price for bcash at 9000 before trading even began.
The timing of their secret launch of bcash trading on the same day of the difficulty adjustment which is always when bcash mining pools steal hashing power and pump bcash. 
They are caught red handed.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:38:56
Dont be jealous of our joy. 
If you dont like this sub so much go back to the bcash sub before we brainwash you as your comment history says.

Not to mention they were clearing the order books so the sell walls wouldnt hurt bcash.
And they still havnt implemented bch to btc trades i dont think
Basically they're in bed with bcash

Really? If you've been around here at all in recent times you would know its been happening a lot lately.
Its called botvoting
Mods have frequently posted about it.  
Mass downvoting anything positively btc and upvoting anything positive bch.  By hundreds in minutes.
The btc sub admitted it happened but then tried to say it was us. A false flag of a false flag.  
Its not people so quit playing dumb or pay attention
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:41:58
If they really cared about good pr they would of implemented segwit and let people dump their bcash long ago.
This feels like too little too late

You are forgetting the fact they are guilty of colluding with roger to surprise it on everyone the day of the bitcoin difficulty adjustment which is when just as last month roger and jihan stole hash power and pumped bcash.  Not to mention the multiple leaks of insider trading before the surprise launch.

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:58:32
Cause they're still not allowing people to dump it.
And giving people access to their bcash is different than adding full support to their trading platform
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:33:17

I want to discuss the roadster. But i doubt id be able to make a post just for that.
It looks freaking sweet. But the car is $200,000+.  Thats more than my house.  
Even once bitcoin hits $1,000,000. How can i justify such a purchase? It depreciates as soon as you drive it.
Id really like one and id love teslas auto pilot but if im being practical when am i going to get the oppurtunity to open her up and go fast. Unless im trying to get a ticket.
As much as id want one feel like id just have to get a tesla s and not waste the money.

They already have that. On coinbase for example you can set it to purchase a recurring amount of bitcoin weekly or monthly.

Now bcash wants lightning network after they talked so much shit about 2nd layer
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:07:12
Seems to me you are purposefully being ignorant to what they did so you can concern troll.
This was their original plan announced for january
Not full buying support surprise launched on the same day of the bitcoin difficulty adjustment. The same day when bcash attacks the network and pumps same as november.
Not to mention the disable bch btc sells.  Fake manipulated price and insider trading.  And clearing the order books everytime a bch sell wall built up when they halted trading.
From your post history:
"I’m bullish on BCH and have diversified to hold both.
I also believe BCH has big potential to poach a lot of the best developers, and might be implementing SegWit2x of its own. We might still see both coins climb. "
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:53:48
Thats bcashes intention. That regular folk will think its the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:43:19
You basically said everything yourself.
coinbase has created a massive stash of involuntary hodlers.
Which allowed bcash a giant safety net while roger and jihan pumped the price and do their sock puppet propaganda campaigns.
Basically lots of people dont have access to their bcash because coinbase hasnt enabled access so they cannot dump it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:04:06
Then why doesnt gemini or gdax charge those fees? 
Coinbase charges premiums on everything.
Quit talking out your ass.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:14:58
Because they are greedy assholes that dont invest any of their insane profits into infrastructure.
They charge an insane premium and massive fees and still havnt implemented segwit.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:53:55

You see the giant sell walls being placed and then removed before being fulfilled to knock the price down.
Been going on for awhile but started back up past couple days. 
This thing wants to blast off but people are being shady
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:04:45
I dont know man. The truth always gets buried with whoever can lie the loudest repeatedly.
With roger going on mainstream talk shows lying his ass off.  
Roger and jihan paying massive social media farms all over the world to shill and lie and confuse newcomers to the community.
And coinbase purposefully delaying segwit to make bitcoin look bad.
The truth gets pretty muddy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:08:30
Gdax is coinbase. Have you been paying attention at all?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:42:56

@_date: 2017-12-18 16:59:39
Time in beats timing.  Trying to sell high and buy low is predicting the future twice. You'll just end up with less bitcoin.  Dont believe the trolls who say "get good bruh".
Not to mention taxes and fees each time you sell. You would have to predict the future and sell at the top of the peak and then have it drop over 30% and buy low to make any profit doing this once you factor in taxes. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:14:02
No you cant. Dont panic sell. If you dont believe in bitcoin you shouldnt be buying it. Its not for a quick buck.

Ok then you only lost what you earned that week. My bad for not being educated about nicehash.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:25:48
Looks like gdax let a 20 million sell wall build up and then resumed trading.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:54:45
I know the difference. You said it was over valued thats why I asked you if you knew what you were saying.
So you dont believe in bitcoin. So why are you here? Just to troll?
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:15:37
How do you not understand that the majority of bcash coins held on coinbase not being able to be sold long ago prevents bcash from tanking.
So yes not being able to trade bcash helps bcash. 
Go concern troll elsewhere

Its so when the sell wall mass dump goes through it doesnt tank the bcash price.

Not really. We just finished our last correction.  We have only climbed 5% today.   When it hit 10k we hit 11,300 the same day.  
So maybe if we hit 13.3k tomorrow maybe then we might get one. Or not.   
Once it hits 10k pounds at $13.3 something we are in uncharted territory as far as perspective.
Even still dont try and day trade. Time in beats timing. If you dont understand google it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:20
In which case buy more. Highly doubt that happens.  A decrease more than 30ish% hasnt happened since before mount gox.

Bitcoin is anti censorship. Twitter is pro censorship. 
The only reason Jack Dorsey even agreed to do the podcast again was because the first time around zero hard questions were asked and both Joe and Jack received a lot of backlash for it.  You can check the dislikes for the first podcast they did was like 20 to 1 negative to positive.
Joe Rogan and Tim both confront Jack Dorsey and his head twitter policy person(lawyer) on the blatant censorship double standards going on on twitter.  
Jack barely speaks and they dodge every question. Its all legalese and bullshit bullshit bullshit. Full pr mode. And the entire reason Joe rogan is popular is for its long form real conversations. Not newspeak not pr mode.
And the only real answers they get out of her is "I'm sorry you feel that way" and "we appreciate your feedback".
Also she blatantly lies the entire podcast. Pretends she doesnt understand plain english. Says things like not that im aware or I dont know. Also she acts like she was completely unaware of all the antifa activity and yet people went to her page live during the podcast and saw she actually follows a lot of antifa pages so she was lying.
Also. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 23:36:48

It was one of the most difficult podcasts to listen to.  The amount of question dodging and plausible deniability tactics going on was pissing me off.
Anytime she was caught she would just say "I dont know what that is", "I dont know who that is", "not that I am aware", "I dont know", "thank you for the feedback".
It was super fake and the whole time she was smirking and being super coy.
She even clicked her tongue at joe when he was trying to make a point.
Also Joe flat out asked Jack for a timeline on fixing these issues of bias and allowing free speech and he couldnt give one.
He asked to have him on in 6 months to see what progress they've made and he basically said no nothing will change by then.
After this podcast fuck Twitter. 
He said over and over again how good his intentions are but the road to hell is paved with them.  Straight Orwellian 1984 farenheight 451 future Jack and his team will create.

Theres a reason this whale is selling one of his properties for bitcoin directly OTC instead of selling it for dollars then just buying bitcoin.   because if he did that then the price of the spot market would go up and hes going to use the bitcoin as margin to continue shorting and dumping bitcoin.
This doesnt help the price of bitcoin.  Sell the property for dollars then BUY Bitcoin.

I think you mean exchanges are fractional reserving and manipulating. They are selling bitcoin they dont even have to lower the price to pay out withdrawals.   That combined with CME manipulation through bitstamp, coinbase, binance, and kraken.
Devs already created a safe tool for major exchanges to prove their bitcoin holdings but theres no way to force any major exchanges to use it and they are already in bed with the FED and CME.
So unless somehow magically decentralized exchanges like bisq skyrocket in volume and take over then bitcoin and cryptocurrency is basically dead in the water.

How cool would it be if they carry it to the next episode.
Or sheldon says sorry guys i timelocked hodled it for you guys.
@_date: 2019-10-24 23:28:59
we already basically did that with the annual proof of keys event and not enough people participated. people are stupid so bitcoin is likely doomed.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:59:21
I shared that experience.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:28:05
Nah I think its purely political. A narrative. Now bcash is being pumped and the blockchain is being spammed small transactions by bots.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:37:48
Isnt that what it says on the ledger nano s

I didnt make it. I saw it way way back in november 2017 and have not seen it posted anywhere since.

@_date: 2017-11-13 03:30:56
Yea i read he misused position to make some dudes private info public and made his wallet vulnerable over $50. Dudes got 600 million. That is petty as shit.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:43:42
You are talking out your ass. The last time it dropped 80% was cause an exchange got hacked.  
Being prepared is good but quit blowing smoke.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:41:51
He admitted it all. Like a comic book villain. He admitted his plot to manipulate the market, he admitted hes trying to steal the bitcoin name which is why he doesnt like bcash.  
Then he goes im rich im rich rage quit.

Not sure which you're saying.  He originally put 2k before he corrected to 7.5k
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:06:53
Duh that would be too obvious
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:11:45
Your analogy doesnt work. The way to look at it is myspace didnt fail, it served its fuction and was replaced.
If Bitcoin fails or is replaced then it didnt serve its function and crypto fundamentally doesnt work since its vulnerable to manipulation and social engineering. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:04:29
Thats reasonable. Hope it does sooner than later before i buy more.

I agree. But from what I understand theres a bunch to implement before it comes to that piece. So why are people fixating on it.

Im sick of people suggesting a mt gox like 80% drop with no reasoning other than "correction".   
It may very well correct from 20k to 15k.  Or 15 to 10.  
But its not gonna drop 80% to 5k without some catastrophic event. Just stop.
You're either wishful thinking so you can buy more or you're one of those bcash flippening guys.

@_date: 2019-04-15 17:43:23
Wrong. He spoke against the heat it would bring to bitcoin at such an early stage. He didnt want to kick the hornets nest before it had a chance to take hold.

Thats flat out false. If that were true O wouldnt have to be annoyed with all you shills commenting pumping bitcoin cash.

You use the other indicators to make an educated guess.  Bear flags, bull flags, support zones, resistance zones, ribbons, waves etc in trading software.
TA only really matters if you're trading.

No forking is an attack for control after not getting the votes to get what they wanted from the bitcoin community.
Bitcoin development is an open source  meritocracy and I think a lot of this forking insanity is because roger ver felt personally slighted after he lost any access since he knows nothing about coding and his buddy got voted out of the meritocracy.

If you click on the history of most of these people. You can see they are shill accounts with no history. 
I gaurantee you its a bunch of people jammed in a room working overseas.  Just like when you call amazon support and talk to an idian who has a bunch of background noise going on behind them.
This is a massive social engineering campaign.
I think the big bankers and wallstreet didnt like bitcoin at first because they didnt understand it.  Most still dont.
The bankers dont see it as a threat cause they dont understand it.  And wallstreet just wants to make money.
So i think we're past the point of them  trying to kill it. I think wallstreet wants to make massive amounts of money in shorts and then massive amounts on a new bullrun. 
But hey just my guess. Or could just be craig and rogers dumps crashing us.

Theres nothing but good news with bitcoin right now and should be sunny skys. And yet the price is plummeting.

It is heavily manipulated though.  Mass spoofing goes on nonstop, Institutions and rich whales can borrow thousands and thousands of bitcoin to dump on spot while they short without even having to own bitcoin using services like blockfi, genesis, and other bitcoin lending platforms.     Not to mention the Fed can print infinite money to short bitcoin which has close ties to the CME. 
Bitcoin is our only Plan B.  So quit being chicken shit bitches and HODL because if it doesnt work out we are all fucked in this world economy anyway.

Why not? Now they know not to keep their bitcoin on an exchange, not that theres anything wrong with bitcoin. What did they go through? They sat by and watched their $400 or less investment that they lost shoot to $20,000.
If anything they cant wait to put their $400 per coin back in and feel its a second chance.

There are people who think they are animals and we dont readily offer them surgery and exogenous hormones. 
Same goes for people who have many other body dysphorias like phantom limbs and or think they are other objects. 
The sad part is there is more effort being done to push trans acceptance and give children hormone blockers and exogenous hormones than to find out the why behind these mens issues but nobody cares about men. 
How come its never considered that these men just have a cognitive dissonance and on an unconscious level they are taught man bad woman good.
I wanna know why men have 2x times less testosterone than 100 years ago.
I wanna know why 80% of all trans is male to female.  Women are not rushing to become men at the same rate.
We still haven't studied why 90% of suicides is male.

You seem to be reacting to jordan emotionally rather than rationally. Im an atheist/agnostic so relax. Jordan speaks in long rants and metaphors. Show me a clip where jordan explicitly says this.
In that video they cut a quick few soundbites together of him not really saying that and then claim thats what hes saying. 
More than likely he was going on a long metaphorical rant about everyone having something that structures their morality.
Jordan peterson is edited and purposefully taken out of context more than anyone ive seen.  Liberals have labeled the man a nazi. Its asinine.

The creators of sv and cash calvin and craig, roger and jihan have a lot of btc to burn to fund their war.
The real winner here is btc because they both bankrupt themselves and then hold way less btc which prevents them from pulling this kind of fork shit in the future.
Before roger and jihan made bcash they made bcash unlimited.

You're better off snagging 2700-2800 if  it even goes that low.
The volume right now is as high as the last bull runs peak volume. Theres a good chance that we bounce off 2900 something into a huge v shaped recovery.

Why do people have so much faith in gold? The government can confiscate your gold in times of crisis which is the very time you will need it. They've done it before.
A lot of people in the usa still seem to believe you can go to a bank and trade in your dollars for some gold. You cant. Gold doesnt back the dollar anymore.
I challenge you to try this. They dont even have enough cash if everyone wanted to close their accounts.
And when a bank goes insolvent your money is gone. Poof.
So if the dollar is backed by nothing, and a bank can take your dollars and run and a government can take your gold and run then why [trust]( either?
Bitcoin is here to stay.
