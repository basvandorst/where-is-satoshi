It is unbelievable. And btw your comment reminds me of this little scene from The Wire.

I thought the same thing but then I realized I already had my id scanned from when I verified on gox...

Very Funny! Much Entertain! To the MOOOOONNNNN of chapter 11 omicron perscei 8!

They are small time and don't have nearly the staff to do anything besides drown under support tickets. They are slow but reliable... okay maybe not reliable but havent lost money to them

 did not work. boo Virginia. Boo

I know it's alpha. I put in like 10$ and messed around with both testnet and real coins. I'm using real coins because I want to know how to get coins from darkwallet keys (encreypted .json file) to a blockchain.info wallet. I need to get plaintext private keys in order to import into blockchain
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:53:11
Never had that problem
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:46:25
1 coin through bitcoinbuilder. I bet that they were solvent. I bet that a muti million dollar company couldn't be that much of a complete fucking failure. I lost that bet.

I would pay for the PC version if they offered BTC as a payment method. Xbox version lacks some stuff i hear
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:46:21
Local Bitcoins man
That is the way to go
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:31:21
Please elaborate. I got a bunch of those transactions. Where did they originate from?
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:49:00
will do!
@_date: 2014-04-01 05:27:20
look to cryptorush or mtgox. Their funds get stolen through hacks and shit programming. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:23:39
was the hack related to the node operation at all?
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:58:24
I had an account shut down for bitcoin purchases. Teller was all smiley too but some boss was observing and did not approve of my coinbase purchases.

Thanks fellow shibe :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:45:15
people are stupid
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:17:39
thats hysterical. glad he got some entertainment out of the whole gox debacle
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:52:04
They are terribly slow at making deposits to your account you only save a small percentage over coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:39:09
that's the point
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:45:35
It's still not gone just yet. I'm not selling ever. Figure gox has got to pay out some amount if not all. I find it impossible to believe that ALL their coins were stolen. They've been dealing with thieves and drug dealers longer than any other exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:43:41
I gained a bit too but overall was betting 1 btc on the survival of gox
@_date: 2014-04-23 00:36:01
good looks on the "bits"
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:08:25
I love that I can send money freely at any time to whoever I want
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:08:40

He put it up on his podcast to see the involvement of the BTC community. The money poured in and he was shocked
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:03:35
Thank you kindly fellow shibe
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:58:55
This is what LOCALBITCOINS.COM is!!!!!
@_date: 2015-04-15 12:25:02
Does anyone know of alternatives to brawker? I loved their service and used it all the time.
@_date: 2015-03-21 08:49:02
I can't access either.
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:34:46
You can easily find people to purchase things for you on Amazon if you pay them in bitcoin. I've done it for numerous people on occasion. 
If you wanted some small item to start, I'd be glad to purchase it on your behalf if you sent me BTC for it. PM me if you don't want to use purse.io or some other site that holds your coins for you.

Na it's still strong as ever. In Charlottesville last June the crowd chanted "Primus Sucks" for a solid ten minutes after Leslie ended the show early. Fan threw a shoe at Les. I was very disappoint.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:02:23
Do I just pour honey on my computer to install service???
I want this service now
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:31:08
Just curious are you blond and/or female?
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:40:10
me too
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:54:49
You like Primus?! Surley you can't be serious!? I dream of one day retiring from the bitcoin trade to become a harvester of the sea with my cat named Tommy.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:46:35
It was a long shot.
Serious note- most bitcoin enthusiasts are male though. That is kind of disappointing as half the world's population has yet to be exposed.
It's also why I feel comfortable posting this here. I'd bet no women are reading this.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:39:29
The fact that you're scanning the new posts of bitcoin subreddit indicates to me that you're probably category one of my bitcoin clients. Male, 25-35 possibly bearded. Am I in the right ballpark?
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:34:48
Clearly you aren't a fan of Leslie Nielsen.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:00:20
I'm kinda complimented actually
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:04:55
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:07:20
Could be. I choose to work on my bigoted comedy routine instead.
Trying to be the next O&amp;A

You could buy a lot of blowgramps with 20k$.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:12:39
It's a shame no more reactions will be had as the downvotes are here.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:33:18
TIL. thanks
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:48:37
Does anybody else find it VERY strange that the SR camel watermark is in the background???
The gov would not put that there...
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:58:25
Agree with you completely. But as of now, women rarely use localbitcoins, craigslist, or Reddit so I will post away.
