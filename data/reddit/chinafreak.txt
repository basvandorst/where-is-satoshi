Many "experts" said that bitcoin is not gonna go up 2000$ and now look it again...  We can never be sure about that.
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:09:23
Good one lol. But yeah I can understand!

What the hell, why the fuck take Blockfolio so much data?
My own app "Bitcoin Profit Viewer" (private app for me) uses only ~ 124 KB of internet data and I'm already using for 2 weeks. I'm using this app very often and it's even realtime bitcoin price index:

other bitcoin "expert" said that btc will drop after $ 4800 meanwhile this guy mean btc will still increase. I can't trust someone.

 pretty easy, safety and it's a known company in germany. Other country can buy this marketplace too.

True. I think the next stage of bitcoin transactios: Store bitcoin online on serives/bank/whatever and just trade inside of bank. Then transactions would be free unless bank want to have own fee too.
 (a german bitcoin marketplace) works similar. You can sell/buy bitcoin without to pay transactions as long your online wallet is on

Staph please...

So, I guess Raspberry Pi Cluster would work... But I guess you can't run multiple raspberry pi with one hard disk where blockchain is saved. So I have to use multiple hard disk, or?
I'm highly interested to support it. But it would be better if there is only one hard disk. =)

Good to know! Thanks! Also its performance important too? Or just network speed?
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:31:57
I've bunches of Raspberry Pi. Cluster = more CPU performance. Thats why I'm asking :)

In germany, you don't have to pay taxes as long you're holding Bitcoin for more than one year. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:29:55
Can you read german?
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:55:12
Ah nice! Because I was actually thinking, too so I can use my old Pi 2 :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:55:54
Nice! Thanks for the explaining. :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:54:08
But this can't be the reason by running Pi for 24/7

This miners are known that they're very loud... But are they quiet in this installation?
