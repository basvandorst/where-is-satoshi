I'm just withdrawing Bitcoin to QuadrigaCX, as I've done before.

Just letting everyone know that I was verified a few days ago for level 2. 
It took almost a month, but it's worth the wait.

Just name and address if I recall. It will have to match your passport photo or driver's license if you ever want to get Level 2.

Here's Poloniex's email stating they need to manually approve my withdrawal for "security reasons", even after I submitted my Passport Photo, Name, &amp; Address:

Okay, cool. 
Thanks for the reply, Mike. As long as I know the reasoning, I have no problem waiting.
@_date: 2017-05-02 10:57:51
Yeah, starting to get that feeling.
I never should have deposited my whole amount of crypto over to them in the 1st place.
Lesson learned. I'll stick to exchanges like Liqui.io that don't hold your money ransom. In and out.

Oh, I never use Polo, Bittrex, or Liqui charts.
I use Coinigy.com charts. Easily the best way to trade. You just use the API keys from each exchange, add them to coinigy, and you just need one login for access to every trade.

It's been 20 days for me now. I used the exact same passport photos on Bittrex, and it was approved within 24 hours.

Russia Today (RT.com) has been showing Bitcoin prices for over 3 months now.
@_date: 2017-05-02 10:48:56
Yeah, I've talked with many people on crypto slacks, and they say the same thing. Waiting for months. I used to be able to withdraw the minimum 2K.

I have a withdrawal history and deposit history:
As soon as I started asking why the verification process was taking so long, Poloniex is now withholding my funds for a "security check."
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:12:41
It wasn't a ransom note or anything, it was effective ransom. I wasn't aware (I'm new to Polo) that if I transferred a large amount of Coins into their wallet, that I wouldn't be able to get them back out. Only $2k at a time which is just over 1 BTC/24hr,  but they were also making me wait longer by doing 'security checks' of my withdrawals.
If I didn't get approved it would have taken me at least 4 months to withdraw my funds. Bittrex approved my photo verification within 24 hours and approved me for $100,000, which made waiting a month all the more scary. It's very worrisome when a headless company with no fixed address and no regulatory oversight, and no consumer protections can essentially do whatever they want with your money. 
All things considered, that's part of the cost of this game. I have to acknowledge I'm taking a huge risk with equally huge rewards if I'm going to play the crypto game.

Good to know! 
Thanks for letting me know there's hope!!
@_date: 2017-05-02 09:47:11
Yes. I am level 1 verified, and I've withdrawn many times before. 
They just arbitrarily said my 1.38 BTC withdrawal had to be verified by a security team member.
