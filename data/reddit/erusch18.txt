Oh don’t mind me, I’m just going to order [anything?] from Amazon.com and have it delivered to my door in 2 days for free (prime). 
*What ever happened to Amazon stock? Heard that dotcom bubble popped around 2000*
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:36:30
Yeah I don’t see this happening. You’re using the same logic that would cause the USD to be a bubble that bursts. Everything in crypto is measured against bitcoin. IMO it has been tested over and over and has proven its resilience.

I think I found my two new favorite cryptos:

Wallstreet Bonus Checks (WBC)
To the moooooon!

Just left a 1 star review on App Store for Coinbase. They fucking deserve all they get for their shit customer service and (now we know) causing congestion in the network
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:33:12
Everyone with an issue needs to CALL THEM and wait the 1-2 hrs on the phone and talk to a US-based rep. Their overseas reps do the web based support and are incompetent AT LEAST. I had to call them and they were way more helpful than the 12 cent per hour Philippines call center scrubs

I’d agree with you if you were assuming that there were no improvements being worked on for bitcoin to solve the scaling and transaction problems... but SegWit (which still has low adoption rn LOOKING AT YOU COINBASE, YOU FUCKERS) and lightning network will help solve those problems.
Anyways, good points and good chat :) 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:25:17
Also doesn’t operate in a few states... like mine :(

Good read
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:27:58
Interesting. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:43:12
That is something I need to get better at.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:58:54
I just checked this morning and I see 13k :(
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:26:14
SO cool
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:23:57
He said he has enough fiat to not have to touch the btc tho
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:40:39
Would have to caption it as well if silent
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:43:20
How has your tax experience been so far? Pain in the ass?
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:49:03
Mobile is essential
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:34:44
I like Binance and Poloniex personally
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:44:19
Everything will work out. Even if they give you the worst news possible, tell them to fuck off and that you’ll never give up. NEVER GIVE UP. &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:03:39
Sigh... I have been running this for a few days and was at like .009xxx btc. Was excited for my first cash out to my brand new Ledger Nano S *weeps*
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:33:49
Lol I had the same reaction as you
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:04:02
normal people :) (aka not in-the-know)
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:25:25
How did you manage  Are those funds in your 401k? Did you get taxed/penalized?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:00:02
The Documentary is also on Netflix rn
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:06:36
Net neutrality is a sham.
Being “neutral” does not equal free and open Internet. Plus, why would anybody be in favor of net neutrality when all it means is more government regulations and intervention???
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:04:22
It is mathematically impossible due to the mining rewards continuing to halve over time
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:05:39
Good point, I suppose you could say cryptocurrency in general but then would you really want to use an alt that’s not had as long of a track record like bitcoin has? Just a thought
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:54:53
Interesting thought actually.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:00:50
Yeah there are a few ways you can do it, the one you suggested is common. I guess it all depends on your preference as to how you want to secure it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:20:43
Lol same
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:09:15
Ledger Nano S is the one I bought, should get it soon
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:23:52
Ok, makes sense, does the node get a transaction fee then or something?
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:42:13
Right but the password allows you to access your private keys in the PDFs? With a hardware wallet you don’t even need to know the private keys - that’s the whole point of a hardware wallet. You only need to save your seed key.
Unless I’m misunderstanding how you have it set up, if so please feel free to correct me :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:07:18
Who is to stop the whole protocol from being changed? The decentralized distributed nature of bitcoin is its strength. It’s the same reason why it is near impossible for a hacker/bad actor to create fraud in the system.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:35:37
We’ll see in 50 years... will America have to come in and save the day again like in WWII?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:09:10
Exactly, and this is why everyone should support cryptocurrency as the new standard. No need for a “trusted” third party like a bank or government, decentralized, and peer to peer.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:59:18
You’re assuming that it’s a zero sum game which it isn’t. Please do some research about basic economics first.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:14:25
lol watched that video and he took it so personally... Sad!
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:26:11
And yet it keeps going up :) be happy!
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:45:37
Hi there :) I would review the beginner’s videos and articles listed in the website below and do you best to explain how it works in this type of terminology so it will be easy for them to write about and understand. Yes I know this will probably be stuff you already know... Assume they’re not tech savvy like we are!
Edit: clarity
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:17:54
Interesting read
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:58:07
Also while I wait for that new tech, with those profits I’ll probably purchase some alt miners as well, I like ripple, ether, monero so far based on their use cases. Diversify! So excited.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:03:38
Insignificant, and also covered by insurance. (that's originally what I thought he was speaking about tbh)
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:11:47
Glad to hear it. Hopefully it continues to improve!
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:40:39
I bought my ledger nano before I was even verified on Coinbase lol 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:29:42
That escalated quickly 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:07:54
So what you’re telling me is that you’re very rich or very poor. You are not considered middle class, who will receive double the standard deduction with these tax reforms, not to mention the repeal of the unconstitutional Obamacare individual mandate. Nice.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:18:32
Yeah if you look at Amazon’s price history from the 90s onward and compare it to bitcoin, I wholeheartedly believe that we are STILL in the early-adopter phase. So don’t fret!
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:28:11
I want to purchase an Antminer S9 to mine bitcoin, I figure at best it can pay my rent per month, or increase my retirement account by 10x with investment, at worst it’s a fun lil tech project. 
Since Bitmain only accepts Bcash as payment, how do you recommend trading USD for Bcash? I already have a Ledger Nano that I plan on storing my crypto (already tested with it and everything).
I’m looking at CEX.io but I’m still waiting for verification of my account from them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:59:47
Edit: Get those $17k memes ready!!!
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:17:51
Good advice, my question then is how accurate are the electricity estimates like on 
Based on my electricity cost and the cost of the machine, if they’re accurate I should get ROI in 2 months at current crypto difficulty
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:54:22
Thank you for the insightful chat! I’m hoping for a bubble burst like we saw with Amazon in late 90s... this is assuming we are still in early-adopter phase. I plan to HODL and continue to invest, if the estimates are accurate after I start mining and I get my ROI back, I’ll wait until the next ASIC tech (10nm? 7?) comes out and buy another miner to keep up with the difficulty increase.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:28:50
You don’t understand the basics of economics. Putting more money back into people’s pockets (lowering taxes) is a good thing, no matter if it’s companies or individuals. Government is bloated and inefficient.
The IRONY here is that if you support cryptocurrency/bitcoin, one of the big draws is the decentralization of currency aka getting away from government issuing and bank holding your money. Yet you don’t support the bill that takes money from the government and puts it back in your pocket? :thinking:
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:56:10
Right, and Clinton relaxed those regulations in the 90s because he thought owning a house was part of the “American Dream” that everyone should have
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:58:16
Forgive the noob question, but is this different than a miner?
Edit: I understand the technicals of verifying the block chain but I’m wondering what the purpose is after it is verified.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:20:56
Very cool info, thanks guys!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:13:36
Yessir! I hope it dips so I can buy more lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:29:18
Omg lol
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:36:40
No Wall Street executives have served time for the 2008 collapse yet. No bank executives have served time for money laundering. Yet Charlie Shrem is serving time for selling bitcoin to someone who sold bitcoin to someone to spend for drugs on the Silk Road. Insane.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:31:02
So you’d rather have the veracrypt password offline rather than your seed phrase? Seems like the same thing to me
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:29:33
Same thing, couldn’t get verified for almost a week and then another exchange verified me within 1 hour, so I told them to shove it and delete my account.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:39:54
Lol wish it were so.. le sigh 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:58:02
If you read the whitepaper and understand how the technology works, you’ll understand that it is near impossible for government to regulate (and for banks to try to take over) because it is worldwide, 24/7, and decentralized (p2p). They can try but will fail.
Failing economies generally have currency issues *by the government* and if the gov’t fails or loses trust of the people, the currency is worthless. For the reasons above, Bitcoin is immune to that scenario.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:41:23
I told my dad about this and spelled it out for him knowing he’s been investing in ‘safe’ low % yield bonds and such to round out his retirement savings, and he said “yeah but I don’t NEED to invest in this because I already have my retirement”
...I said, “but do you really?”
Does anyone with a brain believe the “trusted” third parties (banks, gov’t) anymore? After the 2008 collapse and the bailouts of auto industry and banks, I sure as hell don’t.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:03:26
Well, they will have no currency since it failed so there would need to be a new form of payment created or adopted. Unless they want to go back to the bartering system... but idk if anyone wants to do that lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:27:02
Yep, I’m just getting into it and bought a few hundred dollars worth of btc, ltc, and eth (diversify!) though Coinbase, but I’ve already ordered my hardware wallet and will transfer all of it off after it arrives. Nothing wrong with using Coinbase but just store your assets locally and securely.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:21:28
This is why I personally view it as more of a commodity like gold than a currency rn
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:05:19
Same, bought $100 in btc, $50 in eth, and $50 in ltc just to add to my savings/investment/retirement. Planning on adding more each month if possible since I finally read the whitepaper and understand how it works and what will happen when the 21M cap is hit 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:29:47
Could you have correctly predicted the price of bitcoin 6 times in the past 365 days?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:07:35
Only $20k?! NO BALLS
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:45:55
Because Coinbase verified identity quicker
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:28:03
That’s what she said!
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:54:44
Just think if you had so much bitcoin that you could do this lol 
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:45:29
part 2 at ~16 minutes a caller makes THIS EXACT POINT and calls out Ver LOL 
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:42:29
Pretty fair assessment tbh, no one knows what the price will be at lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:17:59
Fucking finally

Pocahontas is used to illustrating things incorrectly
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:15:10


Mathematics backs the values of crypto, not nothing. It takes hashing power to verify transactions which takes CPU/GPU power which takes electricity, which costs (right now) fiat money.
