Yes that's exactly it

Thank you!

Long term (12month+) capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate than short-term. So you are not only postponing, but to an extent avoiding taxes with the HODL
EDIT: Not sure if this has been said and is just adding to the confusion between you and u/bitcointheboardgame
Regardless thank you for the graphic!
Do you mind if I use it in literature for a cryptocurrency club I am starting ?

It is unethical to support BCH.
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:12:36
Market cap is a heavily skewed statistic. Especially when you have billionaire Ver and billionaire Jihan who can artificially support it.

There was a couple that lived off bitcoin only for 3 months. They had a documentary and everything
This was years ago

Not sure if you’re trolling or not, but I hope to hell thats not a serious comment

Why not demand payment in Monero ? Or any privacy currency for that matter
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:23:30
I agree that if you're fooled by that, then you shouldn't be in this space.
BUT, you also have to always be thinking of "what gets us the quickest mass adoption?" and BCH is not helping that

Lmao we are not still in the innovator phase. If that's what you have to tell yourself to justify keep buying, you should rethink your perspective a bit

For others reading this comment looking for more info:
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:02:30
good point!
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:46:15
A clear identity for bitcoin will help mass adoption.
Noobs coming into the space will resent having sent BTC to BCH address, and will therefore resent crypto
Just one example

They are insured for both hacking and employee pilferage.
All of this information is available on their website.

"Please note that the insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account. It is your responsibility to use a strong password and maintain control of all login credentials you use to access Coinbase and GDAX."
Am I interpreting that improperly ? That is copy-paste from their website
