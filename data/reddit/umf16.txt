Good point,

I hate to say it, as i'm a hardcore bitcoiner mainly due to finding it highly interesting and innovative, but you are absolutely correct. With the way things currently are, why would I just not use a credit card? There is presently no worthy incentive, (that I can currently see), for a non-techie person to want anything to do with it in the everyday world other than trading/investing for profit. There needs to be an incentive that the average citizen can see in order for them to join us.

as a bitcoiner/raver, I approve.

I agree 150%. To us, bitcoin is common knowledge and quite simple/easy for to use. However, it is the complete opposite for a person who is not tech savy. We, the "new" generation, have become accustomed with how to work computer technology. This is not at all the case with the middle-age/older generation that we honestly need to help back this whole thing. My dad literally hates bitcoin and always talks down about it for exactly the reason that OP mentioned. He can just about check email and search google (they aren't stupid/dumb or anything like that, there is just a divide when it comes to using modern technology for some unknown reason, i'm sure that many of you have witnessed this), and so he is immensely intimidated by the techie aspects of bitcoin and refuses to attempt to learn about it. Think about it like this: remember when you were first learning how to use a computer and only had minimal skills? Now put yourself in their shoes with trying to operate/use/buy bitcoin. It just doesn't work for the non-techie crowd atm. Do you honestly think that an "average" citizen (i'm not trying to be arrogant/elitist, just stating fact) can easily work the client software, learn about the cryptographic processes involved, etc... ? They just can't and simply don't have an interest enough to research/learn about it like we all did. Bitcoin will not make it big until the interface is as simple as working a debit/credit card.
