Agree 1000% But what will be done? There should be crypto best practices which the majority of coins, exchanges and wallets support in order to protect the crypto industry so it can grow from strength to strength. Having 30 bitcoins (and Ethereum Cash) will confuse the public.

Of course technically I can but it is not done with the forker attacking the original branch and trying to pretend it is the original branch through a confusingly similar name, rBTC, bitcoin.com, paid-for ads on rBitcoin... Fork away and improve! But choose a unique name and stand on your own feet.

I can't 3D print a Lambo, slightly modify it and call it a Lamborghini Rocket! This is not a joke, this is someone using rBTC,  paid ads on rBitcoin, PR to confuse the public, and attacking another coin with FUD to profit. Fork away and improve!
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:30:42
In the best interest of the whole crypto industry all coins should have unique names. Do we want a NEO Cash, Monero Cash etc? No, it will create even more confused users, cross-coin mudslinging and FUD headlines negatively influencing the whole industry, coins, exchanges, wallets etc. 
If you want to fork if you think you can improve a coin then fork away, just choose a unique name and logo.
Who can protect the industry from such attacks? Exchanges and wallets. 
They should adopt the practice of unique names even if the forker used a confusingly similar name to provide a safe space for innovation (non-hostile forking), and reduce FUD and attacks which seep into the public domain and pollute perception.

Yrs, of course, but it is worth the reduction in short term risk... and can constrict again when LN arrives...

Let's assume there was no communication between RV and the CEO of Coinbase. The CEO is not stupid and would have known that a difficulty adjustment the day after the futures euphoria and bitcoin being at an all time high and due for a correction would be good timing for RV to try his s again. And what does he do, he launches on that exact day. Either there was communication, or not, either way he knew and was irresponsible to be party to this.

Increase with variable block to give risk-free space to roll out LN, then decrease as much as you like... BTC is losing dominance by the week because of backlog.

Roger Ver is intentionally trying to push another coin past its current limit and current tech to try and promote the coin he invested in... this is not only dodgy but is criminal (as in court) I don't understand why these threads aren't more angry at the crap he is causing in the whole crypto space.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:08:52
Good point that a hard form increases risk, I don't know what technically is involved, and how risky it is. If successful it will also increase investor confidence and remove risk of a transaction backlog and high transaction fees... High transaction fees just opens the door for other coins to chip away at bitcoin, e.g. Steam not taking bitcoin as payment anymore and swapping to Litecoin... 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:24:59
Supporting a new coin and f'ing the coin he exited are two different things...  Also, I'm not getting the courts involved but orchestrating mass panic and causing ignorant public to flash sell so his coin can look better, is price manipulation, and pretty serious. This crap must stop otherwise some organisation will start investigating collusion and price manipulation, and those headlines will not be good for Crypto over the many weeks of the very public investigation "Bitcoin investor and Coinbase CEO investigated for manipulating Bitcoin's price"! After that who knows where that will lead but probably increased oversight. We don't want any of that so RV must stop this crap.

"As crypto becomes more mainstream, 11 - 14 million bitcoins in circulation is nothing for over 7 Billion population. I realize that less than 10% will use Bitcoin, but it can be integrated into IRA and other government programs which would mean that we can reach over 50% adoption. People will be holding Bitcoin in some form, whether it's as retirement investment or as an asset, but it will happen."

I can't start a company and call it"Google Cash"! People will be confused. If our goal is to hamper the adoption of crypto currencies in the world then this would be an easy way, on a wallet, on an exchange and in a shop. We all want crypto currencies to be widely adopted so the price would rise... yes?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:52:28
So Roger intentionally pushed PR on multiple channels "Bitcoin.com's co-founder sells all his bitcoin, says it is unuseable", causing panic and flash selling by unsuspecting public, then coludes with coinbase, pumps bitcoin, dumps on the diffeculty adjustment, thus stuff is not cool. I'm more than happy if Roger supports XYZcoin but don't f the whole industry to make your coin look better so you can make more money... nobody in crypto are pulling slimy moves like that, and this s must stop because it is harming the world's view of crypto.

Is there a page showing which wallets and exchanges have implemented segwit and which have not? Maybe such a page should be created on Wikipedia and pinned to the top for the rBitcoin page so we can speed up the adoption, i.e. directing people to rather use the ones who have implemented segwit...
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:49:29
August's decision was not to go ahead with a poorly implemented 2MB, it did not take 2MB off the table. Both increasing blocksize AND segwit was catered for by Satoshi Nakamoto in comments and code so Bitcoin is still in support of his long-term vision and doing it responsibly. But a 2MB block size with replay-protection now will remove the risk. Do you think Satoshi Nakamoto would approve of the scam maneuvers being pulled by Roger Ver? BCH's only reason why it exists is to make lots of money for the founders and insider trading scamsters. The proof of collusion is there all coming together on the same day: difficulty adjustment pump and dump, coinbase announcement, bitcoin.com CTO announcement. So we know BCH is run by scamsters, let's move on from there.

OK, seems like the majority would like an urgent block increase scaled up, which can scale down again when lightening takes off... How is this taken forward? I'm sure many people and whales will push significant funds if it is needed... What is the next step, for core to meet to discuss asap? If they want resources, just start a fund and the rest of us will support...

All exchanges should follow. Confusion is not good for the Crypto industry, especially with uneducated public increasingly involved. Imagine another 100 forks with "Bitcoin" as a prefix within 10 years, and non interchangeable. Want to fork, pick a unique name!
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:10:10
Does a block increase really require a hard fork? How was segwit then a softfork? Is there no way nodes can continue working if only 80% upgraded? If bigger blocks are needed for wide-LN adoption (as I read somewhere), why not upgrade the software now to cater for a small (or variable) block increase now as a softfork which will allow time for LN to be rolled out, and build in a mechanism to allow for a block decrease again if this is required in the future. Who cares if 20% of nodes still work with 1MB blocks as long as the majority of blocks mined support the larger blocks required right now to make btc useable again in the medium term. All nodes will eventually upgrade.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:37:38
Why do the core developers not introduce 2mb blocks in the short term until lightening is being used widely and then they have all of our permission to swap back to 1mb? Currently they are taking reckless risks with other people's money when there is a risk free solution that will keep them and us happy? Wide use of lightening is a year away but there is something they can do to take the risk off the table.

Misleading headline in my view... I have not read their report but GS would not plan to open a trading desk if they did not believe in crypto's future. They would also not plan to do it if there was no demand from their institutional customers... 
If they believe it will go down further, it does not mean they fon't believe it will not go much higher in the future... They basically said as much when they said they can't believe the media attention and interest that crypto is attracting... there is only upside in that statement.
The report was also written before this news:  
To me it seems parties are trying to paint a doom and gloom picture so the price could go down a bit more... but it is not going further, too much good news all over the place.

Much bigger news than an ETF. Apart from the easy buying and custody by brokers (which the Van Eck ETF would also have as I understand), this is the NY Stock exchange platform being used. Brokers trust both the trading AND custody. They don't trust Coindesk's or another Crypto-focused custody solution they've never heard of, no matter how good it is.
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:24:48
Bitcoin for the next x months until you know a lot more, then possibly use a small amount for altcoins (initially the trusted ones like ETH)  but when doing that only look at the ETHBTC chart, not the ETHUSD chart because you want to increase your BTC. Once you know a lot more you might want to exit to USD in long downturn. Alternatively just hodl BTC because it is very easy losing money trying to time the market. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:53:56
I'm not too sure big institutions will invest (pension funds etc) because of the high volatility, but bitcoin is becoming more popular by the day... Multiple people in my office in non-IT fields are interested in putting some money in. And for people there is no other coin but bitcoin. Personally, if acceptance is wide then I would definitely travel with lightening, much better than corporate VISA and Mastercard and cheaper for merchants too. As for institutional money, with certain building blocks in place now (futures and e.g. coinbase custody, we're just waiting for ETFs), then my theory is derivative financial products will be created, e.g. "stable bitcoin" where the returns are lower but risk much lower, e.g. buy an ETF and protect the downside with a future and package it to the more conservative section, or a company who creates a payment app and card using lightening but where the balance is protected from downside using futures...

People lose hard drives, passwords, dust on exchanges and in wallets, people forget, lose bits of paper, lose their phone, they uninstall, overwrite, or just don't bother with small amounts etc. When the public gets really involved then expect the rate of loss to also increase...

Lets say a miner needs to prove that it did CPU work for AWS, Google Compute, Azure and others... Your CPU work is spread amongst all the platforms who would like to buy CPU power, they each issue you with a certificate of how much work you have done. With these certificates you have a shot (somehow) at mining a block. Of course the current CPU power is keeping the network safe, but it can also be used for good.

One person is not going to make a difference, but imagine all POW blockchains swapped to POW that benefited humanity, then it will make the world a better place, and is that not a good aim?

Good point... You could always tax the miners properly where they are mining, and investors where they are living. I'm not against paying taxes because I am using resources in a country, but governments need to tax appropriately....

If BTC will be used globally as a store of value and widely as payment and could still x2, x10, x100 then people are investing now... Many people are predicting $20k in a year. The FOMO has started... It could go up $1k tomorrow and NEVER see these price levels again. What if the hype of the ETF takes us to the point of it being approved, it spikes again for 6 months on the back of that at which point LN has rolled out sufficiently which takes BTC to the public. You honestly could see $100k easy and you'll never see these price levels again...

Agreed... We should come up with a solution to enable government to collect taxes efficiently. But taxes need to be lower for income generated using crypto currencies investment than other types of income such as your 9-5 job... The reason is that it does not put any strain on a country's resources as e.g. driving to your office does. If a country does not lower tax rates for crypto-currencies, then people will avoid paying taxes...

True, nobody knew $20k was the top as we were approaching it but after going down to $18k and further, certain indicators like RSI showed that it was going further... Back then I was just holding, but it does not hurt to know the main indicators, and if they are all saying down the best to exit for a bit and buy again (I didn't but now know a bit more)

Too much positive news, sentiment and fomo to now go to despair... Generally the pundits and bigger holders were trying to shill the price as low as possible so they can buy in again, but as soon as the momentum changed they are buying in and changing their tune. Now the tune is positive to pump it as high as possible so they can sell at the next high or during the small  correction in the next few days. TA gives them an edge of probability to spot the low and the high. They were right about $20K being the top and they were right about $12K not being low enough. Worth learning as much TA as possible and combine it with other knowledge e.g. that the  adoption will increase with Lightening Networks so the price will rise tremendously, if that is the case, why sell at $7K if there is a small chance it will go 20% lower but there is huge probability it will go X3 in the medium term because of adoption...
