Haha, as the US current account deficit begins to close and US dollars become in shorter supply overseas (dollar FX reserves can almost only be accumulated through current account deficits), foreigners will be begging for more dollars. The world will shift to SDRs due to necessity from a lack of dollars, not a desire for something else.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:59:04


There is only 1.2T of physical dollars and yet there are $11T in the M2 money supply. The exact same thing can happen with bitcoin. Please read a basic article on the money multiplier.

Then why were so many dumb fucks sending them money? Haha.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:38:32




So? Dollars are finite as well. There are not an infinite amount of dollars, only the capacity to produce an infinite amount. 


Bitcoins can be produced and destroyed at will through fractional reserve banking. In fact, there is no limit on the creation, unlike dollars, because there is no required reserve ratio to be held by banking institution that would lend bitcoin.
There is nothing magical about a digital deflationary currency that prevents any of this.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:01:34
Nope. There's nothing to stop fractional reserve banking in bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-02-20 19:22:17
Fractional reserve banking increases the amount of money in existence. There may only be $1.2 trillion dollars with individual serial numbers on physical bills, but the M2 money supply is $11T. There is nothing to say that a similar thing wouldn't happen if bitcoin continues to exist.
People who say that the limit of bitcoins in circulation is 21MM simply have zero understanding of monetary systems.

Haha. This is completely counter to all history. You're living in a fantasy land. The banking system continually froze and destroyed depositor wealth before FDIC, federalized money, Fed, etc. No one ever learned because people are greedy and aren't very smart. People put their money in shitty banks all the time to chase yields. You're insane if you think anything has changed.

The dollar is a good store of value. You know why? Because if you're an American and you don't use it you go to prison. Try paying your taxes in Bitcoin if you dont believe me. That's a perpetual source of massive demand.
The US economy is incredibly strong and the US banking system is the safest it has ever been. Many large tech companies are significantly undervalued (Google for one).
You should effectively forget 2008 ever happened because it was a once in 75 year credit supercycle event and living in fear of it happening again will screw up your brain.
And a good laugh at Bitcoin people scared of wage gaps. Most of them are dreaming of being new age Rockefellers for the great societal contribition of buying btc/eth from the comfort of their computer chair.
Anyway if I thought the world was really going to shit I'd be buying farmland and prepper stuff and maybe gold, not digital entries that really on an incredibly robust infrastructure to function.

Yes a bit of inflation is the price you pay to use the global financial system that is tethered to the dollar. A conservative liquid asset allocation will beat out inflation generating real return on USD holdings over a cycle.
The federal reserve purchases debt it doesn’t sell it. And yes fractional reserve banking and treasury issuance is how we expand the monetary system to keep up with the economy. It’s a lot smarter than tying your economy to how fast you can dig up gold or a program some anonymous guy programmed and owns 10% of.
Many states have made very unwise promises to unions. There are hard decisions that need to be made but none of these are the end of the world.
The banking system is far more safe than it was a decade ago. And no I don’t think it’s unusual that the US had a recession and is no longer in a recession. It’s called the business/credit cycle. The US has been the largest economy for 100 years. It would be very unusual if a recession changed that. Private sector debt has fallen over the past ten years; don’t often hear the chicken littles talk about that. Public sector debt is private sector assets; it will probably be paid by the wealthy and be partially inflated away. Anyway, the Japanese enjoy very high HDI despite very large public debt load; it’s not disastrous for a developed country.
By most traditional metrics the US economy is very strong. Highest GDP in global history, low unemployment, good consumer confidence, 6+ straight years of growth. It’s unlikely you’d ever be satisfied with an economy if you can’t appreciate that.

The US economy and banking system are the strongest they've been in the history of the country. Capital ratios are very high at banks, GDP is at record highs, unemployment is very low, consumer confidence is high, American tech firms are the crown jewels of the world, US is producing record amounts of domestic energy. Those are the current trends. Illinois, New Jersey, and Kentucky will have to restructure their budgets, not the end of the world. Zero hedge has rotted your brain. You could see for yourself that the world is awesome right now if you'd leave the basement with an open mind. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:34:29
Wrong. Entitlements and welfare take up a larger % of GDP than ever before. Every year social security, Medicaid and Medicare swallow a larger percentage of the economy. This is a simple objective fact. That's a growing welfare state, and that's the reason why wages have stagnated. I already showed you mathematical proof.
When people can come to the US illegally, birth a citizen, then have the left say you can't deport them because it would break up a family, you have a de facto open border. I hope that is changing.

Under typology in that wiki there are 2 types of command economies, capitalism, and market socialism. Market socialism doesn't really occur in the real world outside of very rare minor occurrences (mondragon is one single company and socialists love talking about it). So, in the real world the two options are command economy run by power hungry vicious dictator who suppresses his people to prevent revolution as they are usually starving, or capitalism. 
How long you studied history? I suggest you open a book.

Yes, I'd prefer capitalism if I was Bangladeshi. The alternative would most likely be a strongarm dictator operating a basket case centrally planned economy with mass famine and labor camps.
The two alternatives in the real world are typically capitalism and Stalinism. Successful socialist movements almost always end up with Stalinism or with welfare state capitalism.

Man this whole thread is a hypothetical about if government wants to crackdown on bitcoin’s use. It’s impossible to give exact specifics on who they would target as it’s a hypothetical.
If you use the banking system you are traceable. If you meet in public to exchange, government can work to track you.
Why would people go through all that trouble and risk to use a digital ledger?
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:23:25
I think a global trustless ledger could have cool applications for creating efficiencies in the financial sysyem. I've yet to see any interesting real world applications, but I don't spend all my time searching for them. Lastly, bitcoin's poor transaction speed leads me to believe it'll be another coin that will carry these applications.
I'm not offended by people using it for illegal purposes. I'm amazed by people's stupidity that they think a police state wont have any problem with them attempting to circumvent taxation and other criminal statutes. That type of arrogance lands people in jail.

My conclusion was that governments could prevent large international Bitcoin transactions between legal banks/corporations if they wanted to, which would only leave immaterial small transactions.

Well it's actually larger than the entire world's M2 money supply. So not only would bitcoin have to completely replace all other currency (pretty much impossible as taxes must be paid in local currency and government spending is in local currency, and the central bank operates in local currency), but the world economy would also have to expand significantly. I mean US monetary base is only $3T and the US is the largest economy in the world. I think that's really far-fetched, and certainly impossible in the medium-term. The only way it shoots that high is if 80% of the coins are on the sideline (satoshis coins) which I would dump on the marketplace if I were him at that point.


Well I'd certainly want my early adopters to believe that I was in it to expand tech and improve the world rather than make myself a billion dollars (what has seemed to happen). I certainly don't know either way, but I have to think of it as a large risk.


As said earlier US monetary base is $3trillion. Under your projection, btc would be more valuable than the aggregate USD stock in 2 or 3 years. My specialty isn't macro/int'l trade but this seems inconceivable to me. 
As a shitty comparison, there are companies that go from zero to $10B in a few years, there are none that have gone from $10B to $10T in a few years. The inertia in the system just wouldn't allow that much wealth to flow into btc that fast. Law of large numbers and all.

But this only works as long as these miners are well funded and bitcoin does go up in the near-medium term. This is similar to how dot-com firms operated in 99-00. I understand your point though, and that is interesting that mining gets easier if there is less competition.


Doesn't this just make switching to another protocol that's more evenly distributed more attractive, thus hurting value of btc? Furthermore, I find it's extremely risky to invest a large sum of money in a commodity where we depend at all on a anonymous billionaire to be altruistic. This is one of the key risks I am trying to better understand that isn't discussed enough. If a handful of people own 70% of btc, they certainly have the power to manipulate it at will. If "we" have the chance to start from scratch here, why create almost the same problems we have now. It seems a btc economy would be the most stratified division of wealth in human history. If the population were to fully realize this, I believe it could crimp demand and value materially.


I think that's crazy. It certainly could never support a valuation like that (maybe someone cashes out, but the vast majority of late buyers have all wealth eviscerated). If we multiply that by the supply (22MM), and then again by 5 as btc will certainly develop into a fractional reserve banking system if it grows, you get to $110T worth, which is 10 times the US M2 monetary supply. That doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. 
A best case fundamental valuation to me seems to be around $50k unless the satoshi coins are never used (which is improbable).


Having very little real use hurts the fundamental value, it doesn't increase it. I think the fundamental value today is lower, but if startups continue to grow the economy, value could accelerate.

Yeah I was a dick. Sorry, I had surgery Tuesday, and I'm a little out of it.
My issue is, I come to the bitcoin subreddit to learn more about the risks. The positives and potential rewards are very obvious and discussed ad nauseam. I want to learn about how it can blow up, not take hold, or something else that would prove it unusable. It seems like no one here wants to talk about that. I'd probably buy more if I could fully understand all the risks, but people seem to just be fanboys here. At this point I have a small position because the potential payoff is high, but I don't feel comfortable that I understand the probability with that payoff.
I'm an analyst at a hedge fund. Most of the people in my industry simply brush it off without learning about it, so I don't think they understand the real risks either.

Hahah. You buttcoin tin foil hatters have truly lost your minds.

Do you mean the US federal government has more outstanding debt per capita than the Greek government does? Are you talking about non-financial private sector debt loads? Do you understand the difference between productivity in US and Greece? Have you looked at US financial and non-financial asset holdings compared to Greece?
Do you understand how meaningless your comments is?
I'm sure you thought hyperinflation was coming in 2010. Still not here huh? Must be just around the corner right?

What do you mean? They just write a law. The legislature has complete power over regulation of interstate commerce. This is very simple.


Banning acceptance by merchants and financial institutions would be the easiest way to prevent it from taking hold in a country. The US has banned gold ownership before.

They make a law banning merchant acceptance. Pretty simple.

Oh shit. Some litigious frat bros with no real accomplishments and no expertise put their money into something. Better follow them blindly and put them on a pedestal as a wise arbiter of value.

So you're saying the bear case scenario is 10% of global b2c e-commerce shifting to btc? That's an incredibly bullish scenario.

If you envision yourself as "a visionary and a saint" for throwing a couple bucks at a speculative investment (you did nothing to create it, and you'd be a massive multimillionaire already if you were actually an early adopter), I think you need to get over yourself, not the other way around. This is the most delusional thing I've seen on this insanely delusional message board. I mean you may have some sort of paranoid schizophrenia if you believe this.


No, the first hundred thousand or million people involved would not be known as saints. Maybe the creator. 
I had an internet connection in the '80s, bow down to me peon!!!!

His desires don't change the reality on the ground. As long as governments exist, state currencies will be needed. You must pay taxes in USD, government spending is in USD, fed reserve member banks must use USD. This is what gives USD value, not misplaced trust in the currency.


I'm saying it would be worth more than the USD monetary base, not US equity market cap.
I love your excitement about the future. I hope that we see real changes in the world as fast as you imagine. We certainly need some big ones.

You need to seek professional help for your mental disorder.

You're a retard because you're a fanboy of your own investment, rooting it on, and prescribing defenses for your baby. Nothing is dumber than that. I've simply evaluated things rationally.

Great response. Thanks for some of your thoughts.


Yes. It's very interesting to me that many proponents are rabid anti-big gov types but at the same time believe that the gov will not interfere. I don't feel I can properly evaluate this probability but it makes little sense to me that the powerful country governments and financial institutions would allow btc to become a mainstream method of financial transaction. Further, If there were something to happen such as a terrorist funded by btc, then all hell would break loose. The government needs little rational reason to attack something (see Iraq).


I don't believe this ensures high prices though. I would think the miners are price takers not price makers, just like anyone else right? What it really allows for is miners to go bankrupt if prices fall below their mining cost thus hurting the hash rate and btc's usefulness (the comp sci portion of this is outside of my expertise)?
For example, nickel metal is currently selling above the cash costs of many miners. The miners are not price makers though, so many are shutting down, as they don't have pricing power.
A blog post from a mathematician I read discussed several of the largest wallets. It made the point that maybe 70% of BTC are owned by just a handful of people. Have you heard anything about this? To me that would materially alter the stability of btc to the downside.

LOL, they don't need "reasons" to do anything. But, they can come up with any number of reasons to explain the regs to the populace. It supports terrorism and drug dealers. Done.


I think you completely underestimate the power of the federal government.
