Can we make a script that starts a new store exactly like the old one if the old one gets shut down. Then host the script on some anon vps. Is this possible?
@_date: 2016-04-05 23:43:42
I know and I find it funny.
@_date: 2016-04-05 21:08:01
that's neat, but I was talking about selling illicit stuff on clearnet. I mean, they can take down the store page. But there would be no point in tracing the store host. Even if it gets shut down, you can just start another store, with the same instance. Right?
I already saw a reddit post about someone selling weed on OpenBazaar.

Don't care, I'm self proclaimed dumbest guy on bitcoin. I know nothing about anything. I'm even dumb enough to be a bagholder of several shitcoins. Auroracoin is not one of them, however it has better potential than the shit I'm invested in. I'm currently heavy on diamonds. I stake them on my raspberry pi running rokos os. 
The human mind cannot comprehend the value of scarcity, yet. However don't listen to me, I don't give any financial advice. I don't have the proper training nor experience.

I understand that he did a bit of everything over there, but what was his main reason for being there?
@_date: 2015-12-14 14:34:31
that's what they all say.
@_date: 2016-01-14 00:21:43
this is so true, most people are ignorant, but even mentioning bitcoin to them will start the process.
@_date: 2016-03-20 03:29:36
So that means we could receieve stock to our bitcoin addresses? 
I mean wouldn't it be safer that way?

You're thinking that the fee would jump up from 5 cents to ???
This halving I can't see the fees going higher than 10 cents.
If you think realistically, in the future all blocks would be full regardless of lightning network or not.
Why would you think that the demand for a digital currency would ease off? I mean we've gotten this far, am I right?
@_date: 2016-03-30 16:21:32
Most places you'll never roi. Invest in some casinos bankroll or just buy coins.
@_date: 2016-03-24 15:14:08
You'd need to pay more fees for miners in that case. Current 5cent fees may get doubled or tripled. But that in no way breaks the network itself. Until we have Lightning Network we just have to deal with it.

Starting a pool isn't really that easy, we'd need some major hashing power or run under p2pool.
Mining isn't a business that you'd want to get into anyway, unless you have cheap power of course. There are way better activities within crypto to get yourself involved.

I heard that they had their encrypted database stolen and one poor guy lost at least a million dollars, because his password was only three letters. I wouldn't trust blockchain.info for holding any amount bigger than .5 btc.
@_date: 2016-03-24 20:44:14
Bitcoin as of now, at 6.4billion dollars is truly tiny compared to golds and other currencies market cap. The increased volatility comes from not finding the right price. 
In the longer run the price doesn't even matter. It's the usefulness of the network itself.
@_date: 2016-01-09 05:28:40
I didn't use that one just because the bad luck it may have.
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:00:50
Bitcoin isn't as well. Core client 0.12.0, technically still in beta.

I love some of the designs, but shipping would have cost me half the price of a shirt. I'll pass this time, but really cool designs.

Don't get me wrong, I have all my savings in bitcoin. However I need more time to collect them juicy coins.
@_date: 2015-11-01 14:05:08
how would they know if I'm owning bitcoin or not. What if the police finds a qr-code hidden in my wallet. Will I be arrested?
/Can someone make a tutorial on how to stop people from reaching your brain wallet. Would appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-11-01 13:15:30
shh... let them sleep a litte longer. Not so loud
@_date: 2015-11-01 13:53:12
but they are getting owned by sergei every time the fed issues a new bond. Don't worry the taxpayers of the future will cover it, it's literally the safest investment in your life. Yeah, I should sell all of my bitcoins to buy dem dolla dolla bills. But in all seriousness this shit is the biggest ponzi of our lifetime.
/feel the hate flow trough you.

I don't think so. SubWay is a franchise company, so smaller local companies are actually managing the restaurants and call them SubWay. If that made sense.
