We're going to provide an excellent Open Source tool using the latest web technologies (meteor, coffeescript, jade, sass, etc). Our goal is to build a dashboard to list all your public addresses, and see the number of coins and their value in any real currency. In addition to make a useless tool, we'll work on making it fun with various gamification elements, and possibilities for new features will be vast. We'll do an Indiegogo campaign after our minimal viable product to work on scaling the app!

not sure to understand :). But being mainly a python developer, I'll have a bit of a learning curve to switch to javascript in backend code, and this project is the perfect opportunity for me to learn and consolidate those skills. We'll start building a simple but useful project, and then we'll do crowd-sourcing to raise funds and start scaling and adding more features :)
