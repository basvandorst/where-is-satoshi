nope. I recognize a need for P2Pools, but i don't know much about the specifics behind them
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:01:33
blockchain.info just switched to mBTC...
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:48:09
yea, i don't know anything. Just pointing out the need
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:26:37
I think all of us miners should mine P2P. But P2Pool is not user friendly. Not as easy as bitminter or guiminer. Not even as easy as cgminer/bfgminer.    
It needs to be the easiest option, imho. plus merged mining.
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:39:04
Right! It's too complicated. We need a simple simple way to mine P2P
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:19:26
that is so elitist and condescending. You do know that most of the people who appreciate the importance of Bitcoin aren't 1337 haxxors, right? And it's going to get "worse" as adoption occurs. Help us

this aggression will not stand, man.    
cheer up

You, Sir, are an Idiot. Or you don't speak English, in which case I apologize. Or you are 12, and you need to grow a pair and get laid.

I am a Miner. I'm also a Bitcoin enthusiast and a HLODer. We should all be worried about centralized mining dude
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:12:23
aim for the LCD.    
make it simple, stupid.    
Fortunately many...uninformed...people have bought ASICs hoping to get rich. It means that the network hashes are actually pretty well distributed. We need to educate *them*, and make P2P mining the easiest option on any platform

Off topic, but i have another potential future envisioned, where individual miners are optional, and pools can rule.    
If cryptocurrency succeeds *all the way*, global society will change. Governing will change. Civilization will change!    
Cryptocurrency, maybe Bitcoin, could be the key to a peaceful world.    
How?    
Ok, specifically, what would this new system look like? At some stage, mining will be dominated by enormous private pools operated by governments/social groups/religous groups, on behalf of their citizenry/neighbors/fellow-believers.    
There will be an incentive, between these groups, between these pools, for balance and distribultion.    
    
Pool size will become relatively static (depending on group membership). Taxes will be a thing of the past, because the transaction fees will be collected by the pool.        
_P2P cryptocurrency pools will replace governments_.    
      
When the block rewards end and are replaced by transaction fees ... that will be an Epic time.    
Banks will be historic oddities.    
All wealth will be represented in the block chain.
There will be an *enormous* incentive to make the internet indestructible, to make data storage permanent, and to make electricity cheap.    Satoshi is like the hivemind's attempt at progress and survival, i think.    
who knows if survival is optimal. I only see suffering here
    
    
    
edit: I have actually put a lot of thought into this, but I'm drunk now :) I will post a proper submission to r/bitcoin eventually
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:52:53
i agree completely- massively important. and i would support too, with btc since i can't code ;p
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:50:58
I would be willing to put a couple btc up as a bounty. If the rest of us did then there would be incentive for developers
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:08:13
I'm the OP and thanks for your info.    
I think that the majority of miners are individuals, with small h/s. Together, I think these miners, "us", are more than 50% of the network.    
There are a lot of us. We are not all brainiacs with degrees in rocket surgery. We need a SIMPLE way to mine P2P, and we need to earn as much as we would on a large pool (so we need merged mining). grok?
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:07:28
also, i just checked out your posting history. You're a stand up dude. I think the other largest problem with bitcoin is that many people who are less technically competent than you are can still appreciate its beauty.    
Then they buy some, and the btc are stolen. It's not good.    
The two major problems with bitcoin are private centralized pools, and the  barrier of entry. I even see relatively informed individuals doing stupid things to compromise their coins.   
The community shouls *also* come up with an easy, idiot-proof, way of owning and using bitcoins. But maybe then we're back to big banking eventually :(

P2P means decentralized, peer-to-peer, like napster. Currently, the large mining pools are *centralized*, which goes completely against the potential of bitcoin/blockchain.    
There is a P2P mining option called P2Pool. However, it is *not* user friendly.    
I think the bitcoin network needs a P2P mining option that is easy, one that eventually eclipses private pools.
