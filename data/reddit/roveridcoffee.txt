You fork a snapshot from before, when the balances were not all purchased by this actor. Or you can still fork the code only and restart everything from zero (like you suggest). Point is: even if it gets all bought up you can still restart. The tech cannot die.

The usd is "stable" until people realize that the supply is infinite and out of control and hence it is essentially worthless; and anyway it's just the less worse in a land of bads. 
Bitcoin has a finite supply instead. 
Remember that your bank decides whether you can or not execute that wire priced 40 dollars you mentioned, it is not you deciding it; and yes, banks do refuse to execute transactions irrationally, probably not if the wires are within a nation, but when they are international wires they do.
With bitcoin, as long as they are your keys and you run your node, you are the bank, you decide, you make the transaction and no one can stop you.

If only the wallet providers themselves had better support on this topic it would be great. I mean that for instance the only way to generate / use a segwit native address with a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor, for instance, is to do so via electrum (their ledger live or trezor.io wallets, which I assume it's where most new comers go to generate their wallets, still do not support...).

Interesting comment. While I disagree with you that 20k a coin will not be seen any longer, on the pure mathematical basis that something finite multiplied by something infinite gives infinite, I do agree with you that the money supply of bitcoin gets diluted. But it has been diluted for years now, and the dilution is called altcoins. The thing is: if fiat dilutes faster than bitcoin/crypto and their attached etfs eventually we'll see 20k again.

Thanks for this reply.
It might be that you used a "Chinese WeChatpay" which is the most developed one on that platform (WeChat being Chinese owned).
I can share my experience: I used a "Hong Kong WeChatpay" and tried to pay in China and it was a no go. I tried to use "Hong Kong Alipay" in Thailand and it did not work as well. I managed to successfully use both WeChatpay and Alipay within Hong Kong most of the times (like at McDonald's) but sometimes even there not accepted (like at seven eleven they bounce it and ask to pay in other methods).
As such the result was that I did not use these services anymore since showing up at the cashier and waiting for your transaction to be denied is not a good feeling.

So basically people accept USD (or change it to whatever currency you like) because you can pay taxes in that currency? And that is justifying it just nicely to you? That's the reason we accept fiat?
People are accepting USD because they are so used to it that it is natural to them, they saw their parents accepting it when they were kids, but never really thought about what USD really is; that is the reason, not that you can pay taxes with it...

Even assuming that your observation on price stability is true (and it's not, because inflation is there and its real, it may just be that your local shop has not inflated yet), you should care about the overprinting of money supply, because if you are not getting any piece of the pie, somebody is eating your pie.

My pockets are not that deep, really. But what about transferring, say, 2000 USD in one go to the exchanger (instead of multiple 100 USD for instance), then leave them there, once the LTC is spent you replace only the amount you spent? Like that it's not too expensive and yes, it helps adoption.

It did do something in three months. It depreciated! 
@_date: 2018-12-03 11:33:59
I think that accepting bitcoin as a payment option, with or without middleman / payment processor should be applauded even if the merchant that accepts the payment chooses to liquidate all the received in fiat. This because of the following reasons:
1: if a business has expenses to pay against its sales, it very likely needs to pay them denominated in fiat, not btc. So it is normal to convert. Still we should appreciate the effort to accept a currency which at today is very volatile.
2: larger businesses delegate clerical staff to handle their receipts and payments. You cannot expect a director of a large corporation to look after each and every bitcoin wallet him/herself, approve each and every btc transaction him/herself. As such the instruction to immediately convert btc into fiat and have the fiat funds sent to a more traditional money handling tool (ie: bank account) limits the fraud/embezzlement of funds risk. Once the custodian services will be more evolved and allow delegation of power etc I believe that more businesses will look at accepting and keeping btc, instead of accepting and selling only.

@_date: 2018-12-19 12:31:08
Yes. How I interpret it is that the amount of the coin you mine times the unit value in GBP at the time you mine (presumably price sourced from popular websites such as CMC) minus the expenses incurred in mining equal the taxable amount. Trouble here arises if coin of the price drops subsequently (since the value of the coin at the time it's mined still applies, not the lower one). If conversely a coin appreciates the tax on the delta is not taxed at the time of mining, rather at the time the coin mined is sold for cash.
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:11:53
It's included in the gross income, from which you deduct the expenses. Nothing wrong with it.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:23:51
If without the said overhead you get to the same result then you should avoid overhead because that's just waste. But if overhead leads you to a product with better quality then you can spend for the overhead and market your product as a better value product, which is quite the contrary of how you put it. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:12:38

Alipay, WeChatpay, Linepay and so on and so forth have these drawbacks:
1 - contrary to cryptocurrency, you still entrust your money to someone. In the past it was the banks, which at least were regulated by some rules; these companies taking deposits, instead, you don't even know if they are regulated or not. To be fair I do believe they are regulated, but as "deposit taking companies" which is supposed to be a watered down version of the full license that banks need to have in place to operate.
2 - they cannot cross borders. Alipay is in Japan and in China, but a "Japanese Alipay" cannot pay a "Chinese Alipay", they all work in their own little environment and don't work globally.
As such, as they are today, I don't see any particular advantage in using these networks; at that point I prefer using PayPal or Stripe to connect to the Visa and MasterCard networks which are truly international networks (but expensive)
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:38:31
I think it's just fair to say that the price on average is a reflection of adoption. If the only adopters are speculators then massive increase in price will eventually crash. If the adopters are users and spend it and move it, then the increase in value is real and stays. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:31:44
Yes but one (Enron) went to zero / ceased to exist because the company ceased to exist. Bitcoin does not cease to exist since it's not tied up to any company, any individual etc. Bitcoin will never go to zero because there is always somebody that wants it, always someone that mines it. It can go to zero point something if you wish. If that really happens I will have been for long time a crypto whale. Looking for that day, but I believe it will never happen.

I think he means the various fees involved in transferring fiat from own bank account to the exchanger and then fees in converting the fiat to crypto for replacing the spent amount plus the fee if transaction itself (which the minor part). Thing is: if I use crypto then I help the ecosystem and I improve the critical mass effect, so I am happy to bear the extra fees I incur in sourcing btc if I am helping the awareness grow.

They would allow you to wire that amount of money only if:
1. You were a bank or a financial institution.
2. You were a CEO / CFO of a fortune 500 company.
Otherwise forget it, they wouldn't wire that money for you.
On top, assuming you were a fortune 500, they would ask you what is for and when it would come back into the country if the wire was an international one.

At any due time this value varies also. Say that you are very hungry, you see an apple and you are willing to pay 2 dollars for it to satisfy your hunger. But in a situation where you just had lunch, the value of an extra apple tends to zero (you don't need it, you don't buy it)

Well, for once we don't know if Nakamoto has a mining farm, we don't even know who he/she/they is/are/were.
As second, the mining farms are owned by new rich if you want to call them that way, not old school entrepreneurs; people behind companies like bitmain and bitfury are new entrepreneurs, they made themselves believing in bitcoin. The same bitcoin that everyone wanted in 2017 and that everyone declares dead now (and that by the way is still hoarded by whales that now everyone calls crazy bagholders and that everyone will celebrate like heroes during the next bull run).
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:42:31
Effectively yes, but a better comparison is just like in business you are free to use and accept any free, unrestricted currency, you don't have to use USD. For instance in Hong Kong and Singapore banks offer multicurrency accounts so that if you receive EUR they keep EUR for you, JPY has got its own ledger, etc. BTC will be the same. It's not that hard to believe and it's not too hard to achieve now with the current level of awareness.

By tax I mean withholding tax, which is a tax introduced to avoid big corporations from moving profits overseas to tax heavens, but sees normal business having genuine need to move money internationally taxed.

Well, we all admit that btc is volatile, so getting paid in btc is really not for everyone at this stage. Plus employees also need to use their money and this means that shops need to accept it, etc.
For the second point, I don't really mean accounting (that can be done in any (crypto)currency) ; I mean that for larger companies there need to be ways to delegate payments down to others; sure there are multisignature wallets that more or less achieve the same purpose as giving preparer/approver rights as banks do, even if it is not exactly the same thing.

Wealth is created, but sound money (ie: money which cannot be easily rendered worthless by excessively increasing its supply) is what allows you to keep on creating wealth not only now but also in the foreseeable future.
Hoarding, as you call it, or saving, as I call it, is just forgiving present consumption in exchange of future consumption. But saving is possible to do only if the money used is sound (gold, bitcoin), and not when money is unsound (fiat, being continuously, excessively debased).

1 - yes they are free, but are you seriously getting cheap on the security of something with such a potential?
2 - if your piece of electronics fail you just import your seed in a non hardware wallet. Simple failsafe. 
3 - yes with an HW wallet you need to keep your seed (which is all that counts really)... And with the paperwallet, if you're referring to the ones available on websites, you still need to keep your private key. Safe-keeping a seed is easier than safekeeping a priv key imo.

"what wallet has the lowest fees" is a sentence that reveals you're somewhat confused. Wallets don't charge fees. Exchangers do.
Anyway, good that you already studied enough to know about the existence of wallets.
If I understood your buying strategy well, and assuming you're in / from Europe :
1 - get verified at Kraken.com
2 - wire your recurrent 100 there
3 - buy btc
4 - get an hardware wallet (trezor, ledger, ...)
5 - transfer btc to an address generated by using your hardware wallet.
Now, if you transfer every single time you buy btc you'll end up paying quite a lot of fees charged by the exchanger. So probably you can transfer out once every 3 months or something like that...

You say that you would like that if you die your family access it. No way with your current configuration (ie: splitting the seed in two and hiding half of it) . The best chance if you want some no coiners to pick up where you left is to put the full seed in one piece of paper and write some clear instructions to go along with. This is especially true if your investment in crypto is relatively small (say up to a couple of btc). If you had more than that I don't think you'd ask this opinion on reddit.

Ok, so we're going down, that is? Every last time this has been posted that has happened... Ok I guess, I keep on accumulating.
@_date: 2019-03-30 05:11:48
I for once will certainly pay with crypto. I have hot wallets with small sums at the ready just to be able to do these sort of payments, when I have the chance.
@_date: 2019-03-25 05:45:50
Soon (if not already, I need to check) inflation of bitcoin will be less than that of gold. And anyways gold and silver can be forcibly confiscated a lot easier than bitcoin, and cannot move around internationally as freely as bitcoin.

Keep at it guys, I did little by little too, same here.

It may take time to get there, buy I have a feeling that next bull will be a memorable one. So many smart people working on infrastructure, solutions, improvements. Next time the bull shows the value proposition of Bitcoin will be so clear, so apparent, that every average Joe will understand, and this time, unlike 2017, we will have a lot of people boarding but not leaving.

There is few people selling on the streets in that scenario I'd assume, in the first place. And so you need Bitcoin to buy from elsewhere.

This is the best answer. The payment can be in bitcoin or fiat, does not matter. Just get the w-8ben done and then you can pay him.

I suggest you study some economics. You can start by: what makes hard money, gold standard, stock to flow ratio.
@_date: 2018-10-28 07:00:37
No, not exactly, because a ponzi scheme works on the promise of future financial returns, generally unsustainable ones. Bitcoin does not promise any return. The investment rationale of bitcoin revolves around the fact that it is a free-er form of money where you have no intermediaries, and this money is still relatively less adopted than other monies, therefore having space for growing and appreciating. 
The fact that the whales may or may not have decided to hold off sales for the latter part of 2017 and therefore act like a cartel, pumping the price may be true or not, but it is not unlike other things like the stock market, that also go through cycles of investment frenzy followed by downturn.

Wow. I certainly hope to pay in crypto next time I am there.

If I run the sha-256 algorithm on anything, say the name of a person, is the result a valid bitcoin private key? I understand it is not safe and I already say I am not going to do it, because it is not random and people can guess it, but I just wonder it it would be a valid key. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 13:41:35
Yes, that is understood. Just wondering if encrypting really anything leads to something usable on, for the bitcoin network. For instance encrypting "abc" with sha256 gives result "BA7816BF8F01CFEA414140DE5DAE2223B00361A396177A9CB410FF61F20015AD". (source:  Is that a valid private key?

I agree, it's dumb: comparing the 10 year dollar price increase of gold, the historical form of money that has established and proven itself over millenia, to a nascent technology is dumb. With that I DON'T mean to say that Bitcoin is bad. 
They are at different monetization stages in their evolution (or, if you want to simplify, they have different market caps, and they started from different market caps 10 years ago).
Does that explain enough?

If the system we know keeps standing I don't see why Bitcoin would change anything regarding taxes one pays in the country where he lives.
The only way for Bitcoin to change things on taxes is that the system gets substituted by a new system, and this latter is more peer to peer and not an oligarchy

Well there are cold wallets and those ones you don't need to carry with you all the time. I usually keep 90% in there.

The point is that sell for what? USD? An hyperinflationary currency? No thanks.
For some valuable assets (apartment, education of children, etc)... May be... but at that point it's stop hodling by using it (and even then, I'd probably just use and replace).
So, yes, you're right, I'll never stop hodling basically.

If you have enough money to buy a full bitcoin, then I am sure you can use USD instead and open an account in a international, respected outlet (Kraken, Bitstamp). And by the way, if you want to trade high amounts then hook up with the guys of Genesis Block (Wan Chai)

That's nice but that's 2015 to my understanding. It would be nice to have it updated. Back then Bitcoin was 500 USD  a coin roughly, so today that would mean 7 squares instead  of one. Total crypto would be  several squares. Still small all considered, but  bigger than that. The chart also screams buy silver actually, hence I will look into that next.
@_date: 2019-02-15 00:06:46
Absolutely. I feel much better with storing Bitcoin for future use rather than seeing a number that they tell me I can unlock when I am 65... (When I'm 65 the purchasing power of that amount will be so small anyway, if things continue down the current  path)

In other words, because LN depends on nodes, some nodes become very large and vital to the ecosystem, and they get shut down by central authorities? That's a possibility, that's why people should be connected to more than one node if possible, but I am not a LN expert.

To anyone that says you should have run or similar: Bitcoin changes nothing on the moral that people should have in everyday life. Good morals and ethics should be in people regardless of bitcoin. The people that say you should not have given it back are not better than the currency debasing governments we're saying no to by using bitcoin.

I wanted to leave this here since a while ago I had an interesting discussion on Reddit on WeChat pay vs Bitcoin. I cannot find the discussion anymore unfortunately.

Gemini will charge you a withdrawal fee, yes. Every exchange does AFAIK, and that's normal.
If you don't want to buy an hardware wallet, which I strongly advise since they are simple to use, then I would do this if I were you:
1 - install a wallet on an old smartphone. (eg: coinomi) 
2 - airgap the smartphone (that is: this phone will never be connected to the Internet again)
3 - create the seed for your wallet, write it down on safe places (I use pen and paper) LOSE THIS AND LOSE YOUR COIN
4 - use the wallet on the airgapped phone to create an address, send your coin there.
5 - end. Do not connect the airgapped device back to the Internet, ever. You did the same thing as the paperwallet websites do, only that in this way you have a seed instead of a private key (ie: easier to handle for a human being... And you don't need to print...)
When you want to use / spend your coin
6 - import your seed in a wallet.

I only keep a small percentage there, about 10% of my total holdings. The fiat valuation of it is not a factor (ie: now it's worth much more than at the beginning of the year, but I have not taken out funds from my hot wallet to my hardware wallets just because the USD equivalent went up).
Yes, I try to use funds out of my hot wallet as much as I can to pay accepting vendors. Most of the times I replenish my funds after spending so that it's always about 10% of the holdings.

Let me rephrase: Bitcoin has definitely taught me NOT to keep more than a couple of months worth of expenses in fiat terms (any fiat denomination). Any excess liquidity goes into repaying the mortgage ahead of time, gold, silver, bitcoin... Basically anything other than keeping it there idle on the bank ledger.

@_date: 2019-02-16 13:55:51
Well yes, the bug or a fatal flaw we are still unaware. Not being a super technical person means I haven't wrapped my head around how ln works in details. I understand the base layer of bitcoin reasonably well, but the LN "smart contract" not yet. I just tested it and it's crazy fast so people love it for that...
@_date: 2019-02-25 04:57:56
That's a good effort overall: lately there are a lot of articles on this subject, mostly done by people who are into Austrian Economics. Your piece does not seem inspired by the Austrian Economics theory though.
The history of money part is a little long worded, and I feel like the store of value property of money is presented sort of like  "in addition to unit of exchange, money is also store of value", while, at least in my opinion, it does make sense that store of value comes first (ie: it would not make sense for people to trade a commodity which is not considered valuable in the first place).
@_date: 2019-02-02 07:14:41
@_date: 2019-02-11 12:05:43
Yes, Bitcoin is just a way to get the payment through, it does not change the fact that a justification of such payment need to be provided in accounting if the entity accepting the payment is a company. Still: with centralized payment processors the transaction simply does not go through; the issue of justifying the payment does not arise. With Bitcoin the payment goes through, and the issue of justifying the payment arises.
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:36:24
Stability is relative. 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin. When prices are expressed in bitcoin the price is perfectly stable (this is called being a unit of account). 
Then if you express the value in terms of another commodity, say the USD, which happens to be a commodity not scarce, infinitely printed by about 20 people's decision (but you and I ain't one of them), the price may fluctuate.
The more people own bitcoin, or fractions of it, the more stable it will be since the more unlikely it will be that a large chunk of holders will decide to dump it all at once.
The stability of bitcoin will be better than the USD stability, since bitcoin stability will be dictated by the free market, while USD keeps on being an artificially controlled stability that eventually pops (ie: bubble)
@_date: 2019-02-19 03:05:13
I could interpret your query in many ways. My understanding of what you're asking, if I put it in other words, is "why can't businesses just accept Bitcoin using a normal wallet (eg: electrum, mycelium,...) But instead they always end up resorting to solutions like coinbase commerce or bitpay?"
So the answer to that is:
1 - they can certainly do that (ie: accepting Bitcoin via a standard wallet); and
2 - it's very convenient to do that if you are a small business where you work on your own; however
3 - in larger businesses the payments are handled by salaried employees. In these cases you don't really want them to know the private keys, while you still want them to be able to accept payments from customers; and so
4 - you have solutions like coinbase commerce where few people can know the private keys, but a lot more can actually use the platform to bill clients and allow the company to get paid.
There are actually other advantages, like for instance accepting a wide variety of altcoins but settling in bitcoin.

Etoro does not let you withdraw, and hence use, your bitcoin. So that's really a bad place to start with.
On top the spread is often horrendous and their withdrawal fees 25 usd per withdrawal. (withdrawal intended as fiat withdrawal since, as stated, crypto is not withdrawable)

No, absolutely not. If phone dies your bitcoin is safe. You just have to take care of your seed. 
Bitcoin exist only on the blockchain, a copy of which is kept by the running full nodes of the moment.
The seed is the key to unlock your bitcoin and you can map your key onto any device you have at the moment capable of running software (computers, phones, etc)

@_date: 2019-12-01 11:46:10
There is nothing that has got "intrinsic value". Value is subjective. There are commodities that are used as money that (usually, subjectively) have value derived from alternative uses. But if these commodities were to be used exclusively as this other use (in other words: lose their monetary status) their valuation would be way lower than what it is today.

No mining. Buy btc, take it off the exchange and into cold storage.
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:27:29
Bitcoin was not made for profiting. It's not like buying stock. It's like buying another foreign currency, only that this foreign currency is still under utilized and is monetising little by little. And this particular currency has fixed, predictable supply. Hence a normal currency, say USD, who instead is with unlimited, unpredictable supply, doesn't stand a chance against bitcoin in the long run.
You're right, too many schemes out there. So if you don't understand the other cryptos, stick to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-18 13:29:36

Buying bitcoin on the phone or computer is pretty much the same; for better security, use 2fa! All exchanges encourage you to use 2fa authentication and you should use that.
Coinbase is ok if you just started. Basically stick to exchanges with history and with real volumes: Kraken, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Gemini... 
After becoming more familiar with crypto in general, learn to use a wallet and learn to hold your private keys.

Go to a bitcoin atm, buy, get your fraction of BTC "credited" to a reputable wallet (mycelium, samurai for instance) and then learn from there.
@_date: 2019-12-07 02:47:33
You got it OK, yes. My comments:
1 - you can trace back your coins to your identy only if you sell it back for fiat. If you stick to bitcoin and pay with bitcoin for goods or services then you can be more anonymous. Clearly the seller, depending on the jurisdiction he is located at and the size of the transaction may still need to identify you for his compliance, not yours. 
2 - an address does not belong to a device. Rather that device just helped you to create that address and you can recover that address onto any other wallet service that support the same derivation path (eg: you use trezor to generate it and use mycelium to spend it).
A consequence of this is that no, Coinbase does not know what device or wallet you used to generate the address, but it doesn't matter anyway.

No it doesn't.

I think he's American so sepa probably would not cut for him... But yeah, the equivalent of sepa in the US is the solution. Meaning just do a bank transfer into Coinbase, then exchange, instead of buying with card?

Loool. So true. ALL of them who bought in November last year they are all out of this by now... Kinda sad, but I did tell them sometime in march "the only way you are to survive a potential crash is to learn what cryptocurrency is, use it and see the value...". They did not listen, bought high, sold low...

In 2011 people said it was too late, in 2012 they said that too, in 2013 they said, in 14, 15, ... You get the idea... Now ask yourself: is it too late?
Bitcoin is NOT a get rich quick scheme, it's just harder money than the standard money.
So no, it's not too late, it will never be too late.
@_date: 2018-11-06 06:42:42
May be we have a different definition of "slow steady inflation".
See here for instance: 
When people start believing that the growth is not esponential any more, then they will start using bitcoin instead of hodling it.
That will be more or less by the time the btc capitalization gets closer to the capitalization of a major currency, not necessarily usd but may be something like eur or jpy, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:30:54
Wiring money into an exchange is a painful experience and we agree on that. I even add an extra step that makes me do usual bank account to small tier bank account to exchange (3 steps). That because I don't want my usual bank to shut my main account without warning. Basically that's because it is painful that I'd suggest to do it seldom, for higher amounts, so that reducing the number of times this process is done reduces the bank charges and exchange rate fees. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:13:57
I agree with you. Everyone should do their part and basically buy and replenish, buy and replenish. If done in a smart way it's not even expensive to do and it helps a lot the adoption of the currency. Like for instance if the problem is the difficulty, or the cost, in getting fiat into one's preferred exchange then make the effort to load the exchange with, say, thousands of dollars of fiat, then exchange little by little, use little by little, after the fiat stack is finished do the process of wiring fiat on the exchange again. If done properly and using the right exchangers it's not even too risky (anyway not riskier than keep the money on, say, a grade b bank) 
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:19:32
To my understanding there it's not the banks, it's the government itself. You cannot stop crypto, not even if you're government, but you can still make people feel bad for owning it or using it, especially since the was majority of people still have not grasped the full potential of these things and are still siding with the censorship prone people governing...

The best way that I read, imo, is to have a hardware wallet, set up the first seed, send the majority, but not all, of your bitcoin there, then reboot your hardware wallet, make a second seed, send the minority of your bitcoin there, leave the second seed mapped to your hardware wallet.
In this way, under torture, you still will give away your hardware, and you still give away your pin, and you still lose the minority of your bitcoin... But the conman will be unaware that you actually had more...
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:44:17

I honestly think that there is no 100% safe method. 
But I think that you can get robbed by two thieves types, basically:
1 - the hacker guy: this guy will steal your bitcoin remotely. This guy might have traced your transactions already and that's the one who will know you have a decoy in place. However, I don't think this guy will wrench attack you. He will attack you via the web, stealthily.
2 - the hooligan: this guy will wrench attack you. But he'll not have a clue about chain analysis, so he'll be unaware you're using a decoy.
So different prevention methods work for different threats.
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:42:45
It depends. 
If the business/shop is a one man band, then I'd say that a hot wallet (any respectable provider) to accept payments on the go, paired with a cold storage solution where to move crypto after business hours is probably the best solution.
If business is a more structured, more than one person and multiple people to accept payments from clients, then I would advise coinbase commerce, since it allows a lot of people to create invoices and get money in, but only the owner to take money out (IE: you need to know the seed to take crypto out of there)
@_date: 2019-01-13 11:35:03
Not just in India. That's why BTC ATM is so popular nowadays.
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:05:12
Sure it's possible but the value will shoot up. Some people will not sell all their crypto at any cost. And anyway after they buy all the bitcoin, then what? We fork bitcoin as bitcoin2 and continue there. They buy that and we fork again... Cannot be stopped like that.

Someone should introduce the rupee pegged stable coin, then...
Also, I think that uphold.com has got the rupee wallet in it and you can send peer to peer those rupees. To me clear the rupees there are digital currency, not crypto currency, so you would not even do something illegal technically.
Hope for you it works.

Debt, like currency printing is a one way road. Only goes up. Our future generations, probably even our own kids will look at us in disgust.

You need to get approved and they take weeks to approve you. All exchanges are the same and will take long time if they are fiat to crypto. If you need to do something in a rush then the only option is no kyc low limits crypto only exchanges. You can try binance. While you wait for real fiat exchanger to whitelist you you can play with usdt, gusd, tusd and all the likes...

If you wanna buy, buy any moment. At the prices we have today, if you are into bitcoin, why not buying... It already proved it's potential, it showed it's way higher than today's rates, and IMHO it will prove it again (rather soon). It helps to buy it in a view to keep it... Not to trade it again soon...
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:43:17
Buy some but do not overinvest. Know your limits. The volatility and risks of being an unsuccessful project still exist and are relevant, but the potential for upside is just too great to be missed.
If I were you I would take some money I would not mind losing, go to a BTC ATM and buy some. Use well known and respected wallets.

In this extended bear market a lot of exchanges will fail. Keep to the ones with volume and order books, avoid the small ones. Transfer your coins out asap even if you use exchanges that in theory should be large and solvent.
In your case I am of the opinion that you got your coins out simply because you kept on being a PITA to them and for 350 USD it was not worth to keep on delaying for them. So well done in the follow up.
