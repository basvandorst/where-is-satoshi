Iv been meaning to switch exchanges, this and the BCash shite that went on is the final straw... If only I could change now

Yeah I know can't really compare the two, but still the fees are fucked. I feel like if that continues people are going to swap

Im no expert when it comes to these things but i just checked the blockchain and apparently theres 133,000 unconfirmed transactions. Just wait a bit and hopefully itll clear soon
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:22:22
Pretty sure that's impossible, just wait and see

Download a wallet and try it, I'm pretty sure you'll need your pneumonic or whatever you use to get in tho

Hmm early tech eh. How come BCH and ETH have ridiculously low fees then. Bitcoin needs to change. 55 usd fee.... Fuck that

so are transactions still taking hours to confirm?
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:27:40
Not sure on the crypto side of it, I would assume that's about right.
Would highly recommend visiting mate, HK is a special place
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:23:57
Theres a huge backlog of transactions that still need to be completed around 170k so no choice but to wait
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:10:21
Not worth much? 11k not enough?

Wow good luck finding your coins and glad to hear your feeling better, wish I could help but im still a noob at this...
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:06:52
Literally new to the game not sure how it all works yet, getting the general gist of things. I saw that blockchain website and seeing that number doesnt really help. But yeah thanks ill read more into it, genuinely quite interesting

Technically Tsingtao was set up by Germans in the1900s, but yeah I know what you mean.
