Bitcoin gets really mad when people try to predict its price. If you have figured out a pattern that should work, Bitcoin would make sure that it doesn’t follow that pattern.
But now I am thinking that the fact that I have predicted its unpredictability would make Bitcoin mad, so it might become predictable. If I were Bitcoin, and reading this I would be very confused about what to do next.
May be I should just stop writing. I am super sleepy anyways and it’s time to HODL too. See how that worked out for the best. So would Bitcoin, it would  bounce back. Oh shit... I might have made it mad again, so I guess it won’t bounce back!

The attention to detail is amazing. Antminer and physical Bitcoins on the floor and I especially liked the “mastering bitcoin” textbook in his hands.

That’s what “they” want you to believe! It’s a huge conspiracy theory. Don’t you get it ;)

Try buying BTC followed by HODL

That’s what he said!

Can you please explain if the block size can continued to be increased if transactions keep increasing? Also, are there any significant disadvantages of increasing the size? Someone on this thread pointed out that larger block sizes promotes centralization. Is that true? And if yes, do we know a quantifiable limit till which we can safely increase the block size without compromising on some of the Bitcoin tenants.

Isn’t that already happening? The rate at which Bitcoin is going seems like it is in a spatial dimension where time passes really fast. The way it just shoots up also gives an impression like it comes from place which doesn’t have much of a gravitational pull.

Might be some sort of blessing in disguise. Nobody knows if the price would go up or down. But it looks like we will stay in this correction phase for a few days before taking off. If you are buying for long term and believe in Bitcoin then it doesn’t matter what your entry point is. Good luck!

Can someone please explain here why did the unconfirmed transactions go up and why are they coming down now? Is it because the total transactions on the network have reduced? I don’t want to be skeptical here but if that’s the case, it doesn’t seem to be good news. Ideally, we would like to see the total transactions on the network stay same or increase because it means that people are using Bitcoin.

Most of it seems like a self fulfilling prophecy. Too many people including robots rely on the same TA and end up actually fulfilling the claimed goal.

Is there a metric to support this claim? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:11:42
As pointed out before, this can be because of less transactions.

Thanks for linking this. If I am interpreting this correctly, the total outputs and transactions both have gone down. The ratio has elevated slightly but the only thing that really explains the low fees and mempool clearance seems to be the fact that the overall usage has gone down. So it doesn’t seem to me like batching or segwit adoption has increased. Please let me know if I interpreted this correctly or not.

I don’t get why this comment is being downvoted. It seems like a genuine concern.

Proof? Did you read the 'segwit2x incompatibility warning' released by bitcoin.org. They mentioned that Electrum can be used for their wallet services. So I assumed they would be handling the hard fork gracefully.

The post clearly says "avoid using web wallets like blockchain.info". They are referring to wallets who are going to follow the longest chain and were part of NYA. You can read blockchain.info's statement regarding segwit2x here:
