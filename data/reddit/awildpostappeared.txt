Haha, sorry I am still new to bitcoin. Thanks for the reassurance.

I'm late to the party but definitely interested. I made a wallet on coinbase but so far have just found confusion!

I think a lot of people have sell orders in at a certain price point. You'll see the price hover over $180 for a while and then crash. Its staying right there because some people who are in it for the long term have a buy order in at that price while others are trying to sell. Once everyone who is willing to buy has bought, if there are more sellers, it drops again. This will continue until we hit rock bottom, where more people are willing to buy. I'm presuming around $100 as a lot of others have predicted. A lot of people have said they will buy at $100, most people who were going to sell would probably rather take a total loss in their minds and hold onto bitcoin rather than sell at that point.

Awesome! Love seeing bitcoin being used for charity. Great for the community.

So I guess what I'm asking for is a wallet that I can use across all my platforms that is not web based, where I own my wallet. Including mobile. Or is it better to have multiple wallets?

Appreciate it. So if the nodes do forget about the transaction, will the balance be sent back to my old wallet? Should I keep an eye on this transaction until this is all sorted out?
