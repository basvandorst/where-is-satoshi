holy shit...I remember a month ago some body wrote about something like this happening but it was because of Ethereum not outright robbery

what was your website? because this is a very rare thing I'm hearing and I know people who run porn studios have the highest chargeback so unless you are running a porn studio, you have no excuse. 
also just because you fucked up don't mean rest of the industry is as hurting as bad as you. so it's not enough of an excuse to justify bitcoin.

I wonder if Central Bank of Japan will now encourage banks to give out loans to people who won't ever pay it back and buy houses and start unsustainble businesses like they did during the late 80s? Creating another bubble

obvious choice for unbiased reporting on irrelevant statistics that offer no real insight.

we are not talking about cash, but paypal.

I don't think you've ever started a business to know that chargebacks are very rare unless you operate a porn site. even at that it's average is a low single digit. so it's a non issue and not enough of a risk to hinder mastercard and big companies.
digital currency means you are liable for storing them or someone else is. there's no oversight in which you can get your money back if they get robbed while banks have insurances in place and often able to recover the money. or you can go after them and get it back one way or other. but not the case with digital currency.
immutability is a double edged sword. I don't see it replacing the current fiat system.

but paypal lets you get your money back if somebody fucks you over
bitcoin once its gone it's gone. no mediator to reverse.
for example, you buy something, it never arrives but you already paid. or maybe the shipped good is broken or faulty after a few days. the money is gone.

not really, the local demand still outstrips chinese money as the study has shown only 10% of transactions are of foreign origin. 
also this means that BTC is tied to the policies of China. If China declares bitcoin illegal it will have a huge price impact on bitcoins. As the chinese economy falters in the next coming year, we will see bitcoin prices fall as chinese demand falls.

THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BITCOIN NEEDS TO LEARN FROM ETHEREUM, ITS A SHIT COIN RUN BY INCOMPETENT PEOPLE.

yet it's susceptible to wild volatile prices. you have 700 today it could suddenly be 400. that's far worse than inflation which is single digits and takes a longer time for attrition to be realized. 


lack of centralization means scams and unhappy transactions. no oversight and no mediation means the moral hazard is costly for the average consumer. ex. paypal, banks has protection for buyers and sellers.


as you saw what happened in ethereum, more often than useful, it turns to herd behavior to serve the interests of the few. changing the technology hardly changes the motive of people using it, rather the lack of centralization and oversight encourages more bad actors to take over and influence the system.

what was the name of your business again? against it's your word against the 99% of industry that says churn is manageable. 
[5~7%]( in the SaaS industry and I rarely see anyone above 1 or 2%. This is from deploying dozen of SaaS products for large companies and we rarely have chargebacks.
So again, I question whether you really were running a business like you say you were or just making shit up to push your view that churn rate is some how overwhelming force that affects all businesses. It is not.
