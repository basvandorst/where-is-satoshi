PoliticalDissidents is correct.  
Miners can select which transactions they want to approve.  They will grab the ones with the most fees and then force all other transactions to wait a few blocks.  This is their way to penalize users who don't pay enough fees and its a signal to the market that this is how much it costs to provide the service. 
Miners are in control of the fees regardless of blocksize limits.

Technically we can write a tax code into our bitcoin clients and have it fund things directly.  These taxes and fees could be government projects or charities.  Imagine if you knew exactly where your money tax money was being appropriated to and you had options to fund different discretionary items based on your values.    If you don't believe in abortion, then you actually have a choice not to fund it.
Of course the developers and miners would have to agree to this, so there is a slim chance of it happening.

You forget to mention the part about bitcoin being more efficient to send money around the world.   You call it a scheme, implying that bitcoin has no edge or value to anyone.  Bitcoin is cash for the internet, like it or not.  It's not going away because people have economic gripes about it being deflationary and Paul Krugman didn't give his stamp of approval.    There are real tangible benefits of using bitcoin and merchants are seeing it in their bottom line.   Yes, it's a wild ride for now because there's a shit ton of speculation and uncertainty.  In time, with better exchanges and efficient arbitrage the price will stabilize.

The Fed and US Governments ideology is that government spending and control of the money supply is necessary for a stable economy.  
Ayn Rand's ideology says that they do more harm then good.  
Look at the deprecation of the US dollar since the Fed was created and it should be pretty clear that inflationary economics rob everyone who doesn't have enough education and money to diversify and hedge against it.  
Inflationary money supply is the reason that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

Facebook followed by Amazon then Google.    If 90% of people use these large companies wallets then the transaction volume on the network will be greatly reduced because they can reconcile transactions between each other in batches a few times a day. This also allows each company to create all sorts of interesting interactions within their site.  Tipping, paywalls, crowd funding, charity etc.  All if this could happen in each silo and have no performance impact on the blockchain. If you look at the coming fee changes and the writing on the wall for miners, P2P micro transactions will get expensive.  Bitcoin will become the next generation bank network for web companies.  Hobbiest altcoins will still be around for cheap P2P transfers.

It's just like your email client opening up when you click on an emailto:  link.   bitcoin: is part of the HTML5 spec and both Chrome and Firefox support it.

@_date: 2014-01-21 23:16:12
The fact that Bitcoin is being used as a currency is a side effect of its currency like intrinsic properties.  
Here are a few Bitcoin intrinsic properties: unique, limited, easy to transfer, easy to divide, fungible, and no central point of failure.  Some of those properties are very similar to money, so why not use these mathematical hashes as currency?  In some scenarios that Andreesen points out, Bitcoin is even better than traditional money and credit cards.   
Initial value is sometimes a stumbling block for Bitcoin noobs.  The limited supply and that fact that you have to do work(time and money) to acquire them, gives them value.  Once they have initial value the market of supply and demand take over and they are traded like a commodity.      All commodities have intrinsic value, as explained above, and the market will determine what that value is.   But the crazy thing is that Bitcoin is also like a Stock.  Owning Bitcoin is like buying stock in the new payment network of the internet.
Bitcoin also has the largest mining network to secure it against malicious actors.  That property gives confidence to investors and speculators that their investment is safe from a 100% loss.  People love to speculate so we see huge swings in value,  but at the same time the Bitcoin social network is growing stronger.  More people get involved each time the price goes up, which turns into a positive feedback loop.  More websites are using it everyday and it is becoming the currency of the internet because we are using it as such.  Eventually Bitcoin is going to required for some websites, because it's the path of least resistance for developers and it allows micropayments.
Economists can debate if Bitcoin is a good currency all they want, but in the end, the people who use it will decide.  Not some armchair academics.  They will only realize it in hindsight.

Ripples are postage stamps that use the existing banking system as clearing houses, because they have a monopoly on trust.

@_date: 2014-01-17 04:28:44
I give it to you that bitcoin is volatile, but I don't think it will be like this forever.  The price needs to go a lot higher so that small amounts of money don't thrash the market around.   I never thought a nation would use bitcoin, but the people would use it as check against out of control government spending.  The same way people in Turkey prefer the Euro or USD to their nations Lira.  They trade out of Lira almost immediately.   In some countries like Venezuela it is against the law to exchange out of local currency and by the way experienced 51% inflation last year.       This means either hold the nations currency, trade it on the black market or find another way out of it.  While Bitcoin is volatile, it's still in an upward trajectory which makes it historically a way better bet than holding fiat.  Venezuela internet usage is 44%, which means it's possible for them to get ahold of bitcoins.  Not sure what the adoption rate is there, but it is a valid option.   
The Bitcoin blockchain is a transaction protocol and Ripple essentially divorced the idea of currency from the technology.  But because of this, Ripples have no value.  The protocol acts like stamps and allows you to create IOUs that are crypographically signed.  Big whoop.  If you think Bitcoin is hard concept for people to grasp imagine telling them you can use a Ripple to send anything you want across the internet in the form of an IOU.  However, you still need clearing houses that you can trust on the edges of the network to make it work (aka banks).  With Bitcoin, you just need a network of people and an exchange rate.
Bitcoin has value primarily because miners spent time and money to mine it, but also because it's called "Bitcoin". Satoshi Nakamoto realized that by solving the double spend problem with the blockchain that money is the obvious killer app for this technology.  In addition, the fact that Bitcoin actually has value is the only reason why we are having this debate.  If Namecoin(distributed DNS) was created first, no one would give a shit about this technology and I would still be getting gang rapped by ebay and paypal with no alternatives in sight.   Banks would still have a monopoly of wealth transfer and citizens would still be at the mercy of their Governments fiscal responsibility.
Satoshi Nakamoto didn't mail it in and just release a blockchain, he thought long and hard about what he was creating.

Of course, they want to tie you into a reoccurring billing plan and then cause the customer to jump through hoops to get out if it.  With bitcoin the customer has complete control of their money again.  No one can pull money out of your wallet the way businesses do today.    There are many apps that will benefit from low friction payments with no chance of change backs.  
Did you know bitcoin is already in your browser?    Have you clicked on email links before and had your default mail client open?   Well that same functionality is built in for bitcoin.    We are at the very beginning of this technology and what it can do.  Bitcoin is going to fundamentally change the way we think of payments on the web.

I understand your scenario, but consider this. 
Currently Discus Fish has 30% of the hash rate.  If they filter transactions with fees above X, then the odds of me getting my transaction included is affected by their practice.  If I want my transaction included in the next block, then I am going to pay their fee.  Otherwise there is a chance of my transaction being bumped to a block that Discus Fish does not win.   Who knows how long that will take.  
This means that all you need is one miner with substantial market share to mess with the odds of your transaction being included in the next block.  All high priority transactions has to consider this.  Thus it will force fees up overall.  Of course the guppy pool can always swoop up all pending transactions, but the practice of the large pool has already missed with your odds.   Once you have one actor behaving this way, then it's easy for another pool to do the same thing.  Collusion can happen.   
We all want our transactions confirmed ASAP and we will have to pay for it eventually.

Great arguments, but what do you think about fiscally reckless nations that penalize their populous by inflating their currency and destroying their citizens wealth? 
IMO, Bitcoin is the first global solution to address that tragedy and has the added ability to send any amount of wealth to anywhere in the world.  Of course you need buyers/sellers in said location, but Bitcoin has a strong network effect.  Internet penetration is still rising per    and smart phones are becoming cheaper.  The accessibility of Bitcoin will surpass Gold.  This will allow everyone to store their wealth outside of sketchy governments and banks and be hedged from most geo-political issues, sans the internet completely collapsing.
From the tech and geo-political perspective Bitcoin is tour-de-force that will go down in history along with Twitter for giving power to the people.

I was replying to the guy that was saying it was strictly a currency.  Which it is not.  It is an asset trading network, which then gives it value and has also has limited units.  Holding a few of those units are similar to holding stock in the overall network.  Bitcoin is way closer to being a stock and/or asset than a plain old currency.  
As you pointed out, a currency can be anything and in that case holds no actual meaning.

It's not a fiat currency you brainless moron.  Bitcoin will increase in value over time because it's the commodity element of a payment network for the internet.  It is actually valuable.  Unlike fiat, which only goes down in value because every government in the world is trying to print more to reduce their crippling debts.   Go ahead and hold fiat, dumb ass.
Buying Bitcoin is an investment.  But unlike traditional investments, I can spend it any time I choose.  This causes mentally challenged people like you to think it *should* be currency.  These things are only mutually exclusive in YOUR mind because the pathways have not been connected in your dimly lit neocortex.  MORON.   These are mental hurdles for you, not me.

You know how you can click on an email address and have your default email client open with that address prefilled?   Well this allows that functionality for bitcoin.    Click on a link that has  bitcoin:ioajdf98wefj  and Coinbase will open and handle the transaction.  This functionality has been possible in Firefox and Chrome for some time now, since it's part of HTML5 spec, but I don't think any bitcoin wallets registered handlers for it.  I *think* Coinbase is the first to do it.  I could be wrong, here.  
It's awesome because it is streamlining user flow and makes sending bitcoin just as easy as sending an email.   Seeing functionality like this reminds me that bitcoin is not going away.  It is being built directly into the web and will become the way we do payments online.

On bitcointalk.org a new crypto currency is mentioned, how is it going to work? 
I'm assuming miners/nodes get rewarded in this currency, and then they sell those coins on the open market to people who want to store data on the nodes.  If that is the case then it's possible to reclaim this currency using demurrage(Freicoin) as a way to charge people for the data stored on nodes.  The demurrage rate could be dependent on how much data is stored and how redundant it is.   IMO, this creates a nice market of supply and demand and the coins are constantly being recycled which prevents hording.

If a protocol change happens in Bitcoin that miners don't agree to, then they don't upgrade.  This causes a fork, if a percentage of them do agree to it.  The entire community then has to decide which path they wish to take.   
I don't believe that is possible with ripple.  
Ripple can make changes that the "community" doesn't agree to.  Nothing is stopping them.

Based on this I see the future of bitcoin being ubiquitous and scaling not being an issue.   I imagine a few large legit wallet providers that settle between each other every few hours.   this would alleviate transaction pressures on the blockchain.  I would imagine bitpay and coinbase are already settling between each other using batches.  Once Facebook and then amazon comes online, we have critical mass with marginal pressure on the blockchain.

The Internet is an integral part of modern life—a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.
The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.
The Internet must enrich the lives of individual human beings.
Individuals’ security and privacy on the Internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.
Individuals must have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on the Internet.
The effectiveness of the Internet as a public resource depends upon interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation and decentralized participation worldwide.
Free and open source software promotes the development of the Internet as a public resource.
Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.
Commercial involvement in the development of the Internet brings many benefits; a balance between commercial profit and public benefit is critical.
Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the Internet is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.

No one solves the exchange rate "problem".  It's an open market and it will work itself out as velocity, market depth, and market cap grows.  The Forex market fluctuates wildly, as does commodities, like oil.  It's just the nature of markets.  The reason there is somewhat "stability" in those markets on a daily basis is because the market is so large.  Over 3 Trillion is transacted DAILY in forex.  There are millions of competing interests that balance the market, or cause it to range or trend.  But look at it over the last few years.
 
USD/JPY that moved almost $30 over the last year.
The reason for this move is because Japan wants a weak Yen to encourage exports.  They are injecting tons of money into the forex market to depreciate their currency on purpose.
Granted it's not the $800 move we see in Bitcoin, but these markets are enormous in comparison.   The fact is that Bitcoin is simply too small to handle large amounts of money right now, so you have wild swings because supply is limited, new coins are created at a slow fixed rate and the only variable that can move is the price.  Similar to Gold, but Gold is a huge market with something like 3000 years of history.  
When 1 BTC is &gt; $100,000 things will be much smoother... or I can say when 1 Satoshi is worth &gt; $0.001, if that is more palatable.
There's only ~12 million Bitcoins in existence today @ $800.  Compare that to gold. And then reflect on your statement about the money supply of bitcoin being too low.  I know that you've debated that Gold vs Bitcoin with other people, so we don't need to go there.  But many people see Bitcoin as Gold 2.0.

Yes it is.  It's faster and doesn't require a 3rd party to be involved.  What's your bitcoin address? I'll send you some.  ;)  Nothing else matters.


3rd Party companies, different APIs, higher fees, restrictions, data breaches, fraud and identity theft.


Charge backs require a trusted 3rd party, an authority.  Bitcoin doesn't require an authority.


Agreed, but we are decades away from the block reward ending.  The fees will stay very low for the foreseeable future allowing micropayments to flourish and giving birth to a new economy of services.


Agreed, but it won't be this way forever.


Yes it will change in value and be freely floating because it represents a free market.  It will stabilize once larger economies emerge.  We'll also have ETFs and other financial services that will allow us to hedge our risk against volatility.

Disagree.  Mining runs on an ROI horizon based on how much your hardware costs and electricity over time.  A miner will only sell, if they have to cover marginal costs and taxes. Otherwise their best bet is to hold their supply of coins until it's profitable.  Historically, that's about 8 months.
Thus, miners control the supply and will hold out causing the price to rise to meet their ROI.

Everyone has their number.  That's why the market goes down.  It's like you think that people never sell any investment.  Or you don't understand stocks. I mean, wtf is going on here.   
Take Google for example.   Their stock price has been going up for years and people have been cashing out all the way through.  Google then takes their paper wealth and leverages it to expand their company and their market.  The exact same thing is happening with Bitcoin.  Tons of bitcoiners are taking their new wealth and then putting it back in the economy to expand the network.  This is called re-investment.
Again, I feel like you don't have even the slightest grasp on anything related to economics, finance, or markets and yet you claim to have worked on a derivatives desk.

I'm a web developer, so of course I know what an API is.  
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. Bitcoin handlers are already integrated into browsers.  In fact it's part of the HTML5 spec.
Are you familar with email:blahblah   ?
You can also do 
This will automatically open your wallet and prefill a few fields.  
Coinbase just implemented it for their wallet.  Any wallet can do the same, because this is how open source protocols work.    Your bitcoin wallet is gonna be just like your email app today.  You can run a bitcoin client on your desktop, phone, or in the cloud if you trust those people with your money.  The choice is yours.  The risk is on you.
The browser that you're using right now already supports bitcoin.  So it's already part of the internet whether you like it or not.  There are going to be websites that require you to have bitcoin. Games and paywalls are gonna use crypto currencies because it's easier than Paypal or any other 3rd party system.   This is because the developer/website gets their money instantly regardless of the country they live.  A 12 year old can create an app anywhere in the world and get paid directly.  This is unprecedented.
Why don't we have paypal:  or visa:? Because those systems are closed source, proprietary, have non standard APIs, are restrictive depending on the country, and are a central authority.  
Bitcoin is an open source protocol that anyone can investigate and learn the inner workings of.  It will continue to get better as technical issues arise, because there are thousands of smart developers out there who love this shit.  Bitcoin is the future of money on the internet and I can say that with absolute confidence because I know developers and we are personally making it happen.  We are innovating faster than ever before and now that global payments are essentially solved, we're gonna see another leap in what the internet can provide.  
If you want some insight into where we're headed, read this book.  
It talks about crypto-currency to the T and it was written in 1997.
More disruption! AKA innovation.

The block reward is a distribution mechanism that allows bitcoin to bootstrap itself, thus giving coins value and prevents central control(ripple).  The reward halves every 4 years and eventually miners will only make money off transaction fees.  Its scheduled inflation and hard coded in the protocol.

The "real" value is whatever the market says it is.  It's simple supply and demand Capt Derivatives!   
I believe that there will be a HUGE demand for Bitcoin, just like there is huge demand for email.  Email is awesome because it's easier than sending a letter.  Bitcoin is awesome because it's easier than going to the bank. It is easier than typing in my CC information.  It's easier than writing a check to a friend. It's easier to exchange it for another currency.  It's easier to gamble with.  It's easier for me send any amount I please to any place in the world I want. No questions asked.   That utility is priceless!
Demand is increasing daily and as the price goes up or down, people will sell or buy or whatever.  The point is, it's already a functioning market. But you already know this, right?  I mean you worked on a fucking derivatives desk for gods sake.  You probably have a fancy piece of paper that says you can recognize a market when see it, right?   If not, then I'm not surprised we had a financial crisis with morons like you at the helm.   
THE REASON every country in the world has inflationary fiat currencies is because they control it and gives them power.  They then use it as a mechanism to erode their debts and force everyone in the country to gamble their money in the stock market or buy their shitty T-Bills that provide yields that barely beat inflation.   A states fiat currency keeps the rat race going.  It keeps markets uneven, noncompetitive, distorted, imbalanced, and increases the likely hood of another collapse.
Now, If you read what I wrote before, you will recall that I said Bitcion is a commodity that I can spend whenever I choose to.  Some how, at that point, your brain gets all confused and suddenly thinks that because I can spend it like a currency, then it must be a currency and therefore must be subject to your text book definition of currency.  Well it's not.  It's better than fiat currency.  It's new, it's different and morons don't know how to classify it.  So you trollololol around spreading your ignorance like you're some fucking genius, when in reality you took an Econ 101 course and remembered a definition.  FAIL!

This makes no sense.  There is no reason for some big guy to literally waste his money to hold the price at a certain point.  
What he *IS* doing, is buying it or selling at a particular price point because that's what he wants to do. It's the entry or exit point that at this point in time looks good to him.  The market and the order book is a reflection of peoples intentions to buy or sell.   They can, of course, change their mind at the last second and revoke their orders.  It's the freedom we have in an open market.   Stop running around here like Chicken Little talking about the "manipulators".   It simply does not matter.  It's the way markets work.

The only reason there is so much power going into bitcoin is because it is an arms race for who gets the most coins.  All this does it create 'buy in' for Bitcoin and gives coins their initial value.  If you spend time and money mining something then the reward has value to you.  That value is greater than zero.  It was one of the requirements to get Bitcoin off the ground.  It's very clever on the part of the creator, but at the same time it's a huge waste of resources.
There are more efficient ways to secure the block chain in a distributed fashion.  Look at the way ripple works.   
Maybe someday Bitcoin will evolve to not need such a ridiculous amount of computing power, because right now it's retarded how many GFLOPS are going into computing SHA2 hashes.

Freicoin has demurrage, which is sort of like inflation.  But the big question is who is going to invest and use in a coin that decreases in value over time when there is an alternative that does not?
Bitcoin is our hedge against out of control government spending and a world where inflation is  eating away at our savings month after month.  We've lived in an inflationary economy for long enough without any alternatives.  Bitcoin is the first alternative to the status quo and lots of people want to give it a try.  It may fail in the end, but it's probably going to take a years to see the exact issues with it.  It's an exciting experiment.
IMO I don't see any issue with changing value.  We have exchange rates and we can convert prices instantly.  Day to Day businesses don't need to hold BTC if they don't want to. They can accept BTC and then convert it to USD immediately, so they are not affected by the price variations.
Remember that at the heart of Bitcoin is a new P2P payment system that allows for money to be transferred all over the world at a fraction of the current cost.  This is disruptive and will be changing the payment landscape of the web and real life.  There is no stopping it, the same way there is no stopping P2P file transfers.

How does mining work?    How is it possible that it takes about 10 minutes of time to find the "answer" if all these miners are just computing random numbers (SHA256 Hash) and increasing a nonce?   Does the block chain just look at a timer and say "10 minutes has passed, lets randomly reward someone"? 
Are most miners really churning, waiting for the block reward to be coughed up?  I understand they also confirm transactions, but there is no way it takes all that much computing power to confirm a few hundred transactions.  So what are the miners actually mining 99% of the time?

51% attack is not profitable, because it will destroy any confidence in bitcoin and send it to zero.
I think will reach the bleeding edge of hash power in 2014.  KnC Neptune is 20nm fab process pushing out 3TH/s.  We will see the next bump with 14nm and then we will be on par with the industry.  Once this happens we will be able to buy these highly efficient miners knowing that tomorrow it isn't going to be made absolute by some another company that managed to build a smaller chip.  At 14nm fab the hashpower should spread out again because you can't get anything better.  Miners then have to scale out instead of up, similar to litecoin.

Freicoin has demurrage, which is sort of like inflation.  But the big question is who is going to invest and use in a coin that decreases in value over time when there is an alternative that does not?
Bitcoin is our hedge against out of control government spending and a world where inflation is  eating away at our savings month after month.  We've lived in an inflationary economy for long enough without any alternatives.  Bitcoin is the first alternative to the status quo and lots of people want to give it a try.  It may fail in the end, but it's probably going to take a years to see the exact issues with it.  It's an exciting experiment.
IMO I don't see any issue with changing value.  We have exchange rates and we can convert prices instantly.  Day to Day businesses don't need to hold BTC if they don't want to. They can accept BTC and then convert it to USD immediately, so they are not affected by the price variations.
Remember that at the heart of Bitcoin is a new P2P payment system that allows for money to be transferred all over the world at a fraction of the current cost.  This is disruptive and will be changing the payment landscape of the web and real life.  There is no stopping it, the same way there is no stopping P2P file transfers.

No incentive? Are you kidding me.  Wait until we get some negative media attention and this bitcoin bubble comes crashinh down. Everyone will realize it is kiddy shit that can only handle 10 tx/s and takes 10s of thousands of computers around the world to achieve this.   This would cause the market cap to collapse and the miners ROI to go down the drain.  They have a huuuuuge incentive to process transactions no matter what.
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:57:58
Bitcoin is a complement to our inflationary fiat system.  Think of bitcoin as a savings account that actually earns you money.  This will be true as long as the adoption rate of bitcoin is positive.  IF the people of the WORLD abandon bitcoin then it will loss value like any other commodity that no one wants.
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:12:52
Ya, I know exactly what ripple did and I also see why mining is so central to Bitcoins adoption and success so far.  No one trusts Ripple because they created their coins, but the advantage of ripple is that there isn't any mining or huge wastes of computing power.  The large hashing power is only required because there is NO trust in Bitcoin.  If the Bitcoin Foundation could establish trust across the network then a 51% attack is no longer an issue.  But of course trust is a touchy subject because then it adds a target.  I'm just saying that these articles about our super computer Bitcoin network is not very impressive when you consider what it's actually doing.

If coins are infinitely divisible and the inevitable supply of BTC is going to peak at 21M then slowly dwindle as coins are lost for various reasons.  
That means BTC price is going to steadily increase to infinity too.

Wtf is this hippy shit?  When we hit the max block size and peoples transactions dont get recorded its goin to shake the confidence everyone has in bitcoin.  We have great momentum, but if we hit a bump like this it could be enough for bitcoin and opensource crytos to loss credibility and a shitty alternive like Ripple a chance to enter the market.   We dont want businesses to wave off bitcoin as being a fad.

@_date: 2013-04-26 23:34:57
I agree.  I think it is more motivating when you see your account balance decreasing.  Inflation is invisible to your account balance, but very apparent when you purchase goods.  People are usually surprised.  "I remember when gas used to cost blah blahb blah"   I think if everyone saw their account balances going down year after year b/c of inflation a lot more people would be concerned with a governments fiscal actions.

You have no idea what you're talking about.   First off btc-e doens't have "market" orders.  It's all limit orders.
Currently there is a "wall" at 700 on BTC because it's nice big round number and orders tend to group around round numbers.  The so called "whale" is really just peoples cash out point.  The price will bump up against it several times because there is a ton of coins sitting there to be sold @ 700.   The price will drop because the buys can't break through and the momentum slows.  Buy orders on the other hand will pull back because they see the resistance point and will realize that they can probably buy at a lower point than where it's at.  The price will then drop a few percentage points, until more buyers come in and the Bulls make another run at breaking through the price point.  
In your example 8.75LTC is a nice number, that's why there's a metric shit-ton of money sitting there.    Buying "cheap" coins is such a retarded way of thinking about it.  You do realize that the sells orders at the "Wall" are still being filled right?  The so called Whale is selling at that price point.
Here's what happened to the 8.75 price point.
It was a point of resistance several times, but as you can see the buyers eventually won.
Your assumption is that the coins sold at the "wall" price will be less than the coins bought by the small retracement to 8.33.    In a bullish uptrend that is impossible.   The reason the wall disappears is because the whale realizes that 8.75 is not the TOP of the market, and he moves his sell orders up higher because there is more demand than anticipated.  Market markers do this ALL DAY LONG and it's how EVERY market in the world works.  Learn it and take off that ridiculous tin-foil hat.

I was thinking about ways that the media industry could implement drm and false scarcity with a blockchain.  Example, Limited releases of albums.   Imagine an artist that releases 10000 copies of their latest album.  They could essentially create an ipo for their album and sell shares which represent access to own and listen to the album.   Media players would have to built to respect the rules of this blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:32:01
This simply raises the capacity so we dont max out in the next month and get a wrath of bad media for it.  Remember bitcoin is not the only crypto in this space.  Ripple is just waiting to step into the market because they can handle a ridiculous amount of transactions per second.  This quickfix gives bitcoin breathing room and the devs more time to fix the issue the right way.  Im sure the miners would agree to a quick fix now to keep bitcoin strong.
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:05:27

@_date: 2013-04-12 01:27:04
Thats what a sell off always looks like.  I can find hundreds of examples of this every day across anything that has to do with money and exchange.  These chart patterns are a relection of supply, demand, greed, fear of loss, doubt and many other emotions that drive us when we're speculating.   Sell offs are always fast, have a bounce, then reach a capitulation point and then some normalization.  If no fundamentals change it will repeat.    mt gox is upgrading its hardware right now so we can do it all over again.
