Not necessarily. If there's a bitcoin service in the country where you live that allows you bank transfers, the process goes like this:
1. Buy bitcoin in the US through Circle (0% fee)
2. Send bitcoin to overseas bitcoin service (0.0001 bitcoin fee)
3. Sell the bitcoin for local currency (fee may vary, but lets say 1% fee).
4. Transfer to bank account.
The whole thing is done in one hour (confirmation time).
This truly is the end of Western Union.

They know you have the coins under the following scenarios:
1. You purchased bitcoins at a US-based exchange and the exchanged reported your purchases to the IRS. They have to in order to pay their own taxes.
2. You associated you name to a bitcoin address and they simply checked the blockchain to see if that address has coins.

1. The bitcoin protocol is designed to create a finite amount of bitcoins (21 million) until 2141. The original creators are no longer necessary for the protocol to do what it was designed to do.
2. Bitcoins are created not by one, but by thousands of collective computers mining the protocol.
3. The protocol is open source. You can check it anytime you want.
4. Again, there can only be 21 million bitcoins over the course of more than a century. Thus, the value of bitcoin increases as its demand increases.

You can already earn bitcoins instead of fiat. BitPay allows your employer to pay you in bitcoin after retaining the fiat for taxes.

Newsweek just wanted to sell itself as a relevant, internet era news outlet. It failed. They did an interesting article on oil production on federal land some months ago -and it was pretty well researched- but since the real target audience for the print media is the web, they probably thought they could get the web's attention with Satoshi Nakamoto. And they did, but it was simply not the kind of attention that will get them readers off the web. Web users probably won't pay much attention to Newsweek after this.
A lot of older people who are not so much into the web will probably buy it. That's why Fox News still has an audience; it relies on older audiences who clearly aren't too interested in facts.

Coinbase should do the following:
1. Eliminate transaction fees for bitcoin transactions.
2. Eliminate their horrible 30-day wait for high instant-transactions.
3. Simplify their interface.
4. Offer bank funding on more countries.
Aside from that, Coinbase does have a superior wallet service and I doubt Circle will be able to compete with it.
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:34:55
From the info you are providing I can tell you the following:
The coins were sent to address 17ns8ggpV2SrUXvZwVkCPcGTGNjPUPSjL almost 3 days ago or 2 days before you upgraded to Core 0.9.3
This suggests 3 possible scenarios:
1. Your computer is infected with malware that sent your unencryoted wallet.dat file to a hacker who was able to plug it into his local copy of core and then sent the coins to his address. (Most likely scenario).
2. Somebody was able to access your computer and sent the coins to the address (less likely scenario as you would've noticed).
What seems a bit strange is that your Core client didn't register the transaction till this morning. What version of Core were you running before the upgrade?
So lets try the following:
1. Backup to a thumb drive the wallet.dat file currently in your Core client.
2. Turn off Core.
3. Go to the bitcoin folder and rename the wallet.dat file to tempo_wallet.dat
4. You mentioned you had old wallet.dat files from 2011 and 2012. Make a copy of the 2012 file and put it in the bitcoin folder.
5. Run Core.
If your blockchain is up to date, you will either find the balance up to 2012 or no coins at all.
If you find coins, then at least you can rocover those. If there are no coins then the possibility of a hack gets reinforced.
After you're done. Delete the 2012 wallet (not the one in backup, but the copy you made for this) and rename back temp_wallet.dat back to wallet.dat.

Er... you can send money to Africa with PayPal.
Now for a really tough question: How many people in the developing world have credit cards? Because that's the only way you can send them money through Circle.
Circle is nice in the way they eliminated waiting times and transaction fees, but it's far from the solution to the world's financial problems.
Until there's a simple, inexpensive method for converting bitcoin to fiat in every country, Circle will only be half of the solution. It's a really good half of the solution, but half nonetheless.

Actually Overstock is making a profit in more ways than just the sales numbers.
1. It got tons of free publicity by being the first major online store to accept bitcoin.
2. According to Overstock, clients who use bitcoin as a payment method spend more money than clients who use credit cards. That's adding value by having new clients with a larger purchasing power. Source: 
3. Sales in bitcoin in Overstock are growing.
4. Overstock projected no more than 3 to 5 million dollars in bitcoin sales for 2014. Now the projecttion has been revised to 10 to 15 million. That's TRIPLE the oroginal projection.
5. Most people buy sheets, smartphone covers and other items with bitcoin at Overstock. They could've gone somewhere else to buy that, but they went to Overstock instead.  That's a WIN no matter what.
6. Overstock adds at least an additional 2% profit to their bottom line by not having to pay fees to credit cards for bitcoin purchases.
7. By using bitcoins, Overstock avoided loses created by fraudulent chargebacks.
Finally, Overstock originally didn't want to keep any bitcoins and immediately changed the bitcoins into cash. But now they are actually keeping some of the coins in order to give bonuses or pay suppliers.
So there's more to making profits than the actual sales when a business uses bitcoin.

1. No. If your business infrastructure is to sell satellite TV or other products, there's no economic incentive to sell bitcoins. Financially it makes more sense to accept bitcoin and convert to cash immediately, as Overstock does.
2. There's an interesting idea. Buy a prepaid card worth 20 dollars in fiat with a code that you can trade at Coinbase for 20 bucks worth of bitcoin. But for Coinbase it makes more sense to get businesses to accept bitcoin in order to create an incentive for adoption.
3. I beg to differ. Unless your favorite restaurant accepts bitcoin, there's not incentive for using it other than to buy it for speculative purposes or as an investment. Bitcoin needs to go past the speculative level and become a payment option that can truly challenge credit cards.
4. Not going to happen. Banks know they will lose money if bitcoin becomes popular. Banks will lose wire transfer fees, saving and checking account fees, and many other fees for services no longer needed because of cryptocurrencies. In fact, if you try to buy bitcoin at Coinbase through a Bank of America account, there's a good chance you'll get that account suspended.

Actually the income tax for the rich during world war II was 94%.

It already is. Any early adopter with a buttload of bitcoins can move the price up or down just by selling a couple thousand coins.
But if you mean if a bank can manipulate the price as Barclays did with gold, then it seems unlikely in the near future.
Keep in mind there will only be 21 million bitcoins. About 12 million have already beeen mined. The rest will be mined over a period of over 100 years. Early adopters have thousands of coins. So for a bank to get a hold of enough bitcoins to manipulate the price it would be difficult. Even the Winklevoss twins don't have that many coins.

Blockchain.info and Coinbase generate new addresses for payments as a security measure -so people won't know how many coins you actually have- and also so you can tell who paid and how much by giving a different address to every new transaction.
That way if buyer A pays you 1 bitcoin you can look up the address and differentiate it from buyer B who paid 0.3 bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-04 05:03:09
I say yes, it is necessary to encrypt the wallet if you have multiple copies. Each new copy increases the chances of somebody finding it and sweep it.
Once encrypted with a strong 18-character passphrase, you can hang your wallet on your wall in plain sight and nobody will be able to crack it.

Here's a simple solution to your problem: Set up a regular Coinbase wallet and tell your clients to pay you through a Coinbase wallet of their own.
When a Coinbase wallet sends bitcoins to another Coinbase wallet (through email instead of a bitcoin address) the transaction is off blockchain, so it doesn't require confirmations and it is instant.
In other words, a Coinbase wallet to Coinbase wallet transaction is 100% secure with zero confirmations.
Again; this only works when one Coinbase wallet sends bitcoins to another Coinbase wallet.
So you can offer your clients "faster" service by using Coinbase or wait for the normal 6 confirmations (one hour) through Bitcoin Core or whatever. You will still hold the coins, though. You won't be changing them to fiat.
UPDATE: I forgot to mention. Coinbase will email you whenever you get a new transaction. The transaction will include the client's email. So you get zero confirmations and you know exactly when you get the coins and who sent them.
If this works for you, be a pal and send a tip to 1N5h1CZsM4rKbuQGHuP62EuPzCk7AaCpBs

So you're saying you want to pretend somebody from another country gave you bitcoins that you in fact bought and then exchange them for USD and claim you owe nothing in taxes?
There's one problem with that plan: if the IRS decides to audit you, most likely you will have to show them your bitcoin addresses. When they see the "foreign clien" got the bitcoins from your own wallet -as all bitcoin transactions are public- you'll be in BIG trouble for tax evasion.

As  gentleman here said, the price will go up sometime in early 2015 after New York implements the bitcoin regulations that will give investors the certainty they need to really invest in digital currencies.
This isn't a prediction. It is just plain old common sense. Ask any serious investor and he will tell you the same: the one thing that keeps investors from getting seriously into bitcoin is the lack of regulations.
Right now the bulk of the bitcoin trading takes place in China. Because of rampant speculation in China, mostly shorting, prices will be low.
For bitcoin to take off there has to be a counterpart to Chinese speculation. That counterpart could happen in the US, but it will not happen until there's a regulatory framework. New York is working on it.
The New York regulations must be in place sometime in late January. After that the market will slowly rise again because now New York investors will have the certainty they will not lose tons of money with something like the collapse of Mt. Gox.

Bitcoin can't "die" from a 51% attack. Most likely, Ghash.io will shut itself down to prevent that from taking place.
And by the way; there's no point in jumping to another coin. No other coin has the mining infrastructure nor the widespread use as a form of payment as bitcoin. You would be buying coins nobody uses and very few people mine.
Oh, and by the way. The only thing a 51% attacker can do is double spend his own coins and not coinfirm some transactions. That won't kill bitcoin. As I said, Ghash.io would probablt shut down whoever is behaving like a prick and shut down some of his hashing power to keep other pricks from doing the same.

After spending your entire instant-buy limit, Coinbase increases the amount for your instant-buy every day until it reaches the 1000 limit again. It usually takes about a week.
However, you can buy bitcoins without instant buy for the current price and you will receive them in about 4 business days at the price you bought them 4 days before. So if you're buying the bitcoins to save them, you might as well buy more than 1000 at the current price and wait 4 days.
The only caveat is, there's no way to know if in 4 days the price of bitcoin will be higher or lower. 
If it goes up you saved money. But if it goes down it doesn't matter because you would only be able to buy less than the instant-buy limit anyway.

The only way to make sure you are sending coins to the correct address is by double checking with the recipient before sending.
If what you mean is you want to know if it is possible to find out if the correct address got the coins, then you can check the address history in blockchain.info. If the transaction from your address appears in the recipient's history, then you used the right address.

Go to  for a tutorial on how to make an encrypted paper wallet.
Then, once you have it, test it by sending 10 cents to the wallet. Then check the public address using blockchain.info. If the 10 cents are there, the wallet works and you can send the rest of the coins.
Now, regarding your keylogger paranoia, you can try some of the following options:
1. Reformat your computer. Technically you could simply run a virus scan, but if you have to, reformat the hard drive, install your operating system and programs, and do the encrypted wallet.
2. Buy a cheap netbook. Buy one of those 200 dollar netbooks and use it only to handle your encrypted wallets and other transactions. Plug it to the web only when necessary. Run an antivirus, of course. Thus, you will minimize hacking attempts.
3. Use a mobile wallet app. If you do not want your keystrokes logged on a computer, sweep your encrypted private key with a wallet app such as Coin Pocket or BreadWallet. You will enter the password on your iphone or ipad, but not on your computer. Then send the coins to another encrypted wallet and that's it.
And no, an unencrypted paper wallet not only is not hackproof, but it is downright more vulnerable to stealing than having a virus. Anyone with a smartphone can take a photo of the wallet and then sweep it. Only encrypted wallets with a strong password are hackproof.

The coins were sent to this address:
Which then sent a total of 15 coins to a bunch of addresses.
As to how the coins were stolen I can think of a couple of scenarios:
1. You used your BitcoinTalk for everything. If the hacker got a hold of a secondary email address with that address, he got access to your primary address and from there he could get into the 2FA.
2. The people who created the vanity address with 1Hero did not encrypt the private key an the key was stolen. Or they did encrypt it but they generated the passphrase. Thus, if the passphrase was stolen the key was vulnerable.
The lesson here is make your own encrypted key and use a different password for everything.

No. Un bitcoin es una moneda distinta al dolar. Un bitcoin cuesta alrededor de 470 o 480 dólares. Te piden 100 dólares pero pagados con bitcoin. A precios actuales eso equivale a 0.2092 bitcoins.
Yo también soy de Mexicali pero ahora vivo en el DF. Dudo que encuentres un cajero bitcoin en Calexico o inclusive en El Centro o en Imperial. Además no te recomendaría usar un cajero bitcoin. Te suben el precio como 6%. Creo que son mejores opciones Bitso, Volavit o MexBT. El que me pareció más completo fue Bitso.

Problem is, you can't hack the blockchain. You can figure out a pass phrase for a wallet. Or you can steal a wallet and, if unencrypted, move its coins. But you can't just "hack it." Not in the way Mark Karpeles claims the Gox coins were stolen through tx malleability, which requires social ingineering or at least a really poorly programmed website and several attempts at claiming a transaction didn't go through.
However, I'm willing to entertain the possibility that somebody was successful in stealing the Gox wallet.
But I'm also willing to entertain the possibility that Karpeles is trying to make us believe the coins were truly stolen so he can keep them for later use without rising red flags.

HD wallets are different than conventional wallets in the sense that the seed words are the basis for all of the keys that will be created for the wallet.
Therefore, you can't really bip-38 encrypt the private keys as they can be recovered with the seed words.
Is that less secure? No. A hacker would have to figure out the words in order to get into your keys. And since we're talking about a combination of several words, and you have to run the entire dictionary each time in order to guess the correct combination, the chances of figuring out the seed are too remote to worry about it.

Print both. Doesn't hurt to have a backup copy of your public addresses in case you want to use them later to receive bitcoins. The public key will allow you to retrieve the bitcoins, but without the public key you can't tell people where to send you bitcoins.
That being said, if you import your private key in the future, you can create new public keys. It depends on what you want to do with the paper wallet. If you're not adding any more bitcoins to it, then you don't need the public key.
Still, as I said, it doesn't hurt to have a copy of the public key.

You don't secure your wallet.dat file with a password, but with a passPHRASE 18 with characters or more. And you don't type it; you copy and paste it from a USB drive used temporarily whenever you need to send coins. You can't keylog a copy and paste.
Now, you only need the passphrase in Bitcoin Core for sending coins or for changing the passphrase. That means most bitcoin users don't use it very often.
And if you enjoy your paranoia, you always copy a single letter to erase the password from the memory after sending coins.

Coinbase is first and foremost a wallet. You can store your coins in a Coinbase wallet. If you use 2 factor authentication, your coins will be very secure.
Coinbase is also a bitcoin broker. That means you can buy and sell bitcoins through Coinbase if you live in the US and 13 european countries where Coinbase will start operating.
Paraoind bitcoin users recommend that after you buy your coins from Coinbase you transfer them to an encrypted paper wallet etched onto a metal plate and then hide the wallet in a nuclear bunker several feet under the surface of the earth and then never, ever, ever, expose the wallet to the internet because, oh no!, somebody might hack it.
I recommend that you buy your bitcoins with coinbase and then, if feel like storing them yourself without having to rely on Coinbase as a wallet, you transfer them to an encrypted wallet. Doesn't matter if it is a paper wallet or if it is an encrypted wallet.dat file from Bitcoin Core.

I live in Mexico City, so I can tell you first hand what goes on in the developing world:
1. The price of bitcoin is not relevant, as you can divide bitcoin to millionths of a bitcoin. Thus, if bitcoin prices go up, people in the developing world can buy fractions of bitcoin and keep more or less the same value in local fiat.
2. The point of bitcoin is not to be rich, but to have an alternative to traditional baking systems. In Mexico, for example, Spanish banks make more money in banking fees than in Spain. All credit cards have an annual fee and interest rates for a Walmart credit card (there is one in Mexico) are huge. Therefore, bitcoin allows people to keep more of their own money instead of using it to pay bank and credit card fees.
3. It is true that most people in the develiping world use pirated software, but they also use pirated antivirus suftware. People in developing countries are poor, not stupid.
4. Ordinary people can use a secure bitcoin online wallet such as Blockchain.info, which uses OTP type security, and not worry about it. However, I do agree that people not just in the developing world, but everywhere should be more educated on internet security issues. That's not a developing world problem. That's a global problem.
5. Again, you CAN "get into the action" in the developing world. It's just a matter of informing people on best practices for security, which is not that hard.

After the Mt.Gox fiasco I doubt any other exchange will "lose" coins. Not if they want to keep their customers, as new exchanges will open in a few months in the US.
The value of the coins is another story. You need more demand in order to have a higher price for a smaller supply. Right now we are at stage in which people panic sell for no reason. That drives the price down. Bitcoins will only rise in price if there's a limited supply and higher demand.
So until people learn not to panic sell without a valid reason, those conditions won't be met.

The procedure for opening an account on Coinbase is to open the account through a computer, not the app, as the app is limited.
Indeed you need to register your bank account, credit card, phone number AND get your identity validated before buying bitcoins instantly. You must validate your identity in order to comply with anti-money laundering laws.
The whole procedure takes only minutes if done correctly.
Once you register bank account, CC and validate your identity and add 2-factor authentication for security, you can buy a limited amount of bitcoins instantly. About 100 dollars per week. 30 days after your firs purchase the limit is raised to 1000 dollars worth of bitcoin every week or so.
The problem in your case was not bitcoin. You just didn't follow the procedure and you didn't inform yourself on the full procedure before using Coinbase.
Trust me; Coinbase is a lot less cumbersome than Bitstamp, which requires you to email them a scan of your passport and a scan of a bank statement. But you have to follow the rules.

The price will stay in the 350-ish to 450-ish range until late December. Then it will go upwards of 600-ish.
The reason for this is the New York bitcoin regulations. Investors are waiting for those regulations in order to get into bitcoin. That is their main demand: regulation so they can have certainty in their investment.
The NY regulations will be implemented by January 2015. A week or two before the implementation the price will go up again.
Honestly, it's a moot point to worry about the price right now. Bitcoin already plunged to 300-ish earlier this year and then it bounced back. Guess what was the trigger for the bounce? Yes: regulations.
So enjoy cheap coins and stop yer bitching and moaning abour the price. It really is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:14:23
Yes. But it depends on how much bitcoin you send.
Lets say you have 0.5 in address A and 0.3 bitcoins in address B within the same wallet.
Now lets suppose you need to send 0.6 bitcoins. The full amount from one address will be used for this transaction and the rest will be taken from the other address.
When the received sees the transaction in the blockchain, he will be able to see you actually used two addresses for the transaction. Thus, he will be able to know you control both of those addresses.

It means those coins can never be spent because the private key for them is lost.

No, it does not. Inflation is an arbitrary increment in the money supply. Bitcoin is designed to reduce its supply every 4 years. From 2009 to 2013 you could mine 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes. Now you can only mine 25 per 10 minutes. And every four years the amount of bitcoins that can be mined halves. Plus the difficulty increases. That's deflation, not inflation.

1. A bitcoin wallet program is different from Coinbase in the sense that you control your private keys with a program. You don't control your private keys with Coinbase. Also, a program stores the keys in your computer so you can acces the coins directly. You can only access the coins in Conbase through the Coinbase website.
2. Both of them are safe if encrypt the wallet in the local program and if you use 2 factor authentication for Coinbase and a Gmail account associated with the Coinbase account.
3. Public key has fewer characters than private key. Both, the program and Coinbase will let you create public keys that you can give to others for payments.
4. There is zero risk in giving out public keys. That's actually how bitcoin works. If you don't let people know what your public key is, they can't pay you.

There many factors, but the three main culprits are:
1. Many chinese buyers left the market when the Chinese government imposed different bans on bitcoin trading.
2. Mark Karpeles's shennanings at Mt. Gox pumping the price artificially.
3. Speculators who realized they could short bitcoin and make a buck by making the price go down.
The antidote is more people buying and using bitcoin. But that won't happen until bitcoin gets regulated.
The good news is bitcoin will be regulated by january 2015 in New York.

Bitcoin will hit the 1000 mark only after New York releases its regulations for bitcoin and more bitcoin companies (ATMs, stores, exchanges, etc) attract more people to bitcoin. Their deadline is june 30. So I would expect a jump in bitcoin prices to 600-700 dollares in July, but the 1000 mark will be within sight till december at least.
I do not see the 5K mark in 2014. Maybe in late 2015.

1. Circle is a BROKER. You use it to buy and sell coins. You may leave the coins there if you want, but you don't have to. I would personally send them to a personal wallet instead of leaving them in Circle as their wallet by itself is pretty crappy.
2. The price is about the the same on either Coinbase or Circle. What I'm going to do is open Coinbase and Circle at the same time. If both have the same price, then I'm using Circle to avoid the 1% fee from Coinbase. But if the price is lower in Coinbase even with the 1% fee, then I'm using Coinbase.
3. There's no such thing as "bank like functionality" in Circle. It's the same thing as Coinbase, but minus the 1% fee and minus the merchant tools, but without the initial Coinbase limits.

According to The Guardian:
"Under the new rules, paying for a beer in bitcoin would be a taxable event with the buyer having to work out if they had made any capital gain on the asset they had just sold."
I would assume that's when you buy bitcoin. But what if you mine bitcoin or get paid in bitcoin? The IRS says if you mine it it's considered self-employment income. But if that's the case, then if you buy the beer and discuss business with somebody else, it's a business expense and thus a deduction. So how is the IRS going to tax a transaction that's considered a loss for tax purposes? Loss and capital gains at the same time?
I think the IRS opened a huge can of worms.

The purpose of the site is to make cold storage as user-friendly as possible.
I decided to create the site after Blockchain.info went offline because of a database problem. Seems to me the best way to secure your bitcoins is using a combination of cold storage and some hot storage for day-to-day use.
However, I have been unable to find a single site with more than one tutorial on how to create encrypted, cold storage wallets and encrypted paper wallets.

I trust Coinbase. They have some of the best coin security out there.
I see two advantages:
1. Coinbase pays the transaction fees if the amount of bitcoin sent is more than 0.001 bitcoins.
2. You can seel the coins quickly instead of having to wait a full hour for 6 confirmations.
Since I hardly ever sell my coins, number 2 doesn't really apply to me. Since I move coins every once in a while, option 1 does.

Here's what you're forgetting:
1. The 51% attack is only theoretical and its potential damages are minimal. Miners in the control pool would be able to double spend or reject valid transactions. That's it. Plus, no pool in its right mind would allow such a thing because it would devalue its earnings.
2. Bitcoin security is relatively easy: just encrypt the wallet or the private key. Encrypted wallets and keys cannot be hacked if a good password is used. The issue is not securing the coins, but securing your computer. That's an issue that has nothing to do with bitcoin.

Nobody said it would be 10K by now. The most outlandish estimation was around 5K by December. The most feasible estimation? 1.5K by December provided new bitcoin exchanges, ATMs and bitcoin service providers for the general public start operating this year in New York after Ben Lawsky releases the New York bitcoin regulations.
For now, the price is down due to Chinese rumors. It already happened last year when China banned payment processors from conducting business with bitcoin exchanges. Price rebounded within a month.
In this case the price will go up after April 15. There won't be any more Chinese rumors and people in the US will have more money to spend on bitcoin because of their tax returns.

No. Merchant adoption and hashrates are not at fault. 72% of bitcoin transactions are conducted in China in Yuan. Only 21% are conducted in US Dollars.
Therefore, merchans in the US accepting bitcoin can't possibly be the reason for the price drop.
The real reason is speculators shorting bitcoin.
Some exchanges allow speculators to borrow bitcoins for free. They sell them right away and then re-buy them when the price drops, thus making a profit.
For this to happen, and to generate a large profit, the price of bitcoin has to go down on a continuous basis.
Why are speculators shorting bitcoin? Because investors are not buying coins until the NY regulations are in place. Thus, the price keeps going down instead of up so speculators can make a profit.
That means that by January 2015, when the bitcoin regulations are implemented, the drop in price will stop and the price will go up again.

Depends on the situation. If you just add bitcoin the same address, then you probably don't need to back up the wallet.dat more than once.
However, if you spend coins, and change addresses are created, you will need to back up the wallet after every transaction in which a change address is generated.
It's not a big deal to backup the wallet. the "back up wallet" option is right in the main menu.
If you don't want to bother with backups, then you may want to consider a hierarchycal deterministic wallet, such as Electrum (for PC), Breadwallet (iOS), or Hive (Android).

The price decline started with the doxing of Dorian Nakamoto. Then the price went up when it was clear Dorian wasn't the real Satoshi Nakamoto. And then it plunged when the Gox coins were moved.
My guess is somebody wanted to buy cheap coins, noticed the Gox coins moved and used the info as a way to cause a panic sell.
Because lets be frank; it would be idiotic to sell thousands of coins right now when in a few months the price will go up after New York establishes regulations for bitcoin that can potentially expand the market cap.

First of all, keep in mind a hot wallet should be just for day to day spending. Therefore, it should be separate from your main Coinbase account and only have a limited amount of bitcoin, so if something happens to the phone, you're not screwed.
That being said, my personal favorites iOS wallets are:
1. Breadwallet. It's the simplest, easiest wallet for iOS out there. However, it has zero security features. Not even a password. It has a long passphrase made with several words so you can recover the wallet but that's it.
2. CoinPocket. Same thing as Breadwallet but it lets you see your private key.
3. Hivewallet.com. This is a HTML5 based wallet so you can only use it with Safari. It's very simple and it asks for a 4 digit PIN. It also lets you send and receive litecoin. However, it's fairly limited. I haven't figured out how to make it read QR codes, for example.
5. Coinbase.com. DO NOT use the unofficial Coinbase app. Instead, use the mobile version in Safari. Just open a new Coinbase account with a different email address. Transfer whatever amount you feel like spending from the main account to the second account. You won't get charged a miner's fee because it's done internally in Coinbase.  Go out, spend coins using the second account. Go back home and transfer back whatever was left to the main account or leave it in the second account for the next time you go out. The mobile version of Coinbase will let you scan QR codes and do pretty much everything you can do in the full version.
The plus of using a second Coinbase account is nobody will be able to know you have a wallet installed if you lose your phone. It also asks you for username and password, not just a 4-digit PIN. And because you have a limited amount of coins, it's not a risk. Use 2FA for your main account, though.

All of the sudden everybody is bashing not bitcoin itself, but INVESTMENT in bitcoin.
Sorry, but I don't buy this piece of FUD. A level-headed investor would not something like that. Investing in bitcoin takes into consideration the future prospects of the currency. That means thinking ahead to january 2015, when the NY regulations are operational and more investors are putting money into it.
So nice try, but I'm not selling my coins.
By the way; Unless you bought bitcoin at the end of November 2013, you didn't lose money.
And guess what: I bought bitcoin when it was 940 each and I still have no regrets. Buying more coin during the Gox crisis took care of that. Now my purchase average is under 600. So by January 2015 the investment will pay off.
What I'm saying is just because you were expecting to get rich quick, but didn't know how to manage your money, it doesn't mean there's something wrong with bitcoin.

In my opinion right now is the best time to invest in bitcoin as its price is almost at its lowest point. By january, once the NY regulations are in place, it will probably go up.
If I had 10k I would put some of it in a bitcoin interest-yielding yubibao account from bitvc.com; some of it I would live it in an encrypted wallet (see  for details on how to do that) and some of it I would use it to trade switching from bitcoin to dollars and viceversa at bitreserve.org

That article is FUD. This is why:
1. It makes the valid point that Houbi is not regulated, but then again bitcoin in general isn't.
2. It makes the valid point that Huobi does not have deposit insurance like the FDIC insurance American banks have. But Houbi is not based in the US. It is based in Hong Kong and it follows the rules and laws of China.
3. It makes the valid point that an investment with a 16% APR is very risky. But bitcoin has been a very risky investment in general since day one.
Now, personally I'm puzzled as to why all of the sudden there's so much doubt in r/bitcoin regarding Houbi's fixed term financial product. Here's why:
1. It does not involve fiat. It only involves bitcoin and it pays interests in bitcoin. Wasn't that the libertarian wet dream?
2. You are told up front what the money will be used for (expanding Hubi's mining operations) and how they will pay you back (using bitcoins mined by Houbi's existing mining operation.) You can see the address where the new mined coins are being deposited. It seems to produce an average of 35 coins per day. That means the mining operation can produce more than enough coins to pay back the 2000 invested coins and interests in 60 days. So the risk is actually very low.
3. Huobi has proven to be one of the most successful bitcoin companies in the world, even surviving pressure from the Chinese government.
So, again, I just don't get why some people are trying to bash Huobi for offering profitable financial products IN BITCOIN with full transparency.
SPECIALLY when a whole bunch of people in r/bitcoin have been bitching and moaning against bitcoin regulation. You want a bitcoin economy with no regulations? Well, Houbi is doing just that; offering financial products without US regulations.
So either stop pretending you don't want bitcoin regulations, or stop pretending you dislike fiat and prefer bitcoin.
And by the way; every single time bitcoin takes another step forward there's always somebody bashing it with FUD. If you're going to help those who use FUD, then don't complain if the price of bitcoin stays under 500 bucks.

1. Open a new account on Blockchain.info.
2. Blockchain will show you a Twitter buttoin offering you free bitcoin for tweeting about the site. If you use it once it will give you about 0.0005 bitcoins.
3. Send the 0.0005 bitcoins to your Multibit wallet. You will have to pay 0.0001 bitcoins in transaction fees, so you will end up with 0.0054 bitcoins in Multibit.
4. Send the coins to the wallet of your choice and pay the 0.0001 transaction fee. You will end up with 0.0053 bitcoins in the new wallet.
5. Now tip me 0.0002 bitcoins for solving your problem. After paying the 0.0001 fee you will end up with your initial 0.005 bitcoins. Here's my address: 1N5h1CZsM4rKbuQGHuP62EuPzCk7AaCpBs

That's a good point. But then lets say you mined 7 bitcoins. That's 3,500. If you have a middle class income, most likely you will pay 20%-25% income tax. That means you're paying 700 to 875 bucks or less depending on your deductions.
So you sell 1.5 bitcoins (at 500 per coin) and you cover your taxes. You still have 5.5 bitcoins and they may appreciate over time, so you could potentially recover your tax loss.

Because the centralized trusted third parties are the only ones making money. And the ones who do not get into it are just giving them their money. Your bitcoins will not be worth more until a lot of people buy bitcoins are centralized trusted third parties known as EXCHANGES. You do not need centralized third parties to make transactions, but you do need them to give value to your coins. Otherwise, good luck waiting for bitcoin to go back to 1,200 USD.

Always make at least 2 backups and store them in different places. But beofore your do it, encrypt the wallet. No point in having backups of a wallet anyone can open.
But if you mean backing up the wallet over time, then the recommendation is to back it up every time you create new addresses.
Which means not just every time you create a new public address, but every time you spend coins and a change address is created for it.
So if you spend coins daily, then back up daily. If you spend coins every week, then every week and so on.

You can't buy bitcoin with a prepaid card. The only way to buy bitcoin is:
1. With a bank account.
2. With cash at a bitcoin ATM after giving the machine a palm scan, a scan of a government-issued photo ID and a cel phone number.
3. With cash face to face with somebody willing to sell you bitcoin in person. 
What puzzles me about this question (which shows up every-single-day on this sub r) is this: are the people asking this question underage and thus can't verify an account at Coinbase? Or are they adults looking for a way to launder money?

Not sure I'm understanding this. The price for sending your girlfriend money was high because you purchased the bitcoins at the Volabit rate or because your GF exchanged the BTC at the Volabit rate?
Try Bitso. I think they have a lower rate than Volabit:
You can do the same stuff you do with Volabit (SPEI, Oxxo, etc), but they do ask you to verify identity and residence.
Also: Unless you are handling both sides of the trade, coordinate with your GF so she can change the coins to pesos as soon as she gets them, thus avoiding the volatility.

Dude, just encrypt your private keys and save them wherever you want. Encrypted privated keys can't be cracked, so you can actually show them to other people -if you must- and they will still be safe.
Oh, and by the way: if everybody uses 123ABC over and over, private keys will no longer be safe. The point of cryptography in bitcoin is not for you to remember the private key, but to keep others from cracking it.

There are similar laws in Mexico. The reason for those laws is to prevent psichogical pressure from discouraging people from going to the ballot stations. After all, what's the point in voting if you already know who's going to win, right?
But here's where cryptography can change that. With a blockchain based electoral system the following can be achieved:
1. Remote voting. Since you can vote from home, even if you feel like the other guy is winning you no longer have the "what's the point in getting out of the house" attitude. You can still vote from home and see if your guy turns the result.
2. Immunity to poll manipulation. Since the votes are monitored in real time, there's no way to manipulate the public with a fake exit poll. The results will show you in real time who's winning in complete vote totals. This will not discourage people from voting. On the contrary; it will encourage to vote remotely.

Coinbase is doing what the law requires them to do, which is do their best to prevent the use of money for illegal activities.
So no, they won't let you use TOR and they will get suspicious if you use the coins for gambling. Otherwise they can be charged with accessory to commit a crime.

Question 1: No, you can sell any amount of bitcoins at any time at exchanges such as Bitstamp and BTC-e because the echange is not paying for the coins. The exchange only pairs you with buyers. Coinbase, on the other hand, has limits on the amount of bitcoins you can sell because they are a broker.

Well, price went up when bitcoin purchasing was not too easy. Now it is easier than ever to buy bitcoin, but the price keeps going down.
I stick to my shorting argument. When speculators saw bitcoin prices stagnating they only saw one possible way to make a large profit; shorting.
Shorting won't just stop the upward pressure; it will create a downward pressure, as you can't make a profit out of shorting unless prices fall.

It doesn't matter where you store the wallet if it is well encrypted.
Having said that, if you enjoy your paranoia then try these magical places to store the laminated copies of the encrypted wallet:

2. Inside your 3-year-old, expired box of condoms you have never used (Ok, that was uncalled for, but it was funny, ain't it?)
3. Tattooed next to your balls. However, if you spend the coins you will have a useless tattoo of a QR code nex to your balls.

The recent crash was caused by margin trading and some shenaningans at BTC-e. Gox has nothing to do with it.
As per the Gox coins being bought with fake money, I don't buy that story. Gox asked for a scan of your passport, a bank account paper statement and another proof of ID in order to let you put money into the system. Had somebody created a fake account, he would've been found quickly and his BTC address could be tracked right away.
Gox fell because of the owner's greed and stupidity. He actually tried to get away with blaming bitcoin itself for the site's problems (the "transaction malleability" issue) even though it was easy to patch.
By the way; given the fact that people are reporting problems withdrawing money from BTC-e, it seems unlikely some bitcoin thief sold a bunch of coins in that exchange, since he would not get paid.
Most likely -in my opinion- somebody at BTC-e realized you can make money off marging traders by screwing them over with forced margin calls.

I didn't miss it. In fact something like that took place in Mexico in the 90s and it wasn't pretty.
When large banks buy each other the conditions tend to be worse. HSBC bought Bital bank in Mexico in the 90s and now HSBC is the bank with the higher fees in Mexico.
Towards 2006 retail stores such as Walmart, Elektra and Coppel got permits to form their own banks and now they have the highest interest rates for credit cards (up to 70%).

If you are Houbi, it's an easy way to get capital for a mining farm that will generate over 800 bitcoins per month.
If you are an investor, in order to get more bitcoin.
The thing is Houbi already offers interest-paying saving accounts for bitcoin. But their APR is about a little under 6%, which is not that bad compared to a regular savings account in the US. But the APR for the Dig-VC shares is 1.2 per month, which is 14.4% per year. Basically what credit cards charge for unpaid balances.
So inverstors make 2.5 times more intest IN BITCOIN per month from Dig-VC than from a regular savings account from Houbi.

The real reason why Apple Pay will fail is because you need an Apple Pay terminal in order to read your phone. Who is going to pay for it? The merchant? Why would a merchant want to do that if they can charge bitcoins using a paper QR code?
Paying for a payment terminal that only works for a fraction of the smartphone users (not even all of the iPhone users) is ridiculous if you consider iPhone users probably alredy have a plastic card with them anyway and can use it if no Apple Pay terminal is available.
Think about it. You just bought your iPhone 6 and just plugged your credit card to it. Now you go to the coffee shop next door and they don't have an Apple Pay terminal. What now? Well, what else? You pull out your PLASTIC CARD and pay your check.
Apple Pay gives no incentive to merchants and its incentive for users is weak at best. It will fail misserably.

Business do not want to empower people. They want to make a profit out of people.
But that's not the worst part.
Western Union makes money taking unreasonable chunks of hard earned money from poor and low income migrants in the US who have no choice but to use WU, or other services like WU, to send money to their families in their countries of origin. That in itself is morally wrong and it must end.
Paypal will let you play with them but only as long as you comply with their rules. If you sell comic books, for example, and they don't like the content of the comic books -say you sell vintage copies of underground comic books from the 60s and 70s with content they don't like- they can shut down your account without an explanation.
That is also morally wrong in itself and it must end.
Bitcoin takes away the power from a handful of companies that make a profit charging outrageous fees for money transfers and gives it back to the people. When most stores in the US and other countries accept bitcoin for goods and services, no company will be able to profit from the needs of poor people trying to send money to their families. And no company will be able to tell you what can you and what can't you sell online as long as it is legal to sell it.

Braintree is a payments processor. If a merchant wants to accept credit cards they can do so by contracting Braintree to handle the payments.
Now Braintree has partnered with Coinbase so merchants using Braintree can accept bitcoin along with credit cards.
Paypal will not accept bitcoin. Paypal owns Braintree and Braintree will accept bitcoin, but the main Paypal service does not accept bitcoin.
It is unclear when or if Paypal will use bitcoin. Paypal executives have shown some interest in bitcoin, but only verbally.

True. The guaranteed return after 60 days for this particular investment is 0.024 bitcoins. At current prices that's 11.61 dollars. But in 60 days if the price of bitcoin goes back to 520 or higher, the interst would be 12.48 or higher, as the interest is paid in bitcoin, not in fiat.
To put it another way: if you were to invest 484 DOLLARS today in a bond that pays 2.4% in 60 days, you would get 11.61 dollars as interest in return no matter what (well, minus taxes). But if you invest 1 bitcoin over 60 days with a 2.4% return, your fiat profit will vary. If the price goes down, your return will be less than 11.61 USD. If the price goes up, your return will be more than 11.61 USD. And as we know, bitcoin has gone up many times over in the last 5 years.
Risky? Sure. But then again, this is r/bitcoin, not r/fiat.

High frequency trading is the result of fron running stock orders using several exchanges. It is not possible for Coinbase to do high frequency trading because there aren't too many crypto exchanges in the US to create the arbitrage necessary for HFT.
HFT is done mostly through exchanges in New Jersey and Chicago through a switch in Jersey, or through dark pools pools belonging to firms like Goldman Sachs.
For Coinbase to do HFT, the echange would need a direct land line to Bitstamp, BTC-e, and several other exchanges. That, of course, is impossible due to fact that most echanges are in Europe or Asia.
HFT will be possible once New York regulates bitcoin and new exchanges appear in that State. Unless a broker does something like a group of guys from a Canadian bank who decided to fight against HFT. Read all about it in Michael Lewis's latest book Flash Boys.
You got a higher pric because bitcoin's volatility changes its price within seconds. By the time you click buy, the volatility already changed the price.
This isn't always the case, though. In my experience with Coinbase, that has happened maybe a total of 3 times over the course of 9 months, and only when the vatility really is high for that particular day.

Not the same. Bitcoin is like cash. There are no banking fraud protection for cash. Escrow would be the closest thing to fraud protection.
Now think about it from the merchant's side of the deal. The merchant gets paid with paypal or credit card and ships the product. A week later he gets a chargeback. He no longer has the producto and he has to pay for the chargeback. Who protects the merchant? Only a bitcoin transaction can protect the merchant, as it is irreversible.

Wait. That's different. You implied the upgrade caused your coins to disappear. If the coins were sent then you probably got malware and you're screwed.
Now, I see 3 issues with your case:
1. You didn't have regular backups of your wallet file.
2. You did not encrypt the wallet.
3. You didn't scan for malware regularly.
The problem, it seems, was poor security practices on your behalf.

Dude, you got it wrong. Shitcoins are worthless. And Ethereum is a JOKE. Capital letters. For any crypto coin to go up in value you need people to actually use it. That means merchants, and a strong mining infrastructure. Only bitcoin has both. That's why it's valuable.
There are ways to invest using bitcoin only, though. I'm not going to tell you what to do with your money, but there is a site called bitvc.com, owned by Chinese exchange Huobi, that lets you invest your bitcoins into a savings account that pays around 6% APR (compunded) in daily interests IN BITCOIN.
That's right; you put in your bitcoins and you get more bitcoin in return.
bitvc.com also offers a fixed term product that pays 2.4% over 60 days and it will offer more fixed term productos in the future, but apparently only to those who have had an account with them for at least 30 days.
So again, I'm NOT going to tell you what to do with your money and your decisions are yours and yours alone, but if you are looking into investing, don't waste your money with shitcoins. Get more juice out of your bitcoins by finding ways to get interests on your bitcoins.
Bitfinex also lets you lend your coins to margin traders and get interests in return. Risky, though.

The value of bitcoin comes from supply and demand and from being a scarce, useful technology.
Since supply and demand determine its value, the more people buy it, the higher its price will be.
It's really simple economics, really. There are a littler over 12 million bitcoins mined and about 1 million users of bitcoin. Its price is about 630 dollars. If 10 million people start buying bitcoin, the price could go up by 10x. If there are 100 million people buying bitcoin, the price could go up by 100x.
Just to give you an idea: There are 400 million people in the USA alone with about 70% of them being middle class. That means there are 280 million middle class americans. If a THIRD of them buy bitcoin, the price could skyrocket to 100x.
And that's in the USA alone. If Europe starts using bitcoin at the same rate, the price could go higher. Same for Latinamerica.
That's not too far fetched. It may happen within the next 2 or 3 years.

You got it wrong.
1. Huobi would need 60 days of mining to get the money for expansion. Instead of waiting 60 days, they simply offered bonds with a high interest they can pay back in 60 days.
2. By offering financial products that actually earn users bitcoin, Huobi is attracting more users and building a more stable bitcoin financial market.
3. The offer was for 2000 shares with a maximum of 50 shares per user. Thus, there's a maximum of 2000 deposits to manage. That's trivial considering all you actually need is a database with a spreadsheet formula. And in the end, less than 100 people bought the 2000 shares, so Huobi is actually managing only less than 100 deposits.

The real potential for these payment pages is in allowing users to build a personal shopping cart/bitcoin store, like amazon does.
If users are able to add several products for sale, instead of just receiving tips and donations, AND a simple interface to search for products (sort of like craiglist) Coinbase will have a huge hit.
If that were to happen, and people are able to sell their products directly on their coinbase personal page AND be able to use a serch directory of personal stores, then eBay and amazon would be forced to consider accepting bitcoin in order to compete.

I think it was more positive than negative, but that's not my main concern. The problem I see is when they interviewed the one guy who criticized bitcoin as a fad, he didn't say why.
Granted, there was no basis for calling bitcoin a fad, but the audience needs to know why.
When Professor Bitcorn said the price would plummet to 10 dollars he have a seudo-explanation: because people would move on to another technological product.
Bitcorn was wrong, of course. There are tens of altcoins and none has replaced bitcoin. Even more efficient coins, like litecoin are far from getting even near bitcoin.
But we understand why bitcorn was wrong becauase he gave a reason. An asinine reason, but a reason nonetheless.
In the documentary's case we never saw any bitcoin detractor explaining why bitcoin would fail. Since there was no explanation, there was also no chance for a response. Thus, there was no debate.
Winning a debate would've made the argument for bitcoin stronger.

A system that matches fiat is doomed to fail because it devalues money.
If you were to use a crypto coin that matches its value one coin per dollar, for example, you would have to spend extra money on the following:
1. Percent fee for purchasing the coins.
2. Miners fees for keeping up a mining network thar verifies transactions.
3. Devaluation by the federal reserve creating more dollars.
In bitcoin those loses are offset by the deflationary design of the coin (only 21 million coins can be mined ever). But in a system in which one coin equals one dollar you can never offset your loses.
Thus, Realcoin is nothing more than another version of PayPal. It is created by a private group; it's not decentralized, and it does not add value to the user.
Thus, why would anyone want to use a coin like that? You might was well use Amazon coins. It's the same.

That's not the point I'm trying to make. What I mean is, new coins can't be sold without a loss for less than 431 dollars each. There are 3,600 new coins created every day. That's over 2.6 million coins per year that can't be sold for less than 431 each for the next 2 years, until the block reward halves.
So the only way bitcoin price can stay below that level is through the sale of old coins mined or purchased between 2009 and 2012. But it is unlikely that will happen any time soon. It would be a bad financial strategy.
The only coins that must be sold out of necessity (to pay for electricity and hardware costs) are new mined coins. Therefore, it seems to me the price floor can't stay below 400 for too long.
That's the point I'm trying to make; the increasing difficulty in mining bitcoins is going to force the price of bitcoins to stay above 400 dollars in a few months if not a few weeks. Otherwise, nobody will be able to mine bitcoins anymore.

The blockchain would be the best way to conduct elections because it is trasparent, can't be altered without consensus, and it works in real time.
Say every citizen of voting age is assigned a cryptographic address and he is given a "coin" for each electoral race by the electoral authorities. The coins can only be used on election day.
The coins can only be sent to addresses assigned to each candidate or election issue.
On election day you can either vote from home or from your cel phone. Or you can go to a ballot station and spend your coins there on a computer through a username and password.
Once you cast your vote the blockchain records the vote as a transaction and it is irreversible and final. Coins can't be moved again.
In doing so, you guarantee the following:
1. The exact amount of votes each candidate receives can be monitored in real time by everybody.
2. Nobody can alter the result nor can anyone stuff a ballot box with fraudulent votes.
3. Vote databases can't be altered, as it happens with the current electronic systems.
4. It makes the process cheaper, as you no longer need to print paper. All you need is a few terminals and an internet conection.
However, the blockchain doesn't keep other forms of electoral fraud from hapenning, such as vote buying and using illicit money for campaigns (the current Mexican president did that).
Still, the blockchain does solve the problem of organizing and conducting an election with full transparency and less cost.

Assuming a low 600s bid for 7 of the 9 blocks, a 900 block and a 750 block, that averages to about a bit over 650 per block.

Well, think about it this way: If the price of bitcoin goes over 6,363, the transaction fee will pay itself. If the price goes down, you lost money with or without the transaction fee.
Thus, why bother to care if you're paying a 1% transaction fee? If the price goes up 2% you'll recover the fee anyway.

If the coin never made it to the blockchain, then the easiest way to get the coin back is this:
1. Backup the wallet.dat to a thumb drive
2. Delete Bitcoin-qt including the entire blockchain in your hard drive.
3. Install Qt again (or Bitcoin Core)
4. Download the blockchain again.
5. Once the blockchain has been downloaded, close Bitcoin Qt (Core).
6. Copy the backed up wallet.dat file to the Bitcoin folder (delete the new empty wallet.dat that was created when you re-installed Qt/core). Keep a copy in the thumb drive.
7. Run Bitcoin QT/Core.
Your coin should show up in QT/Core. Again, assuming it never made it to the blockchain.

UPDATE: ¿Have you tried installing Core in a different computer and then trying the wallet.dat file in the new computer?
Also: You might want to look up in blockchain.info each one of the addresses in the wallet.dat. I know it's a pain but it will give you some insight as to where the coin might have gone. If the coin does not appear as a transaction in any of the addresses, then you still have it.

Krugman's argument is wrong. He suggests bitcoin is some sort of libertarian plot to take money from the gulible, but that's not possible because 72% of bitcoin transactions take place in China in Yuan. Only 21% of transactions are conducted in US Dollars.
So unless Krugman thinks China is the libertarian heaven, or that wealthy libertarians manipulate the Chinese market, his claim has no basis.
Clearly, Krugman doesn't know how the bitcoin economy works. And if he does, he deliberately misleads his readers into thinking bitcoin is a political issue and not an economic one.
Such a shame that the NYT publishes misinformation without asking Krugman to support his claims. Just because he has a Nobel price for economics doesn't mean he doesn't have to prove what he says.

If I'm understanding this correctly, if you mine bitcoin you get taxed as self-employed, which means you can deduct the mining gear and the electricity, but pay up to 39% in income tax.
So if your mining gear cost 2000, and you make 5000 in bitcoin, you deduct the 2000 anyway and pay income tax for 3000.
Capital gains tax would apply to people who buy bitcoin and only when they sell it.
So if last year you bought 1 bitcoin for 900 bucks, but you don't spend it till now, when it's sub-600, you can claim a capital loss of 300 bucks.
But if later this year the price goes to 1500, and you spend it then, you get taxed 15% for the additional 600 bucks your bitcoin earned in price. So your tax is 90 dollars.
This means you will have to do a lot of math and keep track of when you bought and spent bitcoins and what was the price at that moment so you can do the additions and substractions for your capital gains tax.

Coinbase will have to report all of their transactions because they have to report their own capital gains.

You're on the right track but you're not quite there. Some items that should be noted:
1. Did you encrypt the private key? If not, your paper wallet is not secure. If somebody does a forensic check on your hard drive, they can find the files with the key and sweep the coins. Remember; files are not deleted even if you empty the trash bin. They get deleted only if the physical sectors on the drive get wiped or replaced with new data. There is software for physically deleting the hard drive sectors.
2. If you did encrypt the key, and you tested the encryption/decryption correctly, then you need to test the public address first before you move the coins. Send a small amount of bitcoin to the private address first just to check it's working. Say, 10 cents. Check the address in blockchain.info to see if the coins got there. If they did, you can now move the rest of the coins.
More information on creating secure paper wallets here:

I see. The app is generating the addresses then. Well, unless you can send the coins to your actual blockchain.info address, then stop using the app and switch to the Coinbase.com app.

If the IRS runs an audit on you they will get somebody to look up the blockchain.
You are correct on figuring out the address issue. But then the easy solution for the IRS is this: if you moved to coins to another address, and you tell the IRS you don't know who that address belongs to (even though it's actually yours) then the IRS will ask you why did you move the coins. Because when you did, you actually gave property to somebody.
If you say you don't know who you gave the coins to for no reason, the IRS won't believe you. So now the IRS has two options:
1. Charge you with tax evasion.
2. Notify the authorities and investigate you for money laundering.
It's not that simple. You can't just hide bitcoins.

Some thoughts on the comments for the Bill Maher video response:
1. I don't have an opinion regarding Bill Maher or his show. I never watch it. I like The Daily Show with Jon Stewart a lot more. And I don't mind Maher making jokes on bitcoin.
2. What I do mind is getting the facts right. Maher didn't get them right. The thing is his voice has authority for a lot of people -and you can tell by reading some of the comments here- I felt it was important to simply get the facts on bitcoin right not necessarily for Maher, but for his audience.
3. I consider myself a progressive thinker. I have never voted Republican and I never will. I'm also not a libertarian, as I do believe some form of government regulation is needed in order to boost consumer confidence on bitcoin if we want bitcoin to really grow into a mainstream currency with enough power to force big banks into being less abusive. I'm saying this just to be clear on the fact that my beef with Maher is not ideological. All I'm saying is Maher should get the facts right before writing his material.
4. I really don't care if Maher is a "smug bastard." As I said, I don't even watch his show. And I my intent was not for him to see the video, but to use the video as a way to educate people on bitcoin and disperse some of the fog created by the media because of their not getting the facts right on the Mt. Gox debacle. Lets face it: bitcoin has no PR office, so it's up us to set the record straight. I felt it would be more productive not to insult Maher, but simply tu turn his bitcoin jokes into a tool for informing other people.
That said, I really appreciate all of your responses. I'm not interested in picking fights with anyone, so I appreciate, both, positive and negative comments. They both help. Again, my point with the Maher video is to inform, not to attack.

Here's a link to a site with some more tips you might want to consider, including the most important of all (and that you actually missed, by the way): ENCRYPT YOUR PAPER WALLET.
The has-never-touched-the-internet thing, in my opinion, should only apply to people who are downright careless, never install an antivirus, never run a virus scan, etc. If you are tech savvy enough to use Coinbase and install the bitaddress.org software, then chances are you are careful enough not to need a new laptop just for a paper wallet.
However, if you enjoy your paranoia, go ahead and buy the laptop. My guess is it's overkill but who am I to keep you from wearing your tinfoil hat.

The most reasonable explanation points to margin trading and some shenanigans played by BTC-e to trigger a flash crash that, in turn, triggered margin calls, forcing a massive bitcoin sell.
In Margin traders borrow bitcoins from an exchange hoping to sell them at a higher price. But they have to return the coins and interests on the coins.
However, if the price of bitcoin goes below a certain level under the price at which the coins were borrowed, the system will automatically force a sell, causing a big loss to the trader. That automatic sell is what is known as a margin call.
This morning BTC-e had an inexplicable massive BTC dump, plunging the price to 327 USD per coin. That price triggered margin calls for BTC-e's margin trading system, causing another dump and keeping the price low.
To some, myself included, that unexplained intial massive dump on BTC-e smells a lot like somebody trying to manipulate the market so as to screw the margin traders.
Some guy claimed he had 8,000 USD in BTC-e for margin trading. After the flash crash and the margin calls, he ended up with less than 80% of his money.
What's interesting about this is this isn't the first time it happens in the past few days. The Chinese exchange Bitfinex had a similar situation. My guess is somebody at BTC-e could have realized "hey, we can make some quick cash if we just fuck over the margin traders."
It's only my opinion, though.

My source as well. When I added a credit card to my account Coinbase showed me a warning. If the card was used, they would charge an additional 5%. The reason for this is because Visa, Mastercard, etc, will charge Coinbase 5% for the transaction.

Bitcoin is not stock and it used to be worth pennies 3 years ago.
It's very unlikely bitcoin will drop below 200 as the actual cost for mining one bitcoin is around 431 dollars per coin. This means for the 2.6 million coins that will be mined within the next two years can't be sold for less than that or else miners can't operate anymore.
Only the selling of old coins can drop the price to that level. But it makes no financial sense to sell them now if you know that the hashing difficulty will drive the price up regardless.

This is why you should never, ever, EVER trust Trezor. You can have full protection for your coins for free using an encrypted USB and some BIP-38 wallets. Here's how:
As per the coins, since the transaction doesn't seem to exist, my guess is it should be cancelled within a few days (3 days perhaps?). That usually happens when you send a transaction without a miner's fee when a fee is required. Since nobody takes the transaction for verification, eventually the transaction gets cancelled and the coins return to the original address.
And for the love of god, DO NOT USE A TREZOR. You don't need it in order to secure your coins.
@_date: 2014-12-06 05:29:50
Try coinbase.com. They have a pretty good payment system.
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:06:56
If you were to put all of your coins in a single address, anyone can know your total amount owned, which can be a security concern if it is a lot of coin.
By having your coins in multiple addresses, you only reveal the amount available in those specific addresses. That reduces the amount of private information revealed per transaction.
This is actually one of the reasons why sometimes Coinbase can be handy. Since they put most of the coins in cold storage, nobody really knows how much coin you actually have when you spend or receive coins.
@_date: 2014-09-02 19:26:29
I figured the shares would sold out in the first hour. And they did. 2.4% over 60 days is a lot more than what a regular bank account pays. If you were to have a 1000 dollars in a savings account, the bank would probably pay you 2 dollars PER YEAR. With the Dig-VC shares you get 0.024 bitcoins for one bitcoin after 60 days. Depending on price, that means anywhere from 11 to 12 or more dollars just for 2 months of investing.

In 20 internet years there will be other mainstream cryptocurrencies in circulation -other than current altcoins- and probably people will start switching to a different form of coin.
To give you an idea: in 1994 PCs were running on Windows 3, very few people had internet access, and those who did have access at home connected using a telephone line.
That's how far into the future we are now. So in 20 more years I expect something like bitcoin 4.0 and most of the world using it.
What I don't see in 20 years is much use of Paypal and credit cards as we know them. Which is a good thing.
EDIT: jrmxrf is right. Bitcon is also divisible and in 20 years, if we still use the same protocol, there's a chance most people will have bitcoin fractions, as they will increase in value. Not sure the exact same, unchanged protocol will be used in 20 years, though. But that's my opinion.

Not necessarily. The public key is based on the private key, but the public key doesn't know you are creating a private key out of it.
You can create several public keys from a private key. The private key doesn't know how many public keys you created, though, nor does it contain the public keys by default. That is the reason why you should sweep the entire balance of a paper wallet, as the private key can't create a change address.
UPDATE: My mistake. You can't create several public keys from a private key. You can create several private keys from a wallet.

What Huobi did was indeed high-yield and low-risk. The Dig-VC shares are nothing more than bonds for the purpose of obtaining capital to pay for a mining farm.
There are 2000 shares. Each paying 2.4% IN BITCOIN over 60 days. That means Houbi only needs to pay back 48 bitcoins in interests. A total of 2048 bitcoins.
The mining farm can generate around 28 bitcoins per day. So in 60 days the farm will generate 1680 bitcoins.
That means Houbi only needs to pay back 368 bitcoins out of pocket in order to pay for the principal and interests. And Houbi has well over 368 coins, as they have 103% in reserves.
After that, it will only take about 2 weeks for the mining farm to generate the 368 bitcoins Houbi had to pay out of pocket.
The only caveat is Houbi made it very clear they are not responsible if something beyond their control happens to the mining farm, such as floods, fires, earthquakes, uprisings, even meteorites.
But aside from that, seems like a pretty sure bet. Regardless of what the price if bitcoin is, at the end of 60 days you end up with 2.4% more BITCOIN (not fiat) than what you invested.

The blockchain will tell you where the coin came. And if the IRS finds out the origin of the coin you are claiming to be payment for a service turns out to be a coin you paid to yourself, you'll be charged with tax evasion.
The only proof they need is the blockchain and then backtrack your transaction. Doesn't matter how "clean and careful" you are.
If you sold coins, then the IRS can ask you for the source address. Then they can trace where the coins in that address came from. If they figure out the coins came from another wallet you own, you're busted. And there's no way you can hide that.

"Bitcoin can be useful when purchasing from Overstock.com, Tigerdirect, Newegg, and a few local shops on either coast"
And more stores are added every day.
"Bitcoin transactions take up to 10 minutes to process"
Not necessarily. If you pay to a Coinbase account from a Coinbase wallet the transaction is off-chain and thus there's no waiting time.
"Bitcoin is NOT anonymous when you make transactions, but no one can stop you from making them."
Bitcoin is SEUDONYMOUS. It references a cryptographic public key, but no personal information.
"When you decide to enter a bitcoin exchange, you have to "give" your bitcoins to the exchange. And trust that when you decide to withdraw them from the exchange, they will be given back to you. (risky)"
Only if you are going to sell them. If you bought them you can withdraw right away.
"At this point, getting into mining is not feasible at all unless you have access to a supercomputer."
Not quite. It is not feasible to mine on your own with a regular processor, but you can mine with ASIC processors in a mining pool.
"I want to purchase bitcoins and start using them. What is currently the best method for doing so?"
Coinbase.com or Circle.com
"Should I store them on my computer? (keyloggers, hard drive crashes, malware) Should I store them on an online wallet? (giving up control of my bitcoins to a third party). What measures should I take to secure my ownership? (BitGo, USB key etc.)"
If you have a clean environment, an encrypted wallet and an antivirus you have nothing to worry about. But if you are worried about srcurity try this: 
"Can someone convince me that entering a Bitcoin exchange is safe?"
If you doubt, don't do it. You either have the guts or you don't.
"How easily can I convert bitcoins back into USD in the US"

Suppose somebody hacks the USB's firmware. Now the hacker has access to the drive while plugged in.
While having access to the device, the hacker can send himself the contents of the drive.
Since the contents of the drive are a bunch of encrypted BIP-38 wallets, what can the hacker do with them?
Nothing. The hacker wouldn't be able to do a thing with them without the password for the wallets. But since the password is not in the drive -at least I'm assuming people are smart enough not to put the password in the same place as the wallets-, the hacker has nothing.
Thus, even if the USB had security issues with its firmware, it doesn't matter. The coins are still secure. And since you only sweep the coins with a smartphone, you can use them safely.
You may be thinking "well, then the real protection is in the BIP-38 wallets". The answer is NO. The real protection is knowing nobody can physically access the drive without the encryption password in order to get to the wallets (in case the USB gets stolen or lost), AND nobody can access the coins without the encryption password for the wallets (in case the USB or the computer where you plug it gets hacked).
It's a double layer of protection that allows you to store your coins and use them without anyone tampering with them even in a compromised machine.

1. You can generate the private and public keys by downloading the bitaddress.org website and using it offline. Instructions on how to do that here:
Don't forget to tip.
2. The keys are defined by math, not by the blockchain. You can test the private key by sending a small amount of bitcoin to the public address (say, 50 cents). If the transaction appears in blockchain.info, the blockchain knows it's your address and it's ready to use.
3. They are not necessary if you have a secure paper wallet. You can get more tips on cold storage wallets at

The bitcoin protocol does no allow the creation of additional coins because it is descentralized. You need the consensus of 51% of the miners for any changes to the blockchain to occur.
Thus, you can't alter th amount of bitcoins unless you convince 51% of miners to do so, which is not practically possible.

Translation from Spanish: How to send money to Mexico using bitcoin. The article explains how to send money using a Coinbase or Circle account to a Bitso account in Mexico, thus avoiding the 10% or more fees from Western Union or other money transfer companies.
By using this method, users end up paying a 1% to 2% fee (1% using Coinbase and 1% in Bitso, or 0% in Circle and 1% in Bitso), thus for the first time being able to send more money to their families elsewhere in the world because now they don't need to pay high transaction fees. 
The method actually works for any country with a local bitcoin company capable or trasnferring money to a local bank account.

If my phone were to be stolen the attacker would need to get my PIN in order to operate my Breadwallet. That gives me enough time to get the seed installed elsewhere and send the coins to a secure address.
But quite frankly that's besides the point.

By doing that you don't need to worry about the phone being stolen.

I don't think Trezor is safe at all. And at times it feels as though the people at Satoshi Labs are the ones cheering themselves no Reddit. 
Because, honestly, as a security system the Trezor sucks. It's expensive, you can't make backups (not without spending at least 200 dollars) and if it gets broken/stolen/seed lost/etc you're utterly screwed.
It really feels as though Satoshi Labs make money with the Trezor by exploting the paranoia frequently seen in people in the libertarian camp. Well, I call bullshit. There is no need for a Trezor. If the Trezor was the only way to use bitcoin, then bitcoin would not have any practical use. It would be impossible to use on a smartphone and it would simply mean the end of bitcoin as digital cash for every day transactions.

Again, you can't create more bitcoins than the 21 million already programmed. If you try it the network will not validate them and the attempt will be eliminated.
Just as you can absolutely try to double-spend a coin. For the first few minutes the system will show the transaction as being initiated, but as more miners reject the double spend it will no longer exist.
Thus I stand behind my claim that you can't create more bitcoins, as it it requires a system-wide consensus that you can't have without taking controll of the majority of miners.

There's nothing new here. Google Wallet already tried it and failed. There's no advantage in having to take out your phone instead of taking out your credit card and swipe it. In fact, using the phone is a couple of clicks slower than swiping a card.
For Apple's wallet to work there should be a financial advantage in order to incentivize users into not using their plastic cards anymore. But there isn't one. You get charged the exact same amount of money for doing more work at checkout.
Again; iWallet does NOTHING Google Wallet and Paypal haven't already done. It makes no financial sense and it adds more work to the checkout process.
Oh, and on top of that, how can Apple be trusted with personal and financial information if they can't secure a fucking iCloud account so as to keep hackers from taking naked pictures of celebrities and post them online?
If I can't trust PHOTOS to Apple, I can't trust them with my credit cards. Period.

You don't have to use bitcoin QT (now Core). You can always check the status of a transaction by searching your BTC address at blockchain.info.
You can also use an online wallet such as Coinbase or Blockchain.info.

If they are only measuring the most popular pools, then a lot of independent miners and pools are left out. But their hashing exists. Meaning, therefore, Ghash.io CAN'T POSSIBLY HAVE 50% OF THE RATE.

The difference is before Coinbase was just a broker. You could buy and sell bitcoins in Coinbase at their stated price.
Now you can buy and sell bitcoins to other buyers and sellers through coinbase at a price set by you.
For example: now you can go to the exchange and offer to buy 1 bitcoin for 265 USD instead of the 274 current value. If somebody wants to sell to you at that price, you will get the bitcoin at 265 instead of 274.
Or if you want to sell at 780 instead of 274 you offer one bitcoin at that price.
In other words, now the price is a little more flexible than before, but there is no guarantee that somebody will buy or sell at the price of your choice.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:09:13

A private blockchain used only between banks is nothing more than a glorified bulletin board that can be altered by the banks whenever they feel like it.

I suppose this DDoS was a response to one of the Coinbase executives tweeting in support of Mike Hearn. 
Here's my 2 cents: I agree that the block size must be increased. I also agree that the Core developers are playing chicken and they will soon have a major problem if they don't address that issue.
However, I do not agree with the way in which Mike Hearn caused a panic just to pressure the Core developers. He sold his coins BEFORE causing the panic, knowing quite well he was going to royally screw over every single bitcoin holder.
That's not nice. Satoshi Nakamoto left the project without causing a panic. That's the way things should be done. If Mike Hearn don't agree with the way the Core developers are doing things, that's fine. I agree too that something has to be done about the block size. But screwing everybody over a disagreement is really not the right thing to do.
Anyway, lets see how the market behaves after this crash.

Interesting. That means the price should go back up again once the hysteria passes.
As per the block size debate, well, I think it should increase. If the fear is regular computers won't be able to run Core, then the answer is this: computers increase their processing power ever year. It makes no sense to fear a few people will control the blockchain because of block size.
What's comforting about this argument is it can be solved with a code change. In the grand scheme of things it's a much smaller issue than, say, China trying to ban bitcoin.

Yup. Finex had a 36% drop. Thus, this seems to be a Bitfinex issue. Probably a leveraged bet that went really wrong and triggered a chain reaction.

@_date: 2015-08-19 05:41:22
You must be new here. Bitfinex has done this a few times in the last 12 months. The real culprit is margin trading.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:35:18
Not odd. It has nothing to do with the stock markets crashing. The culprit, as usual, is the reckless margin trading at bitfinex and their incompetent conding.
Bitfinex had to halt trading this morning because of this situation. They blamed it on bad coding -which is true- but the code doesn't stop assholes from shorting bitcoin with marging trading.
As long as Bitfinex exists, bitcoin will be at risk.
@_date: 2015-08-22 01:26:58
Bitcoin users unaffected.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:44:55
Another newbie? Dude, this type of flash crash happens a few times throughout the year, but the price always bounces back. If you want your money in fiat values then use Bitreserve or keep it in dollars at Coinbase. You can still spend it as bitcoin, though.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:45:32
I honestly doub it. I think somebody went over his head with his leveraged bets and they got sour, which triggered a chain reaction within Finex, but not everywhere else.
@_date: 2015-08-19 20:54:04


Because Bitfinex allowing reckless margin trading is responsible for two really bad flash crashes. OkCoin is responsible for one flash crash back in April also for margin trading. But the most damaging crashes originated at Bitfinex.
What's really wrong about finex is the fact that they had an almost identical flash crash one year and 4 days before yesterday's crash.
Which means Bitfinex has done nothing to improve their reckles margin trading, thus putting the entire bitcoin ecosystem at risk.
Thus, Bitfinex is the real threat to bitcoin, not Bitcoin XT.


Sure. All reckless margin trading deserves criticism as a threat to bitcoin. The difference I see in OkCoin as compared to Bitfinex is Bitfinex has caused flash crashes twice in 369 days. OkCoin only once and only because of a software glitch that they patched afterwards.
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:30:49
Well, the 300 level was reached in february of 2014 because of the Mt.Gox fiasco -actually it went sub-300- and then in bounced back. But the last time we've seen a market-wide sub-100 price was back in 2013. Ever since the marked has stabilized quite a bit. Now prices are driven by speculation and mining. Sub-100 market-wide is simply not going to happen.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:46:55
Pffft! The price went under 150 in January because of a hack to Bitstamp. Then jumped to 315 6 months later. Settle down. This happens to bitcoin all the time.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:05:08
And it was at 315 a month ago. The significance is the prices bounced back pretty fast. From 162 to 230 at Finex and from 200 to 232 at Coinbase. Within a few minutes I sold at 243, then bought at 220 and right now I'm pretty happy.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:37:48
Highly unlikely. The last time bitcoin went below 100 was years ago. The lowest it has dropped so far was 150-ish in January for a few minutes because of the Bitstamp hack and them to 162 at Finex today. Elsewhere the price has not gone below 200.
The reason is simple: mining bitcoin costs over 200 dollars. It can't stay below 200 for long. Miners won't sell it for under 200.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:25:32
But only at Bitfinex? You can also short bitcoin at other Chinese exchanges. Finex was the only one with the huge drop. My guess is somebody's bet went sour and it triggered a chain reaction. I've seen it before.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:40:25
No. It was one exchange crashing hard. Other exchanges did not go below 220. Coinbase touche pd 200 only for a couple of seconds
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:33:16
The price crash has nothing to do with the stock markets crashing. It is crashing because Bitfinex's reckless margin trading once again caused a massive cascade sell.
As long as Bitfinex exists, bitcoin will be at risk.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:34:39
I would agree if the prices would've nosedived as hard as Bitfinex in all exchanges. Didn't happen like that. Finex has had flash crashes before.
@_date: 2015-08-28 14:52:26
Here's the easy way to do it:
1. Open up an account with Bitso, which is a Mexican bitcoin exchange: 
2. Get the account verified so you can sell the coins for pesos and deposit them to a Mexican bank account. If you don't have a bank account but your MIL does, she will have to verify the bitso account.
3. Buy bitcoins in the UK and send them to the Bitso wallet. I assume you already know where to buy them in the UK. If you don't, try Coinbase.
4. Sell the coins in Bitso (1% fee) and deposit the pesos to her bank account via SPEI bank transfer.
That's pretty much it.
Also: yes, you do need 2 wallets. One for buying the coins and then the Bitso wallet so Bitso can receive them and you can sell them for pesos. Remember: sending bitcoins is nearly free, but it takes 1 hour to fully confirm the transaction. But that's the only way you can send the money to Mexico from the UK.
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:32:29
I beg to differ.
Mining one bitcoin costs a bit over 200 dollars just for electricity.
So if you mine a coin, you're not likely to sell it for under what you spent on electricity. Otherwise, you're losing money.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:53:22
Yeah, Bitfinex users rely on R/bitcoin for makimg key decisions on how to move millions of dollars. I have seen the light.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:10:33
Dude, Bitfinex nosedived to 175 USD. 40K coins changed hands in a few minutes.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:10:14
Probably a leveraged short. Not necessarily a millionaire.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:45:37
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:43:17
No correlation whatsoever. The Bitcoin crash is due to one exchange allowing margin traders to fuck up the entire market. And that exchange is Bitfinex, the Gox of Chinese exchanges.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:23:03
Nope. Margin trading is the culprit for some of the worst crashes we've seen in the past 12 months or so. Always at finex. Only one time the culprit was at Ok Coin and one was a panic because of a hack at Bitstamp.
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:27:54
No. I wrote it after another post titled "What the FUCK is going on at Bitfinex" didn't get posted. By that time the flash crash was over.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:31:37
I really don't think the crash has anything to do with Bitcoin XT. The only exchange that crashed hard was Bitfinex, nosediving to 162 USD per coin. Elsewhere there was drop, but nowhere near as bad. Coinbase went to 200 for like 3 seconds and then bounced back to 220-ish.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:22:13
Coinbase. They did apply for a bitlicense.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:29:24
I posted about it but I guess it got censored because the title whas "What the FUCK is going on at Bitfinex?"
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:46:34
Well, Coinbase did not pass the 200 USD line. It barely touched it for 3 seconds and it then it bounced back. Finex, on the other hand, went to 162. That's way more than a 10% diference between Coinbase and Finex. Besides, it's now above 232. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:38:27

In Bitcoin there are private keys and public keys just like in PGP.
A public key is also known as a bitcoin address.
Thus, all bitcoin addresses are public.
So "public address" is actually redundant.
Public keys are the receiving point. Public keys are the sending point. The public key is derived from the private key. The coins are stored in both of the keys, but only the private key will allow you to sign the transaction to send (spend) the coins.

Getting bitcoins:
1. Open an account at Coinbase.com and get verified.
2. Buy bitcoin.
Waiting or not:
 Be aware that bitcoin has been fluctuating between 220 dollars and 275 dollars in the past 6 months. At this point it is anyone's guess where the price will go. It may go up if there is no solution for ghe Greek crisis. It may go down if it is.
If I were you I would start by opening a Coinbase account and then buy some coin regardless of price. You have to understand that the price of bitcoin went up to 1200 dollars in december of 2013 and dipped under 200 in january of 2015. So there's no "good time" to buy it. Just buy it and see if you feel comfortable. In the end, you can use the Coinbase exchange to buy, sell or trade in order to fend off volatility a bit.
Oh, and DO NOT use a Trezor. If you need to secure your coins follow this tutorial: 
As per leaving your coins in Bitfinex, I would not do it. I trust Coinbase, though.

@_date: 2015-07-06 01:29:14
Ah. Finally a smart reply.
My response regarding fundamentals:
1. Yes, but not nearly enough to sustain a 2013-like bubble.
2. No.
3. This is actually the second time in the year that we've seen a spike in price above 262. I know because I bought some coin a few months back at 262 thinking the uptrend was permanent. Nope. It lasted one or two weeks and then it want back to 240. So I see no reason to belive this uptrend is any different. Unless you get truly more people buying and holding bitcoin -and by that I mean thousands of people- this is a normal mini-bubble.
Think about it this way: today the price went up 9 dollars for less than an hour because of a 1000 coin volume. IN CHINA. None of the European or American markets got even close to that volume.
Thus, I see no reason for "to the moon" hopes.

2. The Greeks can't buy bitcoin and they can't spend it either because few businesses in Greece accep it.

TIP: If you sell through the main Coinbase page ( you will be charged a 1% fee. But if you move the fiat to the Coinbase exchange ( then make an offer above the current exchange price and somebody buys the coins for that price, you don't pay a fee and get more fiat.
OR you can sell the coins for the current exchange price and get charged a 0.25% fee.
The difference is if you sell for a 0.25% fee you don't have to wait for somebody to buy the coins at the price you set.
@_date: 2015-07-06 03:36:51
It's a matter of cost. If it cost less to bail other countries after a Greek bailout, than to devalue the Euro because of Grexit, then they will agree to lower terms with other countries.

If the EU says "fine, we'll bail you with new conditions", that will calm down the markets. Thus the uptrend will stop.

You're not understanding my point. If you create a bubble simply by fooling people into believing to buy into it, eventually the bubble will implode and whatever you were selling will not be trusted anymore. We saw it in 2008. If you make a bitcoin bubble simply by fooling people into believing in a mirage, you will be destroying people's faith in bitcoin in the long term. Under such conditions, bitcoin will never be taken seriously.
In other words, if you think that short term gains at the expense of bitcoin's credibility is a positive thing, you really don't understand what bitcoin was made for.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:22:47
I still don't think so. The rest of the exchanges didn't fall anywhere near as deep as Bitfinex. They reacted to the Finex drop, but that's about it. It looks like it's creeping back to 230-ish.

Economics by delusion? Sorry, that's not sound economic policy.

I expect the price to be hovering 229-ish to 233-ish all week with a possible drop to 220 or a bounce to 240-ish.
Keep in mind this crash was not caused by a dump, but because of a couple of really asinine margin trades that went really wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:48:33

Quick and using cash? LibertyX. On a steady basis with bank transfer? Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:32:05
Well, lets keep some perspective. The price of bitcoin is still way below the pre-Bitstamp hack levels.
So it took a tiny hack for the price to plummet close to 50%.
Now the price is up around 7% because of a major economic crisis.
You would think that something as massive as the prospect of a Euro crisis would shoot the price higher. But no. Just 7%.
So unless we see a truly massive price spike (at least 50%), I'm not ready to declare bitcoin as truly sensitive to economic news.

Yes. But it takes 4 bank days to get the fiat into Coinbase. Once the money gets to Coinbase you can move it to the exchange and buy coins. Same rules: if you offer to buy below the current price and somebody agrees, you pay no fee. But if you buy at the current price you pay a 0.25% fee.

The Google formula is indeed based on Coinbase. However, it is the price from
Coinbase as a broker, not from the exchange. The exchange price is always a bit lower than the broker.
I suppose a solution would be to plug the Coinbase Exchange API into a Google Spreadsheet, but I haven't figured out how that might work. It would be nice to be able to do it. That way you can calculate your trades easily.

Well, it depends on how you want to look at it.
If you were to upload a video to YouTube with with a QR watermark the video can be downloaded and re-edited with a different QR watermark.
However, if you were to discover somebody pirating your video, you can file a complaint with YouTube so the video can be blocked and the pirate's account suspended.
In other words, there's no way you can stop piracy or people editing your video to place a different QR code (most likely, you won't even know if it happens unless you are constantly searching for pirated copies every day).
But you can make sure your users see the code or you address in the video's description, and get donations.
Or to put it another way, you can get bitcoin donations from your audience, but you might lose a bit to piracy. Thus, work on expanding your audience so the donations increase.

@_date: 2015-09-28 18:59:29
Just a heads up for those who got confused because of an article in El Universal newspaper claiming SAT (the Mexican IRS) banned bitcoin. It didn't. It gave bitcoin the same status as cash for transactions deemed as "vulnerable for money laundering" under Mexican law.
Thus, you can't use bitcoin in Mexico to buy a car or a home in Mexico if the price for the transaction is bigger than a certain limit. But you can't use cash either for the same transaction.
For anything else, like paying for food at a restaurant or paying for stuff online, bitcoin is perfectly legal to use in Mexico.
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:53:14
Starbucks in Mexico can read bar codes but not the Fold codes. It can only read the codes from the Starbucks app. Thus, Starbucks is missing the chance for more business from bitcoin users visiting Mexico from the US and other countries.

I too believe the price will go higher. But only because, like in 2013, there's a bot pumping the price. The question is, at what point is the bot going to stop pumping, triggering the next crash. I say 450-ish to 500-ish.

Yes, but if you keep shorting it you're only fucking yourself in the ass. Nothing is a good long term investment if people keep on shorting it. You want bitcoin to work as a long term investment? Sell when it starts crashing and then immediatelt buy back at the lower price. The more bitcoin you have, the more value you will have.
Sheesh... and you have the audacity to tell us you have been shorting bitcoin and now you're worried because the price keeps goin up?
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:09:00
Two possible scenarios:
1. The price keeps rising for the rest of November and then there's a huge crash in early December.

I will sell at any time there's a crash so I can buy back cheaper. That means more coins and more value. I kicked myself for not selling on time during the last crash (when the Greece thing). I could've had a lot more coin if I had sold.
So now I'm selling if I see the slightest hint of a crash and buy back at a lower price.

I wouldn't say this is the last time we've seen the 300 mark. I'd love to think we won't see it again, but something tells me we're going to see a good ol' crash sometime in December that will throw us back to 200.
If I'm wrong, and believe me; I WANT to be wrong, I could care less if a bunch of get-rich-quick people show up here. They'll be gone when they realize you can make more money at the markets sub reddit.

It will hit 350-400 by December. 450 by January and then a huge crash to 200. As always.

Don't worry. When OKCoinBot and HuobiBot -fine successors of WillyBot and MarcusBot- are done pumping we'll be back at 200.

Dear Coinbase: How about offering store space for merchants and compete against eBay? You can offer no fees and the regular 1% fee for fiat conversion. That would be a lot better than selling those creepy gray t-shirts.

Honestly, my wishful thinking is it will go to 1000 and then it will crash hard. At that point I will be able to double my coins selling during the crash and buying back afterwards. But I think the 500 mark is much more realistic.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:58:33
I just did that and there was NO bitcoin. This is a scam.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:42:00
Bitcoin Ticker is the best by far. It lets you plug in the public addresses or the bitcoin amount manually plus the cost of your coins so you can see how much you've earned or lost.
It does not use TouchID, though, but I doubt you'll need it. It's just read only. However, the paid version (1.99USD) has 4-digit password lock.
@_date: 2015-11-03 01:57:12
Personally I'm not selling yet. I'm monitoring BitcoinWisdom.com to see if there's a crash. If there is, I'll sell and then buy back at a lower price.
@_date: 2015-11-02 16:51:23
I believe them. The rally is due to the OKCoinBot and the HoubiBot. Fine successors of WillyBot and MarcusBot. Now the question os when will they be discovered, shut down and the price nosediving. You know, so we can sell and then buy nack at 200.
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:41:38
Except volume at Houbi dropped when volume at Ok Coin dropped. Meaning one bot was using another bot as a reference. The rest of the exchanges followed OK Coin and Huobi. Thus, this bubble is brought to you by WillyBot 2.0. WillyBot: Pumping the price of bitcoin since Mark Karpeles allowed it in 2013.

Look at the bottom of the page. They have the Visa, Mastercard and Amex logos. And bitcoin, of course. What bummed me out is that you can buy t-shirts from Coinbase using a credit card but you can't buy bitcoin from them using a card.

It is a good bit. A swap is a form of insurance against price changes. So lets say you buy 1000 bitcoins at 300 dollars each. If the price goes down you lose money. So you tell somebody willing to insure your coins through a contract "hey, I'll pay you a certain amount of money if you agree to pay me 300 per bitcoin if the price goes down below a certain level."
If the price goes up, or if it stays the same, whoever took the contract makes money because of the fee you're paying him but your coins' value doesn't diminish.
And if the price gors down, whoever took the contract will lose a bit of money for taking the risk, but the value pf the coins is still 300.
What this creates is a situation in which the value of bitcoins always stays either equal or bigger than its initial value at the time of purchase. Being the case, there's a bigger incentive to hold on the coins, thus keeping the overall value of bitcoin stable.
Swaps can be abused, as it was the case with subprime derivatives, but in the case of bitcoin, swaps have the potential to stabilize its price if they are used at sn institutional level and at a large scale throughout the ecosystem in order to control the volatility risk.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:10:37


Well, it does mess up with long and short bets if you start pumping and people start buying as a result. My guess is somebody figured a way to discourage shorters and thus pump the price.
@_date: 2015-03-10 15:50:06
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:00:10
Keep in mind 2013 had an artificial pump at Mt.Gox with the Willy bot. While there are bots pumping the price at OK Coin and Huobi, the pump this time is far less controlled than 2013's.
Thus, seems unlikely there will be a similar pattern.
Also, the 2013 crash started with rumors about the Chinese government banning bitcoin. So far, no rumors have been heard. Yet.
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:01:52
Bullshit. There's no mention at all of bitcoin in that site and it asks you to change your password right off the bat. Probably because they hope somebody uses his email password. That site really feels liks a phishing site.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:18:34
I'm not that optimistic. I've seen this kind of pump before.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:12:25
PRO: 21.8% APR
CON: The interests are only accrued on USD or Euro balances. That means you are essentially selling your bitcoins for fiat and then earning interests on the fiat balance.
So even though a 21.8% APR sounds really nice, I'm not really interested in earning more dollars. I'm interested in earning more bitcoins. Specially now that the price is really low. If the price jumps to 300 again, I'll be pretty pissed off for converting the coins to fiat.

If the transaction is merely storing bitcoins, then the *transaction* is non-financial.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:16:53
If you have an iOS device download Bitcoin Ticker. Then create a new wallet inside the app and add each individual PUBLIC address for each one of your wallets. I reapeat PUBLIC address.
NOTE: This "wallet" in the app is not a regular spending wallet, but simply a "watch wallet" that allows you to see a balance from adding together the balances from any number of public addresses. Nothing more.
The app will give you a total for all of the bitcoins in the public addresses and the dollar value according to the exchange rate of the site of your choice (Bitstamp, Coinbase, etc).
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:29:55
No. Price is important. If bitcoin is to work as a payment form, then price is the difference between using it or not.

He's clearly confused. He thinks bitcoin is an application like Netscape. It isn't. It's a protocol. You can compare bitcoin with TCP-IP and Bitcoin Core with Netscape. Netscape doesn't exist anymore, but TCP-IP does.
So sure, maybe Bitcoin Core *the application* won't be used anymore in 5 years. But bitcoin *the protocol* will still be used with other applications and services.
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:24:45
The short answer is NO.
For that to happen you need:
1. A mining network larger than the current bitcoin mining network to verify the transactions and hijack the public ledger, which is next to impossible for a single person due to cost (several millon dollars in hardware and several more in electricity) unless that person is a multibillionaire, in which case there's no point in hijacking the bitcoin network to "get rich".
2. Replicate each and every one of the existing private keys. This is 100% impossible because they are created with entropy, not with the bitcoin software.
Finally, the bitcoin code is open source and it has been replicated several times to create altcoins, but due to the above restrictions, the best you can do is to create your own altcoin, promote it, and hope it becomes as successful as, say... Litecoin, the value of which is 100 times smaller than bitcoin.

I was eagerly wating for the regs. They will give the bitcoin market more stability and security. The "whaaa whaaa, leave bitcoin alone!!!" (say it like that chick who defended Britney Spears) is 100% certified organic, high-octane bovine excretia. No regs means more Mt. Goxes. I don't want that. I want bitcoin to go to the moon and I want it to be a viable, mainstream payment system that won't drop from 1200 per coin to 160 in little over a year, as it happens now.
That will only happen with regulations. Period.
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:59:11
Nah. Serious investors will tell you they won't touch non-regulated industries. Now that bitcoin is regulated, Lawsky will probably be remembered positively as the guy who regulated bitcoin, thus triggering the industry's growth.

"I've given away much more significant amounts, why should I give you anything?"
Because you clearly wanted to get rid of it regardless of who cracked it. What do you care who gets the coins? There's the address. Go ahead. Knock yourself out.
"I didn't expect anyone to crack it without hints and it appears my expectations were reasonable."
No, they were not. And you know it.
" I've also said that I could crowd source the password faster than it can be brute forced, but I'll leave that to your imagination!"
But you didn't. So go ahead. Send the coins. You don't need a reason and you don't care who gets them.
