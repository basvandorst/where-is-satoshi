You know that the miner still needs to find the block, right?  It's not as though a user can shop around for the miner with the lowest fee.  If they want their transaction included in a timely manner they will need to include a fee high enough that most miners will accept it.

A 1099-B is a standard form filed by various financial services providers and it is perfectly reasonable to expect Coinbase to do likewise.  In fact by suggesting they not be required to do so as well you are basically saying that Bitcoin is somehow beyond the law and exempt from the rules that govern every other investment class available. 
What is unreasonable is the detailed personal and account information being sought by the subpoena.

If it is really him it would be trivial to prove.  All he has to do is sign a message with the private key for the address in question and post it here.

The only way for you to prove it is to sign a message using the private key from the transaction in question.  Nobody, including the miner, will believe you otherwise.  At this point I certainly don't.

No you can't.  Credit card processors won't work with marijuana stores.

That is not at all how it works.  The difficulty of the hash is adjusted automatically so that block times always average around ten minutes.  Individual block times however are random and can occur anytime within a few seconds to possibly an hour or more.

But unless he proves it was he who sent it why should they?  As unlikely as it is, it is possible that the fee was intentional and the original sender doesn't want it back.

Use a credit union.  Not only will you be able to trade freely but you will also no longer be supporting Wall Street banking interests.

They closed your account with just an email requesting they do so?  What is to keep somebody from spoofing email addresses and maliciously closing accounts?
EDIT:  That said, I just sent an email requesting they close my account.

Spoofing an email address is ridiculously easy.

I guess it's time to close that account.  Seriously, what is their value proposition at this point?  A messaging app to send money?  What's the point?  If the recipient won't take bitcoin they probably already have PayPal.

Except their population isn't fleeing.  While new illegal immigrants do continue to cross the borders they are doing so in dwindling numbers and just as many or more are leaving.  The total number of illegal immigrants in this country has been essentially unchanged (it is actually slightly down) since 2009.  Anybody who tells you illegal immigration is on the rise isn't listening to fact based media.
