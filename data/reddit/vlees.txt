Not following the developments very closely, what back-door and what is he supporting now (apparently not core) and why would that other thing give him ownership?

One mined block. Possibly (well, over 1.5 months: probably) more attempted and just not in time for a proper miner to find a next valid block.

I almost commented that site but as it's scam ridden I refrained from doing so.
depends from which country you are, for example when you are from the Netherlands, there are services like bitonic.nl that instantly convert online wire transfers ("ideal") to bitcoin without verification of your age (their terms probably state that you need to be 18 though, but there is no confirmation). Other countries sometimes have similar services that do this (via the respective counterpart of the online wire transfer thing, which makes chargebacks impossible, removing the need to verify identities of buyers for them as seller).
EDIT: Just checked, bitonic also accepts bancontact (Belgium) and MyBank (never heard of that).
EDIT2:  Supports Dutch, Belgian and German instant payment options (unlikely to verify as they use these instant payment services).
 Supports traditional wire transfers (takes some days, no idea about verification)

Don't forget illegal chemicals.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:31:19
Yeah, I was confused, like "that's an odd thing to lie about" because anything above 1mb is enough.
@_date: 2017-01-02 12:32:11
I don't see Core on that site, even when clicking "view all" for Desktop.
Edit: Oh, it's only under "Full". Not under "Desktop".

No, literally, the specification of [iDEAL]( has no notion of charge backs. Verified the transaction via your mobile banking app? Instantly the money is transferred to the counter party with no way to get it back without the seller just transferring the money back manually.
To prevent getting defrauded (from the banks side), unlike PayPal, there is extreme vetting for merchants in this system and the bank insures the purchases and takes the risk of accepting a dubious merchant.
So: no chargebacks -&gt; no need to make sure your customer doesn't try to get the coins and the fiat, as the fiat will never ever be chargebacked, unlike with stuff like SEPA direct debits (instant chargeback the first 90 days, after that still easy), credit cards (call your cc provider and say the card is stolen), PayPal (often side with buyers, even if the purchase was legitimate), etc.
Other countries have similar products to basically allow for instant wire transfers (also not charge back-able): Bancontact/mr cash in Belgium, SofortBanking in Germany (they have a second one iirc)
And about localbitcoins being a scam: my entire problem with in person transactions. I don't like going to a local Starbucks with a few thousand euros in cash.

Quality shitpost :P

That link says 1.7MB, while big enough, it's not anywhere near your 7MB.

You do know that many regulars on Buttcoin do own cryptocurrencies, right? And that it's mostly laughing about the circlejerk here and noobish behavior of beginners (let's put all my life savings in BTC; send 0.5btc as fee; etc)
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:34:17
@_date: 2016-12-05 19:56:41
Haha they still didn't fix their coinbase integration to actually wait for confirmations?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:21:33
Probably are. Makes total sense as well, you don't want to hinder the actual forking by not having enough transactions, so you spam your own network once, to create a block that is definitely invalid according to Bitcoin, so you can start with a clean, clearly split fork.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:40:42


I think a pump and dump following the difficulty reset can be expected, yes.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:22:08
But they just found their first block.
Hooray, finally gone. Let them have their pump, dump and shillcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:15:49
Hmm maybe I have to look into that (I looked into race attacks a long time ago, back then it was quite easy with an instance of Bitcoin QT (or whatever the current Core used to be called) and the blockchain.info raw tx push option). Purely for science. I need that Reddit gold again.
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:26:12
Wait, (I hardly do anything with bitcoin at all) Bitcoin Core (formerly Qt) is the full node, right? If so, then I'm two of the special 6,000. It actually surprises me there's only ~6,000. Literally (yes, literally) unbelievable.
EDIT: Ok, I'll install the full client on some VPS's tonight (that mostly idle anyways).

[Bitcoin XT contains way more than just the blocksize increase](

Depends on whether or not you use a seeded wallet (bip 39) or just a regular wallet with a passphrase.
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:59:50
Well, BitPay immediately sends an email when the double spend is detected (very soon) and also sends a new postback to the merchant declaring the previous transaction to not be final.
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:58:40
This works because blockchain.info is connected to a large part of the network (and possibly also directly to BitPay).
I send my second transaction with fees (own PC; 6-8 connections) 2 seconds after I transmit the one via Blockchain.info (connected to 1500+ nodes). Even before I transmit my second transaction the BitPay website gives the greenlight and redirects back to the merchant.
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:18:52
The food ordering company takeaway.com (active in big parts of Western Europe) also accepts 0 conf Bitcoin payments via BitPay for a very long time.
All that is needed are two non-connected bitcoin clients (in practice I just use  one of which is modified (just to be sure) to not care about the `spent`-state of its own coins.
Then just broadcast two transactions: 1 to BitPay without a fee (always use "young coins", eg. coins with &lt;3 confirmations) and 1 to myself with a tiny tiny fee.
Free food 98% of the attempts. And the 2% that fails: Oh well, no big loss (it is just as if you actually paid for your food).
PS: Of course this is purely fictional and has never been applied to the named company and was purely tested against my own BitPay merchant account. :X
@_date: 2015-04-11 10:55:12
To perform a double spend against a high-risk merchant on BitPay is very easy and does not require any mining power at all.
Smart move by Gyft to finally do this.
As long as other big merchants accepting Bitcoin via BitPay don't correct this mistake I'm happy though.
And yes: the merchant takes all the risk with BitPay against this kind of attack.
@_date: 2016-10-11 15:54:51
Yes, current assumption that is at least correct, but might have tighter bounds.
Also P = NP would have major problems for many things (including most (all?) modern crypto stuff). NP = PSPACE does not.

When doing a bitcoin transaction everybody is just excited for the new outputs and nobody mourns for the deceased inputs.

Haha I've seen a few people sell "permanent external OpenBazaar hosting" for insane prices (~$1000 per 6 months) a few weeks ago and I thought: Would anyone fall for that?
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:00:52
Well, Kleiman apparently knew stuff about crypto, Wright claims to know stuff about economy (but is known to falsify degrees).
I don't believe that Wright either is, hacked or knows Satoshi until he signs a message with the first private key in the chain, undeniably stating a recent date, his full name and maybe a major headline (verbatim) from that day.
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:41:42


Want the open source Core patch that double spends directly back to your own wallet? No problem, just ask.
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:43:44
Unfortunately this makes bitcoins very unusable for real world purchases (restaurants that you don't often frequent; I know one in the city where I live where I can pay with bitcoin while sitting outside, where they don't have cameras to even record my face).
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:29:27
We know that Wright can't spell.


@_date: 2016-05-24 14:04:43
No idea. Luckily Western Europe doesn't have checks for a long time now and the main fiat payment methods require more work to chargeback and are more traceable back to the person possibly committing fraud (as the restaurant can probably easily convince a bank that a person actually bought dish `X` and then you would only complain about the tip amount)
@_date: 2016-05-24 15:49:34
Probably. I made a spaghetti code php script once that does this via RPC calls with a mobile frontend that looked like the blockchain.info app so merchants don't become suspicious.
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:04:43
Are we actually sure that he mined/constructed the genesis block and that he didn't work with others from early on and someone else claimed the Genesis block? (yes, legitimate question, although I would believe Wright if he signs something with that key (or that Wright at least knows the real Satoshi (and obtained the key somehow))
@_date: 2016-05-24 15:47:11
Oh god, I didn't know that. My condolences.
@_date: 2016-05-04 14:05:05
The code works...
... Just like Craig's proof works.
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:24:23
Highjacking top comment. The logo of that site looks like takeaway.com and thuisbezorgd.nl (and pizza.fr and etc, same company internationally).
This isn't news. They accepted Bitcoin since before the 2013 bubble (via bitpay, zero conf allowed)

Causes non blockchain spam? Well, depends on the definition of spam.
