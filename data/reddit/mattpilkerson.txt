That would only apply if they were sending it to a million different accounts and splitting it up a lot right?
@_date: 2019-12-26 06:22:36
Where is that? Is it on the main form everyone fills out?

When doing your taxes First In First Out FIFO, is it that you use a program to determine and literally sell the actual coins that you first acquired first, or that you just sell the coins like regular and then do your taxes as if that is the first in?
Like it I buy .25 btc for $1000 and then .15 btc for $2500. And then sell .2 btc by sending it regularly, I’m not indicating when I’m sending the .2 from which (.25 or .15) bitcoin it is to be sent. So would I just write down the taxes like it’s out of the first .25?
Thank you

Thanks. I'm looking into getting an accountant. Like I was trying to figure out if that means I wouldn't owe in Japan or if they double tax you? Thanks

How did you laser that in, what kind of thing did you use? I have a 3d printer, I wonder if it's possible for me to rig it to be able to do that.

Wow so everyone in America gets that question now? Interesting.

Holy fucking shit, Data dash did? What could their reasoning be? I wonder if they are trying to say it's financial advice or some shit but that could only be possible if they are taking off other financial advice videos. Any info on that I wonder. I'll look into it a bit.

I thought proof of stock was you can invest the coins you have and make more? How do I do that and what’s the going rate?
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:40:17
Sounds like a tax nightmare. How do you do your taxes on something like that. Even tax attorneys don’t know about bitcoin nowadays.
Also a huge learning curve. I looked into this once, you need to have a certain amount of money present in a bank account at all time or a certain amount of coins at one point IIRC.
Great job!!

That's awesome. I live in Japan and work with 3d printers as a hobby... I need to become more computer literate... I get the basics and how it all works with Bitcoin but I look like a wacked out dude trying to exxplain it.
@_date: 2019-12-27 17:39:07
Oh legitely thought there was a reason, didn't know it was a mistake. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:27:06
If you buy and sell your bitcoin all while living in Japan do you owe capital gains to Japan, US or both?
@_date: 2019-12-19 13:36:06
Couldn't it be used to purchase things like for example umbrellas or gas masks, etc instead of liquidating it? Like, nowadays you can set it up so you can get your Bitcoin linked straight to a Visa card and purchase things from like Amazon etc, right?
@_date: 2019-12-25 04:58:35
That's awesome man. No problem if it's private but what kind of work do you do that has that at your job? Also, where'd you get that MNVP wood?

Merry Bitmas everyone..
I'm trying to use Cointracking to get all my trades together... But it doesn't have an option for uploading a CSV or API from bitFlyer or MyEtherWallet... anyone know how to do this?

Thanks, what does the title mean by "new point of sale"? I thought regardless of lightning or not, point of sale just means the price at the time you sell it, I don't get the connection to the title.
@_date: 2019-12-21 07:56:45
Is that even patentable?
@_date: 2019-12-10 20:08:47
Hi thanks,
For example if someone buys a sandwich for .002 where the sandwich is $5. Where .002 Bitcoin is $5. And the next day Bitcoin becomes .002 Bitcoin is $100,000. The merchant would have to calculate the $99,995 as profit on capital gains no?
@_date: 2019-12-22 17:05:50
That seems strange, first to file. Almost every idea has to bring it to fruition and in that process the idea will spread to plenty of people, all of which can now just go down to the patent office... that's not good.
Thanks for letting me know about this!
@_date: 2019-12-22 12:42:59
I had heard it’s extremely difficult to beat a patent. Like the Adam Corola patent troll case. Seems like it is more the burden of the one defending their use of something that has been patented then it is defending your own patent.
Thanks for replying!

I thought it’s helpful to run a node because if most people have light wallets those aren’t working to verify transactions... or that’s what I thought. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:48:30
What is that wood material and how did you so cleanly mark the "Lightning ATM" imprint?
Nice work I must say!
@_date: 2019-12-28 16:06:15
How do people even hear about all the laws regarding that? I am utterly confused by taxes. Like even if you hire a guy to tell you, he could be wrong and you'd still be liable. It's like you're never sure if you're doing it legitly.
And ya I'd bet that will happen because I looked into it and didn't do it for that reason, that I couldn't understand everything in regards to banking laws etc.
@_date: 2019-12-29 09:33:44
That’s amazing. I live in Japan and if I recall you’d need a good amount of money to start up as you need to have a certain amount of coins to be able to be bought from the atm’s wallet.
Didn’t have the cash and the banking laws seemed hard to understand especially in a foreign country.
That’s really cool you did that though.
@_date: 2019-12-28 19:57:30
See, that seems so beyond my level lol Never heard of Fincen, don't know what an MSB is, federal level sounds like that's a big hurdle, and if you hadn't brought up the MTL act I doubt anyone would have heard of that. 
I'm actually impressed you know all that, could I ask how you found all that out?
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:36:34
Just curious, did you choose those states because of it’s laws on trading? And how did you find out those states were OK, going through wikipedia one by one or consulting a lawyer or?
Great job!
@_date: 2019-12-10 01:12:41
Those of you that traded a lot of coins before knowing the tax implications what did you end up doing for your taxes?
@_date: 2019-12-29 19:10:45
Ahhh so the point of sale would have no relation to what people are exchanging fiat for it at any given time. I think I get it. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:13:09
I see, thank you for your advice! :)
