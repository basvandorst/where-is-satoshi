That article takes into account exactly what he was talking about. Thanks for finding that.

Okay, that makes more sense. Thanks for responding.

I'm still concerned with the idea that the means of production (computer bits and bobs) are controlled by a relatively small entity who has no interest whatsoever in protecting/harming the value.

The next time I owe him I'll offer up the idea :D.

Yeah, I tried, but the search function is a bit rough, especially for such complicated situations. I figure if the question fails the FAQ and multiple search engines it's okay to post.

Hell, that would be convenient just to have in your pocket.

That's a great answer, because it's really the conclusion that we came to. I have very little money in bitcoin (or in fiat), so for me it really is just this interesting investing experiment. I truly believe in the core ideas behind its creation, but it's historically obvious that once too much money gets involved in a new system it goes to shit.
I'm an optimistic skeptic. I'd be happy to go to the moon with it, but I'm not holding out for a miracle either.

Well, to a certain degree I would argue that they do. However, as we've seen with U.S. foreign policy, people who fuck with those systems for their own gain tend to be met with the barrel of a gun, something that bitcoin does not have.
Also, I could not start a mining company tomorrow. I could, however, start up a bitcoin client.

That's interesting. Do you think that will eventually "break" the system, so-to-speak, or will the world just get used to really expensive graphics cards?
