Hehe, please notice that you will receive the ticket by e-mail only after 1 confirmation ;)

Not going to argue against BTCPay Server, if that works for you, use it. But if you are located within the euro zone we are happy to help you using BitKassa (free service). The merchant can choose if if he wants to receive euros or keep the bitcoins. In Arnhem we started just like you are about to start, with now over 100 merchants accepting bitcoin LN payments.

We have not experienced any difficulties yet. Some confirmations took longer than normal but that's it. We are monitoring it more closely than normally. But of course it does have some negative effects. When you help new people who are interested in Bitcoin with a transaction on their mobile wallet and they see a few extra (euro-)cents for the tx-fee its a bit harder to explain the higher fees than just the 'normal' 2 cents. But still most people are very positive about bitcoin after they get to know more.

You guys rock! Keep up the good work. We highly recommend your wallet to any iPhone user.
@_date: 2019-03-15 18:44:39
at the moment there are over 100 :)
@_date: 2019-03-16 11:39:08


Please profide us feedback on which merchants we list on our website did not accept bitcoin while you were here, because we are trying extremely hard to keep every one of them on board. Can you also tell which month you were here? 
@_date: 2019-03-15 14:47:31
Not over here. 
(for more info:  )
@_date: 2016-06-28 09:15:03
You are right that this kind of information needs to be on the homepage of Arnhem Bitcoin City as well. We should add it. However it might take a while, as we have so many things on our backlog and the main page is completely translated in three languages.

Hi fellow bitcoin enthusiast!
This is a page showing the pictures and videos of *the event* (and some numbers about that event which we refer to as statistics) I'm happy give you all the information you want. You can get more info on the main website of Arnhem Bitcoincity. And you might want to read more about it on [this post]( we did earlier.
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:33:09
Great to hear this!!! Do you have a website we can link to?
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:35:44
Leave us a note when you're in town!
@_date: 2019-08-18 12:36:49
The real question: Did you pay over LN? :)
(which bar is this again?)
@_date: 2019-06-05 06:25:44
He is right though, this is because after you sent the bitcoins, Bitpay also has to consolidate their UTXO's and that can be expensive at some times. However, I do believe Bitpay is overcharging. (They even charge when the mempool is empty)

There have been no businesses yet that accepted Bitcoin for some time and then quit. There have been a few places that stopped their business altogether, i.e. they closed down entirely, although we doubt this was due to a lack of Bitcoin customers :)


Hard to tell from the payments alone (Bitcoin being anonymous and all) but we know for a fact there is a small group (a few dozen) of hardcore users and enthusiast, a growing number of newcomers who are interested, and from time to time we see visitors from other places (or even other countries) visiting Arnhem to spend some time and bitcoins.


Actually, there are typically more people present at the meetups than RSVP'd on the page. But the meetup group is not fully representative for the number of users here. People from outside Arnhem often come and visit the meetups, and by far not all users from within Arnhem attend the meetups.


Free publicity, new customers bringing more business, it generates attention, it's a form of customer service (customers have more ways to pay), attractive for visitors and tourists. Saves them money (it's the only payment method that is 100% free), they're part of something new and fun and revolutionary, and for anyone interested in the idealistic side of Bitcoin, it helps growing an alternative financial system that is no longer depending on (and monopolized by) banks.
Moreover, by using our Bitcoin payment processing service [BitKassa]( which we developed mainly for this purpose, it's *extremely* easy for them and takes away all the downsides anyone could think of. Zero investment (it works immediately on any device, no app required), no concerns about safety or security, free of charge (unlike PIN / debit card payments), extremely user friendly, zero knowledge required (this solution really is as fool-proof as it gets), and if they let it convert to euros automatically there is also zero volatility risk. Moreover their money is transmitted the same day, 365 days a year (again unlike PIN / debit card payments). 
They're not bound by any contract or obligation. We just ask them to give this a try (even if it's just for one month or one week) and if it doesn't work out for them or they dislike it for whatever reason, they can quit any day. None of them have, so far.


It's a simple trade off. Pros: many, see above. Cons: absolutely NONE. Seriously, I think with our approach (the BitKassa solution) there is absolutely *no* reason why anyone would NOT want to accept Bitcoin. 
We always have to deal with some initial scepticism (if it sounds too good to be true...) but as soon as we get anyone to at least give it a try, they're typically aboard and there is no reason at all to quit.


We used to have 2, but unfortunately due to technical problems they have both been out of order for quite a while and eventually were taken offline. 
We hope to get a new ATM placed, and we'll surely mention this on the [Arnhem Bitcoincity website]( when it's available. In the mean time we recommend using Mycelium Trader where you can buy bitcoins with cash in person. Or just buy some online (we also have a [service]( for that) which, at least in the Netherlands, is very fast and convenient. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:54:32
Yes they will :) 
Most shops in Arnhem that accept Bitcoin have a "Bitcoin accepted here" sticker (or in Dutch: "Wij accepteren Bitcoin") on their front window, [like this]( (this happens to be on a book store nearby the Burger King).
When we're there tomorrow we'll take a pic and post it :)
@_date: 2016-02-18 08:07:02
Don't forget our [ma'am]( :D
@_date: 2016-02-18 07:21:46
This is practically the biggest problem we are facing in Arnhem. Why don't you keep your BTC savings and buy some extra BTC to put on a mobile wallet. Repeat when empty. This way you stimulate the bitcoin economy and won't miss out when bitcoin hits the moon.
@_date: 2016-02-18 08:03:44
These stats are correct. We choose to give a fair view of where we're at. Sure it's still very small, we hope the stats will go up further over time. Btw: you don't have to wait for a confirmation before you get your Whopper :) See our view about this in [this post](

Here's another set of lists of merchants that accept bitcoin:

hehe, it is :) At the moment the church is being renovated so it looks like [this]( And [here's]( one just before the scaffolding
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:41:20
All point-of-sale merchants that use BitKassa are now also able to process Lightning payments. Merchants that use BitKassa for webshops will soon follow.
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:23:19
It's not just socializing, have a look at some of the presentations given in the Paris edition two years ago. I really liked the quality of them. For instance [this one about the MtGox hack]( was a good example, but there were **many** more of really good quality. I hope to see some more of it this year.
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:13:10
Contact those webshops and tell them BitKassa will help them to accept bitcoins again. We already have some webshops who switched from Mollie to us. If you name some of your favorite webshops we might contact them ourselves about it. It is sad that Mollie stopped their bitcoin service though :-(
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:38:05
This is awesome! For those of you who missed it; In Arnhem the Burger King is already taking bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:54:14
Looking forward to it! If anyone happens to be early in The Netherlands, visit Arnhem Bitcoin City on the [Breaking Arnhem]( meetup!
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:33:38
Yes, you can open a channel to BitKassa's node:

Please profide us feedback on which merchants we list on our website did not accept bitcoin while you were here, because we are trying extremely hard to keep every one of them on board. Also thanks a lot for visiting! It would be so much easier to keep all the merchants accepting bitcoin if more people would visit them and pay with bitcoins!
