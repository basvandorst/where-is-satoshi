Yeah  is a good cert but I didn't get one for  Working on it :)

Well if you don't like it than don't use that watch face on your watch. They are customizable. 
I for one like to know my balance and I would never personally hold large amounts of bitcoin on a hot wallet anyway. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:58:42
Sure. 
So when you first install aegis wallet, the app creates a strong key. Using Shamir Secret Sharing, the key is broken up into 3 shares, 2 of which can be used to re-create the original key.
Share1 is kept on the device and in backups. Share2 is stored on the user's NFC tag (or encrypted with the user's password), Share3 is sent to BitcoinSecurityProject.org over SSL.
if a user loses their NFC tag or their password for Aegis Wallet, they can use the Share1 that's in a backup and I can recover their money using Share1 + Share3 (that's on my server)
That way, I never have access to the user's funds but can still recover their money if they lose their device or something.
It's really just a backup plan to a backup plan.

Can you send me a screenshot? I would like to fix it ASAP.

LG G watch with Android wear. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:05:57
Nice then! 
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:52:31
It only refreshes every 15 minutes so it's a bit of a break :) 
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:11:27
Well this one can also receive bitcoin. But besides that, nothing :) 
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:35:02
Yes it is. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 14:30:23
Thanks! Let me know if you want any features added! 
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:42:11
That's true but why wouldn't people at least want it as an option? It doesn't have to be strictly one or the other. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:02:37

Aegis wallet has the ability to watch addresses. So you can see your watch address balance on there! 
@_date: 2014-06-12 00:57:15
Developer here. I'd be glad to walk you through the source anytime. You can find it here:
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:58:39
It was released a week ago. It is open source and you can direct any questions to me. I developed it. 
Source code can be found below and you can find me at pretty much any Bitcoin event in NYC.
@_date: 2014-09-26 23:27:07
Not that I know of. I would just learn to program apps :) 
@_date: 2014-09-26 13:25:47
Hi everyone, I've added Android Wear support to the Aegis Bitcoin Wallet. The watch face shows your wallet balance, the time, and current BTC price. Works on both square and round watches such as the Moto 360. 
Screen shot:
The link to the app:
Open source on Github (contribute your code!) - 
Please let me know if you encounter any issues with the app and I'll put in a fix ASAP.
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:01:10
The app does not have access to your calls or call log. It requires the READ_PHONE_STATE so that the app can tell when your device is locked/unlocked and therefore usable. 
You can check the code yourself, the app does not actually look at your contacts or your number even. 
However, in the future we do plan to add a feature to send money directly to your contacts. But that will be optional. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:54:23
It uses the mobile application's min and target versions. When you deploy a wearable app, you deploy it in with the mobile app. It is a google library. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:52:37
It has that feature. Just open the app on the watch or you can say "Start Aegis Wallet" to see the code. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:53:25
OK! lol
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:51:49
Haha. I AGREE!
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:18:57
The fix is now in. Please update your app to the latest version and it will work! 
If not, email bojan [at] bitcoinsecurityproject.org for help. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:00:19
I meant for the TV channels. Will probably stick with the better internet connection until an alternative is available....
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:46:20
Which wallet are you using? 
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:54:15
:) Glad you like it. Let me know if you want any other features. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:09:33
Ditto. If you're a security dude check out bitcoinsecurityproject.org and let us know what you think. Also, we're always looking for content contributors. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:54:55
You can buy it on google play or at best buy. or from Motorola or LG who are the watch manufacturers. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:19:34
Yes that is true.
The Share3 values are pulled from the server every day, encrypted, and stored at a off-line location. That way if the server gets hacked the most Share3's that the hacker would get is for users that have been added that day. Even then to access those user's funds they would need access to either their device or their backups.
So yes, if you lost your password and wanted to retrieve your funds, the last resort would be to contact me and have me retrieve your funds and send them back to you. At the moment, we haven't had to deal with this yet but than again there aren't a ton of user's of Aegis wallet yet since it's new. 
I don't think that any service or system is perfect but I believe that Aegis significantly decreases the likelihood of any successful attack. There is no single point of failure. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:20:52
At the bottom of the learn page, says to email contact for source code. 
They are keeping the github repo private until documentation is completed. Until that time, just shoot an email and you'll have it! 
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:24:17
I think it's great but unfortunately no one is going to use it. A security implementation needs to be much more transparent and simpler. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 23:07:27
It will be in the "wear" or "mobile" directory under src/main. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:54:01
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:42:45
Congrats! Mintspare gives you the BTC upfront though. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 05:50:12
It's where Android studio puts it by default when creating the project. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:51:40
It's another layer of security. I keep mine in my wallet so I just touch my phone to my wallet.

Hi there, to see the other stuff, go to your watch Settings &gt; Change Watch Face and choose the one you want.

One is left accidentally from the past. Good catch. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:44:41
I gave WSJ an interview after giving a talk about bitcoin security. I made my disapproval or other articles with misleading titles and cherry picked quotes very clear. 
I personally think that the Bitcoin community should work on educating and clearly communicating with the media to get the facts straight and only work with journalists who write good content. 
Some of the stuff WSJ has written in the past has not been good. But I read some of this guy's other articles and they didn't seem to be misleading or deliberate misquotations. 
I'm not sure what the right thing to do is here but I believe the media can be used to paint bitcoin in a positive light with  hard work and lots of communication. 
Bitcoin is an extremely disruptive and amazing technological masterpiece but unfortunately most people have a difficult time getting because it's so revolutionary.

Hi there, I'm the developer of Aegis wallet and the founder of the Bitcoin Security Project. You can find the source here:
Also, if you have any questions about the source code or any of the functionality feel free to ask! 
HD wallets (BIP32) are not yet supported but it is a feature we are looking to implement. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:21:51
Can you elaborate? 
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:51:29
It will be public once documentation is more mature. Until then if you want access just pm me your github username.
@_date: 2014-06-06 13:02:55
There is a new bitcoin wallet that encrypts the private keys on your device at all times except for the very brief period of time that a transaction is sent. So no one could get your funds even if they took your phone. 
Check it out.

I'm waiting for them to make the image of the sale the private key of the wallet...

I've used it. Works well. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 00:56:35
Hi there! Developer of Aegis here and founder of Bitcoin Security Project! The keys are recoverable using a 2 our of 3 scheme via the Shamir Secret Sharing Algorithm. I'd be glad to walk you through it or discuss it in detail anytime.  
I want to re-iterate that we never have access to any wallet funds. All keys are always stored on the user's device (encrypted) or in their backups which are always encrypted as well. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:47:58
And time too, I guess.

it's a tech company so I assume that people taking the survey know about Bitcoin. My confusion is why so few would be willing to at least consider it as an option of payment. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:15:47
Thanks for the info. If you'd ever like a security review or anything of your wallet, just let me know. I'd be glad to help out! I do mobile security assessments for a living and am always happy to donate a few hours to help bitcoin developers and businesses!
