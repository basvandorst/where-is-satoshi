Lol, I hear ya!  I was annoyed to hear something like this myself, replying, "Yeah, pretty crazy how I'm still up over 8x on my investment in six months."  
In other words, fuck those people.

Have fun getting eaten by dogs, bro.
I mean, uncle.

Lol, I hope they collaborate with Wu Tang Financial.

It's actually mind boggling that these guys weren't exploiting compromised machines to hide their traffic even further.  Think about it.  There are literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of compromised machines on the internet that would enable (perhaps) nearly 100% invisibility if exploited properly.

The more I learn about bitcoin the more fascinated by it.  Not only have there been massive losses via trading houses, but there's also now this?
@_date: 2012-02-23 21:28:47
So the answer is don't talk about anything that's on it, ever.

Neither are mp3s.

Referring of course to the dickhead now possibly faces "charges", I mean. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:29:25
Time for a dickhead index. The more these dickheads complain, the more we buy. Fuck this guy.

Lol worst idea I've seen in a while

That day is today.  Or years ago.  Or 200 years ago.

Haha, yea the prices were absolutely absurd, I noticed that as well.
@_date: 2013-02-12 06:10:38
  you asked for it!
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:15:04
Care to tell us why?
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:45:55
I would have to agree, but I was also really disturbed at how many plain login pages there were as well.  "Where does it go!?!?!?"  Probably I don't want to know what's behind it.
@_date: 2013-08-15 15:54:26
I honestly have no clue what you're trying to say here.

As far as I'm aware, it's $100K per banking license.  Not bank.  As in a parent bank owns smaller banks, you fall under that single banking license.
Diversify that shit.
@_date: 2013-08-15 05:20:38
Sweet, so you're willing to foot the bill?  
@_date: 2013-06-27 06:09:21
Exit nodes are still the problem with tor, correct?
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:27:19
Is it safe to say that people really distrust fiat currency at this point?  I mean the growth of bitcoin value is absolutely mind blowing!
