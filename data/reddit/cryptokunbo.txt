How long will Faketoshi keep running around suing people. He must have a lot of energy and resources to be doing this.

Thank you for your service.

Kindly re-read what I posted. I have not asked anyone to buy BSV.

There is absolutely no need to increase the number of Bitcoin from 21 million.

In fact, actually it seems very likely to be Bittrex as the 0.04071048 BTC transaction is accounted for on this page -  [

Why downvote everything posted on r/btc? isn't the same Bitcoin topic?

What technical and fundamental analyses are you using to back this claim?

Thanks a lot for this

Welcome to the table of men son... you should use this period to study about Bitcoin so you get a better understanding. So many free educational materials available online... Just google and YouTube them.

1. Do you remember the amount in BTC you sent?
2. Did you send it to an address in your own wallet or your address on an exchange?
3. Do you per chance have the transaction ID? The reference you provided above is an address not a transaction ID, and the transactions have no date.
Answers to these three questions can help in tracing it

You're welcome

And what does the golden cross represent in your chart?

I do not see how "heavy accumulation" is something to be excited about. I'll rather have "heavy utility," this is the real Satoshi Vision  -  pun intended.

Lol! it sure cannot be 5 years. Have you heard of Bitcoin halving?
@_date: 2019-04-19 22:35:54
Spot on, I totally side with this sentiment.

Wow, how are they able to track that?
@_date: 2019-04-25 10:22:45
The transaction was done on the 23rd of November, 2017 (more than a year ago... about 18 months ago)
Here is the address you sent the 0.04071048 BTC to -  17dcBncqSXtVf4Li2K9SBn1U82ed9pGJXs 
My search using the walletexplorer platform says that the wallet is hosted on the Bittrex exchange. Here is the data -  [ 
This can however not be 100% guaranteed.
