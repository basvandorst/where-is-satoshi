Bitcoin supply is limited. Crypto supply is not. Worldwide agreement that one coin is the one and only coin we should all transact in and therefore bid up to 100k will be tough to come by.

I have a bridge I want to sell you. I'll sell it you for 10 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:33:35
alts are far better for day trading IMO but if you can make serious money doing it on BTC please let me know
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:25:42
actually i bought in at 2.5k and am guilty of day trading it. But it does not seem obvious to me why people are selling. Even if this truly is a ponzi scheme, which I admit it could be, dumping now seems ridiculous to me.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:14:28
thank you for the thoughtful (and informative) reply
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:02:45
if you have coinbase easy &amp; free to move it to GDAX (owned by same company). GDAX has lower fees and also limit orders

In essence... i work on wall street, and we all talk.... and thats not illegal... but the talk on here appaers to be HODL or im out to pay (x) debt.... we can coordinate more... isnt that what the banks did to justify there role in finance. And i dont believe its illegal to tell someone im comfy exchanging CAD to USD at 1.08 versus some other price... so whats difference from bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:30:18
If its real its 100k and if its not its ok? But simply due to the magnitude of my position i have t start being more savvy with risk mgmt as i invest.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:22:38
i say losers in the respect that without them (and without whale selling) BTC would be 50k in a matter of weeks.... day trading for peanuts and causing the ultimate best case scenario to be weakened is short sighted no?  
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:21:38
first of all lol..... only thing bitcoin cash has over altcoins is the name bitcoin - which no one cares about now or will care about later
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:40:07
I question this thinking.... obviously being short max upside is 100% and max downside is infinite..   And we just saw bitcoin double in a couple weeks....
That will margin call the balls off a traditional money manager.. would love to the risk department interview after... i give credit to those with cajones to short bitcoin via a futures contract, but if im standing here with tax reform and record low unemployment - i have better places to deploy my money.... just my two cents
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:53:07

@_date: 2017-12-09 09:04:22

i mean.. looking a gift horse in the mouth? To your point, wouldnt sell on price alone but also adoption, sentiment, etc...
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:50:02
i am spread across btc, eth, and many other alt coins.. but maybe this is an opportunity... how does the technology have any impact on the price of btc? the idea of a decentralized ledger is great - but it does not bestow inherent value... thats like saying your iphone is worth $x dollars because the technology of radio waves...no?
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:01:28
But maybe im reaching... in essence... bitcoin's advantage of being a "currency" is easily transact-able versus gold or other metals and is also not riddled with national debt? Or am i missing the big upside thesis?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:59:18
thx that is true
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:37:20
overvalued in what way? compared to what? for something that does not generate cash or have any inherent value how are people deeming it overvalued all of a sudden compared to what it was one year ago.....
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:10:03
Hijacking top comment. But, everyone would know shorting on the cme is a pretty conservative investor group..... Compare that to a BTC ripping 100% in a month... if you hold a sizable futures contract on that you are getting steamrolled.. thats why banks dont want it - being the other end of a $1m futures long tht just went up 60%, its bad business..... frankly dont see what institution is coming in to engage a big short simply due to risk controls at the company... literally can lose 4x the future value in 1 day for no reason
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:15:07
Agreed... but also go try and buy something on Amazon with a gold bar...
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:42:53
what i dont understand is the view why Bitcoin market cap goes up due to futures? Thats like saying GE's market cap went up due to invention of derivatives... buying futures isnt same as buying coin when its cash settled (rather than fear of commodity settled).
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:19:37
Im not saying investing in stocks or bonds arent speculative at times. Im saying that investing involves taking a view an asset is undervalued base on reasonably forecasted future cash flows and discounting it back to determine if an asset is over/under valued. 
A commodity or FX is based wholly on supply/demand economics which are impossible to predict beyond a short and maybe best case middle term horizon. Therefore it is speculation. You don't buy oil or natural gas or the Euro and sit on it for 10 years. You can however reasonably model out what Facebook or a Shipping company or cash flow producing asset will do with a margin of error - investing.
edit - look, im also not bashing putting money into bitcoin, i like making money. Kudos to all who did pre-November 2017. But, i take issue with incorrectly deeming it an investment as say a bond where risks can be calculated fairly easily.
double edit - im not also some troll, i was in bitcoin from 3k. But in no way did i have any idea what it would do or have any reasonable expectation.
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:44:42
I can do a lot of stuff with blockchain and not even touch bitcoin. They are different my friend.
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:20:52
You all do realize your to the moon bets on bitcoin over the last 8 months would be worth 10x if you say took to the moon bets on AAPL or NFLX calls.... two entities i think none of you would deny are going away in 10 years... just a thought... your losing money  (or BTC if you want to invest your profits in BTC while it falls) by not putting it in better assets
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:26:48
The USD is both, but would you call your checking account investing then? The price is determined by its relation to other FX which are unpredictable/determined by fiscal policy/politics/etc.
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:31:48
Investing - said it above but investing is investing in a money producing asset and taking a piece of it. Bitcoin does not inherently produce money, it fluctuates with supply and demand.
Speculating - is taking a bet on an asset will rise.
Listen, im not saying your wrong putting money in bitcoin, just saying calling it investing is technically wrong and would think a savvy group such as yourselves would want to correct that error.
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:45:14
Whether bitcoin is $1 or $1,000,000 it doesnt change blockchains applications or usefulness
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:54:48
By that point why dont VCs invest in oil or gold. They invest in Uber because they think it will produce enough cash to return their cash and then some, but they are investing in a business that creates cash. Its the same reason these newly sprouted "BTC" VCs or hedge funds like Novogratz fund blockchain companies or exchanges but they dont buy tokens.
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:54:45
so you invest in money?

Some would say, like grandma who bought AAPL for her grandson in 1985, and rode it out through the brink of bankruptcy years with no Steve Jobs, you speculated and got lucky....

I'll concede that point. And I hope this blockchain becomes the universal blockchain. As a cynic, I assume there will be an assault on it by higher institutions and will cause price losses and therefore less adoption... But I hope I am wrong.

lol so its ok a major influential investor espouses about his other investments in his bitcoin tie, but not when said major influential bitcoin investor in his bitcoin tie talks about an embarrassing investment? How is the mindset of one of the most influential whales in bitcoin not relevant to the future and development of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:38:30
your justifying a couple hundred anonymous rich people having the weight of the Fed without oversight or penalties for manipulation. Sustainable fo sho.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:49:08
So its use as a store of value or a currency is rational if this volatility is normal?

@_date: 2018-08-07 02:58:12
Or, I believe there has been doomsday sayers since we left the gold standard for 50 years. If thats your investment horizon to MAYBE make a return above simply investing in the SP500. Or, taking to the moon shots like NFLX and AAPL which would of yielded you +30-70% since Jan 1 2018 (versus BTC down) and make money now might be a wiser choice.
@_date: 2018-05-11 02:13:29
And Tim Draper said today Theranos (which he invested heavily in) was a great company and a shame it failed... It was a sham that cost investors $900 million dollars. Don't believe in what the whales say, they go on cnbc and pitch it then sell.

you realize your giving terrible advice right? And blockchain technology does not equal inherent value of a bitcoin versus any fiat currency. For some, waiting 5 years to get their principal back is not an option. I don't disagree with your long term assessment, but don't give fiduciary advice here, right?

and i want to make it more clear because there is a finite amount of bitcoin... your case that decentralizing will take power from the whales is idiotic. OK i own half an ice cream stand that serves one town vs i own a nation wide ice cream franchise corporation. I still exert the same power because I own half. C'mon man. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:02:33
ok..... so you want to decentralize but allow whales to control where it goes. Why dont you just buy the dollar or euro, same system. Get over it. Theres only so 21mn bitcoin and half are controlled by "special interests" who are using it to get richer. Winkilvi twins dont give a shit about what you think bitcoin is. They are making money.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:56:18
To watch a 60-100btc wall appear and disappear 5 times in 30 seconds disrupts any chance of it being a store of value or a currency. No one but big Fed can manipulate currencies or gold so vastly. And they at least do it over years rather than minutes. Spoofing seems to be accepted by us while its illegal in every other investment.
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:48:19
It can do NEITHER actually. when 40% of it is owned by 0.5% of the investment base it cannot be considered a fair value at any value

i agree but its not decentralized when half the money supply is a couple hundred early adopters calling each other figuring out ways to make money. It is centralized to them. If that wasnt the case we would not be seeing flat low volume trading with big price dips / increases due to one big seller/buyer moving the market with 200btc in 30 seconds

@_date: 2018-04-27 01:45:26
well there are actually many ways in traditional markets to limit market manipulation. I cant do anything. We could do something. Spoofing is a classic example of illegal in currency and commodity markets but legal in bitcoin. So the case bitcoin will replace both makes little sense to me if both of the formers had to outlaw it because it obviously led to harmful manipulation.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:38:25
the other 30-50% of bitcoin holders. Most crazy idea is we just all sell and crash it and wipe out their fortunes. Another idea is deal with it in a fork somehow which is a total airball but a try. I mean, the french revolution happened right after people asked "we?"
