It's also a moral justification for their own misery, and therefore a way to control them. If my suffering makes me righteous and seeking power is unjust, then I'll continue to suffer and never challenge your authority.

That's not correct. His point is that the slave morality of Christianity _keeps the poor subservient_, it doesn't help the poor. It's a slave morality because it presents being a slave as being in a moral state. Not because it's a morality that supports and helps the slave. 
If you want to control people, make them believe that being controlled is being good.

Internet commenters aren't a 'convicting party.' This is not a trial. Notice, for example, that you aren't under oath right now. There are quite a lot of differences between stating a belief in a discussion and having a trial. The standard of 'innocent until proven guilty' is a legal one, not a moral truth. No one has been legally proven guilty of the Zodiac murders, but that doesn't therefore mean no one committed those murders.

It seems very very likely that the IRS will make some examples out of some people. To drive the point home, it shouldn't be a surprise that they pick some people with modest investments so as to send a clear signal that anyone who doesn't pay taxes is at risk of the severest outcomes.

You can also get paid in bitcoin, or you can agree to have someone send you bitcoin for a handfull of cash in person. It's just kinda tough to coordinate the later scenario.

Sorry, buddy. Technical analysis is like numerology of astronomy. I'm happy that you've made money so far, but I'd caution anyone reading this not to get too excited. Predicting markets isn't possible. The idea that there is information about the future hidden in the shape of an price curve is pretty appealing, but it doesn't hold up to scrutiny. 
Firstly, if there were a way to do this, wouldn't literally _everyone_ do it? (Which would, in turn, cause market effects that would immediately make it useless). Beyond that, as an actual statistician, the methods of technical analysis are wildly unscientific; they're not even meaningful. It looks like it's rigorous because it's mathy, but it's not real math. 
I agree that it's best not to trade emotionally. And acting kind of randomly might be better, so in that sense, TA (or flipping coins) could be better than wild emotional swings.

If there's a major run and all the primary exchanges become insolvent, the price could drop to effectively zero. Price = 0 means no one wants to buy it. 
This could also happen if a competing coin somehow completely deprecates BitCoin to the point that there's no reason to ever by btc when you could just buy this other coin instead. 
The second scenario could be the cause of a giant run on btc exchanges. Nothing's impossible.

Yes, this is why I asked how they bought their coins.

Did you buy through an exchange like Coinbase? They file with the IRS. This is why you can't sign up anonymously.

So you're saying it's just always wrong and completely inappropriate to disagree with the results of the US court system? That seems silly. Especially while you're simultaneously saying the legal system is unreliable. 
Which is it: the system is unreliable (therefore my judgements do not need to be held to be aligned to the systems judgements, and therefore I can believe someone is guilty despite them having not been found guilty) _OR_ do I need to hold my judgements to be in line with the system's because it is reliable (and therefore I can trust that these are in fact DPR's chat logs)?

Not just _can_ be, but rather _must_ be.

He very clearly participated very directly in buying and selling large quantities of drugs. He didn't just set up a website and then let things play out how they may.

No one was claiming he was legally found guilty of hiring assassins. People, however, are claiming they believe he did it. The standard of 'innocent until proven guilty' is irrelevant to that discussion. And that's what quite a few people are trying to explain to you. 
This particular phrase started with your comment:


EVERYONE here understands the meaning of 'innocent until proven guilty' (excepting, ironically, you possibly).
However, I don't require a jury conviction to establish my belief. I'm not sure why this is hard for you. I and many other think he did it. We think so because of the evidence we have seen. Nothing about this is really all that hard to understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:05:13
I'm not saying his sentence is just. I'm saying he _did_ actively participate in the drug trade in a significant way with huge quantities. I personally think that should all be legal. But it's still inaccurate to claim all he did was act as a web developer.

I think people are more imagining something like this 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:58:02
I'm not. The standing you're asking me to adhere to ("innocent until proven guilty") is to not make a judgement that differs with rulings by the US legal system.

This doesn't make any sense. ETFs are low-fee, low minimum balance, and totally diversified.
