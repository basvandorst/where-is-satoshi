Feature creep? How about just plain old FEATURES?

Took a second to figure out what "GH/s" was.. Thinking I was going crazy at a computer that sped up by 1.25 GHz every second.. But Yeah, Nice.

Reddit is coming off as pretty incompetent. Their website continually goes down, looks like yahoo from 1999 and hasn't added a single big, visible feature in years.

No you're all wrong. It depends on the volcano!

I'm losing my faith in BitCoin.. For a few bucks here and there anonymous services are ok but how can we possibly be serious about using BTC as any kind of monetary storage system if these websites are consistently going down by just a bunch of script kiddies.
Also, what the hell happened to mybitcoin? I had an a account there too..
Is BitCoin just for the tinfoil paranoid libertarians who keep their passwords excess of 20 characters and boot from hidden trucrypt volumes? Cmon..

Absolutely. Unless it's a live, erupting volcano you'll probably just get a bit of mud on it plus a bonus rotten egg smell! Bitcoins shall prevail.

There's just a bunch of standing around for the first 4 minutes and you cant even fast forward this video..

if this ever hits tipping point how are you going to deal with the flood of illegal shit this will definitely try to finance?

I find this level of arrogance on reddit to be irritating. So many idealists that are absolutely sure that they know what is best for us and know exactly how to fix the world. I've heard all the arguments for why bit coin is so perfect and sticking it to the fed but all I give a shit about is how it works out in the real world. Right now there is a unacceptable level of chaos. 
"don't worry, citizens this is just the system operating as designed " just sounds like bullshit to me. We need real world solutions if this thing is ever going to become something real and not just a utopian experiment.

Reddit, if you accept bitcoins I will subscribe monthly for life.
@_date: 2011-08-04 12:52:03
obligatory oh noes now we'll be flooded by commoners..
@_date: 2011-08-03 14:59:15
Well if you're being literal then yes, you're absolutely right...
How'ever I think it's more a reflection of the nature of unregulated decentralized systems.. It's the wild wild west out there.. 
When you hear about people loosing their funds and criminals looting "banks" you cant but help have a sour taste about the whole thing.
How can we bring Bitcoin into the first world? I believe in decentralization but I am beginning to think some kind of regulation is a good thing..
It would be awesome to have some kind of certification body.

Well the video was very very commercial. Doesn't quite have the mom'n'pop feel if you excuse my opinion.

I lost my 0.005 btc i transferred from the faucet donation :(
aaaaaaaaaaaand its gone. next customer please.
@_date: 2011-08-03 08:44:29
What the hell is going on? Can someone in the know please explain? I had an account here.. Should I be changing my relevant passwords?
@_date: 2011-11-29 18:57:31
Something about this screams "Created by the FBI/CIA/NSA/ASIO".
