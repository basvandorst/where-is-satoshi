Not specifically. I've just never actually bought anything with bitcoin so i decided this would be the first thing. Hoped it would go up enough to cover transaction fee difference or stay the same at least. I knew the gamble going in but that doesn't mean it doesn't feel like a kick in the balls.

Of course i bought my first biggish chunk of bitcoin not 5 minutes before the price plummeted. FML. (I intended to spend it on a Steam game on sale in a few days :( )

How frequent are the payouts?

Surely that's the small quantities that should be avoided? That's like £0.15/$0.19. Wouldn't it make more sense to allow a higher payout amount to be set? Perhaps manually or from a pre-set list of amounts.

I'm fairly newish to the world of bitcoin. I've done very few trades with it so things like fees are something i'm not really clear on but, to my understanding, receiving bitcoins from faucets and the like is a supposed to be a bad idea because it will make my fees higher when i come to spend bitcoins sourced from several of my addresses rather than a larger quantity from one address.
Why do bitcoin faucets or organisations such as yourselves pay out at set intervals rather than allowing a user's "earnings" to build up a bit and then you pay out when an agreed higher target is met? I don't really see the incentive for these kind of things, unless my understanding of transaction fees is incorrect (which is possible).
