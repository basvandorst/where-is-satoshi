I mean that, you can construct a contract which manages funds and does not allow any person to remove funds simply because they have a key. Bitcoins are always owned by an external entity, ethereum introduced software which can be owner of funds.

what i understand, is that the particular ETF everyone is raging about (COIN, by the winklevoss bros) has its last chance this march 11. so if its rejected, I don't think it has any more chances.

hardware wallets are hands down the best way to store bitcoins
@_date: 2017-02-06 07:52:27
using electrum is probably fine unless you are a really reckless computer user. make sure you keep the wallet encrypted (electrum has encryption option) and keep plenty of backups on other hard drives/computers (encrypted backups of course) if you cannot remember your encryption password, keep it in a password manager or write it down on paper, or both!
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:20:24
lol this is pretty true. although i always keep an open mind
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:06:44
I'm guna put this bluntly. Bitcoin is a big fucking deal. Sign up with a coinbase account, buy some fucking bitcoin, learn bitcoin enough to transfer them off and manage the coins yourself (like a bitcoin boss) or trust coinbase that they wont be attacked by the government, be hacked, or go rogue and steal your funds. A hardware wallet such as trezor is best recommended for storing bitcoin funds yourself. Dont move around large amounts of bitcoin unless you know what your doing, you risk losing them. and then you will be sad.
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:34:26

bitcoin has me concerned more than being excited/boring. Apart from the ongoing blocksize drama which is meh, I'm more concerned about bitcoin fungibility. Until bitcoin is fungible, it only is capable of even more privacy infringement than hard cash. So in that regard scaling bitcoin seems like a bad idea until it's fixed.

an error on their part, legal or technical, could cause them to be offline, they could get hacked, or they could simply run off with your bitcoins. you might get lucky keeping coins with them for many years but its not the best way. better is to store them on your computer with some wallet software such as electrum (i recommend) or bitcoin core, in which case you should definitly keep backups of the wallet files. Best way is to store them on a hardware wallet: an electronic device designed specifically to store bitcoins, and keep the seed backed up somewhere safe.

an immediate price increase might seem good for bitcoin hodlers but honestly i dont know how much an ETF would actually help bitcoin considering its technical issues, namely fungibility, right now.

bitcoin is not fungible nor scalable in its current state, so a non-contentious hard fork that fixes either of those issues will be a good thing for bitcoin. "immutability" is kind of an illusion, if everyone agrees to change something it can get changed.

my opinion is that if we try to change denominations we should go with bits (0.000001) that would make 1,000 bits = $1, more future proof, and way easier to say/type. 100 satoshis = 1 bit, also

@_date: 2017-02-06 16:09:14
firstly, only invest accordingly to your understanding. It seems like you should do much more research before investing any "good chunks". Try not to follow the hype of others because the whole point of bitcoin is to not need to trust others. secondly, bitcoin is such a huge deal, many see it as a financial singularity (along with the other cryptocoins) that will replace fiat as a medium of exchange as we know it today (controllable by banks), in other words a true bitcoiner will tell you to never sell, eventually you will just use those coins as money. It probably will continue to rise in value indefinitely (even well beyond after the last coin was mined) and so there is no point in converting them back to anything else.

@_date: 2017-02-05 07:31:02
you just have to be nimble. perhaps sell some off if your confident a very dividing hard fork is coming. this stupid BU crap looks like another altcoin. Chinese miners have 1 thing in mind only, to make money. they are trying to give the perception that people need bigger blocks so that a chain with bigger blocks is seen as the better chain, thus giving legitimacy to their increased profits. If that perception does not spread well enough, the bigger blocks they mine will be worth less anyways cuz nobody cares about that chain. an increase in blocksize will be beneficial to bitcoin but not the scaling solution, something niftier will be needed perhaps something like lightning network (i dont know for sure). The consensus model of bitcoin unlimited seems convoluted and risky, and best suited to be tested first in an altcoin. Personally I'm extremely bullish on bitcoin as it is and not too worried of these crazy miners, they are blinded by being rich from mining.

@_date: 2017-02-14 00:00:32
i suggest coinbase, I've had no problems with them so far. I highly recommend learning a bit how to transfer bitcoins from one location to another, your best bet for storage is to put them on a hardware wallet such as a trezor, and there are others, make sure you back up the seed (that you wrote very carefully), perhaps make a copy, keep them in locations that are secure and that you wont forget. All this stuff is just necesary honestly if you want to manage money like this by yourself. It's kind of new and the tools are still hot in development.
@_date: 2017-02-15 23:28:03
probably at least 50% of bitcoins are held as investment for speculative gains, people believe it will go anywhere from double to hundreds of times its current price. bottom line is this: SOME crypto or set of cryptos will explode and bitcoin is poised to be on of the top. its not too late to buy but make sure you know what your doing

no, cryptocurrencies are just the beginning
@_date: 2017-02-27 03:09:24

@_date: 2017-02-14 00:50:32
the bitcoin network as is, is definitely best suited for long term saving. however, even if its not lightning network, I would love to see a nifty solution make it valuable for day to day transactions as well, bitcoin just needs some work.
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:53:41
true that. i honestly dont know really, its hard to follow all of this. A simple blocksize increase doesn't seem to solve anything because it will get full again, all the while shutting down lots of independent nodes, losing decentralization. The BU solution is a more complicated consensus model that would be fine to fork off and we can see how it plays out as an altcoin and not implement it into bitcoin itself until its proven worthy. I've heard lots of good things about segwit but also lots of complaints and so I'm not totally sure what is the best next step.
@_date: 2017-02-22 02:25:49
why are miners refusing to signal? by almost everyone i hear segwit is a good solution
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:35:34
no i dont think so, I think the $ cost shown for the ETF will represent a single share cost in the ETF which will depend on the amount of bitcoin the trust holds and how many shares. Which is better to stay with? Both prices will exist, obviously for classic bitcoiners the price per BTC will be the most interesting but it doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:57:31
i think thats true for networks of a threshold size, bitcoin, ethereum being well above that, for a network in its infancy, developmental forks can successfully discard a previous one. but yeah, in bitcoins case probably any fork will leave multiple coins existing
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:50:39
without much analysis, already I'd say its because many in the developing world cannot afford to run a full node. there was an article how just 1 full node was running in practically all west africa. To those who scoff a that and say something like "well screw them they are an exception" then what makes that difference with the rich elite saying the same about most other people? Most people, (humans around the world) cannot afford to run a full node, I can't see how much else I would need to say.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:33:59
no its not! storage cost is not the same thing as operating cost
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:02:43

@_date: 2017-02-07 18:28:41
ledger nano s is considered a hardware wallet, definitely one of the best ways to store bitcoin. just remember that you must manage them carefully, it can be very easy to lose them forever. (keep a backup of the seed, know where it is, etc)
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:21:27
bitcoin wasn't hacked, if you keep coins in exchanges you should realize this is always a possibility, unless you have the private keys, they aren't your coins

because the bitcoin network is not capable of handling many more users, its pretty maxed out. so far it has served as an internet currency for a niche group of people, with much more load bitcoin will only be usable as a slow store of value. many bitcoin people would like to see bitcoin be used for its smart contracts and overall programmability to take over traditional payments and incorporate micropayments. that is what LN aims to provide

with hardware wallets, paper wallets just dont seem useful at all. I have not encountered anything better than a hardware wallet with passphrased accounts. The seed is memorizable, where private keys are not. if the seed is stolen, your funds are still secure, assuming you didn't put everything on the blank passphrase wallet. If the paper wallets are compromised, so is all your money. Also, even when you try to spend your coins from paper wallet, you must upload the private keys to some online computer, which exposes them to theft. With a hardware wallet, you can spend the funds securely, signing transactions on the device and so the seed is never even exposed to a hostile environment.

@_date: 2017-03-24 17:42:30
the premise is that any blocksize increase at all will lead to some centralization, and based on just that it should be raised extremely conservatively. the recent p2p payment backlog can be relieved with other methods (ie without harming decentralization) and therefore does not justify harming bitcoins decentralization. That aside, I supported bitcoin classic when it was gaining support, because it was a simple honest blocksize increase (I think I wouldn't support it now because of what I said) but ANYWAYS the main thing I'm trying to say is that the emergent consensus mechanism itself is dangerous, not simply raising the blocksize limit. Particularly because it puts the blocksize directly in the hands of miners and nodes can signal whatever they want the final say is with the miners. people say its what was the case all along but thats not true because currently if you mine large blocks for "long enough" it will never be accepted by a core node whereas with BU it will, possibly resulting in very large chain reorganizations

@_date: 2017-02-14 05:06:53
nothing for the most part. Holding bitcoins yourself just means you are safe against a few things that could happen to coinbase: either they get hacked, the government goes after them and freezes or tries to come up with an excuse to take half of your bitcoins, or they simply go rogue and steal your coins. All of which are unlikely, but when you properly manage the coins yourself, there is little anyone can do to take them from you.
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:03:09

Rootstock requires semi-trusted third parties to act as the bitcoin locking mechanism, the trust model is a hybrid of blockchain style and trusted custodian style, therefore its a temporary solution for smart contracts for bitcoin until it can be done in a fully decentralized way

@_date: 2017-03-24 17:04:54
BU specifically allows for miners to dictate the blocksize, local maximum block size settings can be overrun (validly) by miners from what I understand, to me BU is just a miner attack on bitcoin and can be made irrelevant if people would calm down
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:41:28
its no big deal, the hype around bitcoin can be funneled into the hype around cryptocoins. all the crazy shit you heard about bitcoins taking over the world will 100% happen but how the particular chains evolve with time is much more unkown. if its a matter of investment, you just gotta pay attention all the time and diversify a little. Each network has their own uses, if litecoin and ethereum and the thousands of shitcoins can exist, so can 2 chains of a bitcoin split coexist.
@_date: 2017-02-13 16:30:28

i REALLY hate to agree with this but I kinda do. on the other hand, we could wait eons before bitcoin becomes "stable" its already pretty damn stable, anyone looking to invest in the crypto world has to accept a level of instability, its the way of crypto
@_date: 2017-03-13 01:45:37
I'm not a professional financial analyst by any means but still I agree with most of your points. The one thing I think could change is the meaning of these consensus networks, people continue to consider them just to be p2p currency however that is just one application the network provides, ethereum is a great example of the potential of these networks that goes well beyond currency, one of bitcoins greatest strengths is the security in decentralization and so there will likely be network effect in it being the most secure, while applications such as p2p payments can be built as higher layer networks that link up to the base layer.

no if the bitcoin price went up bigtime the fee in btc would go down however youd also have the corresponding increase in demand for transactions. You cant "band together" to form lower fees just as much we cabt band together to lower the bitcoin price, both are a result of supply and demand
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:51:20
"massive short selling" would only be done by people in institutional investment firms with personal bitcoin anyways. What, exactly are they going to sell given the first news of ETF approval? Nothing because COIN shares didn't exist before. As someone else said, it may just increase volatility for a while (which I think is kind of obvious?) There is absolutely no way the price will tank if the ETF is approved, the price will only skyrocket upwards.
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:46:30
of course it will bubble, its just the cycle, i dont think were quite in a bubble yet though, next bubble will likely be in the $3,000-$5,000 region if within a year

unfortunately bitcoin at scale is more functional as a slow settlement network. A lot of people would be mad to see bitcoin stagnate as only that, but that is why we need to make progress towards proper scaling solutions such as lightning network. Cheap and quick payments with bitcoin were only a thing because very few people used it, now were seeing a flood of interest and it will only get worse.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:29:51
woot more proof of government corruption we all already knew about -_-
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:14:35
it never was for you then because bitcoin as a currency is only unique in its censorship resistance and financial privacy, has only been cheap and fast because nobody used it
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:32:36
its public debate, would you prefer privately closed meetings by issuing institutions?
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:48:57
mining centralization. its not a lot of miners, its miners with tons of hashrate (cough jihan wu cough)
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:31:06
"Surely a hard fork with widespread support would go completely smoothly." I don't disagree with that but it doesnt seem like there is widespread support, I can't tell honestly

you could use a bitcoin debit card, like bitpay
@_date: 2017-03-06 05:32:28
fees are high because transactions are in high demand right now. It will only increase -&gt; $2 -&gt; $5 -&gt; $10, bitcoin was never unique for being cheap but for being censorless and decentralized. With the network the way it currently is, and as the world realizes the utility of bitcoin, these high prices will be realized as well. We can only hope for a proper scaling solution in order to achieve cheap and quick payments.
Edit: dono why im downvoted, im stating pretty solid facts, not really speaking on a biased behalf. Personally I want cheap and quick micropayments but we have to realize the network currently is not set up for that as we gain more users
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:19:08
I interpreted your post as saying that miners will check themself in order to keep the market they are serving but I feel like thats too indirect of a relationship, the emergent consensus "algorithm" as it stands now (and how I understood it) fully allows miners to push the blocksize to whatever. I suppose this is a matter of opinion but I see it as an easy way for centralization to occure
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:05:23
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:25:15
well BU has equal hashrate with segwit so its not inconceivable

bitcoin entering traditional financial realm is a big deal, bitcoin won't be the same again, it could cause the next biggest bubble of up to $10k or more, and settle down to something lower but yeah shits going to get real if ETF's start going through, its mainly about drawing the worlds attention. it could go bad also, but im optimistic

ah, the truth emerges from all the pressure. best days in crypto. jihan has been under incredible pressure from the mining community, who he communicates with all the time but what we never see. miners can point their hashrate wherever they want, mining was never centralized to the degree people claimed. all the chinese miners have banned together to protect their income, it doesn't get more classic than this. NOW we have to do is explain to them that higher layer networks do not subtract from their income in the long run.

lets not become shall we. My opinion is that Roger has good intentions but sadly, knowing everyone makes mistakes, thinks it's still okay for him to try to influence the entire debate with his money.

lots of startups, banks, and governments have been attempting to create their own altered version of a "blockchain" in the last year and a half and more often than not it is not a blockchain at all. There was not link in this article for more information and since its for sure not specifically the bitcoin blockchain, that is why i said 'typical blockchain hype', but it still seems like positive news, I did not see the dollar amount

I'd consent right now if the size was small enough but to get a specific time the actual size increase matters. i think its important to stay as small as possible, currently maybe 2 or 4mb size would be alright, thats a guestimate out my ass i have no simuations or more in depth basis for that

"Its price swings are still great enough that they could cause havoc if bitcoin was a broadly used unit of account (and they do wreak havoc on other cryptocurrencies, where bitcoin is often used as the unit of account)."
When bitcoin is "broadly used", it will not have the price instability it has now.

lets agree that if we have infinite energy, we would have much bigger disruptions than in bitcoin. Although electricty is free in some special cases, energy is scarce by nature and will never be fully free. Even if we discover a huge source of energy, that will just boost the hashrate that much

multiple ways. A kind of stupid way is to show them an address or addresses with the bitcoins you want to prove, then send a small amount out that they agree on as prove that you own them. A more sophisticated method would involve you signing a message with your wallet keys (and you show the wallet address to prove BTC holdings), I think you might be able to do this with bitcoin core.

@_date: 2016-11-29 22:05:53
I'm seeing wallets starting to use bits now more and more and I like it personally. Like others have said, this is an old discussion, but if we use bits instead (0.000001 btc = 100 satoshi) we can have a unified denomination for a longer period of time, soon when the price climbs to heaven mBTC will get old quick.

@_date: 2016-11-06 22:41:17
no because its easy to switch pools, like stupid easy, and a pool cant force people to mine with them, so if they act not in the majority of connected miners interest they will just lose lots of hashing power

it seems silly at first but i feel like a lot of people are put off by feeling like they missed out, and not realizing you can own any real value amount, not just multiples of a bitcoin. The ecosystem should consider making the standard unit be milicoins or bits, then newcomers will more easily feel the potential that is ahead of bitcoin still.
@_date: 2017-01-03 01:01:21
cuz its not like last time.... we went from $100 to $1000, and all prices in between had never been seen before, this time we slowly ramped back up to prices we've seen before. what will be similar is a spike up to $10,000

There are some core concepts regarding bitcoin security that all people should be aware of, such as secrecy of private keys, etc. Apart from core concepts, everyone including developers want and aim for ease of use. Private key storage has been a little bit of an issue so far I think, as a lot of the time I end up just writing down a seed phrase on paper, and I don't think thats the right way. Hardware wallets such as Trezor are leading the way in that regard I think. Same goes for lightning network, I think they are aiming it to be entirely back processes and the end-user sees instant transactions to anyone, although I'm not sure if it will be that simple at least at first. We still live in a time where half the population is oblivious to how to use computers, let alone know how they work, and that for sure has been a major impeding factor. Although a bit of a harsh analogy, if you give advanced tools to fish, will they know how to use it? A crucial part in the development of decentralization is going to be just plain and simple adoption of technology and technical knowledge in general, especially cryptography.
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:15:00
there is the blockchain network and its ledger, and then there is the unit of account 'bitcoin'. YES, bitcoin is more than a cryptocurrency in a sense, more technically it is a scripted cryptocurrency so you can do all sorts of fancy stuff with it, as far as data storage, that would be rather expensive and idk if bitcoin should be suited for that kind of application. As far as showing proof, I've always thought about it as best evidence of ownership is via a timestamped hash. So you have a file you want to prove to be the first to have, showing evidence that you were the creator, just create a hash (a sort of digital fingerprint) and sign it, publish that to the bitcoin blockchain, and voila, its permanently recorded forever. If you want to learn EVERYTHING, then here:  My favorite application of this tech by far is smart contracts, machines that manipulate money with precision and immutability, truly stuff of the future. Technically all these applications are smart contracts, with varying complexity. There is quite a lot you can do with it. Hodl on to your sweet bitcoins its only up from here!

without even knowing what your website is, I'm going to say a resounding YES!!!!!!!!!, bitcoin is built for the internet, quick and hassle free.
@_date: 2016-12-29 17:10:26
sometimes i feel like we take this too far, technically a blockchain is the core innovation, bitcoin is the first example. Properties of blockchains make it so that the first one (bitcoin) can become incredibly useful/valuable but it doesnt mean that no other blockchain should exist, or that all other blockchains are inferior, just wait until sidechains come out!

@_date: 2016-11-02 08:00:39
how can off-chain be subdivided more? my understanding was that a microtransaction is basically an updated closing transaction yet to be published, and you cant update a bitcoin balance below a satoshi

how is that justified? dont you just need the minimum amount to not have to work on anything else? so i can go to vc funders and become a millionaire that easy? what do the funders even get in return for an open source project?

thanks, now im hungry
@_date: 2016-11-28 16:07:58
...I thought more transactions could fit in 1 MB, segwit by itself doesn't raise the blocksize limit, so a "segwit 2MB block" is actually still a 1MB block I thought? since the witness data is removed
@_date: 2016-11-20 05:26:48
mostly c++ but lets be clear about something: Bitcoin is a protocol, that means many different implementations to the protocol can be written in any language: java implementations in android sending bitcoin to a python implementation on my desktop. typically you will get best performance with cryptographic algorithms using C/C++ but (just in case you thought otherwise) don't think that bitcoin is written in a single language. That said, by far the most common implementation is bitcoin core and that is written in C++.
@_date: 2016-12-13 21:15:56

It's not a core protocol update, so it won't come about the same way as a soft fork. As soon as segwit is activated LN can exist as long as people have functioning interoperating implementations, how long that takes and the economics/politics of that becoming a reality I'm unsure of yet

debates regarding that are really part of the technical development, average users in the future for sure don't even need to know what any of that is, but the magic of bitcoin will still be visible, the fact that its digital cash not linked to any institution or government, and of course not to mention the fancy smart contract tools that will be emerging.

well firstly you should buy some bitcoin just to play with, get a wallet app on your phone or even a hardware wallet. buy some things with it, try out mining just to see how it works, even if you don't profit, spread the word and help people set up a wallet, tell people about how its a superior financial system to what we have now, offer services for bitcoin. Or perhaps start thinking about how the current tools (like wallets) can be made better to suit the average jo.
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:08:00
miners only somewhat control the blocksize: blocks greater than 1MB are rejected by the network, that is out of miners hands. The nodes, collectively, decided that any block greater than 1 MB is invalid, this is part of the consensus rules. With BU's EB/AD parameters, miners know the BU network will accept any size block as long as EB/AD parameters are matched, but those can be matched given enough hash power
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:25:44
I suspect with the current model that we will end up with lightning hubs which act as "banks". (much more secure trust model however than traditional banks). It will be easier for people to manage a connection(s) with a single entity whos purpose is to provide a secure lightning connection, can offer different services based on use case (large companies will need heaver lop-sided channels for example) etc, as opposed to be subject to the unreliability of random channels. Managing multiple channels will be expensive as each channel requires funds to be locked up for the duration of the lightning sends/receiv. any opinions?

Unless your take good care to make sure the private keys never see the internet, they are likely still accessable to the internet. I haven't made paper backups yet because I haven't dedicated a fully offline computer and printing setup. Otherwise I just keep them on various wallets, including core. You could keep them backed up on an external hard drive or flash drive for example. I don't think it's THAT insane. As for software breaking, are you referring to the OS? Core could break but your wallet.dat file shouldn't disappear magically. Encrypt the wallet and just memorize the password for hacking prevention. I do think paper wallets are the best way to go but I'm paranoid with leaving traces of the private keys on whatever you used to generate/print them. One of these hardware wallets that are coming out are probably gong to be my "go to" eventually.

@_date: 2016-09-30 16:24:47
My personal opinion is that segwit is more important than a blocksize increase right now because blocksize increase will be a more subtle performance boost to the system where nodes will struggle even more with larger blocks, that will get better with network infrastructure. Second layer protocols will take a while to mature and it makes more sense to allow them to develop sooner than later.

hm well im just throwing some ideas out there: say you had a reputation system where public accounts had histories of credit, say certain information such as how big of loans you successfully paid back before, or even personal information your selectively willing to give to the loaning party, etc, all originating from a data capsule entirely owned by you and viewable from no one else. such data could be weighed and payback viability be automatically calculated from that. I could see something like this potentially be implemented in ethereum but you could probably do it in other coins/blockchains.

Most merchants that accept bitcoin do not also accept altcoins. These millions of coins that will surely exist will have sub-cultures and will be relevant to niche markets. Bitcoin and other primary coins will likely stay dominant at least for a while. Of course nothing stops that from changing, I'm not really arguing with you since this is more speculation.
@_date: 2016-10-06 07:15:52
u know, honestly 2k is not that high. Every single transaction being on-chain is a major drag. The room bitcoin has to grow is still immense, were looking at well past 2x growth, I haven't done a proper analysis of this but my guestimation is that there is at least another 100x-500x in adoption potential. The lightning network and cross-chain (altcoin) transactions will pave the road for the future of bitcoin. It's not that hard to see the utility in a global payment system. Even if some government offered an e-coin, whos would be the one to be accepted /everywhere/? probably none of them due to politics and economic competition. The truly decentralized currencies are the only ones that have the potential to be a "global" currency, there will probably be many of those, but bitcoin will be king, for a long while at least.

Well, this might not need to apply to bitcoin, when you think of bitcoin as a protocol and recognize the great utility in there being a single globally accepted currency. I tend to think bitcoin will take that role first, but not really my point though. For example, the internet protocols are extremely useful as globally implemented. Can you imagine having multiple internet protocols competing?

First of all, bitcoin core IS a node.
Second of all, if you want to support BIP148 (which you should) install the BIP148 version at the bottom of the page [here]( It is the same thing but actually will enforce segwit on August 1st (BIP148)

That paper basically says the basis for the motivation of centralizing is the crazy excess of energy that is required to only allow 7-10 transactions per second due to miner self-interest. My thought was that all that mining power just secures the network, I did not see a technical counter-proposal that would allow less energy be consumed, anyone find anything more in the paper on that?
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:16:55
originally the "power to the people" was thought to derive more from the mining process but I think a more accurate view now is that the power resides in nodes ability to decide consensus. Miners only have a say in consensus by running a node, like the rest of the network, "mining" just creates blocks for reward

@_date: 2017-05-17 03:30:52
frankly this is more a problem with the exchanges as ripple is just its own thing but it is quite different from a regular decentralized crypto and exchanges like polo should just leave it alone, why dont they add regular stocks too while they're at it
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:30:36
people are complaining that someone is "messing" with the UASF movement, or otherwise claiming its an attack. Why does it matter? Legitimate BIP148 nodes will activate on august 1st no matter what, the nodes dont' check what other nodes are doing, its a forced activation on august 1st.
@_date: 2016-10-30 19:48:26
and isn't raising it to some higher limit just as arbitrary? unless we have simulations that show a specific blocksize is ideal, i would say smaller is better.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:27:51


not necesarily, just need any miners and incentives means there will be miners. miners serve nodes blocks in return for pay, they cannot dictate rules, nodes do.
Interestingly only the legacy chain can be reorg'd, the UASF chain will be accepted by legacy nodes and it is very likely that it will become the new chain. At this point it is very likely there will be a segwit-activated bitcoin by August 1st, only question is if the legacy chain will remain or not
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:55:16
before everyone gets all fuckin giddy, its not as ideal as it should be, they use a semi-trusted sidechain:


both platforms. But since Bitcoin does not currently support smart-contracts nor native
opcodes to validate external SPV proofs, part of the two-way pegging system in RSK
requires trust on a set of a semi-trusted third-parties (STTP). No single STTP can control
the locked BTCs, but only a majority of them has the ability to release BTC funds. The
STTPs temporarily store the BTC that are locked, and unlocks BTC to pay Bitcoin users
RTC are locked in RSK to be transferred back to Bitcoin.
and STTP's are supposed to be only for "well-respected community actors":


Federation. This is because the Federation incentives are highly aligned with the STTPs:
they must be well-respected community actors, such as universities, and they must also
have the technical ability to maintain a secure network node.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:40:40
nope! running a node is supposed to be easy, so bitcoin is decentralized, bitcoin is comrpised of all the nodes connected with each other. we need to all run BIP148 nodes to support segregated witness activation on august 1st

you're talking about using RSK as a scaling layer which is not the greatest thing for that, use litecoin or something. RSK is about smart contracts and their whole contract execution network is guna be semi-centralized so to me it really solves nothing until bitcoin is capable of 2 way pegs
@_date: 2016-10-11 05:28:38

@_date: 2017-05-20 00:34:09
your motovation is totally on point with those in favor of layered scaling, I had that initial reaction too, however if you know how LN works its super interesting in that it leverages smart contract mechanisms via bitcoin script to make trustless offchain instant transactions. it was basically written into bitcoin from the beginning with the locktime field in txns, what else would that field be for?
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:23:39
actually we're not. the debate is over, SegWit is coming to bitcoin on or before August 1st. My BIP148 node especially isn't stopping
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:36:47
This is great. I also want to dispell a "economic node" fallacy I've heard from a number of people. Yes, the nodes run by exchanges, wallets, other bitcoin services have a certain amount of "weight" behind it, but this does not make an individual node completely useless. This is the sort of argument someone trying to destroy bitcoin could push. 
Secondly, running your own full node allows you to do all the independent verification yourself, meaning that you really should connect the wallets you use to your own node. The bitcoin network entirely consists of globally connected bitcoin nodes and every node that represents a unique "party" adds very important weight and helps decentralize the network, regardless of if you are an exchange or not. Let's understand that exchanges pose very centralized entities that ideally will get replaced by more decentralized autonomous mechanisms anyways, saying only they have node weight is anti-bitcoin. 
Also, for the representation's sake, I do agree that running multiple nodes only helps in securing your uniqueness to a degree and that running lots of nodes does little more than running a single node. 
Case in point, if you are capable of running a node, or are at least interested, you should take the time to learn how to set one up, it might not be as difficult as you think.

they could have forked off anytime they want, it was them who chose to not do anything. they were too scared to activate a *hard fork*. This is a SOFT fork, that means they must hard fork again to reject the segwit transactions, why the fuck would anyone do that? maybe because they are retarded shills of jihan but.. anyways, point is that MUCH less nodes need to agree to make this happen, worse case is there is a temporary chain split but nobody will prefer non-segwit bitcoin over bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-05-27 01:48:57
yes!!!!! Almost everyone agrees we need segwit on bitcoin asap, and miners are the only ones stopping right now. All BIP148 nodes will actively reject non-segwit blocks starting August 1st. By more nodes being able to be operated, the system is able to remain even more decentralized.
So yes, you can and should run a node in general, and ESPECIALLY right now, run a BIP148 so we can upgrade the network ourselves. The idea is that no one person or group can make changes on their will alone, running BIP148 is us going back to bitcoin roots.
Lots of info on the following link, and at the bottom of the page you can find binary BIP148 node programs for different OS:
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:41:24
first of all it will result in a chain split because there is too much support for 1MB blocks. more technically though it centralizes the network by making putting more load on nodes. It's not necesarily the case that a simple 2MB hardfork would cause bitcoin to be centralized, I think it would be totally fine even if most people supported it. However, bitcoin should remain as decentralized as possible, and anything that harms that should be carefully weighed against its benefits to the network. What are the benefits of increasing blocksize right now? NOTHING! It sets a bad precedent that we can just increase the blocksize whenever the network gets congested. Why would we not do further blocksize increases later when the network gets even more congested? No blocksize increase will help cheap, fast, p2p payments, that is exactly what LN will provide. SegWit offering an immediate throughput increase means there is absolutely no reason to consider a HF, its purely political as many devs point out.

EC ? this isn't emergent consensus its segwit hardly anyone opposes it besides the filthy rich miners
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:21:24
i partially agree with you, but I think its more the other way around, higher prices are an indication of adoption which is what is good for bitcoin. anyways these are my light opinions
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:47:36
there is a significant number of BIP148 nodes, this network will activate segwit as a soft fork and cause a temporary chain split unless segwit is activated before, but this is not a hard fork, if a segwit chain is longer, even legacy nodes will reorg to it. If there is temporarily 2 chains and bitcoins, who would prefer the non-segwit chain? no one
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:24:42
gtfo, we all need to run BIP148 nodes, segwit by august 1st
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:46:09

@_date: 2017-05-18 17:32:41
cmon man do you even know what segwit is? It IS a solution to network congestion and much more, where bigger blocks literally solve nothing. SegWit is WAY more of a solution than hardforking to bigger blocks for the following reasons:






There is no reason to oppose SegWit. Bigger blocks accomplish nothing, and harm the network, a hard fork for blocksize increase will be way more contentious than a segwit chain split. segwit solves short term congestion as well as long term scaling, with no harm done, much less contention.

I'd prefer to tell people to spend some time to learn about bitcoin, this is not a trust model where we should rely on other more tech-savvy users, we cannot achieve decentralization if everyone just does status quo and does nothing until "something is worked out".

Complacent people unwilling to study bitcoin don't belong in bitcoin in my opinion, it is just not nearly established enough for that.

if you can't use a hardware wallet (because if you can then thats what you should use, such as trezor) then you dont need to use a full node just to store coins, I'd suggest Electrum on an offline computer, encrypt the wallet and dont lose or forget the encryption key or else your fucked. keep multiple backups of the wallet file, and I mean lots of backups, every storage device you can get your hands on.
Like I said if buying or using a trezor is an option for you then I cannot suggest anything else.

WAIT, before everyone wets their pants, bitcoin cannot support true 2-way peg so their solution is to have a semi-centralized federation for "well-respected community actors" aka bullshit:


Fully trusted and third-party-free two-way pegs can be created using smart-contracts on
both platforms. But since Bitcoin does not currently support smart-contracts nor native
opcodes to validate external SPV proofs, part of the two-way pegging system in RSK
requires trust on a set of a semi-trusted third-parties (STTP). No single STTP can control
the locked BTCs, but only a majority of them has the ability to release BTC funds. The
STTPs temporarily store the BTC that are locked, and unlocks BTC to pay Bitcoin users
RTC are locked in RSK to be transferred back to Bitcoin.
In RSK the STTPs that protect the locked funds are precisely the members of the
Federation. This is because the Federation incentives are highly aligned with the STTPs:
they must be well-respected community actors, such as universities, and they must also
have the technical ability to maintain a secure network node. The locking and unlocking of
funds is done by this secure network nodes without any human intervention. Therefore a
requirement for being part of the Federation is the ability to audit the proper behaviour of
the software that powers the node, specially regarding the correctness of the component
that decides on releasing BTC funds.

I truly think that segwit on bitcoin will take it to the next level, higher layer networks will more easily be able to hook into bitcoin and everything will change.
Run a BIP148 node, buy a miner, or a lot of miners, and support BIP148 chain around august 1st. BIP148 is a genius upgrade mechanism and we have to be steadfast.
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:04:00
if miners dont activate segwit before august 1st the network will split and those not upgraded to segwit will be in danger of a reorg
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:49:09


fuck yeah!!!!!!!! BIP148 unconditional!!
that aside, the segwit2x signalling is still only just "NYA" string signalling, not actually mechanistic, so 79% or 81% make no different until they actually start signallilng on bit 4.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:51:53
no one will use it if blocks are not full? that is completely not true. the reason nobody is using lightning in litecoin cuz its not even developed yet. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:31:08
good point
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:40:30
your 0.14.1 core node will track the segwit chain if it is longer, if there are more blocks mined on the legacy chain then your node will follow the legacy chain.
a BIP148 node will track the segwit chain regardless. The segwit bip148 chain will be a seperate chain for as long as the legacy chain is longer. If at any time the segwit chain catches up and exceeds the length of the legacy chain, ALL transactions starting from august 1st until it catches up will be "undone" and segwit chain will be THE bitcoin chain. This is why we say all legacy nodes are at risk as long as BIP148 gains traction.
To me, if there is a split, the BIP148 chain is simply bitcoin with segwit so I find it hard to believe it won't catch up and replace the legacy chain. For one, the fact that it has segwit makes however slow the blocktime is irrelevant since we can now build higher level networks such as lightning network, and have instant cheap p2p payments despite a slow blocktime.
for the love of bitcoin please support BIP148 by upgrading your node, info and download links at the bottom here:  , and if you have the means to contribute ANY hashpower to the BIP148 chain come august first please do that also. segwit on bitcoin will change the entire ecosystem and bitcoin will likely become the dominant chain again.

i see, thanks. we'll see how the uasf goes lol
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:05:39
basically, yes. there could have been a chance though because the transaction wasn't actually mined into the blockchain yet, but rather in mempool limbo. If you configure your transaction to be "replace by fee" then you can replace the transaction (if it isn't mined yet) with a higher fee. Unfortunately it looks like they did not enable it in this instance
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:33:40
really is not surprising considering the high fees. bitcoin has lost its major utility as simple internet payment, really only useful for large transactions at the moment. This is why the altcoins have pumped so hard, because people HAVE to use alternatives for regular payments. I have a lot of projects I can't do because of the fee situation, I'm waiting for lightning network. In the meanwhile make sure you are running a BIP148 node and are ready to mine the BIP148 chain when it begins august 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:19:57
if identifies are never linked to an address, bitcoin is anonymous, but if a link is discovered, the entire lifetime of coin movement with the address can be tracked (past and future). Anonymity with bitcoin is achievable but not easy, and more and more difficult as "sniffing tools" and even companies dedicated to blockchain analysis emerge.

bitcoin is losing a major use case it had for the longest time now, this is why alts have exploded.

Most of the network is already upgraded to segwit, but miners are holding back the upgrade!! BIP148 is a no brainer and extremely important for bitcoin for these reasons. Run a BIP148 node and if you can, send hashpower to a BIP148 pool.

lightning network channels will be under the hood, user experience will actually be pretty great, there are no service-specific hubs, you will just have a lightning wallet and it will manage the channels for you. why would you use it over debit cards? because there will be no delays, no chargebacks, no 3rd parties watching what you spend or possible censoring what you do, also why would you hold on to junk fiat money when bitcoin exists? fiat goes down in value, crypto goes up

i wouldn't say never, it is certainly possible later on there is a legitamate reason to upgrade it. certainly not with political "segwit2x" bullshit though. let them do what they gotta do to get segwit activated, their games will be neglegable afterwords. I still stick with core (or BIP148 for now)
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:52:57
i can partially agree with this because full blocks represent an equilibrium state
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:30:50
you wont need to rely on any 3rd parties in a trusted way, opening and closing channels will take blockchain time and fees but likely you will only deal with that extremely rarely, basically the lightning network will become more fluid the more channels there are, Im not completely sure what the network topology will look like, but anyways, the lightning network "hooks" into the trust of the blockchain layer and gets the same security, you still manage all your own keys

of course, was milibits, then bits, but straight to bits would be good, breadwallet already denominates in bits. currently 1000 bits = $2.8
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:03:13
the recent events have me extremely optimistic of bitcoin, this has been a great learning experience. I hope more users understand the power they have by running a node, and more importantly, USING that node. congrats everyone, we're getting segwit!
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:24:25
i think a good point that is made by maximalists is that the "magic" behind consensus networks shine through when it is large, robust, and decentralzed, which allows it to benefit via network effect, and bitcoin currently is the most robust by far, (although still has a really long way to go)
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:52:35
your FUD is indicative you dont really understand bitcoin. What are you worried Bitmain is going to do? The fact is almost the entire bitcoin network is comprised of bitcoin core, and will reject &gt;1MB blocks. They can fork off if they want, but you have to wonder, which nodes will be following that fork? Basically none besides their own and maybe some shills/lunatics. Even I got slightly worried by their statement but then I realized I was retarded, they can do nothing about BIP148, they are just trying to scare people. What happens if they decide to hard fork? They will essentially resign from bitcoin. There is nothing to worry here, this is why it is important to allow as many people as possible to run nodes because it makes the system extremely robust against centralization attempts. There is absolutely NOTHING to worry about, there is overwhelming support for segwit and BIP148 is working as intended, we will have segwit on bitcoin before or by august 1st and that is the end of the story
@_date: 2016-07-31 04:50:05
you must be new :P
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:50:23
its possible we will need to do a HF for bigger blocks at a later date, but even right now with LN base blockchain fees will be dramatically lower, not to mention segwit itself increases transaction throughput, its a total win
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:49:13
ive never had 1 problem with coinbase
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:53:37
yeah, people forget that segwit is a bug fix! its not some unnecesary fancy features, its a fundamental fix to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:14:37
haha :D thanks
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:51:04
By the way for anyone who knows, If you only sell at the moment you buy stuff, then how are you supposed to pay taxes on it if you have no more money?
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:46:42
@_date: 2017-06-19 03:15:45
bitmaincoin won't be validated by anyone, there would only be 2 chains potentially but hopefully theres enough hashpower to avoid that
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:23:49
I partially agree with you and that is why I don't suggest people to run 100k nodes but running 1 node is much better than running nothing, bitcoin is strong the more people are knowledgable with how to run a node and actually be a part of the network. Saying only large institutions can run a node that matters is anti-bitcoin in my opinion
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:21:48
the way i understand is that replace-by-fee works by simply allowing another transaction to replace it as long as it has a higher fee. I don't think you can update any other data of the transaction
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:41:25
sure, i didn't mean bad software in the technical sense, just the political motives behind it. segwit was designed with higher throughput in mind while avoiding a risky hard fork. I'm also not against a 2mb hardfork but only for proper technical reasons, not political ones
@_date: 2017-06-10 09:12:27
cant they drop it before activation, like a bluff? Until I know for sure my BIP148 node and miners remain
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:08:37
these are great questions. Running a bitcoin node is a mechanical way of showing what you support (in a way). What is means to "upgrade to BIP148" is that you convert your node (like a Core node) to BIP148 software instead, which will reject non-segwit signalling blocks on august 1st. There is little you can do if you dont have the means to run a node or server, but being that it basically is a server / computer running 24/7 you can do it with minimal cost (depending on where you are) with some help from guides online, namely  . As far as the August 1st deadline and keeping your coins safe, I would pull all your coins off of exchanges such as Poloniex and onto anything local that you control the keys of, such as a hardware wallet (like Trezor), paper wallets, electrum digital wallts (make sure to keep backups)
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:11:41
it wont have zero impact because at least some users (like myself) will keep the bip148 nodes running after august 1st. im not scared of 2 bitcoins if some people want to use the legacy miner controller coin, its not like majority of the world is doing better anyways. anything could happen, true, but considering its segwit on bitcoin on august 1st i seriously cannot see a reason not to support it.
anyways like i said, a 0.14.1 full node will track the longest chain, either segwit or legacy, after activation. nobody knows exactly what will play out
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:04:14
you do understand that segwit2x is a response to UASF right? the fact there is 90% hashrate for segwit2x is exactly supportive evidence that UASF is alive and working as intended
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:13:57
jesus im talking about the other aspects, not details of the code, my understanding is that segwit2x will activate segwit and then at a later date hard fork to bigger blocks, is that wrong? I just find it silly that miners must do it this way even though there is no guarantee of hardfork later but feel free to correct me
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:54:05
even UASF segwit will relieve pressure immediately, its an effective 2x blocksize increase. LN will take it from there, being developed on litecoin at the moment
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:47:36
i did make it seem like i was talking about code quality so that is my mistake
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:46:20
the good news is that BIP148 has momentum and probably is past the point of no return, it activates segwit on august 1st
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:10:00
nobody cares
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:35:40
a) observed
b) (no regulation)
c) none
its way too early to know how crypto is going to play out, the relationship between networks a few years out, regulation is a lost cause, any attempts will get wrecked once any underlying crypto changes.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:54:57
ah ok, wasnt aware
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:28:45
dont do what?
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:49:31
I haven't even peaked at it, surprise! I'm referring to the 2x part, and assuming there are no bugs. I hope this was interesting enough for you :D
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:14:41
my understanding was that the chain split IS the signalling for segwit, 100% of blocks on BIP148 will be signalling segwit regardless of how much hashpower is still on legacy chain, is this incorrect?
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:09:07
oh thats a bot? And I'm now talking to myself
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:02:59
this is raw SegWit !!!

so it seems
