Hell yes it did

I'm scared. Someone hold me.

Ita easy to use so yes a good start. Soon you will want to use a good wallet of some sort and maybe look at using an exchange. You can also move you BTC off of coin base and avoid their fees if you use GDAX. Look into it.

No you're good. All this is still in it's infancy.

@_date: 2017-11-12 23:22:03
Can't access it till January
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:31:35
Is it jammed up right now? As far as it transferring?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:41:21
That dude is a shit show
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:02:57
I wish I would've bought more of the dip...
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:29:39
Can't stand that guy.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:42:17
20,000 huh?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:37:59
You know what to dk
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:22:57
Last night it took a few hours. Tonight, who knows? Probably awhile. Don't freak out. It'll show up
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:49:22
Exactly. So many gullible folks out there. Scary times. The government need to keep their hand off the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:03:20
Yes it's easy to do
 The fees will vary. Just watch some YouTube videos and read some faqs. That's alot of cash so I'm not sure if there are limits on certain exchanges. I'm new to this as well
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:58:36
I use Bittrex. You cannot exchange USD for crypto there. I use coinbase eventhoigh they suck sometimes. I'll buy ethereum then transfer it to Bittrex then exchange it for BTC to avoid giant fees
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:25:19
Use Bittrex. You'll need to use coinbase or something to exchange USD for crypto, then send it to Bittrex. I would send ethereum then transfer that to BTC once on bittrex

That's not a cat, dude. That's a mountain.

Ron Paul is literally the opposite of racist. Stupid fucking person wrote that.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:33:26
When is the dip? Do we know for sure it will dip?
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:16:43
i do

Coinbase will not let u access your Bitcoin Cash until January 2018 I thought..
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:30:28
That's what  coinbase says. However much BTC u had at the fork you will have the same amount in BTC Cash.

Lew Rockwell wrote it. He wrote during the LA Riots that most of the rioters would go home on the first of the month...
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:24:27
Haha. That's a good question.

Hold it. It's skyrocketing. But what do I know? I bought a small amount of BCH earlier this morning...it's almost doubled. Wish I would've bought more. I'm about to buy some BTC, but it keeps dropping. Trying to buy as low as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:23:38
Mail it to me. I'll check it out.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:01:12
My Spidey sense is telling me there's gonna be a new ATH..
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:06:20
What is wrong with taking it out before it drops more.. then buying again when it does drop more?
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:45:48
Yes I saw that yesterday!
