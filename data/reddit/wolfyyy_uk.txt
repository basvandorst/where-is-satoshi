This is different the pattern is breaking 
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:00:07
It's got to go down so it can go up 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:35:00
Sold high bought low
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:27:59
Its funny when people want it low so they can buy in they never do.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:33:49
No sorry, that why i have level 3 verification on kracken as back up haha 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:36:43
Ladies and Gentlemen please keep all arms &amp; legs inside the ride things are about to get interesting!
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:23:12
You could try revolut only too 7 days to transfer money around.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:13:03
Incoming bulls move out the way 
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:47:42
My rule is if I miss the sell just hold cause I see so many people regretting when they sell and have not seen one person regret when they hold.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:46:13
It will go up then maybe down but most definitely  a bit sideways 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:42:59
And it's going up up up 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:36:42
Every-time there is FUD bitcoin comes back stronger than ever and were about to see history repeat itself again
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:53:02
I think this is a dead cat bounce 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:24:28
Been waiting for this dip, sold my altcoins for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:17:12
With his  9k and 10k never again, can't wait to rip him to pieces for those comments.
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:46:53
Fuck me the suspense is unreal 
@_date: 2018-05-11 04:58:29
Just did 
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:00:35
What happened to you  You already deleted it from your posts?????
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:40:02
proper fight on right now 
@_date: 2018-05-06 19:47:34
Yeah don't trust this bullshit, if it was this straight forward we would all be rich.
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:02:29
He posts this everyday a few times, this is a sign that bitcoin causes people to go mental talking to themselves 
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:26:20
In Europe we normally sell in the morning, looks like we are buying up right now
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:55:03
This day and every other frickin day 
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:01:10
If we constantly keep rejecting 8000 it's going to go super bullish 
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:40:50
i see more and more of these posts, why do you guys not buy a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:30:16
I'm not advertising shit, just using common sense 
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:17:20
Why do you keep spamming this? Piss off if it happens it happens it doesn't take a genius making a guess if it either goes up or down. I would love this to pass 10K so we can all give you your own Hashtag # nobend 
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:46:36
We are going to go down from here until the end of may as this was an event triggered push but i expect it to pick up in June and go to the moon
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:24:27
This fight back from the depths... How long will it last 
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:03:15
I'm just thinking about the conference its going to go fucking insane 
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:20:04
It's either gonna go down to 7k or shoot up to 11k were in the middle right now
@_date: 2018-05-07 01:33:17
Bulls don't want to let 9300 go right now 
@_date: 2018-10-29 11:34:20
This could be a fake out... won't know until end of day 
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:14:57
You mean the 300 btc wall just made at 7940?
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:12:30
Is it me or is something happening?
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:41:49
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:16:37
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:47:15
I don't know I've bought at highs and lows too many times to count 
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:37:09
That feeling when you can throw so much shit at BTC but it comes back bigger, better, stronger, faster..
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:26:36
Goes up on Drunk Friday Nights then goes down on Saturday Hangover Mornings
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:04:05
That got eaten up likes no one's business!!!
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:14:54
It's a Trap
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:51:25
I'm locked in at 11600 with my day trading money arghhhh
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:51:25
It's happening or dead cat bounce 
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:24:06
Something is gonna happen soon its way too quiet.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:43:54
HODL has been easy until now as I was always confident it would go back up but now I just don't know...this one is very hard to take 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:17:52
I took  the risk and I'm prepared to go down with the ship, ill never let go!
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:18:34
I hate this rollercoaster someone hold me please 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:22:19
It did but knowing this mt gox guy can sell that much coin at anytime in the back of peoples heads just is unnerving 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:42:41
Witness me
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:12:36
if you're gonna day trade the key is patience and looking at the pattern.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:16:24
This is different it's gonna shoot back up again to break 8700
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:17:16
The most annoying thing is when gdax came online I knew it was gonna go down and I should have sold and bought but said to myself nah...idiot 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:34:24
4 weeks in a row selling sundays, its the only day i do day trading..its gonna fuck me over one time.
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:38:44

@_date: 2018-02-17 09:50:41
This is Fomo building up so the bulls will cash in
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:38:03
It's a trap!
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:30:12

Woah 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:05:14
This is the calm before the storm, which way it goes nobody knows.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:57:34
If you send me some I will send double back divided by 2
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:11:55
It's on iPlayer and it was pretty good! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:44:57
Prepare for incoming memes
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:20:21
Called it was a trap on Friday and this will be the last drop on Monday before we go up, selling Sundays six weeks in a row now.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:05:27
It's just capital gains tax from what I've looked into,  if you make more than £11300 for the year you need to declare and get taxed anything over. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:10:16
I only use kracken to withdraw took around 2 days to hit my account by sepa
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:28:34
And now we shall rise from the depths of hell 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:18:21

@_date: 2018-02-09 16:37:20

@_date: 2018-02-05 18:27:11

@_date: 2018-03-27 09:54:58
At the end of every year it's like a wish I bought now, well I'm doing it this year fuck it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:46:00
How many weeks has it been since bitcoin went up on a Monday morning?? this is bullish!
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:52:19
I always have funds on standby for occasions like this, then I sell after the bull run.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:13:55
The battle is real
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:36:38
Its fucking happeningggg!!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:54:24
We are going to have one more huge dip to 5K then we will go high there's to much money to gain in this market, people are greedy.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:48:11
Why is it so hard to believe he made that much, I made 2K in a week doing this.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:18:53
Clear bull trap, within the next 2 weeks this will drop then go up steadily, growth right now is way too fast too sustain.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:23:07
lol at me all you want i made 600 dollars in the last week day trading
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:09:25
All in baby even my emergency dip money, I could be wrong but it just feels like it's gonna explode.
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:29:53
i woke up early to cash out but don't worry ill put it back in :)
@_date: 2018-04-20 04:28:47
We like to take profits made over night lol
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:09:30
it normally happens between morning and noon, just need to be patient
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:23:09
its feels like its ready to explode soon!
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:00:36
Did you not know? the reason bitcoin goes up is cause of the memes! more memes please!!!
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:51:51
You mean bull trap 
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:24:01
This is it!!! All this patience is about to pay off (pun intended)
I can't take anymore traps
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:13:28
Don't think so look like it's getting ready to go up anytime soon 
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:26:07
dammit how did you know!
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:29:16
I did said emergency dip money not life savings lol
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:48:05
When else have I said? Feel free to look through my history :)
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:00:57
This looks like a shakedown for weekhands
@_date: 2018-04-23 07:11:45
That's all she's got captain, we cannot give her anymore!
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:46:43
Waiting for 9K memes 
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:02:37
and here comes the reversal, trading sideways for a bit me thinks
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:41:54
I agree I have a small portion which I use to day trade so I don't really care or fall for Fomo with it. I've made about 2K with it so far.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:00:18
Do you mean withdraw to your bank or withdraw to you crypto wallet?
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:55:48
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:41:00
There's not much action on both sides because nobody knows whats going on but only because we have showed signs of being bullish the past few days I'd say it's not going to end just yet.
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:53:28
It's cause he sold too early and didn't hold haha 
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:34:12
People get a thrill out of life going out, traveling, see new places, meeting interesting people and learning all sorts of shit..... I like to watch my graph 24/7
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:05:39
Waiting for someone to put it back to 9000, seems were in a cycle for now.
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:44:22
When we hit 9K yesterday dropped to 8700, this morning it dropped down to 8800 and latest one is 8900, next time we hit 9K should be hopefully holding.
@_date: 2018-04-20 04:35:48
From what I have witnessed Asia and America go against each other while Europe watches like the man in the middle and takes profits from both of you. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:27:25
apologies its gonna happen 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:54:09
My bad I easly get them mixed up
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:12:56

@_date: 2018-04-18 16:19:42
If you tell me when the best time Is then please let me know cause sometimes you just need to go with your gut feeliing.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:28:55

@_date: 2018-04-20 04:27:44
Happens every morning in Europe
