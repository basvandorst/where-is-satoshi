Nexustk is a small MMO.. Guess is 1000 users. This sub has some 114k subs? Just pointing out some facts.. Unlike whatever you are trying to accomplish.

This is actually worrying for me.  I went in to a Chase branch two days ago to initiate an international wire for some stuff I'm buying from China.  I do have a fe w business banking accounts with Chase - 1 being for a mining operation I run.
The mining account was opened last year.  When I went in to the branch for the wire I spoke to a member of the small business banking team.  I asked him (as I usually spark some random small talk to keep the awkward silence away) about Bitcoin.
This is what I left in awe about:
* You can not deposit cash in to someone else's account at Chase (according to this banker)
* Chase does not want to deal with any businesses that deal with Bitcoin transacting.  (Whereas I would point them to this:   )
Keep us posted.  I'm getting really pissed off at Chase recently.

StockTwits was founded in 2008, a platform that people use on top of Twitter to talk about finance.  Instead of a hashtag, stock (financial) symbols are identified by the $ sign.  So $AAPL, $MSFT, $F, etc.  $BCOIN is how the finance socialites of Twitter/StockTwits/whatever refer to BTC.

File was recovered from the array using EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard.  Basically I used the trial until it showed me it could rebuild the files on my array.  Then I looked in to the location (the index was rebuilt, so I could see a file structure) where the wallet was.  It's here.  The full file.  An empty wallet is 80kb and mine is 88kb.  
Now.. when I try to replace my wallet with the default wallet in AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\wallet.dat, I'm seeing a corrupted message.
I think I'm pretty far along... just don't know what to do now.  Can't figure out how to get pywallet recovery to go correctly.  I'm getting dump failed.  The error is just "Error in dump page", nothing on the full page content.
edit:  The wallet is in that directory, and the next option is the filename which I've enter myusername.dat in.  It's all correct.

Thanks for your words of encouragement.  I think I found the issue - the software I was using (not PhotoRec) was finding the files on each of the drives in the RAID array and building them out corrupted.. so 2 version of the same file.  I'm trying to use PhotoRec again and added the dat file signatures.  Hopefully this should be resolved soon!

Oh yes, that makes much more sense.  I have 22gh/s going right now in GPUs and it difficulty is only going to go up... rapidly. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 16:56:52
Yes I will.

Didn't really anticipate a BIOS update on the motherboard was going to turn in to this.  I don't backup often.. boohoo for me.  Unfortunately I don't need backup advice, I'm fully aware of the consequences.. and now I'm trying to get back what I've broken.  The hard way.
Good tip to all ~~redditors~~ from first hand experience. :)

I found the wallet.dat using the software that rebuilds the NTFS partition.  Tried putting it in C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\wallet.dat.  Bitcoin-qt says corrupted on start.
Attempting to use pywallet recovery now - thanks for the tip!

My wallet was encrypted - and I found the .dat file just where I left it after using some recovery software.  It wasn't named wallet.dat, but was named myname.dat.  So I copied it in to C:\Users\myname\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\wallet.dat and started up the Bitcoin application.  Corrupted, unable to salvage.
Trying pywallet recovery now.

Well ain't that some shit.  Yes, scam.  For sure.

Isn't the key saved as a file?  I can just use the same key?
It's been done on the forums.  I have all of the data and it looks good.  I can open my PDFs, images, music, movies, etc.  I have my full bitcoin directory intact C:\Users\myname\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin.  Everything is in there...
edit:  Is it not like having a public/private key pair?
