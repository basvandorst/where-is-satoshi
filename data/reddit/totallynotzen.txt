I'd recommend Kraken.com for EUR deposits and withdrawals.
They have a super fast verification process, super fast and free deposits (from EU bank accounts), and a fast support service.
And for general altcoin trading (i.e. day trading) Bittrex (works well) and Bitfinex (didn't trade on there myself yet, but signed up just in case). 
And to some degree also Kraken for altcoin trading.
Bitstamp might be one to look into as well (but I don't have any experience with them).
I'd also sign up on Poloniex, but they seem to have some difficulites with handling all the new customers. 
So for now, I would just sign up there and go through the verification process for Tier 2 (and after that Tier 3) that will take a while anyway. 
After that you should first test how well Poloniex works for you (i.e. small amounts for testing deposit and withdrawal speed.).
There are also other big ones like GDAX and Gemini.. but I haven't used them yet.
Activate on all exchanges 2FA with authy (for easy backups and sync on multiple devices). 2FA might speed up withdrawal speed on some exchanges, but either way it's a security feature everyone should use.
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:48:06
Kraken verification to Tier 3 took just a few hours for me.
1st  fiat deposit to kraken via SEPA transfer just 24 hours.
If it takes Kraken now already several days to verify customers, I'm afraid it will be worse on most other exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:59:52
And Kraken has a darkpool feature too, I think. 
This might be usefull if you want to turn an amount of 30.000 EUR into BTC without "making the price go up".
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:49:44
you should try to recover your password for Kraken (if that was the issue why you couldn't log in anymore). Because you need an exchange that offers fiat (euro) deposits. Poloniex offers only btc and altcoin trading, so you need btc first.

No, not that I'm aware of.
You could check out exmo.com and cex.io those offer quite a few different payment options (I think).
But most exchanges demand that deposists are made from real bank accounts which are under the same name as the exchange account.

Coinbase seems pretty popular among  people who like to pay with a credit card.
What country are you from?
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:50:46
Just out of curiosity, what kind of retail establishments are those and where are they located (country/city)?
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:28:32
Yes, that's the price for a more "privat"/"undetected" transaction.
If that's not important to you, you can just use i.e. Kraken for 10K purchases..
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:39:24
Coinbase=suppose to be simple and quick to use and that is financed by a higher price.
I'm not using Coinbase myself, but I think the sell price (if you sell BTC with Coinbase) is lower than on a "real exchange", but I guess some actual Coinbase users know more about that.
So you pay more if you buy BTC with Coinbase, and you get less if you sell BTC with Coinbase.
Are you from the US? Then you won't be able to buy BTC with USD from Bitfinex anymore. You could use Kraken.com instead.

it's pretty hard to buy bitcoin with paypal in general, no matter in which country you are. and if it's possible it comes with very high fees.
reason for that is because paypal transactions can be reversed. that's a fraud risk for the seller.

Bitfinex isn't dropping all U.S. based customers. Selected individuals and institutional traders from the u.s. won't be effected by the ban.

I don't know what "recommended places" you are referring too, but you can just sign up at kraken.
Their fees start at 0.16%/0.26%. 
Fiat deposit is free, at least for me. 
You might want to check their fees for bank deposists and withdrawals for your currency.

First of all, the chance of a nuclear war with North Korea is pretty much 0%!!
If North Korea crosses a linie and China thinks that there would be just a 1% probablity of North Korea using nuclear missles, they either assasinate Kim Jong-un or they invade the whole country and make it another part of big ol' China. 
China is all about trading, business and making money with mainly the USA and Europe, they won't accept for a second anything that puts that in real danger!
But in theory a nuclear war between North Korea and the US would just cause a major dissruption in the crypto-economy. Which means a nice dip for Europeans to buy in or to buy more. 
US residence are pretty much fcked, after all they would be at a nuclear war ;), but after the dust settles and the infrastructure is back up running again, it's all back to business as usuall.. if they had "paper-wallets"  or their holdings on servers not localized in the US. Actually those Bitcoin holders would be way better of than USD holders.. since the USD will be pretty much worthless .. probably simililar to the situation the people of Venezuela have to deal with now.
Btw.. there are no super emp-device or actual blueprints for such a thing... that's all just conspiracy-nonsense! 
The only way to cause a significant emp is with a nuclear missile!

bitstamp might want to know alot about the sources of your funds. At least that's how I remember it when I looked into them. So you should only use them if you feel comfortable with sharing those details with them.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:02:09
You just bought them in June/July.. I'd hold them for at least for 4-8 weeks longer. 
BTC has just another ATH run.. when that's done people will starting buying lots of alts again. 
An alt can easily gain 50% just within 24hrs and sometimes even a lot more than that.
I'm pretty sure you can still make a really good profit on those alts.
Actually I would even take the 200 BTC you have left and invest them in "solid" alts, which are really cheap now, like ETH, XMR, REP, GNT, Factom and even SIA (super cheap now). You actually can't go wrong with that at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:03:15

Glidera was bought by Kraken. So I'd conisder it trustworthy. But I never used it, but also never heard anything negativ or positiv about it.

I like Poloniex for trading. I also experienced no problems myself with them. But some people do have problems with deposits and withdrawals. Maybe it's a good idea to split your trading activites over more than one exchange i.e. Polo, Bittrex, Bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:15:29
Yes, it's true. Depending on which country you live in, large wire transfers (from bank account A to bank account B) will be reported to the government. But I don't know if that's just for receiving, or sending, or both.
I think in the US they start reporting at a value of $10.000.
But this has nothing to do with sending money to crypto exchanges. 
You should call a canadian bank and ask about the regulations they have to obbey.
Of course there exists easy ways to get around this problem. Espeically in Canada.
I'm not aware of any legit exchanges or websites that offer large BTC transactions without AML/KYC.
You could instead use localbitcoins or bisq.io for many smaller p2p transactions.
Or place an buy offer on some subreddits. But you have to expect a 5-10% markup.
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:32:43
You mean funds like they are offered by normal banks? I don't think there are any yet.. but there will be in the future. You might want to look into Iconomie.net (ICN, ICNX) and their subreddit for now.

Two years ago? for a remodel? That sounds like you got quite some amount of BTC back then... So I would say yes, get a hardware wallet. 
If you aren't using your BTC for traiding or spending anyway, it's the easiest, save way to store it in a hardware wallet in a safe place.. i.e. bank locker where it's protected from thieves, fire and water damages.
An alternative would be a paper wallet .. which can be made out of metal or plastic as well.. and to also place that in a bank locker.
I personally wouldnt leave a significant amount on a windows computer or mobil device that is used on a daily base.
I wouldn't trust Coinbase for longterm storage of a significant amount, because you never know what might happen. They can get hacked like any other exchange too, and even if they claim that they have an insurance for all funds of US customers .. i wouldn't count on that, since insurance companies are well known to try every loophole to get out of their duty to pay for something. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:20:19
Yeah sure, why not? If coinbase offers your favorite way of payments it's probably one of the easiest and savest ways to get started with BTC.
Never used them myself, but I guess the ease of use comes at a price, i.e. fees or premium price compared to other exchanges. But I guess some actual Coinbase users have more insights about that.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:00:33
bitbay.net is now available in India. but i dont know their deposit options. I would guess that bank deposits and maybe credit card deposits are possible.

Like someone stated already, it would be like investigating/shutting down craigslist because private citizen use it for "unregulated transactions".
The US government can't do anything about it anyway since it's not a US based company. The only thing they might be able to do, is to seize the domain, but that's it.
And when, in a worst case scenario, push comes to shove localbitcoins will just make user verification mandatory, or block users from the US.

BTC could drop a little before August 1st, because of uncertainty of some investors.. but it could also go up before August 1s because some investors might pull their funds out of exchanges into a locally stored wallet, in order to extract BitcoinCash (if they believe the split will happen.)
But I just read that it looks like the split might not even happen after all ..
When it comes to alts, it's the same situation.. either BTC drags them down or pulls them up..
I personally think BTC will keep the current level and alts will slowly recover from the recent drop.
And after August 1st we will see a decent uptrend for the rest of the year for alts and BTC.
And I think that because BTC didn't take much of a hit even though we have the "BitcoinCash-confusion" and the "BTC-e-drama".. and Alts are already starting to recover..
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:27:18
The mycelium wallet just shows a USD balance based on an exchange rate. You don't have any USD in your mycelium wallet..just BTC, so no money is missing!
You can change the exchange rate that mycelium uses to display the USD value of your BTC holdings in the settings. If I remember correctly, you can set i.e. Bitstamp Bitcoin Average as the source for the exchange rate.

You can just use the (official) electrum wallet for now and figure out after August 1st how to extract your BitcoinCash from it.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:22:23
Unless the references for each transfer a localbitcoin user made to your account had something with "Bitcoin" in it, I highly doubt your bank froze your account because you were selling some bitcoins. Simple because your just sees random people sending your random amounts, without any hint that there might be BTC involved.

If the split happens you won't see your BitcoinCash in your electrum wallet. But I'm sure there will be plenty of tutorials on how to extract them, after August 1st. IF a split will happen, that is.

If you used the right Poloniex deposit address, Coinbase successfully accomplished the transaction. So the problem is with Poloniex, 
You should open a support ticket on Poloniex. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:25:35
If you just hold for 1-2 weeks, you won't lose any money. IF BTC goes (further) down it will be back up in 1-2 weeks. So no loss for you. If it goes UP now, it will be up in 1-2 weeks as well (or at least on the same level it is now). 
Side effect of holding BTC might be the free Bitcoin-Cash (depending on how and where you hold your BTC).
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:31:53
I don't know if the link works. It's suppose to be the link of one comment by CashInBitcoinOut, left on this CoinDesk article:
Copy&amp;paste of the comment:
Unless there is a way to manually set difficulty.... They're going to fork with today's diff rate.
Meaning... if they don't get a S***ton of hashing power the instant it forks... they're screwed.
Lets say they get 10% of the hashing power (That's EXTREMELY generous). It will take 10x as long to mine ONE block, until the next diff calc. Normally the difficult would adjust every 2016 blocks, which takes about 2 weeks. BUT now it takes 10x as long to mine and the adjustment would take 10x as long, or almost half a year. *AND* even if "cash" were to magically have the same price per coin, because it takes 10x as long, they'd be making 1/10th the amount... So, everyone would be mining at a loss for half a year... But, rest assured miners would leave VERY fast when not making a profit... AND the price of "cash" would be a tiny fraction of BTC... meaning even greater losses and even faster migration off of "cash".
Most likely, they'll get a number FAR less than 1%, and the value will be FAR less that 1%, and the miners will give up before the first or second block is even mined
I'm lacking the technical background to know if that's true or not, but if it's true, it leaves BitcoinCash pretty much worthless for everyone.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:50:44
Really? Bittrex allows 1 BTC daily withdrawal without verification? I didn't know that. Thanks for the info :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:07:40
What about Kraken? Verification for tier 3 took just a few hours when I signed up there. And my first deposit was credited within 24 hours.
I don't know how fast it will be if your signup for a corporate account (if you use a corporate bank account, I guess you have to get a corporate account on an exchange as well), but I guess that won't take them much longer.

There is a difference between deleting an account.. or giving the option to users to delete their accounts and deleting all the data.
A regular bank has to close your bank account too if you demand them to close it. Of course they keep your financial data as long as they are required by law, but those two things have nothing to do with each other.
Fact is, they have to follow the laws for Data Protection in the EU. At least for european users.
So if the law states that they have to delete a user's account if a user demands it (I haven't read the law(s) so I don't know if the law actually covers that) they have to comply.

Actually most (if not all) exchanges send out emails about how they handle the fork. In addition to post this information on their blog/news page.
Check your email inbox.
I think most of the major exchanges just disable withdrawals and deposits of BTC before and during the fork, and for a period after the fork. But trading btc during the fork goes as usual.
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:02:05

You could try kraken.com 
With tier 3 verification you can deposit up to $25.000 per day and up to $200.000 per month. 
I guess verification process works pretty much the same like on coinbase. 
But you can only deposit with wire transfer, not debit/credit card (as far as I know). But you get your coins right away, and don't have to wait a week for them (like on coinbase).

That theory only works if BTC won't drop a lot approaching the split. If it does, like it's doing right now, you'd lose money and the "free Bitcoin Cash" won't out balance that.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:12:05
oh and 2FA code or not, it's still your money. in the same way it's your money that you have in a bank account, even if you lose your debit-card or forget your pin. so legally they have, of course, to give you or BTC back. You should contact your lawyer in malta and tell him to apply some more pressure and to file a report for lost income and damages.

That's not laundering BTC (or money in general)!
What your describe is a way of exchanging i.e. stolen BTC into cash while hiding it's origin. That could be at best the first step in laundering BTC. But not an ideal one, actually quite unnecessary, costly and risky.

Nothing will happen to BTC. BitcoinCash will just be another ALT!

So there won't be a split after all?
I personally didn't care for BitcoinCash at all. But its even better if it won't even come to existence, because it seems to confuse quite a lot of people.
