Nobody asks them to stop, but to optimize.
30% reduction by segwit and 80% by batching will help the network a lot.

Coinbase only pays the fee if you are using gdax. All users who don't use gdax pay the fee for them self.
Most of the new users probably don't know of gdax or don't want to do this extended verification process.
If coinbase would change to segwit addresses, this congestion would reduce gradually because every transaction only produces segwit addresses.
Being this long in the business should be no excuse to not optimize.

This example is wrong.
Company  stores videos unencoded.
Company  stores videos encoded.
Company  is clearly the one which will not survive, because they don't use their ressources as best as they could.

They probably use this high fees so they can keep the gdax transaction fees on zero fees ;-)

You realize that the checksum word can be computed?
Thats why its called checksum, you check a sum over all other words against this checksum, to find any errors.
So removing this should have zero effect.

Packet loss is probably the biggest issue.

Which fix for malleability is used in bch?
I only found the proposal of MalFix and this seems not to be in the bitcoin-abc source code.

How do they know, how much would be earned?
Is there a fixed rate you get for your hashrate?
I always thought they would divide all generated rewards depending on your hashrate. 
When they don‘t mine any block how can they know how much they would have earned?

All this are assumptions, made by watching inflationary systems.
No one can tell how people behave in a fully deflationary system until there is one in place which hasn't developed from a crash (like japan).
A deflationary system can work and would probably change the behaviour of the people. By now inflationary systems amplify dept based behviour, because depts today are worth less than in the future.
In a deflationary system this behaviour could be removed and lead to a different money allocation, because you only invest in projects which have a higher value in the future.
Unless such a deflationary system has developed nobody can know how it would behave.

They can not waste block space if they don't use it.
They simply try to incentivise users to pay a minimal fee, you can agree with it or not, but it is their right.
FYI some blocks are just seconds after another, so this happens when they try to get a head start and found a block early.
