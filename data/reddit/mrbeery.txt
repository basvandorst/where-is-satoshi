It's simply a modest short-squeeze. Whenever the short interest is so high that is not sustainable, this happens. It passed mid-June levels today, now it's down 11 %: [

Of course, but that is not what he said. He talked about electric cars in general. 
As a side note, I think if you look deep into Tesla (which I have), I think you'll find that it is actually a more revolutionary company than most people think. I also think that they will survive in the long run, but they are still at (and will be for a long time) a company at risk.

Bitconnect 2.0?

Wow, did not know that was his view on Tesla. His Twitter account shows that he's the Nouriel Roubini of the electric car world. The fact that this guy can't even see that the future is electric is quite worrisome. Makes me question his intelligence.

Haha, yes, that was the point. Take a look at his twitter profile, exactly the same attitude towards electrification as Roubini has towards crypto. I believe a lot of economists tend to be far outside their "circle of competence" when it comes to these matters.

Use a 3D printer instead, but don't use biodegradable materials!

Ok, so how is this possible when G20 are supposed to discuss crypto today (monday) and tomorrow? Sounds a bit like premature news to me.
