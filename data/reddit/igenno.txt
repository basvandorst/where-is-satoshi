Don't you feel like LN is extremely over-hyped right now? There are barely any mobile wallets that support it (unknown, untrusted and untested Eclair, and sure GreenAddress will ship one).

What’s the overall architecture of mobile send-only wallet? How is it different compared to ‘fully-featured’ Lightning node?
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:19:36
How will Lightning work in a world of Mobile? There is [currently closer sourced] [Eclair Testnet Lightning Wallet]( for Android by [Asinq]( (major player in a world of Lightning implementations).
As far as can understand, this ‘node’ works as a one-way pay-only wallet (can’t receive funds). How is that achieved? Does it ‘outsource’ channel management to a trusted third party (wallet provider?). 
Is it even possible to have a **mobile** wallet capable of **receiving** funds on a mobile? If yes what’s the architecture of such a setup?
Everyone is so passionate about Lightning but it seems like it will have very limited uses cases for quite some time, like payments in offline shops (still huge use case though) and on-the-web desktop payments.

Sure the drama has no beginning (the first argument to White Paper was that the system won’t scale) but this particular documentary does not seem like a biased one.

Also, I hope people will use Lightning on Bitcoin and not on other altcoins, who on earth can’t pay 10-100$ to open a channel and then close is and then open again?

I can’t even believe I see this advice here on the most popular Bitcoin forum in the world.
So why not to recommend Litecoin? It’s fees are 30x lower. Think about it for a minute — a so-called bitcoin enthusiast is recommending PayPal for cheap fees...
Fuck that, it really seems like I will sell this shit just because of THIS COMMUNITY.  You guys clearly lose you mind, you just forgot that we are here to build the new economy.

@_date: 2018-01-01 23:50:34
That’s nonsense. It’s quite easy to ‘snowball ‘ fees to a very higher level right now:
1. Create a bunch of high fee transactions
2. Algorithms around the industry start to set the ‘fastest’ fee to an even higher level
3. There are even more extremely high fee transactions now, most are ‘organic’
And this can continue for a very long time. Spam transactions are not those cheap ones , they are ones with high fees to launch a snowball.
If nodes ‘deterministically’ exclude transactions based on their fee levels the system is broken.

That's right. We can imagine a war between a community B1 and a community B2. At some point, a part of community B1 is heated so much they decided to form a sub-community (B1sub) and begin an actual fight (after specific day in the future). A lot of members of parent community don't want the conflict, though they can't do anything about it. They can stand still and watch how that fight will turn, but if B1sub will lose, the whole B1 will lose. That said, it's always better to do the best to prevent the conflict, but if the battle began, it's better to cooperate as a whole. Unfortunately, that was not the case in BIP148. Hopefully, we will win. Though, the battle is not over, there is a possibility of huge manipulation from the B2 until the end of the year.

Internet was a thing that allowed information to flow freely around the globe (and it’s critical mass is not achieved yet). Cryptocurrencies do the same for economic activity. In my opinion, when economy is *truly* global, economic activity can achieve such a temperature that different cultures fuse as in nuclear-fusion producing new *elements (atoms)* (new cultures) composed of primitive protons/neutrons (parent cultures).
So what I mean is that current cultures will persist, though as a part of another, more advanced culture that will be synthesized as soon as the nuclear fusion begins ��

That is not how things should work in Bitcoin.
A wallet, by definition, is something that stores users money. In a world of cryptocurrencies, if a contentious hardfork took place, owner of the private keys has inputs in two blockchain, thus, a wallet provider should not make a choice on behalf of the user about what blockchain is ‘objectively’ ‘right’.
The best he can do is to inform a user about the fork and let him safely access his money in both chains.

I hope one day in the foreseeable future we will have a breadwallet-like base implementation for Namecoin look up and wallet.
Just imagine a server independent Bitcoin (and some other crypto) wallet that can look up human readable names and retrieve BIP47 payment codes to make payments to ephemeral address.
Or Tor browser mobile  implementation that can look up human readable domains to retrieve onion address.

I am Russian and I am exited about these news, here is why:
These guys definitely don’t understand what a breakthrough Bitcoin is — a tool that destroys the old monetary system and the concept of government as we know it. They think they can ride a wave, though Bitcoin is tsunami.
As soon as Russia enters the game (and it will because of sanctions) other countries (India, South Korea etc) will follow. And this is exactly what Bitcoin needs to skyrocket and destroy the old world order. So basically corrupt governments set themselves on fire thinking they are riding the wave.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:41:46
Why it was meant for cheap transactions? It’s exactly the opposite: fees should be that high, to fulfill security needs (huge among of power) of a global currency. That said, miners should earn money, not astronomical amounts, more like regular business, yet at global scale each fee would be huge buy design.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:39:17
That’s right, it’s far from complete, a lot of work yet to be done.
PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure. Every time you establish a secure connection to a website, your browsers trusts some third parties — that’s a problem by itself, especially serious in corrupted governments such as [turkey](
Web certificates is not the only thing that relies on PKI. You can use it to publish your public key that will be used for serverless encrypted communications (see keybase.io, yet it is a centralized PKI)

There are different ‘types’ of inflation curves. Consider Monero: it has ~0.9% yearly inflation, thus you can as well claim it has infinite inflation (and that sounds bad, right?), yet there nothing wrong with such an inflation (it could even be more healthy in long term than zero inflation, we can’t tell for sure right now). Doge has 5% yearly inflation which is not harmful  for it’s system at all.

Good point. DigiCash was a first cryptocurrency, and it was not decentralized.
Blockchain is a technology that allows community to establish a decentralized cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin was first such a decentralized cryptocurrency, and as of now it is the most decentralized cryptocurrency out there (considering it’s network effect that as of now compensates mining centralization). But nobody guarantees that underlining blockchain won’t be centralized sometime in the future — it’s up to community to fight centralization.
Moreover, it is quite dangerous to think that blockchain is by definition forms a decentralized network — that can lead to a conclusion that we can have NGB blocks and the network will remain decentralized, just by definition, just because it’s open source. That is wrong conclusion.

Let’s speak in numbers. The network consists of ~7000 nodes right now. Most of them located in the USA and Europe. How much does it cost (per month) to operate a full (in terms of unlimited number of incoming connections / bandwidth) node there?
I operate a node from home where I pay ~10$ per month for 100Mbit/s inbound/outbound with unlimited data plan. How many people in Europe/USA/Canada have the same cost of node operation?
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:18:56
Yeah, and if most nodes operate in that way, it would take ages for a new node to bootstrap, the network would be in unhealthy condition. Or, wait a minute, do you you mean there can be several nodes in a few data centers that would seed blocks with unlimited bandwidth?

@_date: 2017-08-20 12:37:19
This. The storage capacity increased exponentially, yet internet bandwidth did not. We are in 2017 and barely less than a half of the population has access to the internet, and among those who do most have slow and expensive (and some — censored) connection. And while on peer-2-peer network, your node has to *constantly* suck in new transactions and blocks. Ideally, it should seed transactions and blocks to other peers. Even with 1MB blocks this can easily be measured in **terabyte** of outgoing data per month (I operate a node in an unlimited data plan and I get this number). Good luck for anyone willing to seed 8 terabytes voluntary.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:00:39
Agree. I think monero is where we will use CT. fully opaque blockchain is a more secure solution that a sidechain to Bitcoin (taking into account on chain CT would be extremely expensive and this inefficient)

Speaking in terms of crypto: as long as a ‘node’ (you) of your culture is online (alive) and there are other peers with the same protocol rules (your neighbors) the network will function in normal way. So it’s up to you to spread and defend your culture.

Yes. Right now it’s between 16-17 mln coins mined out of the 21mln cap. In less than 10 years most of the coins will be in circulation.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:20:24
No. Mempool contains transactions that were made by people during last ~72 hours. Miners pick transactions to form a ‘block’ that’s tied* to the previous block in the chain of blocks. They try to find a special digital representation of a block they formed. Digital representation is what guarantees that if anything inside a block is changed, this representation is different. There are few parameters inside a block that could be changed to change the representation. They need to change these parameters to find a ‘special’ representation. Special means it should have certain number of zeros in the beginning (representation is digital, remember?) — in other words, the number that represents the contents of a block must be small enough (00157 is smaller than 01157).  The exact number (the target ��) is determined in the beginning of an ‘era’ by how fast the last 2016 blocks were found. Because everyone has just the same chain of blocks, they will calculate just the same target number and will be able to check a block they receive whether it’s representation is valid (small enough). To find a small enough number miner should change those special parameters many-many times. Hi will find the number only if he is lucky enough. Luckily, someone will find it sooner or later. Sooner or later is usually around 10 minutes because this parameter is used as a target during calculation in the begging of the new era.
The valid block representation is called a ‘solution’. Technically, this a hash sum of the block contents.
*to tie a block to a previous one you just need to include the hash sum of the previous block inside the new one. That said, if the contents of any block is changed, it’s sum becomes different and subsequent blocks invalid. Thus, to make a change you need to recalculate all subsequent blocks, which is... you got it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:26:10
1. You have to set a transaction fee to pay miner for ‘verification’.  It’s quite a complex topic and a lot of drama surrounds it but it is important to understand that there no blockchain in existence that successfully entered the ‘post coin-issuance’ stage. Bitcoin will likely be the first one. It’s important to have a developed fee market or otherwise there won’t be incentive for miners to invest into equipment and pay for energy. So don’t believe folks who will tell you transactions are expensive. They must be expensive, that’s how this system is supposed to work.
2. If you have a lot of money you still need to meet at least basic needs, such as food for example. That said, one will grow wheat and another one will by it with btc :)

Yes, they do, as long as you pay attention to **software** and **hardware** you use to access the blockchain.
Bank is a single big-fish target for a hacker, where with cryptocurrencies (**if** you store your coins properly) you are secure against hacks.


Things are a bit messy regarding privacy in crypto world. Comparing to banking, no one can stop your economic activity, and no one receives information about your activity by default. Though, ‘first generation’ blockchains are traceable. That said, if you are a target, someone can get important information about your economic activity.
There are already untraceable blockchains. The one that’s most opaque is Monero. Another one is ZCash, though in it’s current state it is as transparent as Bitcoin’s. Some people say they have untraceable blockchain tech (Dash for example), but it’s mostly a PR lie and there is no serious cryptography behind that kind of shit.
It’s important to note that even when the underlying blockchain is traceable, the privacy of one’s economic activity could be achieved on another layers, such as Lightning Network (which will work in mainstream bitcoin in matter of a year (personal estimations).


1. They give this info to governments, so they can properly tax you.
2. They sell this info to corporations so they can extract profit from you as a potential customer (just one example)
3. This info could be stolen / illegally sold to hackers by corrupted employees, **so you wealth, health and life can be in danger**.
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:48:06
**it** – is for current bitcoin. It would improve intractability in the future as well as there is already untraceable cryptocurrency called Monero, and more to come — MimblWimble for example, and possibly (though unlikely) zcash.

@_date: 2017-09-16 11:58:51

@_date: 2017-09-29 22:39:44
Exactly. But choose wisely. Litecoin and Monero are those that will likely 10x in a period of no more than two years.
Siacoin is another interesting project (not a cryptocurrency at first place, yet it’s token gonna be valuable as well).
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:31:52
Yes, exactly. Just imagine you’re a branch of a pine tree. It’s obvious you can’t name yourself ‘a pine tree’, right? Or not?
Arguing about those trying to steal the ‘Bitcoin’ brand is the same as arguing about those trying to patent it. Old school tricks don’t work here anymore, no reason to worry. Open a coinmarketcap webpage and count how many ‘Bitcoins’ are there on all those pages.
Surprised? Do you care anymore?
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:03:48
Crypto’currency’ is what allows blockchain to exist, not vice-versa. If there is no token issuance, blockchain can’t exist.
There can be cryptocurrencies without a blockchain, such as DigiCash, or IOTA. IOTA is an interesting example in that case, cause it is a cryptocurrency, without token issuance through blockchain (and without blockchain itself).
edit: a blockchain is what’s allows a cryptocurrency to be decentralized.

It’s likely I was bad at describing my message there (English is not my main language), or you didn’t get it (sorry).
Short version: I am sick of those classic/xt/EC/btrash/s2x attempts and I didn’t want to bring this whole topic up again.
Yet I want people to think about forks in a positive way: there will be lots of alternative implementations in the future (Grin, for example) and it is good: we should experiment a lot — that’s the only viable way to understand what is a good idea and what’s a bad one.
It is much healthier though (imo) for the infrastructure to experiment with an existing transaction history (whether possible) rather then starting from scratch (and it was bcash who had shown this, to me at least).


The the downright shifty way it’s been done is why people feel bad hearing a word ‘fork’. The should not.

Coinbase has a kind of secure multisig wallet somewhat resistant to such hacks, yet it is definitely not the best place to store your bitcoins. Consider Core (requires ~150gb of disk space yet helps the network, requires prolonged synchronization if you don’t use it daily; the best choice overall), Electrum (fast synchronization) or Breadwallet (fast synchronization on a mobile, yet somewhat vulnerable to hardforks – does not matter if you hold and don’t spend coins during times of uncertainty). Remember to always use wallets in a secure environment, that said: don’t use windows and android for such purposes (until you are an experienced users and know very well how to protect such an environment).
There also hardware wallets, yet they are more tricky to use (considered very secure though). Much better than a sheet of paper.
Wallets are tricky nowadays, there are a lot of trade offs in each choice, and the infrastructure is far rom mature nowadays.

To put things extremely short:
1. Cryptocurrencies does not depend on decision of influential people with a lot of power. No one can inflate the currency to their own will.
2. In addition, compared to traditional banking, no one can efficiently censor your transactions
3. You are as free to start using this new currency system as you are free to get internet access and install a software (soon even without internet access, over satellites)
4. Protecting your savings is much easier: with banks you can’t protect your funds by yourself, with cryptocurrency you can spend few days/weeks to educate yourself and store enormous amounts of wealth in a manner that is more secure than anything humanity dealt with.
6. Cryptocurrencies are border less by nature. This opens doors to the whole new world economy.

@_date: 2017-05-20 01:13:25
Unfortunately, you don't understand how UASF-148 works as well. As soon as august came and economic majority (say most of the nodes) started enforcing segwit, the blocks mined by non upgraded miners will be orphaned among economic majority, making their coins spendable only within economic minority (say, with almost no one) regardless on the hashrate that works on this economic minority chain and regardless of top-block-height difference between two chains). That way, minority is enforced to switch as well, cause it's chain will reorganize just after the 148 chain prevails sooner or later as more and more miners will switch to it from minority chain to start working for money again [not for psychopaths idea]. The only downside of this is possible notable decrease in block creation speed that will last for up to two months. I don't take into account an attack from majority of the HP cause in case of 148 the majority is already pro-segwit. In worst-worst case scenario, where attacking miners can completely stop the economic majority's chain, the emergent PoW change fork could be deployed with a strong incentive for economic majority to update as fucking quick as possible (cause that would be no more in a lifetime opportunity to became a profitable miner for chip in the same time healing Bitcoin's greatest problem).

I recommend you to try sidechains to Litecoin instead. Because..  you know... Litecoin has already fixed txn. malleability bug and has segwit up and running and it's blockchain is the place where first REAL-WORLD UNFEDERATED SIDECHAINS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. Do you know why it will be the first? Because... you know...
- it's kinda copy of the Bitcoin itself, so infrastructure needs no a lot of money to adopt their technology to Litecoin.
- it's as old and tested as Bitcoin itself. Not some kind of zexperimental tech.
Wanna unfederated RootStock? Here you are. Liquid? Here it is. Confidential Transactions? No problem.
And what about Bitcoin? At that moment of time you can only try true sidechains in theory in some undefined time in the future. Not so tasty.
And as you probably know, these unfederated sidechains to the main blockchain are doors to the whole new world of adoption. What an irony that what was Litecoin's main drawback: "hah, this shitcoin is just the copy, nevermind" became what the market needs right at that moment of time: "look, we can deploy LN/Sidechains in production with minimal investment".
And Speaking of sia/storj/ipfs this is complete stupidness to say that people should sit and wait while Bitcoin is ready for their ideas to flourish. Sia is not an altcoin, it's a network that creates one of the first few truly **cloud** storage systems: those that will host information around the whole globe in a decentralized way.
There will be such systems that does not use personal tokens, but some of these first will last for quite some time.
Look man, there are some valuable projects out there, even if 95% is bullshit. Why do you want to stop the information about some astonishing projects on this subreddit only because they have their own token? Are only posts about ETH-as-a-scam allowed here?

Copay runs through Bitcore Wallet Service that does not enforce BIP148. If there is fork and you spend btc with Copay they will go into legacy blockchain.

Can't agree. It's much easier to memorize 8 picture-representable meanings than 8 abstract symbols (like in secure password: 8 symbols, at least one digit ect)


Doesn't matter; wallet software can replace the visual representation if something from emoji-list got changed (rare case).


That is actually a positive property. The only place you need to backup these symbols is your head.


I am sorry but that does not solve the problem cause you still need to back up **your** key.

Being not ideally fungible does not exclude the fact that crypto-primitives are used to archive decentralized state of the currency, thus Bitcoin IS decentralized cryptocurrency. Monero is an improvement of the concept, not invention of the new one.

Since the beginning of July: AlphaBay RIP, Hansa RIP, RAMP RIP. Now, BTC-E is going RIP. Governments just started the open war against crypto guys, and we are probably in trouble. Expect some major crash soon.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:07:15
Another point is that we can't make Bitcoin anonymous in a near future. zk-snark crypto is *highly* experimental and resource heavy; ring signatures and co (Monero tech) is too heavy for Bitcoin's 1mb-10min bandwidth. At best we will have a side chain in a few years. Though, the best approach is to use Monero right now for everything that requires privacy.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:52:32
I am glad people realizing that it is not about single dominant blockchain, but about a network of blockchains (tress) and related side-chains (branches). The future is fantastic guys.

We can, but 1. LN won't serve the whole darknet's transactions and 2. It is likely those who need real anonymity would prefer opaque blockchains such as monero.
That said, LN are improvement on privacy, but this is not a bullet that will magically make Bitcoin anonymous.

"Two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I am not yet completely sure about the universe"

Agree. Sidechains are breakthrough techs. Will eliminate most of the altcoins. Currently I just can't figure out what can't be done with sidechains so it turns out that two factors will play a role for alts:
- Infrastructure 
- Community
Interestingly, in terms of infrastructure only litecoin can potentially have enough support (because of ease of adoption from current Bitcoin businesses and their willing to do so after segwit update)
In terms of community I think monero and sia have a chance. Bad times for Eth and Zcash...
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:58:05
This is amazing.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:45:36
You are incredibly ignorant.
- I can spent this few transactions per year to withdraw some bitcoins into Lightning channel and use it for off-chain payments that are almost free.
- If Bitcoin's lightning is insufficient for the worlds demand I can change some bitcoins to litecoins and use Lightning there. Oh, wait, why do I need to change something explicitly if that can be done automatically with cross-chain atomic swaps? Oh, wait... Do you believe that Bitcoin will fail if people use another currency for daily purchases and Bitcoin for the savings? Is that all or nothing thing? Isn't your imagination broken then? aren't you being fooled that we all die soon if hard fork does not happen until the end of the year?
Fuck that, man. 30$ is cheaper than what's western union offers
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:05:34
Thanks. Though, this mistake will stuck for ages in the title.

From where have your understanding of this problem came from? I somehow was able to get it, even though Wikipedia article wasn't helpful at all.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:14:11
why do you assume that only people who can afford tx fees should be able to run a node?
I can clearly imagine a future where a transaction on-chain costs say $30 and I can only afford only few such transactions per year but in the same time I can straighten the network that gives humanity an independence from the government with a $100/year  node (these costs are in fact less then the cost per year of the plastic in my wallet).
If you can't, you'd better go learn some economics.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:07:52
This problem will be resolved just after someone big will switch to BIP148 enforcement. And this will almost inevitably happen one day in August.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:53:59
As far as I can see, miners cartel can orphan segwit transactions in the same manner users can orphan non-segwit blocks in bip148 thus effectively censoring segwit functionality. In reality, economics won't let this happen cause segwit adds value to the blockchain and it is possible to orphan blocks from this cartel as well, incentivizing pro-segwit mining.

Women in an industry is a good sign that a lot of money will flow into it soon.
FYI. I be been into Bitcoin since late '11 but didn't buy a single coin until late '13. Cause I just wanted to understand this tech and figure out how things work and why this thing is valuable and important. I got it and explained to my gf in simple terms. She bought her first Bitcoin right before the late '13 bubble few days after I explained her what that all means. And she is as hodler as a rock. Fantastic woman.

Imagine: a super secret team of genius mathematicians, economists, programmers and cryptographers of the Japanese government that was researching the idea of cryptocurrency to finally eliminate this usd scam. They found a solution, but the only way to present it to the world was to quietly publish it among geeks. This tactic gave them a lot of time (cause if they published it openly the USA would kill this project in it's infancy). Nine years late the critical mass is nearly archived, Japan became the first country to integrate Bitcoin into national economy.
One year from now: the usd bubble bursts, western world is in dark asshole, though Japan, China, India, South Korea and some other countries have just step into new economic era.
