Great comment on what happened.
I think where we failed as a community is emphasizing the risks attached to the nature of Bitcoin. Decentralization and lack of authority are great, but it comes with high risk; that is, you cannot trust third parties.
It's time to forget anything that resembles an analogy to a bank.

Yes, the situation is much better if you want to transfer money within the European Union.

Yes. I would have opted for bitcoin if the buyer had any idea what's it. But I notice more and more "non-techy" people know or own bitcoin. So I guess we just have to be patient.

I love seeing Dogecoin on the list. The the Moon!

I tried these but worked pretty bad. A bad quality, buggy website with horrible user experience. If I were you I would take the stairs down and walk 1 minute to Levykauppa Äx record shop and use their bitcoin ATM. It works like a charm and has a fair rate:

You know what will? The awesome community behind it. Something Bitcoin doesn't really have. Just mean people like yourself.

I think that comparison doesn't make sense.
Bitcoin is not a software product and not a company, it's an alternative currency with a floating exchange. It's backed by an innovative technology but don't be fooled by that. 
WhatsApp's value depends mostly on some important KPIs (revenue per user, number of active users, future business plan) and its assets vs loans. Bitcoin's value and so its market cap depends generally on the trust associated with it and its future. You can easily see this. Good and bad news about the cryptocurrency have had a huge impact on the exchange rate.
Only part of that trust is coming from the number of Bitcoin users. The way I see it a large part of the trust is added by the number of merchants accepting Bitcoin (see Baidu). Another thing is, as Bitcoin is still a very speculative investment vehicle, the promise of making big money (and as such past exchange rate tendency) influences value as well.
I do think Bitcoin has a potential to grow its market cap by orders of magnitude, but it's not comparable to WhatsApp or any other company or product. If you really want to compare it to something, an interesting thing to look at is the world's M0 money supply (~"all the cash in the world"). That is roughly around $60 trillion. Bitcoin's value right now is 0.001% of all that. In my opinion it's not unrealistic that it grows to at least 0.1% in the next five years, which is a 100x increase (it's a currency after all) even if the value of a single coin will not increase that much because about half of the coins are still not mined.
What I'm not sure about is that Bitcoin will always be market leader. I think there are some fundamental issues with PoW that are difficult to address and I really see PoS currencies like Peercoin taking off on the long run. In shorter run altcoins with strong community (e.g. Dogecoins) are good investment.

So apparently Bitcoin community sucks.

Yeah good point. Right now popularity and volatility. I can use bitcoin ATMs to the my money I'm Europe when I need it. I own some Dogecoin and Peercoin myself too.
