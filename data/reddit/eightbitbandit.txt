I've used the service several times now for Amazon codes, and it's always been very quick. I have a friend who said his Newegg code took a few hours, but he was satisfied with it as well.

Sigh. I consider myself security conscious. I've had a lot of activity on my account, so it didn't surprise me to get something like this. As soon as I typed my user/pass, I knew what I did. Immediately went to go reset my pass, but it was too late. They've got a script jacking the account as soon as it gets credentials. Byebye 12 btc :(

I just swapped from phoenix to cgminer last night, and absolutely love it. I have 2x 5830's and 1x 5770. They total about 700mh/s currently, I need to reflash my bios on my 5830's to up the gpu speed cap (factory on mine are 875, but I've tested them up to 1000 just fine). Memory on all 3 is 300 while mining. I'm also running my own p2pool node off an old laptop I had laying around.

I invested nothing over the electricity cost of mining with my old 4870 and my wife's 5770. I used the coins that I accumulated from that, sold at $30, and bought two 5830's that are running 24/7 on mtred. I also took out a loan from a buddy who got in early, invested in a mining op on GLBSE, and swapped my miners to pay out to him to repay things. All in all, I'm waaaaaay ahead.
