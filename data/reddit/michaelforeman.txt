If people are prepared to pay out $400 million for BTC at current prices... surely that’s great news

Is gold a store of wealth and a worldwide payment system? ... no, but bitcoin is both so surely that is two use cases?

Market cycles are natural and on average actually do happen every ten ish years. They don’t have to but haven’t failed to for the past 50 years so why would we doubt the law of averages this time? That would be gamblers fallacy!
We are due a correction in the short term (the exact start, size and length of which, however is unknown). You only have to look at the Dow Jones over 50 years on google to see how massively overpriced it is against its moving average...
We can also use indicators like bond and gilt yield curves, monetary &amp; fiscal policy, inflation etc to hazard a good guess when a downturn is imminent.
And Warren Buffet is a long term investor... idolised for his ability to judge the success of companies long term....market cycles matter little to investors with a long time horizon so I’m not sure why you used him as your example.

The order book is fundamental to the price and how a market works in its simplest form

MT Gox but it never got as far as a market order haha

Doesn’t matter what companies are doing for bottom line (that would be more of a reason to choose to invest in a specific company in a portfolio) It doesn’t have much to do with the fact that the Dow Jones still being overpriced compared to long moving average apart from maybe trying to get yield or P/E ratio up in an expensive market....

Store of wealth and a fast worldwide payments network would make two uses therefore plural

Lets not lower the intellect of the discussion by name calling but instead have an educated conversation above that of a child.
I wasn’t supporting the other commenter, merely correcting your statements, timing the market is impossible, predicting the market is entirely possible.
I predict that these markets (ie a few of the companies within them) will still be here in five, ten, twenty years time and be worth more than they are now (or I wouldn’t invest) ... I can’t say how low or high the markets will go in that time but I can say my investment plan is for the long term so I will be holding throughout whatever happens in between.

I think you need to consider the pages you’re taking information from a little more then haha

I think the article is getting at the fact there was insider dealing... 
No one puts 400m in and out as quickly as described without knowing something no one else does...

Errrrm if you live in a caravan I could understand your comment about your house being deflationary but other than that, you’re talking ��
What about BTL? A form of leveraged investment where you actually get great yields and ROE?!
Not to mention the human race is expanding every day and people need to live somewhere causing ever increasing demand... 
Just a couple of points to support my point that you may want to consider.. I could come up with more but I don’t want to bore peeps!

Handy research undertaken just the same...

The sun do so well with the story description and have to ruin it right near the end with the whole “experts forecast the bubble is ready to burst”... can we not just have an interesting story with no FUD???
Good post though...
@_date: 2018-03-07 10:26:40
So which one is it not?

Speak for yourself
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:59:10
Easy to say but fiat has been around the block, and most know its value... how do you price something in bitcoin when you don’t know what it’ll be worth in a week... the only thing we know is value against our local currency not a global one and this will be a long process to “switch” over 
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:02:47
Lol cos the trillion dollar banking system is just going to fade away yeah? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:47:19
Or just diversification...
Not diversifying is a fatal flaw in ANY investment strategy... but the article makes some interesting points.
Edit: 38% of my portfolio is BTC
