You think this is a fad?
This must be your first time hearing about a decentralized currency.
Welcome to bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:44:31
Did you check out his worse than useless video?
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:36:03
Ok, technically you're correct. The entire globe is "centralized" if you think about it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:37:37
EXRNChain is one of those side chains that links them all together. 
After watching Andreas I'm fascinated with how much control they (gov't and banks) have and I'm excited to see what this new frontier will bring, and who is going to fight it. It kinda reminds me of when the RIAA tried to stop music being on the internet (cause they could sell CDs in stores). They won some court battles, but lost the war. As a result, music sales have increased and even some early adopters (like Apple) created a platform to sell it and made billions.
This time who's going to fight the inevitable? Who's going to adopt it and become insanely rich?
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:06:37
Give it time, this is brand squeaking new and it's still finding it's stride.
We've been living in a secret surveillance banking state since the 70s, it might take more than a couple years to figure out how to allow everyone to trade with confidence.
edit: Wow. I haven't seen such a sub that's against it's own namesake so much.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:11:53
I always thought it was pronounced "hoe-dl"
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:39:38
Mom's tit? esh. I see you're continuing to make assumptions.
You "woke," huh?
You seem like the kind of person who lacks conviction. Like, "I'm not going to vote cause whats the point, they're all the same, my vote doesn't count" kinda guy. Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:55:00
How is it not?
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:11:46
Isn't that pretty much all of reddit though?
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:18:33
And then sell it to whatever cambridge analytica changed their name to, but not before getting hacked and losing all your financial data
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:54:07
It is more than a get rich quick scheme, and also those that want to get rich are doing so. Remember the Internet IPO bubble? Did it kill the internet when it crashed? No. Were there some losers and really big winners? Yes.
We're kinda in that now. The internet is changing again because the way we transact is being changed at it's core. The box has already been opened. Bitcoin is at the price it's at because people believe that's the price it should be, just like the US dollar is the price it is because people believe it should be.
If you're lost on wallstreet, I understand how you could be lost on this. It's not easy to wrap your mind around it. I'm still learning myself, but I'm also not going to brush it off because I don't understand it.
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:50:23
Yes but they have the ability to then take it from that bank account.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:02:00
That's brilliant! Good job, you. You've saved the internet.
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:49:01
Fuck cashapp. They will rip the money from any account you attach it to without your permission. They will also not let you refund any money that was accidentally paid to you. They also have 0 phone support and their "email support is a joke."
Fuck cashapp
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:56:37
You're right. If it takes more than 9 years to do something then "fuck it."
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:59:18
There's a vast difference between a leader and a king.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:53:04
What's a hodler?
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:19:40
That's what I thought, just wanted to confirm. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:55:55
So should I buy and sell only through gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:42:56
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:23:49
Anyone wish it would go in super sale again?
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:53:03
Cause no one's trading it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:39:57
You better believe my Credit cards are primed for that one (OK it's not a lot of money, but I get excited all the same)
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:08:21
That$ $o intere$ting!
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:21:20
What does log do to it?
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:35:56
ahh, and it can be used to kind of "normalize" a chart
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:51:13
Love the graphs! Thank you!
(This is a very light 4)
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:24:00
Where/who was that guy that predicted this time and time again?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:14:46
The insult and the denial. Harsh
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:44:30
Ripple nipple bastards!
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:51:34
On tradingview, is there any way to put the volume on the right side? (I think it's volume). I used to slap the volume bought/sold on the right to show me the support resistance levels.
Which support/res indicators do you use?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:07:39
Who thinks that he's the one that actually invented bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:54:43
Dear God I hope despair is in the future. I'd love to gobble some up sub-$9k.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:38:56
Yeah I'm just learning about these "Fork" things and SegWit2 and whatnot. I wish there was like one of those ELI5 videos I could watch.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:17:42
I'm looking for credit card purchases
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:58:08
Every movement needs a leader, a figurehead, someone for everyone else to look to when shit goes crazy.
Otherwise they attack each other and nothing is accomplished
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:34:25
Satoshi bless
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:43:59
That's a really good explanation. I was reading about some Segwit2 fork that would push for 2MB blocks.
I see what you mean, if normal people can't mine it, then super rich can and control it (including gov'ts).
So why are the fees an issue? They have to be recorded in the blockchain as well and with all the transactions it hits a ceiling? (Trying to wrap my head around it)
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:41:55
I don't think my little baby card can hang mining btc
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:47
Bought at 14.6, damnit. Oh well, Stay Calm and Hodl On.
Btw, is there a discord server?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:40:26
Wish I had $5k in it, I'm just scrounging with such a small amount.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:59:48
Not sure if you're joking, or chancing your livelihood on speculation
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:03:15
I'm not a big fan of inconsistency on the Ledger (menus, different .exe for bitcoin and ripple) but I do feel so much safer
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:24:24
Agreed, especially with all the attacks it's gotten recently
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:20:25
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:14:06
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:10:14
I see that now. How do I cancel a pending bank transfer?
Oop. Guess I gotta wait till it clears. No worries.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:37:47
So basically you buy from Coinbase or wherever, then offload to your wallet and stuff it in a safe place and then watch bitcoin soar safely knowing that whatever happens you're safe?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:25:44
Quick question. Is Ripple centralized? Why is it so popular if it is?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:11:16
Ahhhh, as a newb, I didn't know. Now, it makes sense.
I read a few months ago about a guy that came on Reddit and posted talking about the 10k hit soon to come.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:55:03
I'm in the same boat. You wa.t personal information without even any features is a no go
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:19:44
I purchased a Trezor one.
Basically I'm not planning on unloading my Bitcoin, just buy more with cash so there's no real reason to have it on anyone's wallet but my own.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:30:59
BCH? Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:36:45
Why did you go with this over the Trezor?
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:46:49
When I was trading futures, I used some software that allowed me to see the levels that were supported a lot better than what GDAX is doing. I just thought you might have something better running.
And which bitcoin is the real ticker?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:22:40
Not yet. We still have one more tpuch of 10k
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:51
I just saw the video with that dude "multimillionaire no chill" rage quit an interview.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:19:21
My nano ledger s came before my trezor. Excited to use both
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:57:36
Finally someone talking my language.
What are you using to monitor the levels?
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:18:31
I'm actually impressed with the photoshoop 
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:29:59
Put a line completely through the S
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:11:51
Remember when tether had all those billions and billions as backup $$? What happened to that money?
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:49:49
Something went wrong.
Try again.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:10:30
Has a little Game of Thrones music with a twist and a whole lotta fun
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:41:51
... and then selling.
@_date: 2019-06-08 01:53:34
Sad sad worf.
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:45:36
What's a maker? What's a taker?
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:13:36
I laughed, I admit it.
But btc hasn't broken free yet. That means it's a baby bubble and we'll see a correction.
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:14:48
Everytime it drops feels to me like a reason to buy in; theres so much increasing talk and increasing adoption during these bumpy times that any bear action will be followed up by bulls someday.
It's confirmation that crypto is the future.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:26:48
I've currently got a credit card attached to coinbase, it looks like I can't use credit card for GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:42:21
So you're telling people not to now? Is that the message of this?
@_date: 2019-06-18 10:53:21
When you and the boys are part of a banking conglomerate
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:15:10
It looks like it can't, but GDAX can? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:34:53
So I want to buy $100USD if it hits $5000 for a bitcoin on GDAX. I hit limit, but but what do I put in the amount (BTC) and limit price (USD)?
@_date: 2019-04-06 13:09:54
I like the way you think
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:23:07
Lol, most expensive thing you'll ever buy in 20 years
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:41:37
They've got 8k TVs there for tens of thousands so putting a limit is smart
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:46:57
Lol got this too
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:41:46
You're right. It would've been 0.
@_date: 2018-11-24 02:00:42
Not enough upvotes. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:03:07
Someone needs to graph these dates a barchart
@_date: 2019-01-27 03:41:42
I can buy it in about 15 to 20 minutes from my credit card
@_date: 2019-01-09 11:44:11
Sorry, you are rate limited. Please wait a few moments then try again.
Thanks twitter.
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:31:26
To shreds you say
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:21:31
They had laws in place for crypto in 2013? That's progressive.
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:19:05
Jigga What?
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:57:05
Interest is still there, but the fear of btc volatility is also there
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:52:21
Aren't they looking solely on when they convert back into fiat?
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:20:29
Not on coinbase (anymore).  I only pay like 4% when I make a purchase 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:24:30
Depends on your cost per wattage. A couple 1070s at 30 cents could net you $140 to $300+ a month
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:20:37
Considering since it's panda express, those "returns" that it's referring to will hit you in about 30 minutes.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:45:29
Wasn't there a dude that makes those predictions on here and said to buy?
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:44:49
What's really strange is they don't accept AMEX, but they say they do.
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:18:05
 
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:32:19
What's  the fees to xfer to another source, like a hard wallet or another exchange?
@_date: 2019-09-20 02:05:27
Hello from the front page!
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:31:33
Or verge 
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:15:04
So is it having 1btc or 21 btc?
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:47:50
Waiting for the pull back for another injection of fiat
@_date: 2019-05-08 10:45:57
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:41:11
Lol. I gotta get to the 26 million club, then I'd have more than I'd have now
@_date: 2019-05-25 01:23:33
Wind blows
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:40:29
So how does this work?
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:55:18
I feel there's going to be a pullback
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:24:38
People who actually use bitcoin, you da real MVP
@_date: 2018-12-31 22:34:40
Immaculate Bitception.
I'd only heard of it, but, until now...
