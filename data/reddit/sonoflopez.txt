They don't keep it. . . after 180 days you can withdraw to a bank account. I don't know why everyone here acts like they can just take the money.

MAKE BITCOIN REIGN, LET REDDIT GOLD RAIN.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:47:21
It's speculation on what bitcoin can become. Soon, it could be instant
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:31:59
Yeah, that's why I want to do it too. I'm part of a sub-community that specializes in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency so I am getting them on board as much as I can too.
Ill drop you a PM sometime today.
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:41:04
Hey, I'm a fifteen year old too and I have a lot of my peers interested in BTC, but not to the point where they would actively use it. 
How is the adoption over there?
@_date: 2014-01-28 07:47:50
Contrary to popular belief, not all malware has ultra-fucking-hardcore persistance. MB:AM is the best solution, but if you're ultra paranoid then get a new computer.
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:05:51
We COULD monetize it, but we'd need to be well known. I plan on expanding with a MyBB Forum after we get a loyal fan base.
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:11:26
I dont suggest getting into this if you are in it for money.
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:47:00
There are always alternatives. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:33:30
Yeah, I got one of my friends who so happened to have around 2Gs in gold and had him move it into BTC back in January 2013 (~$30 a Coin) and he made a killing, so that's what spread it in my school.
@_date: 2014-01-27 06:00:23
Get Malware Bytes: Anti Malware. I code crypters and occasionally Delphi and VB.NET based malware. If the crypted file doesn't have an anti for MB:AM, then this is the strongest tool against it. Also, a system restore would do the job if you're extra paranoid.
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:48:40
He's pointing out its something you don't *have* to do.
Exchanges are ease-of-use, hence why you pay fees to use it.

I'm looking to start a crypto currency news letter (TheBitJournal.com) if you have any interest to work with me on that I'd love to have you aboard.
Edit: Hijacking this comment of mine even though it doesn't have much up votes.  
I'm looking for people who are interested in writing articles.
PM me or reply here and ill get in contact.
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:35:48
Yeah, no, the only ways to obtain BTC (for people not willing to take chances) and Coin base, BTC-E, and LocalBitcoins. Its still frustratingly hard to obtain BTC, even as an adult.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:12:59
No it won't happen simply because of the timeframe it would take.
@_date: 2015-03-18 14:02:57
Ah my bad. I see your point now, my mistake. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:19:40
ASIC just means a processor made to accomplish a certain goal. 
ASICs for Bitcoin are made for SHA256, he's saying it could be made for any type of encryption, I.e. AES.
@_date: 2013-08-25 16:30:33
My entire family is lawyers.
I have an extremely powerful dedicated server hosted offshore.
As far as the wiki quote, I want to see something that makes Bitcoin fall under a financial instrument seeing as I could go out and make an online casino that wagers point on my website or something of the sort, I don't see how you could call Bitcoin a "financial instrument" under US law as of right now.
I have already thought about if someone wins all on one bet, so at first I'm going to start with a Max bet of 1 BTC. If I lose it all that quick, then Ill go work for some more BTC. You win some, you lose some.
If Bitcoin crashes then my Bitcoins are worth pennies anyway.
And house edge/mechanics are still being worked out. This has only been in development for a week or so.
Also this is not my first bitcoin venture, I run a private pool for a specific website and its community, which nets me about .60 Bitcoin a day.
Sorry if I failed to answer all your questions.
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:08:08
This is for bitcoin. Please stay on topic. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:58:23
Holy fuck how hard I laughed at this.
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:47:15
Ive been using bitcoins for a few years, but I'm looking for a way to get Bitcoin, not to store them.
Edit: and the instant part is really important, otherwise I would be content with CoinBase.
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:03:28
I believe that its because BFL and other ASIC miners are finally being shipped, as far as shares dropping I'm not "in the know" on it but I believe it has something to do with the sudden influx of more ASIC miners.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:31:57
They're still worth something. Bitcoin wasn't always traded somewhere.
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:43:54
So three women are at the gynecologist and the first one looks at the rest and says, "I was thinking of Todd while I was having sex (a boys name) so I'm gonna have a baby boy!"
The second woman looks at the others and says, "I was thinking of Sarah so I'm going to have a baby girl!"
The third on stands up and goes, "FUCK! I'm going to have a puppy!"
Best joke I got ;_;
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:33:33
Didn't verify lol.
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:24:40
I replied to you in another thread..


At school, a lot of people invested in things, and I was known as the guy that wouldn't shut up about bitcoin.
Well, I convinced two of my friends to invest 400$ cash into me, so that's 800$, then another student took all his money out of gold and gave it to me which was 1,600$.
Long story short I bought 13.7 BTC for 146$ a piece. I was at school watching the charts at Mt.Gox almost 24/7.
When it hit 220$ I sold them all and walked away with ~3,000$. I returned the 400+100$ to each of my friends and 1700$ to the gold kid. I walked away with 1,300$ and called it a day.
I'm now wanting to start the Satoshi Square equivalent in Columbus, Ohio.
I'm the creator of and I'm currently trying to find out how to drive traffic to it.
To answer your question, I'm known throughout my district as a guy that can make money off of investments. I've pulled around 5,000$ in investments in the past month, and made around 3,000$ profit on it so far.
This is on something unrelated to Bitcoin, but if I told someone to give me money for a Bitcoin venture, they would without hesitation.
Edit: Still didn't answer your question.
I'd bring it up in my economics classes and my AP programming and I'm sure it would catch fire *very* quickly.
@_date: 2013-08-25 21:34:08
Yes, I do think like a 14 year old, but I also know when to walk away from something and right now I'd rather test it before leaving it.
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:15:59
How about you take a seat.
@_date: 2013-08-24 15:08:35
Didn't know. Thanks for that information.
@_date: 2013-08-25 15:48:04
My devs are working for percentages... I don't know what online businesses you've attempted to start but this is by far the best way to make a quality website as fast as possible in my eyes 
@_date: 2013-08-25 07:46:36
I came here to Reddit to ask the community what they want to see in a Bitcoin gambling site. I want to be a cut above the rest, so why not just throw suggestions and help shape the Bitcoin community?
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:14:48
I'm not sure I understand the question.
Rephrase it please.
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:36:53
The engine only processes transactions, not bank transfers.
@_date: 2013-08-25 21:52:40
Precisely, I want to just experiment with this site, I don't think people understand that.
I wanted to make it for as low cost as possible, I don't want to make an income off of this, just a fun little side project, and maybe make something a bit innovative too.
@_date: 2013-10-11 11:16:16
Can you post a picture? I kinda want to see it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:56:25
If you're going to mine, you can do or right now. I suggest you mine ProtoShares (its a CPU only alt-coin so everyone has fair chance.) Its not traded public anywhere but I heard that they go for over $7 a share(coin). Hard to believe, but that's what I've heard.
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:02:15
Uh, its projected to be done at 2033.
@_date: 2013-08-23 04:40:17
I figured as much. Dunno, my sleepy brain thought of it.
Thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2013-11-12 13:00:37
The point is this:
When someone buys someone else a coffee in line they *usually* buy the person behind them a coffee too, so its just a big chain. Do it with Bitcoin and its a hell of a publicity stunt.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:24:13
AFAIK parents have almost complete power over their children.
Edit: Until 18
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:05:05
Imagine my surprise when I realized that my birthday was recently. I'm not used to calling myself 15 yet, oh well... The digit doesn't change anything.
@_date: 2013-08-25 07:39:11
Might I suggest  in the mean time?
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:28:49
Sorry it took a while to reply, I'm sleeping.
Alright well, I get a bank statement every so-often, and my R# is on there along with my bank account number. I also have my social security (although I can't use it like you can on PayPal) 
I just buy it. Spent my $80 I had on .25 BTC I think two weeks ago? Its already appreciated to $200+ on that $80.
I believe that the best way to make an impact on someone is saying "I believe in this and am willing to go all in on it." And that's exactly what I did with Bitcoin. And it was a good investment, my parents now allow me to manage my funds as I please and they set me up a PayPal student account that has direct access to my bank account.
I hope that was a satisfactory explanation of what happened.
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:09:04
Its still a currency. Just because I'm using it for its purpose doesn't make it something else.
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:17:11
Thanks, this will be very helpful.
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:08:04
Made me chuckle.
I think it'll be around 2033 by the way.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:06:51
He was making a reference to the beginning of the Internet and how much of an impact it had.
@_date: 2013-08-25 16:02:19
I don't understand the problem with having devs that are willing to work for a cut of the profits, but oh well.
Ill be sure to take into account that my site is going to be shit supposedly. Thank you for your input.
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:36:11
Well what don't you understand? Ill happily ELI14
@_date: 2013-08-25 15:51:27
I don't think you guys understand that my devs are not freelance devs or working for a company, they're people who wanted to make one for fun and I'm the man with the means to make it happen, the percentages are just a bonus in their eyes.
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:26:54
Matters a fact I made a few grand off of the April Boom.
At school, a lot of people invested in things, and I was known as the guy that wouldn't shut up about bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-08-25 15:49:57
Yes I am more of a businessman. I do have a few connects in the world of Bitcoin and should probably utilize that. I specialize in SEO and online marketing. But the easiest way to advertise something, from how I do it, is to have at least one really *different* thing that no one else has, which is what I'm looking for.
@_date: 2013-08-25 15:46:50
I'm fairly sure there's different rules for Bitcoin or the regulation for Bitcoin/laws have not gone into effect seeing as the ruling to make them a real currency is so new.
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:24:05
Its a joke.
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:32:58
It really depends on your skill set. You asked how I'd do it. That's how I would and **have** done it.
Others... They'd have to be really into Bitcoin to figure out what would be their niche.
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:39:15
I mean.. I know these guys are top-notch, they're friends of mine and they work for a local computer development firm in my area. I'm a website developer and computer programmer myself and have been for the past four years. Its not like I'm hiring people my age to do this. Its getting done the right way.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:40:53
Except it is a currency.
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:31:34
Honestly I am enjoying all the questions that are actually making me think. I've set up a meeting with my lawyers and I'm considering new devs that I pay a fee instead of percentages.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:35:57
As a fifteen year old who can't convince his parents to buy jack-shit into Bitcoin even though I've been telling the to since it was worth $30 a coin, just get CoinBase verified to a bank account and go all in. I saw the crash last week and I decided to buy in at $314 a coin. Que addictions to watching BTC charts. I've already turned that $80 (.25 BTC) into $130 and I literally don't even have it in my wallet yet. I'd say all in all it was a pretty good impulse buy.
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:32:18
What state do you live in? If you're doing a meetup close I'd love to see it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:48:00
Yeah, I expect a mass sell at 1k. Maybe it'll take a day but it will happen.
Talk to your parents about it, explain to them that its your money and you want to invest it to make more money, and if you get burned then that's on you, not them, and will be a good life lesson.
@_date: 2013-08-24 15:08:15
My friends understood that if it crashed they would be shit out of luck.
But I did promise the kid who invested from his gold his money back, I had 2,000$ in the bank at the time so I could pay him back in full.
Me and my friends do shit like this all the time. We've lost in the upwards of 4,000$ before.
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:02:44
Do you need to provide ID?
@_date: 2013-08-23 19:13:02
Thanks. My first bit coins.
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:55:05
I'm looking for a way to do it more instantly. But, this is my backup method if there's no other way.
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:29:28
By making the square.
3D printers print plastic, not paper, so it would be cheaper and easier to make (I guess). 3D printers are known to not be that high-quality though.
@_date: 2013-08-23 20:35:46
I want to get into selling BTC but I only have 2 USD worth of bitcoin, and I'm fourteen so its not possible to spend my own cash on them. Meaning, working for BTC would be the best option.
Edit: BYC-&gt;BTC. Stupid spell check.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:54:03
He was trying to make it more practical. If you 3D print then it can sell for $5-$10 a piece.
@_date: 2013-08-25 08:05:26
Yes but there is a market for it and I plan on making the best one possible.
My devs only get paid if we make money, so we will make the best damn site possible.
Still open to suggestions.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:30:26
Just tell your parents, unless they're going to take your coin what harm is it in telling them now? Its a damn good investment and you made a good decision, my parents would be chill with it.
@_date: 2013-08-23 18:49:48
You should add something that tracks the amount of successful transactions you've completed. It'd helps feel easier about giving you my money.
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:29:11
No allowance or money.
My parents are tight as hell with cash.
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:17:35
I wouldn't invest until Mt.Gox goes offline (which I think will happen very soon). Also, the ASICs make mining unprofitable without a huge botnet, so there's no point in that. And you don't need a pool if you're not mining. If you have an ASIC miner, then I suggest the Eligius pool.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:48:25
Or get your bank account R# and bank number, make a coin base account, verify, buy BTC. That's what I did when I was 14, now 15.
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:37:52
I hate how people think just because I'm 14 means I'm incapable of doing something like this.
I'm no different from you, or anyone else. I'm a freelance web developer and wanted to make a Bitcoin gambling site. I came here for suggestions **not riticule**.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:00:47
As a 15 year old with an unreasonable mother she'd just take my license or just call the cops.
@_date: 2013-10-25 12:07:45
Step one: have 36000 bitcoin
@_date: 2013-10-11 12:12:00
I'm sorry but I don't believe 0.01 BTC or 0.02 BTC is enough to make anyone want to write an article.
You should think of ways to sweeten the deal. Many people enjoy being "internet famous". Provide them an avenue for that and you're going to get much more article writers.
@_date: 2013-08-25 06:07:40
I suggest you *target* businesses that you think would do this. An example would be not a clothing store but maybe a cafe or bar.
Also, the younger the management the higher the chance of it catching on.
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:35:29
Is that a joke or are you serious? I've never paid attention to my local BTC market.
@_date: 2013-08-25 16:23:33
This is a wonderful product and I think it will go very far.
