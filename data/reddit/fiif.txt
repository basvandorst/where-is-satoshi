Day I bought it fell by like 10% and I nearly sold right away. Since then I already sold an amount to make back the money I first put into it so going forward anything else is a bonus. As such couldn't give a shit. It can hit 0 tomorrow and while it'll suck it's not the end of the world

They'd need to buy the bitcoins off an exchange unless they already take it as payment and honestly if that's the case they'll rightly tell you to buy it yourself with your wage.
To soon for this tbh

Fuck this shit, have any of you ever worked in a busy company before? Some times you need to stop, put out the fires you already know about and then plan for the future.
If you want to make your opinion known vote with your wallet and go some where else

Possible expecting a massive correction in the price. it's already fallen today and could end up lower then it is now. Sell now, buy more bitcoin when it gets low enough and you've made money on the drop (assuming the price rises again). it's a risk because you lose out if it doesn't actually drop.

I've got 0.1 bit coin that I bought with money I honestly didn't know at the time. I wouldn't even considered the money lost if it hit 0 tomorrow. I'll hold until I need the money or it's high enough to be life changing. If it hits a million for example I'll cash out regardless. (but I doubt thats coming soon)

Fuck that, pay them like a normal person unless they actually use bitcoin. Fuck off

No, I like bitcoin but if I own someone money I'll pay them back in using a method they can easily access the fund on. But fuck, any banks out their who want to pay me to shitpost on reddit all day throw me a pm.

I've got a bunch of spare change that's been hitting in a tin. 350 euro's in it. I was able to live without it until now so that's how much I'm investing. If I loose it all it won't make a difference to me

It's "crashed" a few times now. I don't mean it lost 90% of it's value or anything, more it went down quite a decent amount and the media labeled it a crash. It will likely go down under 3k again (which will be labeled a crash) before going back up.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:21:32
It very likely will crash again at some point, but it'll go back up again. It's so hard to tell, it might crash to 1/4 it's value before rocketing up to 10k. No one really knows

A lot of people cashing out are clearing there debts by doing so and investing in stable markets from what I've read. Sounds like a fucking amazing thing to do. No matter where bitcoins go those people have set themselves up for life regardless, insane position to be in

And also , please do not invest more then you are able to lose. Yes it looks like it'll keep going up but if you invest your life saving and tomorrow it completely tanks then you're fucked (and it has tanked before and likely will again)

Bitcoin it's self has no transaction fee but Coinbase does. The ISP's would be explained if you're accessing it from different locations on your phone as each place will have a different IP address. Regardless update your password to be at least 12 characters long and completely random if possible. Use a manager such as lastpass.
