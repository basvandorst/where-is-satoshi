"You can do it!"
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:39:23
And where you're shopping. Let's not forget that bitcoin isn't accepted everywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:51:33
This exactly. How many times must it be said to never put in more than you can lose?  
  
I treat my bitcoin purchases as an alternative to purchasing "junk", though obviously not saying it is junk. Rather, I buy it, it sits there and I still have it. On the other hand, I could purchase "junk" that I'd use a few times or even never, then I either lose it, throw it away, or smoke it (cigarettes). In that case, I'd have spent that money on sh*t that I'll no longer have. It's money that I won't be missing, though, so why not put it into something that I can keep? If I do end up losing it in whatever manner, then I can treat it as the "junk" that it would've been otherwise. Then life goes on.  
  
All in all, it's a gamble, but it's not a gamble for my well-being. I'll still be fine regardless.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:40:59
$500-600 isn't what I'd call "way higher". What exchanges are you looking at?

Edit: ...yet
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:13:44
IIRC, it's the 18th.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:16:36
There's no reason you can't use both. ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:51:39
@_date: 2018-09-15 05:34:52
You think it's insane now? Try being one of the guys that bought at $19k+ ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:43:23
Seriously? Now that's news to me. Cool! :-P
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:43:09
Haha as of right now, they're set to 3300, 3200, 3150, 3100, 3075, and 3050.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:52:25
Be careful. If I were you, I'd have transferred my BTC to a new wallet with a different seed before using the same private keys for BCH. Any other way could risk your BTC being stolen, having now exposed your private key. Remember that BCH is still new, and not scrutinized/vetted anywhere near as much as bitcoin has.
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:58:01
The same thing could be said about nearly any currency.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:44:44
Admittedly, like every other time I regret, I wish I'd have bought when it was lingering around 2700. That's just my luck, though. :-P
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:51:15
XD I'm sure we're not alone.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:58:37
I gave em a dolla
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:17:57
Or $0.10
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:10:53
It may seem like an eternity, but BCH came about more quickly than that, which is why I don't trust it just yet (if I ever will). Some things need time, and crypto is one of those things.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:48:38
They're really not the same though. They may have the same outcome depending on who it's told to, but they're really not. In one case, you're straight up suggesting someone to invest in something simply because it's money they could afford to lose. In the other case, you're hoping that they *think* about their investment, and ultimately not to invest what they can't afford to lose should they decide to invest.  
  
Understand? Sure, grammatically they are pretty much the same sentence. However, psychologically, they are not.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:58:19
Dammit! 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:36:49
It's not about investing what you can lose, but rather, *not* investing what you *can't* lose. I think you miss the point.
@_date: 2019-10-24 01:35:37
Great. You broke it!
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:29:19
Actually, though I'm not sure it's in use in OP's QR code cuz I haven't checked it, QR codes have an error correction feature to restore data if the code is dirty or damaged. There are four levels of error correction available, each of which provides a different amount of error correction up to 30%. This would, theoretically, help to keep the QR code readable if the stencil isn't perfect. You can read more here: 
@_date: 2019-06-04 08:31:47
I hope you mean this in an educational, or at least a non-evil, sort of way. I'd hate to have aided in some sort of terrible scheme.
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:37:36
How do you figure?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:52:44
I like turtles
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:08:20
In times like these, absorb the fees.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:55:29
This exactly. :-)
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:16:26
I'm with you on that one. Personally, I'm waiting for a correction to buy bigger, but still buying smaller increments regularly.
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:10:45
Error correction in this case isn't necessarily susceptible to data manipulation. The most common thing to happen is scammers placing their own QR code over an existing one, which obviously has nothing to do with the exploitation of error correction. Reed-Solomon codes have been tried and tested for a long time, ever since they were originally developed in the 60s.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:38:12
Luckily, I've never had such a thing happen (knock on wood). Plus the last support ticket I submitted (less than a week ago) was resolved in just a little over a day, and that includes several back and forth replies.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:55:22
Pet rocks are still sold, are they not? :-P
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:02:14
Personally, I don't put in what I can't afford to lose. That should be the case for anyone, so it wouldn't be a huge deal either way.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:03:51
Exactly. If the price actually doesn't climb back up, I'll still be hodling anyways, since my investments into BTC were nothing I couldn't already lose. Therefore, no regrets for me regardless of any outcome.
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:40:59
I know that feeling all too well. ��
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:54:34
RemindMe! 3 hours
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:14:53
Apparently so, though I won't complain. Into my wallet with the others it shall stay. ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:58:59
I must've had some crazy foresight without reading a damn thing. I made a deposit that cleared just before the dip started, then I bought a couple days later. :-P
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:15:44
Technically not. Coinbase has it; the user only has a promise for it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:23:51
I made a post a few months ago about an app called [Privacy]( You link it to your bank account(s), and generate virtual Visa cards to use anywhere online that accepts Visa. I'd assume that includes coinbase, and you can even mask the charges so they don't appear to your bank to be coming from coinbase. That wasn't my intention when I wrote about it, but this seems like another great reason to use it now. :-P
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:22:43
You're using an iPhone, I'd assume, yes? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:35:03
In that case, therein lies the difference. Coinbase uses `FLAG_SECURE` on Android, which prevents in-app screenshots. :-P This should help to answer some other people's question.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:21:53
The OP's screenshot looks as though it's from an iPhone. iOS probably doesn't have an option similar to Android's `FLAG_SECURE`, though I may be mistaken.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:08:22
You'll want to withdraw directly from GDAX. Doing so will avoid the fee. Last time I checked (July), GDAX also covers the network fee, so what you withdraw is what you receive.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:38:19
Or rather ... end sarcasm
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:51:41
I think you mean nothing
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:18:55
Unless he "lost" his keys ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:51:43
My thoughts exactly. Regardless of whose advice you follow, bitcoin is still an investment of sorts. No investment is free of risk. If you can't afford to lose what you put in, you probably shouldn't be buying it in the first place.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:22:53
I hodled my scrotcoin
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:51:43

@_date: 2017-10-21 08:25:09
You too? Shit...I need more friends so I can tell them to hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:49:16
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:56:13
Ah. Well that makes much more sense now.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:23:42
Might I trouble you for a bit of hunny? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:54:53


@_date: 2017-10-21 08:28:57
Huh? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:25:50
You mean everyone doesn't keep them strapped on 24/7?? 
@_date: 2019-09-14 05:30:57
I think what they're getting at is that you seem to be comparing apples to oranges by comparing blockchain to marriage between two people.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:05:12
That kinda behavior belongs in r/jokes ��
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:11:07
Yea. I'll do this cuz free money! /s  
  
While it sounds great to the untrained ear, I'm not greedy enough to try and double my hodlings. If BCC actually does gain a real footing, fine. But I'm not jumping into that boat so quickly. In especially not looking up my BTC and keeping my fingers crossed that I'll be able to get them back.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:13:01
Luckily I pulled mine a little early, almost a week ago, and it only took an hour.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:57:07
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:26:45
I think you've hit the nail on the head. The way I see it, it's all about greed on the part of those exchanges, and greed/ignorance on the users' part attempting to double dip in a coin that doesn't exist yet. I'm seeing discussions about locking up one's bitcoin in an exchange to trade against BCC futures. In essence, one would send them their BTC, which will be frozen. You're then free to trade them on whatever BCC pair they offer, with a statement that they'll release your BTC after the fork. In such a situation, BCC could die a quick death of it comes to light, and one may never get their BTC from that exchange. At least that's how I'm understanding it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:28:58
Maybe, but it's possible (read: likely) that one of those coins will be worthless, or cease to exist. ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:22:08
Thanks for the vote of confidence. :-)
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:47:55
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:45:24
The private key is calculated based on the seed, so you should be good. :-)
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:14:24
What about the noobs like me that are hodling, yet still planning to buy when it makes a big dip? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:01:37
I've got alerts set to let me know when the price drops below 2400, 2300, 2200, 2100, and 2000. Keep poking! I wanna buy some more! Lol
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:00:41
I most certainly will.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:17:43
Office Space. :-P
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:50:39
Thanks so much for your insight. :-)
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:33:11
I believe he/she is referring to ViaBTC, but I honestly wouldn't trust them.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:47:28
Ok, so any coins that are moved *before* such a split would all be safe, correct?
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:51:34
Thanks for that. I guess I could've checked the code. I believe it's open source, anyways. :-P
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:43:27
I considered transferring, but wanted to avoid the confusion of having two wallets in the case that I didn't like the setup of whatever I switched to. With that said, any idea how to import the exported encrypted wallet file from the aforementioned app into Mycellium?
