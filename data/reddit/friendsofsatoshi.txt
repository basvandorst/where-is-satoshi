Thank you for having everyone's backs recently! You are really on top of it when it comes to these pitiful scam attempts.

It's the difference between having a bunch of people empowered and thrilled about using a new currency or scammed and disillusioned, completely turning them off from it. If it helps any, we could create PSA videos with very bold and easy to read announcements in a moment's notice.

BTCPay is the probably the best for Wordpress/Woocommerce, and BitPay, GoCoins, or Coinbase Commerce are the only options for Shopify right now. I think there are plans to bring BTCPay to Shopify at some point.

We have a long track record, from our media group Friends of Satoshi, to our state organization Nebraska Bitcoin Association.
Nonetheless, we may be offering special OpenDime version cards - although these will run $12-15 higher because of the cost of goods.
It is the same risk that one takes when purchasing a Casascius coin or even putting faith in the manufacturer of a hardware wallet.
We don't store private keys, plain and simple. I am happy to further discuss the manufacturing process, but ultimately through time and many happy customers, we will prove our reputation.
We are solving the problem of how do you transfer Bitcoin to someone who doesn't have a wallet? Right now OpenDime is one of the few solutions, but this is costly (over double) and is not as intuitive of a form factor.

Also, just wanted to mention that our price at $5.99 is quite competitive with other Hallmark/store-brand greeting cards that do not have any wallet. Certainly not required to use the wallet function. 
Perhaps will think about a DIY version that includes a obfuscation/scratch-off layer - so that one can generate their own private key. Not for a casual customer, but those interested in extra security. Thank you for your feedback!

Great story! Check out our project, Crypto Greeting Cards!   We're trying to replicate the same experience as yours, and make it more accessible to gift Bitcoin and share the message affordably.
