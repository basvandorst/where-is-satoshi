**EDIT: We have updated the site and are now selling yearly subscriptions.**  
We'll try to add a yearly buying option by the end of the day tomorrow which should enable a discount of about 70% over the monthly prices.  
We wanted to get the site out there fast to get your reactions, and we agree that there is still work to do :). 
@_date: 2013-05-29 01:48:16
You're hired! :) Should be fixed, check it out.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:34:15
Awesome, thanks for the feedback.  We'll definitely work on integrating a few more sites over the next little while so recommendations are welcomed.  
@_date: 2013-05-14 00:43:43
Thanks!  Should have mention that my digital content might be in the NSFW category... which seems to be against their ToS.

It should take 24 hours maximum, usually 2-6 hours.  It is highly dependent on the speed of our payment processor, BitMerch.

Hey Reddit!
For as long as we can remember we have been hesitant about purchasing porn because of the information that can be found on our credit card statement.  
Because of this we thought it would be a great idea to offer a service where you can anonymously purchase porn through our site using bitcoins as a payment method.  Please don’t hesitate to ping us at support if you need any help.
Thanks for your feedback and support :)

I've been able to reproduce this by resizing to a smaller screen.  Was it on a smaller screen/mobile?
@_date: 2013-05-17 13:25:38
Yup, you can definitely download the videos, those are definitely part of the many perks of having a membership ;).

As a believer in Bitcoin and believe in libertarian values.  Therefore, I'm pretty opposed to heavy moderation.  Let's let the free market regulate what makes it to the top and play our part as needed.  This is our community.

PM and sent.  Sorry about the mix-up my friend!

Hope you enjoy your subscription and thanks for being one of our early customers!  
We were swamped with orders yesterday but should be faster in the future :). 
@_date: 2013-05-27 03:19:20
I agree, there definitely is a good overlap between our values, I'll definitely be emailing (and hopefully donating) too!

We also saw the need to offer quality porn anonymously and that's why we created  Bitcoiners can now purchase porn from top vendors like Brazzers, Reality Kings and Mr. Skin. We're also about to relaunch the site with features that will enable users to purchase access to any site (will keep you updated).  Hopefully this is a helpful service for some Redditors ;).

Hi EatingTheNight,
Most of the discount for the yearly subscription is carried over from the actual site owners.  Turns out they try to incentivize you to buy yearly subscriptions.  We're also able to offer an additional discount on those subscription due to the higher ticket price.
If you're looking for 6 month option, feel free to use the web form option and request that length.  The posted sites are just to get your imagination flowing... :).

Hi bitcoinmaster,
