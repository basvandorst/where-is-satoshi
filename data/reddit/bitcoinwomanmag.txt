While differences between ways of percepting between men and women are quite obvious, well documented and can be considered scientific facts, differences between white and other coloured people in the same respect are statistically undetectable. So you have your answer. And now my question to all interested. We do our best to make bitcoin atractive to women, as they are underrepresented in this area. And this is not because of discrimination, but because of lack of information that should be also served in a way attractive to them. We know the specific of Interenet, however we are constantly astonished how few constructive remarks and advices we receive, but anyway, thank those who support us in what we do and struggle to understand deeper the reality that surrounds them.

Women aren't being alienated, just the opposite but men still tend to experiment with Bitcoin a lot more often, that's why we decided to pay extra attention to details that women might note when considering getting more involved in the Bitcoin.

Person is never equal to the other person, people are different, there are substantial differences between man and woman. Those differences are biological, psychological and cultural. All this affects perseption of different matters. It's not sexism, it's humanism!!!

Concerning desing I must say, I agree with you, it will be improved in the nearest future. 
But why consider supporting this initiative?
There are two types of people in the world: those who understand binary logic, and those who understand fuzzy logic.
In the first group are mostly men, in the second - WE are.
By the paradigm of biology women are more complicated, sophisticated and finesse. They deserve a source of information about cryptocurrencies adequate to their broader perception of reality.

Right. Our first language is German, second languages are Polish, Swedish, Russian, French and Greek. Probably we can make mistakes in lingua-franca. To reach considerable audience unfortunately we must use such a primitive language as English. Sorry for that and sorry for mistakes.
