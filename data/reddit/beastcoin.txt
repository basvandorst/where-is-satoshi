Yes you did miss it. Because you are still focused on a constructing an argument using equity and favors as analogs to finite digital tokens. 
Equity is the value of shares in a company. Bitcoins are not equity in a company. They are finite digital tokens that allow users to participate in the network for storing and sending value. Appcoins/altcoins are finite digital tokens that allow users to participate in whatever function the app provides.
Favors are something people do for somebody else out of kindness. When a person sends a bitcoin to another person they may be doing a person a favor (by giving them money) but they are more than likely just participating in a transaction - exchanging goods or services for that bitcoin. Eg. not a favor. 
Neither equity nor favors are good analogs to how the bitcoin system works, which is why your argument doesn't work. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 23:14:12
Right, but you use the equity as an analog to appcoin/altcoin tokens, which is a poor one as I illustrate. As such, the argument falls apart.


Is bitcoin not open-source? How come bitcoin tokens still hold value? Same applies to appcoins/altcoins that solve a unique problem in the market. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:48:03
That doesn't seem like the strongest argument to me. If you ask me, equities are not a good analog to app tokens. Commodities are. A couple of examples:
Internal combustion engine requires gasoline to move a car. Gasoline has a finite supply. If internal combustion engine becomes widely used gasoline then becomes subject to supply and demand price pressures. Those who wish to drive an internal combustion engine need to pay the market price for gasoline. 
APP-1 requires token-1 to function (eg. store files, bet on predictions, etc). Token-1 has finite supply. If app-1 becomes widely used then token-1 becomes subject to supply and demand price pressures. Those who wish to participate (store files or bet on predictions) need to pay market price for the tokens. 
It's very possible app-1 will never get off the ground and thus a lot of people will have lost their hard earned bitcoin for a useless digital token, but it's also possible it will and millions of people will use the app. Under this scenario those who hold token-1 may be able to resell at a price greater than that which they bought it for (eg. it will have been a good investment.).
Am I missing something?

I support some altcoins/appcoins when I believe there is a unique use case that can't be fulfilled by bitcoin - such as maidsafe, storj, peertracks, etc. 
One could argue any of the aforementioned can in fact be built on top of bitcoin. But I would then be concerned these resulting solutions would not be decentralized or open source. 
I'll take the risk. I'm a decentralization maximalist.

You are highlighting exactly what's wrong with Krugman's assessments. The features that he believes are bad about bitcoin as a currency will not diminish the massive incentives folks will have to embrace it as a currency. This is the first time in the past 100 years where folks will have the choice which currency they want to transact with and store value in. A currency that reduces their costs will be a very strong draw.
What do you think will happen? Government will listen to Krugman's assessments and make it illegal for folks to hold their wealth in and transact in bitcoin because it has the potential to cause deflationary spirals?
His acumen may be useful to central bankers and policy makers, and perhaps that sort of smarts helped us recover from the most recent housing implosion, but he has to realize this isn't about central bankers and policy makers. Its about the choices consumers will make. And who will choose the fiat/credit card stack if it costs x% more to transact in and store value in? 
He should evaluate all possible macroeconomic pros and cons. Even Larry Summer is humble/smart enough to realize there may be significant benefits. 
Larry Summers in Feb 2014: “I think Bitcoin has the potential to be a very, very important development. I think that we are seeing many, many sectors of our economy be transformed by information technology and certainly it seems bizarre that at this late date, one has to pay as much as one does to use a debit card or to get cash from an ATM or to transfer money to one’s child living abroad. So it seems to me that there’s going to be a concerted effort to reduce financial frictions and that effort’s going to be multi-faceted and certainly Bitcoin is an innovative approach in that regard."

The primary counter argument, that investors will learn that appcoins aren't a good investment and therefore won't want to hold them, is not a very good one. Just as the pool of bitcoin holders has grown and grown and grown, so has the pool of investors in appcoins. There is no indication that trend will discontinue. As new people get into bitcoin many fresh faces want big returns that can't be had with bitcoin. 
So, that point he describes (Daniel or Pierre) when people learn not to invest in and hold appcoins is wayyyy in the future anyway. In the meantime, because of the constant stream of fresh-faced investors, appcoin developers will be given the leeway to develop coins and apps that are, like Storjcoin for instance, differentiated from bitcoin doing things bitcoin can't do.
There is no reason to believe that bitcoin will be able to do everything. Bitcoin is not the analog as TCP/IP. It's more than a protocol - it's also an application. And I understand the vision of having one blockchain. But human nature, profit incentives and the reality of differentiated coins/apps are just too great to allow that vision to be realized - my opinion.

Ha. Bubble? Same argument anti-bitcoin people make. And it falls flat in the same way. All forms of money retain their value because those who buy and hold them believe in them as money. So, if appcoins are bubbled up as you say, so is bitcoin. In both cases folks are holding them because of their value in performing a technical task.
While you and Pierre successfully refuted the gift card/miles analogy you did nothing to disprove the initial statement. Truth is that appcoins will likely provide functions (proposed storjcoin case in point) that bitcoin can't do and never will do. 
In any case, the "bitcoin is the only blockchain" mindset is a bit strange if you ask me. Don't you think that market confidence in storjcoin/maidsafe is the same phenomenon as market confidence in bitcoin? How is it fundamentally different?

That's exactly where he goes wrong. Yes, currently payments and currency are separate and can be analyzed that way but bitcoin is not just a currency. Both come bundled together. And the possibility of low-cost, fast payments has massive macroeconomic potential. Bitcoins adoption as a currency assures its adoption as a payment mechanism and vice-versa. You DO have to talk about the entire system and he should know that better than anybody.

Sure. The end result could the same. But the question is what developers would build a new tool on sidechains when they can do so on an altcoin and can be rewarded directly by holding the related currency? I'm sure there are some developers that will do it simply because they think it's the right thing to do, otherwise it will just be those that work for venture backed bitcoin related companies - which means the resulting code will exist to drive the revenue for those companies, rather than being totally self-sufficient.  This isn't a bad thing necessarily, as it would be great to see work to continue on both sides, but we certainly can't count out altcoins because of sidechains...

I was just joking. The price is really hard to predict. But, given it's limited supply, if enough people want to hold onto it and enough people use it for commerce, it could go as high as $1 million or more. Nobody knows but increasing interest and popularity of bitcoin should be an indicator that it will increase significantly as it has in the past.

Yup, no doubt that, when the market is on a downward trend, the appcoins will fall faster than bitcoin. And when the market is on an upward trend they will see faster growth than bitcoin. 
So, to answer the question as to whether or not you should invest in an appcoin, besides asking whether or not the proposed app seems to solve a real world problem, you should also ask whether or not you think bitcoin's volatility will continue to be upward trending in the long term. If the answer to that question is yes, than you have a strong case to invest in appcoins. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:45:37
"co-opted" is a vague term. The number of bitcoins or the rate of creation can't be altered and that is the most important aspect.

Volatility: Yup, it's young. Greater liquidity will obviously lead to greater price stability. 


But it does! It significantly lowers the cost and reduces the time of making payments and moving money around the world. Significantly - even when you factor in converting out of and back into local currencies. This eliminates the volatility risk and as more and more people take advantage of these benefits the liquidity will grow and thus stability will increase. 


First, the reduced fraud and theft risk because of irreversible transactions is an additional benefit bitcoin offers. It is part of the reason it is so expensive to use credit cards. Remember, the cost is not just 3% or 4%. Companies spend much money mitigating chargeback fraud. Second, the technology is much more secure. When you use a credit card you give your account number to the hundreds of merchants you use throughout the year. With bitcoin you will only have to trust one company (the one at which you store your private key) or no companies (if you choose to store the private keys yourself). Third, yup, credit card companies have a monopoly hold on consumer credit. That's why interest on consumer credit is so absurd. This is because they own the "last mile". Bitcoin breaks that wall down so we should fully expect the cost of consumer credit to drop significantly as competition can enter the space. Last, remember, about half the population on earth do not use banks or credit cards because they are too expensive. 
The fiat/credit card stack does not stand a snowball's chance in hell of surviving the next 10-15 years. I'm not trying to be inflammatory. I'm just saying what is incredibly obvious, major major change is coming to finance.

Above all else money incentivizes people to do things. There are exceptions of course, but the majority of people (developers, speculators, tech nerds, etc) will support the path that they believe will give them the best return. 
I'm sure sidechains will be a success but it seems very likely that the altcoin/ appcoin ecosystem will continue to flourish as all sidechain development will be by for-profit/ venture backed entities that create key functionality in their own proprietary systems that ensure a revenue generating business model.

Ok. It says the coin will "Reward contributors and provide return". Also read the other details but couldn't figure out fees would be paid out in the in-app coin. 
Without a significantly useful role in the app it seems the value of the coin is unlikely to increase over time and therefore won't be a very good incentive to developers. 
Contrarian argument? Am I missing something? What will make that in-app coin useful? 
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:12:09
Who knows what will happen. I don't have a lot of confidence that sidechain projects will be the most innovative or dencentralized. It seems likely development on sidechains will be led by venture backed for-profits who, of course, will develop them in such as way they can generate revenues from (ie not decentralized).

Because the knowledge that people use to live their lives and drive their behaviors is imperfect - knowledge that is often 1) the product cognitive dissonance that prevents rational thought 2) has incentives misaligned with truth and 3) has gatekeepers determining what is "true" or "not true".
Wikipedia gives a good sense of the collective wisdom on a wide subject but does not do so well with specific bits of information.
For example: You go to a doctor for a digestive issue with X and Y symptoms. They prescribe you a medicine called Z. Yet there are an abundance of peer-reviewed studies that indicate a diet with X and Y vegetables can solve the digestive issue without any side effects. That information is locked away from the individual that is suffering because 1) The lens through which doctors are addressing problems is "that which can be solved by patented drugs" 2) the doctors are financially incentivized to prescribe those drugs, 3) doctors are the gatekeepers of health information. 
You can glean this important knowledge, that a dietary change can fix your problems, from wikipedia or by searching through peer-reviewed studies, but it's not easy at all. 
A prediction market in which individuals are incentivized to create morsels of knowledge that others will vote as true and are disincentivized to create morsels of knowledge that others will vote as false, would be an extremely important development, in my opinion. 
Bitcoin gives a single point of truth for money. Human knowledge needs the same: a single point of truth.

There are many economic factors that Krugman fails to consider and instead focus on the theory of deflationary spirals to make a point that bitcoin is bad.
What happens when you reduce the cost of payments from 2%-3% to near 1% or less for every transaction on earth? What happens when you reduce the cost of remittances from 5%-25% to near 1% on the hundreds of billions that are moved? What happens when payments happen in less than 10 minutes rather than 3 days? 
These potential benefits are astounding and a smart economist would evaluate these positives vs. the negatives he sees. 
He is an entertainer. And the Keynesian theater within which he performs is burning to the ground. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:26:39
It seems to me that the only development that will happen in sidechains is by those developers paid by venture capital/ for-profit entities. As such it is likely that sidechains will be developed in such a way that parses important functions into proprietary systems so these entities can generate revenue. 
For example - if developers paid by blockstream are developing a sidechain it's unlikely that sidechain will be useful on it's own. Rather it will need blockstream's technology to be useful. Otherwise why would blockstream pay for it to be developed?
This is not bad, necessarily, but it codifies the bitcoin ecosystem into the old model of software development - not truly open source. 
I don't believe it will do anything to attract development talent (nor investment dollars) away from creating altcoins/ appcoins. And, in terms of pure open-source innovation, it seems altcoins/ appcoins will still lead the charge.

Not sure I agree. I'm not so keen on mastercoin just yet....
But if you look at bitshares: you are essentially supporting their ability to bring together disparate developers to collaborate on projects. I realize collaboration is already happening but there are 200+ coins out there.... many of them scams, of course, but the moral of the story there are a lot of developers working separately on projects. 
Appcoins, as you call them, offer the ability to bring multiple projects together and facilitate collaboration/ learnings/ ideas/ etc.

Well, I disagree with that nuance as well. In fact, it stands to reason, and has been true with altcoins, that appcoins will outperform bitcoin. The smaller the market cap, the more sensitive price is to economic activity. If the bitcoin price goes $2k (500%) it only takes a small proportion of the volume from that activity to send the price of appcoins on a much greater trajectory. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:11:27
Nonsense article. And where it goes wrong: market cap is not going to be the primary driver of which coin a consumer chooses.... volatility (lack thereof) will be. The question to ask; is it possible that an app can generate so much activity for its associated coin that that the coin's price might stabilize.  For something like maidsafe, storj or swarm, if they garner a large user base, its very possible that the price will stabilize. 
In fact,  bitcoin itself is an appcoin - for a payment mechanism - and its survival is similarly dependent on usage leading to low volatility.

Ok doctor.
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:58:25
Ok. Well, let's take storj as an example. They have created an altcoin, storjcoin, because they need to store some things in the blockchain that bitcoin could not support - and perhaps as a tool to raise money for development. 
The developers benefit by 1) having money and 2) having stakeholders interested in testing their platform. 
The folks who bought storjcoin believe they will benefit by the rising price of storjcoin and are compelled to test and evangelize for storj as releases are issued. I'm not saying they will see a return on their investment - perhaps they are noobs as you say - but I'm just indicating why I believe this particular altcoin exists. 
My question: if this phenomenon is removed from the equation with sidechains, what is the incentive for developer (such as those that are building storj) to build a product on sidechains as opposed to creating their own separate coin?
It seems to me the basic function that an altcoin provides (a fundraising mechanism) is a major major one. And it seems sidechains would thus force development into for-profit companies that can find other ways to monetize.
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:27:07
This will go nowhere. The issue is: bitcoin is extremely disruptive to the existing power structures and there is no way it can be rendered not to be. Money can be sent from one person/company to any another person/company anywhere in the world with bitcoin. Nothing will change that.

The cold hard reality is that money can now be sent from any one person to any other person (this includes bad people, very bad people). This is a cold hard reality that can't be regulated out of existence so regulators are never going to be happy no matter what the community does to appease them.
So, we just need to continue building a healthy bitcoin economy of legitimate individuals and businesses and hope law enforcement/ government come up with other ways to control the threats to our society.

Offering to sell ether that doesn’t yet exist to mislead purchasers can only be considered irresponsible at this point. Buyer beware.
We request that peercover.com cease to offer ether forwards, until there is more information released on the Ethereum project, the potential value of the ether cryptofuel, and until lawyers in various countries clarify what the securities and regulatory issues might be in selling ether to the public in various countries.

The difference: competing internet protocols didn't have a tornado of incentives built into them to encourage their usage. Therefore the one protocol that made the most sense for the machines (TCP/IP) persisted over time. Competing digital currencies do have a tornado of incentives encouraging their usage and development. IMHO the only likely scenario is that an ecosystem of blockchains (not just bitcoin itself) will emerge as the analog of the internet that will persist into the future.

These companies spend marketing dollars to educate and handhold the noobs. The potential profit of any bitcoin related business is proportional to the amount they can spend on educating/handholding. 
When a noob is first exposed to bitcoin - security is not the first thing they want to hear. "Here's this great new fangled thing but in order to use it you have to load software on your computer that you never plug into the internet"
I'm afraid that, for the expansion of bitcoin, centralized exchanges are the only on-ramp that can educate, handhold and sign-up the common man in a big way.

But if bitcoin takes over the point-of-sale it will open consumer credit markets to significant competition - which mastercard won't like of course. As long as they have control of the point-of-sale they have credit markets cornered.

That's exactly what I was saying. Others had suggested credit card companies shouldn't care about bitcoin because it's not credit. It's not. But by taking over point-of-sale bitcoin will open the retail markets for competition - and yes, as you suggested peer-to-peer could then compete with credit card companies.

"The whole speculative part" is as much necessary for the continued growth of bitcoin as it is for altcoin projects. 
Without the speculative part sidechains will either 1) not see any useful innovations or 2) see innovations that are dependent on a centralized 3rd party.

Except a car engine that runs on water has not been invented and if it was it would be patented so that only one car company could use it. Bitcoin has been invented and it's open source/ open protocol, so any company can take advantage of the technology to provide a better services and products.


Yes, as a starting point - backwaters. But there are 2.5 billion unbanked by the way. And there are many countries that don't manage their inflation/deflation very well. The number of use cases is staggering. 


It's actually quite easy to store, if you use a service like coinbase. 


WTF are you talking about. Do you have any idea how many projects are underway right now? Both open-source and proprietary?


Because it makes more sense that way? That doesn't make any sense. Yes, the ethically motivated will be the pioneers but, when given an easy to use alternative, most people will dump the old guard in a hot second. Most people that use email/internet/facebook will use bitcoin, even if they don't know it.

Actually that's not such a great idea. 
Incentives are an important part of any economy - crypto is no different. Those who see potential innovation and take risks to invest in it, should be rewarded.
If folks are too lazy or stubborn to learn about projects that might have useful applications, why should they be rewarded? 
Projects like Nubits, Storj, Bitshares, Maidsafe, Peertracks might end up being a raging success or might end up in dismal failure. Those who buy-in early should be rewarded if there is success and penalized if there is failure.

Good point on _bc hyptothesis. That said, I do think you have to qualify your last statement with this ending: "if there is not a copy of of that information somewhere else." Unlike matter information can exist in  more than one place and it CAN be the exact same information. So therefore, just because one copy of that information is lost in a blackhole, it doesn't mean the other copies don't still exist somewhere. Perhaps I'm devolving into full-on pedantry. 
But I will take it one step further with a theory I've been toying with - and feel free to rip it apart. I believe that information is never lost and it is inherently eternal. If somebody makes a cake, writes down a recipe, burns that recipe and then dies. Is that information destroyed? What if somebody gets lucky and makes the exact same cake again? Did they recreate that information or did that information always exist and was just re-expressed when the 2nd cake came into existence? I believe the latter.
By the same token - if earth were destroyed and evolution had to start all over and eventually yielded an organism - say a person perfectly identical to Miley Cyrus - would the information (her DNA, environmental influences etc) not have existed in that interim period? Or did that information exist the whole time and just wasn't expressed in physical form? Again, I believe, perhaps stupidly so, the latter. It seems to me information is, in fact, eternal.
So back to the Gold vs bitcoin in the blackhole example. A good argument to my point that information is eternal would be that gold is just an expression of information as well. It's a design for a bunch of particles organized in a certain way to form an element. 
So now, if I'm right about information being eternal, which most people would say I'm not, then what's really important in this discussion is our relationship with the information. And therein lies the beauty of bitcoin - we as human beings have acknowledged that it's INFORMATION that is important for storing and exchanging value, not the expression of that information in a physical element such as gold (or fiat for that matter (no pun intended)).

Good points on VC infrastructure but that is all so new, and when smart startups begin to see the opportunity in building a multi-coin economy (profit on liquidity between coins) I think VC dollars will follow. Also, the competing coins will likely differentiate in some way - store of value vs. transaction. 
Maybe this isn't happening today or tomorrow but it will happen very quickly when it does. 
BTW: finding primes is interesting but it is peercoin that has implemented proof of stake that is innovative and compelling: more secure and less energy intensive.

Which leads me back to the intent for asking my questions - I'm curious if anyone has any good ideas, besides the standard metric prefixes and standard common name.  I'm willing to intentionally adopt some good names as opposed to wait for the natural forces of language development to deliver those names.

If then, the language god's decide that the fancy name some redditor gave to me is no longer the best, than fine.. they rule!

I think you are getting at core arguments between Keynesian and Austrian economics - managed inflationary currencies vs natural deflationary currencies.
I believe we are in a monstrous monstrous bubble of debt and spending that will pop as the threshold for when a consumer is compelled to make a major purchase goes up. People realize they can hold money and it and it will appreciate at a fairly robust rate.
This is actually the case for somebody I know very well. He currently rents but would like to buy a house. But when he factors in all the costs (taxes, utilities, interest on a loan, condo fees) vs the rate the home will appreciate at he comes to the conclusion that he would prefer to keep his down payment money in bitcoin right now. It has appreciated more than 30% since he got into it. He realizes there is risk btc will collapse but feels less scared about that every day as it gets legitimized. 
Fast forward a bit, as bitcoin attracts more and more people, those who don't have an appetite for the current risk factors. Short term I think there will be pandemonium as the debt based economy collapses as that threshold of when people spend their money rises and rises. But long term I think people will be compelled to be thriftier, happier, less debt laden. I think. 
Either way, it's a major major big deal. Shit.

I hear ya. But the bitcoins will have been long backed up to other places in the universe by then. If we are doing peer to peer now we will be doing something much more sophisticated before we let all our shit get flushed down Hawkin's toilet. Interesting on the quantum level. I imagine we'll be able to create gold at that point anyway, which of course would devalue it. But then we'd not likely be so stupid to use such a highly inefficient method of storing and exchanging value. And if we were being sucked into a black hole, and we didn't have our bitcoins/gold backed up, it would be a heck of a lot easier to shoot some btc out into space before we pass the event horizon.

You highlight exactly why altcoins will play a role. Both ASIC miners and bitcoin holders can easily move to another virtual currency where there is money to be made for both. The good news is this will contribute to a diverse ecosystem of virtual currencies - which should be more resilient.

I would think somebody would come up with an ATM - cash in one side - bitcoins through the internet - cash out the other side. Maybe. Just hypothesizing.

Information can't be lost in a blackhole. The medium carrying can -whether brain or digital media.  Information = life. The primary role of artificial consciousness,  as it arises will be to replicate information, just as life has been doing for billions of years. So, don't worry,  while Trump's gold is getting crushed your bitcoin will have long been backed up out past the event horizon.

Your in depth analysis is of great value. But perhaps you can explain your reasoning? Do you think bitcoin will not be a platform for this type of innovation or do you think the innovation will happen through for-profit tech companies?

In my opinion there are two important facts about ppcoin. 
1) To date it has held value - if you compare 6 month charts to any other coin (except bitcoin) it looks strong. This means most people who bought have been rewarded for putting their faith in the coin. Why has it held value? Because of number 2.  
2) ASIC miners can turn away from bitcoin and make ROI on ppcoin. 
Together I think those two facts will (and have been) creating a positive reinforcement loop that makes for a steady growing coin. These other facts (that it is more secure, more environmentally friendly and less subject to high frequency trading) can only further support the future long-term growth of the coin. 
Who knows if ppc would ever take over the top slot, but bitcoin rose fast thanks to a community of miners and people who believe in a better future with crypto-currencies, and have been rewarded monetarily for their faith. If that community turns wholeheartedly to another currency, that altcoin can and will also rise as fast if not faster. 
As one might suspect, I believe in a future with multiple crypto-currencies. I think its necessary for long term financial stability of the world not to have all of our eggs in one basket. 
edit: disclaimer: In addition to bitcoin I own some ppcoin so I benefit by other people taking an interest.

He smartly notes that we will likely live in a world with multiple competing digital currencies: one primary and four or five secondary. I'm curious as to what currencies he envisions "on top" of bitcoin. 
Thus far, correct me if I'm wrong, but there is just mastercoin that has proposed sitting on top of bitcoin... right? 
Others?

Well, if they take on the bitcoin then their central banks can't manage inflation and thus productivity. Indians would hoard their money and the economy would further collapse.

By LIAM DENNING
"Say this for the proposed Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust: Its name attempts the oxymoronic feat of combining celebrity and a crypto-currency with the concept of reliability.
 
Wall Street’s latest idea comes via Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss who have filed paperwork for an IPO for a venture that allows investors to track bitcoin value. Heard on the Street’s Liam Denning offers analysis.
Had the preliminary offering prospectus for the WBT been filed exactly three months earlier than July 1, it might have been dismissed as a prank. But it may actually represent the apotheosis of the exchange-traded fund—and not in a good way.
One parallel: gold-backed ETFs. Like gold, bitcoin is an alternative means of exchange and wealth storage with real constraints on supply. Both assets sit outside the dominant fiat currency system and can't be manipulated by governments.
 
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have filed for an initial public offering for a bitcoin exchange. David Benoit discusses on MoneyBeat.

Winklevii Outline the Downside
SEC Filing
While gold's actual worth is debatable, it does have several things going for it versus bitcoin. It is tangible, for starters. Even if you might struggle to really swap it for canned food and cigarettes when profligate central bankers finally push society over the edge, it at least would look nice on your mantelpiece.
Above all, millennia of history where gold has been used to settle transactions back a widespread perception that it has value. Gold can thus function as a currency in a reasonably similar way to the dollar, where value rests on a belief in America's property rights and military and economic clout.
Gold ETFs, therefore, offer a relatively easy way to hedge against things like inflation. But they also offer an easy way of simply speculating on price momentum in an asset historically bought and held for long periods. That hot-money aspect has come to the fore as outflows of cash from ETFs have accelerated gold's recent selloff.
Indeed, while the push to make virtually everything from high-yield debt to copper tradable via an ETF has empowered investors, it has also exposed them to high costs and potentially illiquid markets.
All of which gets us back to the WBT, offering exposure to a virtual currency backed by advanced software, security protocols and a network of enthusiasts—fine things but as the prospectus says, a "new and rapidly evolving" area. Even bitcoin's creator is only "purported" to be a person or group that goes by the moniker Satoshi Nakamoto.
Virtual currencies shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. Their use could well grow in a world of increasingly electronic and global transactions. But they are a very recent phenomenon. And given the regulatory, technological and even philosophical questions hanging over them—not to mention bitcoin's whipsawing exchange rate—they represent a "frontier" investment to say the least.
In a purely functional sense, creating an ETF for something like bitcoin, which isn't easy to gain exposure to, seems natural. But for retail buyers, taking on a bitcoin ETF looks closer right now to gambling than to investment or hedging. Somewhere in the rush to ETF-ize everything, we are losing sight of what purpose these funds really serve."
