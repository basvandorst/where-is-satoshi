Good morning. So it is tomorrow and the Bitfinex page is saying withdrawals are cancelled. Does this include withdrawals already confirmed? And what does it mean for getting my 12,000 USD?
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:17:18
Can I get an answer to my question please?? I have also written Support at Bitfinex with no reply.
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:39:07
What is my best move, genius?
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:26:20
Given the scummy way they are treating their loyal customers, I wouldn't be surprised.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:31:31
I'm interested in hearing a full explanation of BFX's logic. Anyway Zane has contacted me and I'm waiting to hear back.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:33:03
How am I "in denial"? Did you even read the post? The money was not in my account during the hack. I have a legally valid defense.
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:43:07
What do I "need to do" after a 4000 haircut from money that was completely unrelated to the incident and wasn't even on my account at the time of the hack?
And if I'd used BTC to transfer out, I'd be even more fucked because then I'd lose the BTC in the hack as well as accept a 36% haircut.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:42:54
Your USD was on its way to you when the site went down? If not, then your situation is not the same as mine.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:36:12
Meaning fiat withdrawals that were correctly received by Bitfinex and confirmed on the Bitfinex website when I checked many hours before the hack. They were in the queue awaiting processing AFAIK.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:03:50
I'll do what is best for me, thanks.
In the meantime, I am waiting for a statement from as spokesman for Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:20:10
Oh wow another anonymous idiot that doesn't read a post before he comments. I said I had written him several times, moron.
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:06:33
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:27:05
The day of the hack, I made a withdrawal of 12,000 USD from my Bitfinex account and it was confirmed before the site was taken down. Can I still expect this withdrawal to be executed?
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:24:21
Whew! I'll take it as a positive sign anyway.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:14:38
Oh no, another 14 year old on mommy's computer. Blocked. Next?
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:34:11
I checked and the missing USD has been replaced by their bullshit BFX "credits".
EDIT: if you're implying that the money was actually in my account, that is false. Regardless of what they call Processing, the money was not on my balance or in any way available to the user. Therefore it was not in the account.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:00:05
Boggles the mind why idiots with absolutely nothing to do with a subject feel entitled to shoot their mouth off with stupid, useless non-witty comments while thousands of miles away and feel cool about it.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:09:50
Not necessary to hear all you really smart anonymous peeps that have nothing to lose by spouting your wisdom. I'm addressing @_date: 2016-08-09 13:00:51
Better than doing nothing. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:53:32
I'll feel better at least.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:38:56
Many thanks. Do I just PM you tomorrow with my user info?
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:22:22
Is your name Zane Tackett?
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:22:44
Thanks for your support.
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:51:42
Suggesting we do nothing. You're not helping anyone dude. 
Anyway this post is about waiting for a statement from Bitfinex, not lots of really smart, anonymous commenters...
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:38:56
I appreciate this. I am assuming they are not affected since they have nothing to do with the hack.
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:18:28
Guys, with stories like this coming out by the day, and Finex become more and more strange, changing their story by the day, I am getting antsy. 
Do you want to come out of hiding and comment, @_date: 2016-08-09 14:42:15
Yer so funny dude.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:43:40
And you know all this how, exactly? 
Did you even read the post? I am waiting for a statement from Bitfinex. Unless you work for them there is no reason whatsoever for you to be speaking for them.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:31:15
I appreciate that.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:08:10
Once again, amazed at the reception here from you little kids. All you have are tough-talking one liners and schadenfreude.
Really sad if this is what the community looks like.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:25:01
Huh? Not only did no one ask for your comments but you don't even make sense. Go away.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:32:43
Love the solidarity among bitcoiners. You are blocked too, you sad, bored 14 year old piece of shit.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:47:06
Hi again how about that announcement??
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:10:10
I appreciate what seems like (?) a constructive comment finally. Yes I am contemplating class action, if that's what you're referring to.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:03:07
The lack of resistance is really sad, I know.
The sheer breakdown of any logic on the part of BFX is what's killing me. They just so obviously look like a company scared shitless tryig to steal any money they can to finance their own errors.
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:16:08
This is starting to look extremely shady. You have promised and failed to meet 3 deadlines. 
If you're actually planning to try to defend yourselves in a courtroom, this kind of business behavior will not look good.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:06:40
Not very much applies to you here, so go away. 
I'm amazed at how tough you people talk from your little cubbies while anonymous a thousand miles away. 
I would have thought you'd all be a bit more forward thinking than this. Pathetic.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:47:23
Loving the warmth here among bitcoiners. We are truly doomed then. You are blocked asshole.
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:44:35
Is that supposed to scare us off, and let us accept what is blatant theft? No way man. Either they reinstate my 12K or they get mired in legal bills. Which they have no money to pay for...
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:56:44
Read the post. The money was not on the account. It is not applicable to the haircut according to BFX's own logic.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:02:40
i was waiting for an already-approved USD withdrawal when the site went down. Therefore it was not on my account at the time of the hack. Is this covered in the 36% haircut too?
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:30:47
Just go away, idiot. You're just bringing up unrelated shit to deal with some personal problems you have. 
I have addressed not you, so fuck off. Oh and you're blocked.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:20:28
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:33:49
And let me add that these stories will be compiled and used against Bitfinex in court. Better make a statement soon guys...
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:52:24
So give in to threats of losing more? Dude stay inside and lock the door.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:19:11
(Gives you finger). Who care's what you think?
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:24:09
It is unprecedented cowardice and failure to accept responsibility. 
Also, it doesn't even follow Bitfinex's own logic, since the money was fully deducted from the account and unavailable to me at the time Finex went down.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:30:50
Well fight back instead of hitting the bong and making fun of others.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:15:27
I love the BFX shills here. Can you guys stop speaking for them please? I am addressing them, not you.
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:34:55
Actually if that's true, Bitcoin may be seriously damaged due to Mark's Mt. Gox fiasco as well as his fraud sentencing in France in 2010 (where he was sentenced to a year in jail).
@_date: 2014-11-04 11:47:22
Gee, what a sad, lonely and stupid piece of shit you are.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:55:06
And there is a lovely MOOOOOOOOON out tonight!!!
@_date: 2014-10-14 11:57:02
Can you please support buy/sell for LTC? My business depends on it! Thanks for your great work.
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:58:28
This rumor has been debunked:
