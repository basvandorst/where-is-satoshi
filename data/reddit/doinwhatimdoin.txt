You are a complete fool. Good day!
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:54:25
So? What's your point?
@_date: 2019-12-03 18:23:52
You are a fool to presume you know what will and will not happen! You absolute idiot!
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:22:33
You are a fool. You presume to know the limits of Bitcoin.

As per the world economic forum, 5th generation wireless technology, distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence will be integral to the 4th industrial revolution.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:43:33
Yes. The price I assume will go to 50K in 2020, and then 340K in 2021. Sounds fantastical, but so was 1 BTC going from 700 USD in 2016 to 19K in 2017.

If the cost to produce something doubles, is the cost not passed on to the customer?
If the cost of producing 1 BTC doubles, is it not fair to say the value of that 1 BTC has doubled, and so the price of that 1 BTC is also doubled?
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:42:25
True. Look at China, look at Japan, look at Europe.
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:34:55
Yes, it is interesting.

Nothing is superior to BTC for what it does.
@_date: 2019-12-03 20:03:54
Every time a block is validated, the person who contributed the necessary computational power is given a block reward in the form of new-minted BTC and transaction fees.
Transaction fees are issued to miners as an incentive to continue validating the network. By the time 21 million BTC has been minted, transaction volume on the network will have increased significantly and miners' profitability will remain roughly the same.
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:41:32
Well done!

Fun fact 
The same amount of BTC will be mined in the 4 year period from 2020 to 2024 as the 116 years from 2024 to 2140!

Found it: Satoshi’s decision to use 21 million as the finite number of Bitcoin may be based on the global M1 money supply which stands at approximately $21 trillion. This is the global money supply that includes physical currency and coins. Every dollar can be divided into 100 cents, making the total number of pieces of money to exist at around 2,100 trillion. Similar to the cents for a dollar, a Satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. There are 100 million Satoshis in each Bitcoin, which means there will only ever be 2,100 trillion, the same number as the global M1 supply. Based on this, Bitcoin is well suited to replace all fiat currencies and has the ability to act as a global currency.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:25:57
1 BTC is likely to be between 100K USD and 1 million USD by the end of 2021.
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:35:35
You are a joke, you know nothing of BTC.
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:06:50
You don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:11:07
Utter bullshit.
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:41:59
The supply is always going down. Satoshi built a deflationary currency. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). Inflation reduces the value of currency over time, but deflation increases it. This allows more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:46:54


Stupid comment. Just idiotic in so many way. For one thing, Bitcoin now has satellites so an internet outage will not matter. Not gonna explain all the other ways your statement is foolish.

BTC's stock to flow ratio, is why.
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:53:59
Miners will still be rewarded, you know nothing of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:22:27
Not fully right. The cost to mine 1 BTC increases over time.
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:46:53
Fucking no
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:30:54
I like your thinking! Once banks and financial institutions begin backing their investments with Bitcoin, as a way to prevent the masses from doing banks runs and pulling all their investments, that is how I imagine trillions flow into Bitcoin and the DLT industry as a whole.
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:56:35
What a stupid comment, you do not understand economics, history or technology.
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:27:26

John McAfee says the price of 1 BTC will be 1 million USD by the end of 2020.
He has based this price on what the last BTC will cost to mine, and then mathematically working backwards to 2020, and that is how he has arrived at this 1 million USD per BTC valuation.
He seems very confident about his mathematics.
What do you think?
@_date: 2019-12-02 13:03:20
I have a question:
John McAfee says the price of 1 BTC will be 1 million USD by the end of 2020.
He has based this price on what the last BTC will cost to mine, and then mathematically working backwards to 2020, and that is how he has arrived at this 1 million USD per BTC valuation.
He seems very confident about his mathematics.
What do you think?
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:56:01
They can't.
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:37:38
I know what I'd pick, I'd pick the BTC, because 1 BTC will be worth 500K USD.
@_date: 2019-12-06 12:52:41
The fuck are you on about?
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:30:42
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:35:58
So what's your point?
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:59:30
Mining will always be profitable and needed. Eventually, the reward will decrease to zero, and the limit of 21 million bitcoins will be reached c. 2140; the record keeping will then be rewarded solely by transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:26:22
Read Max Keiser on Bitcoin.
He knows his stuff.
The current economical system is running out of steam.
Fiat currency has run its course.
A currency reset is likely, with a digital infrastructure such as Bitcoin as the base layer.
I can imagine banks and financial institutions moving their assets to be backed by Bitcoin.
The first institution to do this actually wins.
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:52:19
Thank you for your answer, and for treating me with respect.
"second and third layer technologies will continually get easier for the layperson in the same way that everything about the internet has gotten easier for the layperson"
I agree totally, and what I pasted above from your answer, to me, is the crux of it!
Thanks again.

Excellent reply, thanks!
@_date: 2019-12-02 12:27:39
Can I assume that every 4 years the cost to mine 1 BTC doubles? If the reward halves?
That is to say, every 4 years for miners to remain profitable they need to double the price at which they sell 1 BTC?

No. More that big price jumps will occur, that is what he is saying. He is a mathematician. I can't say now if he is right, but he seems adamant on the mathematics behind his prediction.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:45:17
@_date: 2019-12-02 12:43:23
John McAfee does seem adamant on the 1 million USD price for 1 BTC by the end of 2020.
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:45:15
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:23:08
Not really. It was far more risky to buy BTC in 2016 than it is now, and it was way harder, much less people knew about it and there was no institutional involvement.
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:43:24
Max was touting Bitcoin when 1 BTC cost 1 USD.

Go to Plan B's twitter page.
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:44:23
Can you explain this in more detail?
The cost to mining the last bitcoin will take 40 years and depends on the electricity it takes.

no wonder america is the mess that it is

The on ramps are too complicated, John McAfee talks about this, once it becomes easier for the average person to get involved, they will. John says 2020 is the year it will all come to pass. The infrastructure is being built.

But the cost increases as the rewards decrease.
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:38:13
I dunno man, Satoshi built a deflationary currency.
Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). Inflation reduces the value of currency over time, but deflation increases it. This allows more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency.
@_date: 2019-12-06 12:48:17
It does, you intellectual lightweight.
Something that is useful and scarce is valuable.
@_date: 2019-12-02 13:48:09
True, hyperinflation looks likely right now.
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:12:04
It implies that the value of BTC continues to rise to compensate miners.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:04:54
**2019 – 3.4K**
**2020 – 80K**
@_date: 2019-12-03 20:36:42
85 % ish
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:35:01
4 million BTC are lost and irretrievable.
That leaves 17 million total supply of BTC, at most.
This makes BTC even more scarce, and therefore, more valuable.
As each halving occurs, and the corresponding price increase occurs, BTC will be seen for what it is.
@_date: 2019-12-08 12:40:59
BTC is a hedge against the banking system!

So if it is 6,000 USD to mine 1 BTC in Dec 2019, the cost of mining 1 BTC will be 12,000 USD in Dec 2020?

Bitcoin is superior to fiat currency and gold.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:29:06
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:00:13
Nope, wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:16:16
Do not presume to know the limits of Bitcoin, you will end up looking like an utter fool.
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:43:53
Correct, once the halving occurs in 5 months the price will rally and will last until Jan 2022, when it peaks.
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:32:04
I imagine if the cost to mine a BTC goes up, miners will still mine it, and will want a higher price for 1 BTC. Once central banks being mining BTC and banks and financial institutions start backing their money with BTC, the profitability to mine BTC will increase.
@_date: 2019-12-02 13:48:31
Is there though? Is it not a miner driven industry?
