My prediction: BTC will continue to do pretty badly in 2018 *because you refused to fork and the people behind the technology are abandoning it*. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:51:37


Alright, think about it logically then: If you can't fork Bitcoin Core, how are you going to keep difficulty down? Now that China is [cracking down on cryptocurrency]( particularly on [mining]( this isn't good for Bitcoin. 


Currently, [**China controls 70% of the mining hashrate.**]( What do you think happens when 70% of your miners just disappear overnight, and production on them pretty much stops? And no, they're not going to go rogue and run illegal mining ops. You don't go against the Chinese government. They **do not** fuck around with disobedience and do not mind resorting to violence if you disobey the people's party. So yes, 70%+ of your mining hashrate will just vaporize over the next few months, which will mean the backlog of transactions will increase, which will mean the transaction fee will skyrocket. And that means more people leaving, and not as many people buying after they're scared of what is happening to the market. There will be no more new miners, since nobody will be making them anymore. 
Don't be stupid. Use your imagination where things are going in 2018. Especially when you consider the Chinese government has a good amount of control over Bitcoin Cash.

I dump it to a plain text file, line delimited. It isn't hard to select the password field and dump it out of the database. Then I don't have to have the overhead of sqlite3. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:24


Yes, it can pop arbitrary addresses. It attempts to generate hash collisions of the keys. If it does this, it effectively duplicates a key without creating an exact copy. Creating SHA-256 collisions is extremely hard, [but weaknesses in bitcoins SHA-256d have been found.]( Simply switching to SHA-3 would at least remove that attack vector - particularly if computing capability for these algorithms increases over the next 5 years. If it exists and has proven it's capable of happening with the trophies they've already claimed, why let it continue to exist?  
Running brainflayer against a bunch of wallets isn't the same as creating hash collisions. SHA-3 makes it significantly harder to create these collisions. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:10


And attitudes like this are why every fork has failed so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:06:21
Small blocks relies on fast processing on a proof of work system with ASIC miners. Throwing more ASIC miners at the problem doesn't fix it. Rather, it creates a wall and pushes that wall towards you faster, and the closer it gets the taller the wall gets. You need to increase the block size slightly and switch to a staking method so nodes earn Bitcoin instead of operating "for the good of the people." Nobody has the time and resources to give a fuck about working for free, especially if it takes a significant investment to operate a node. If proof-of-stake is too scary, then you need to fork to a PoW mechanism that can't get owned by ASICs in order to sustain growth.  


[Considering you said this 2 days ago,]( and now they've added the BCH-USD pair on GDAX, you might want to listen and consider what I have to say: You can't underestimate the power of influence that GDAX adding BCH will have over BTC. **Keep an eye on it and don't become a bag holder.** Now that they've added a BTC fork, you *know* what's coming next. Exchanges are going to flip to one fork or another, and away from core. Since BTC has proven uncapable of forking core, it isn't looking good. The last thing an exchange wants is a bunch of useless crypto currency held up in some vault. If they announce drop of support for BTC in 2018, don't be surprised. We have some historic record of this happening before: The Ethereum Classic and ETH fork post DAO-hack. They added one fork and dropped the old a while later. If you bag hold BTC you will thoroughly regret it. At least move some of it to other coins to diversify. The last thing I want to see is a bunch of BTC holders get utterly destroyed.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:19:53
The miners and major exchanges did not switch to these forks. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:13:45
It's your last chance to flip your BTC to alts before they create the BCH pairs...  
- Flip your BTC to alts to preserve wealth until the dust settles with the fork. 
- HODL the BCH and ride the hype out to the ATH.    
- Flip your alts to the surviving bitcoin fork in 2 months (whether that is core or BCH is anybody's guess).  
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:35


Yeah, for those in the know it didn't seem that impossible:
They've been readying this for a while.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:35:55
More like good luck to you. An exchange adopts one fork and the Bitcoin community implodes, it's just proving my point the coin is fucked. Core can't fork because nobody is maintaining it anymore, so it was only a matter of time before you see the bigger exchanges start laying the groundwork of giving up on core.  
Reality is a BCH isn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:23
For the immediate future: Switch to PoS to maintain feasibility long term, increase block sizes to clear the growing backlog of TXs and speed up the TX rate, add BN-128 &amp; SHA-3 support so we don't get owned by a quantum computer or the [LBC.]( The fact something like the LBC is even possible should be alarming. It's a fact that it's only a matter of time until the LBC pops a huge wallet. I bet it would have everyone's attention then. They've already popped a couple wallets with .5+ BTC.

They already allow this. Whatever BTC you held in GDAX is now available in your BCH wallet. Don't be stupid. You know what this means: they're looking to drop BTC from GDAX.

BCH and Bitcoin Gold have not been widely adopted. Also that is two forks. Not one, unified one that all of Bitcoin rallies behind. That's what is needed at this point or else it's another Segwit all over again.

Dialogue like that doesn't help your cause. If anything, it shows you're worried a post on Reddit can tank your currency. If that's the case, then why the hell would you put your money in it? Plenty of people can spread FUD about any other currency. You don't see the Monero guys losing their shit and brigading when one guy says something negative about their currency being associated with hacker botnets.  
The top voted post on this subreddit right now is a conspiracy-tier post about how Bitcoin is being 'attacked.' Ya'll need to take a step back and look at what you sound like.  
Listen to yourselves:  
[We are under attack, beware](  
["If you don't think Bitcoin is going to be attacked, you've misunderstood what this is about."](   
["Most of the comments are about high transaction fees"](   
["Coordinated bitcoin dump + network attack with high fees + coinbase adding Bcash..."](

I've been around Bitcoin a long time. It's not doing well and I can't continue to look at core positively. The people who were important to it's vision have abandoned it. The core team is completely apathetic to the wants and needs of the businesses that want to build on their platform, and interest in Bitcoin as a technology has died off. The only interest Bitcoin has going for it is it's high price. Once that drops, it won't recover. **Bitcoin is too slow, too old (tech wise), too expensive, and too resource intense.** Look at what is happening with the futures, a majority of the market is anticipating a massive drop in price. And what I'm saying, is it won't recover. There is just no value to Bitcoin core once you remove it's over inflated price. Do you really think that Bitcoin is worth more than 44% of the entire world's oil supply? Because that is what people are speculating it's worth right now - more than OPEC. Bitcoin is just a currency, and there are other currencies and BTC forks like BCH and Gold that do what Bitcoin core does - but more efficiently, faster, and with a degree of anonymity and security BTC core doesn't come close to yet.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:17:41

I do this for a living. In my career I've found dozens of major vulnerabilities. Some of the more recent ones I found were a few major vulns that would have a major telco's credit card data leak all over the internet for every single one of their prepaid users, and some of their postpaid (subscriber) users. Right now I work at a blockchain startup whose specific goal is completely mitigating these attacks. It's a growing threat as more and more data is leaked. I can't wait for the data on the 1,500,000,000 yahoo accounts to drop any day now.  
Like with bitcoin mining, there are entire mining pools dedicated just to cracking leaked password hashes. It's a collaborative effort whose data is public so long as you contribute. At this time, websites across the internet are hemorrhaging hashed and plain text passwords to the tune of millions per month. It's pretty ridiculous that some tiny mom N pop website gets owned, causing some of the biggest enterprises to get hacked as a result because someone in their company of thousands of employees reused a password that was on that mom N pop site.  
This problem also impacts bitcoin directly: If you're not aware, there is something called the "Large Bitcoin Collider" whose sole purpose is to crack bitcoin wallets by generating a hash collision. It works just like a mining pool: the wallet loot is distributed across everyone attempting to create hash collisions. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:38:24
This is why I'm talking about BTC core specifically. I had to edit the original post. Development has kind of died off on core due to the inconsistency of people willing to adapt forks. Hopefully that attitude will change fast enough that BTC core will be allowed to fork before the end of next year. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:52


You don't seem to understand how the market works. You can't sell right now *because nobody is buying right now*. It's not worth 3x the price, and nobody is willing to buy it at that. BCH is really worth  like it is on coinmarketcap. A few people traded BCH between themselves to set the price arbitrarily high in hopes of getting it to trade more than it's worth. So they can reinvest it back into BCH when the price corrects to it's actual value.  


If I had a way to bet against this I would. I'll check back with you on Friday.

If you think that BTC-Core's PoW in it's current form is sustainable, you'd be mistaken. They can keep PoW, but they'd need to switch to an ASIC-resistant PoW system or they'll hit the same problem as before. Requiring pools of peta-hash/s of computing power just to calculate a block is beyond ridiculous and is approaching insanity tier now.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:27:37
Racing bitcoin expansion vs computing power expansion of Moore's law isn't a good idea. The growth of Bitcoin already outpaced Moore's law. A better system is needed. I'm giving up on core now that GDAX added BCH. It's only a matter of time before major exchanges drop core now, and the last thing I'm going to do is bag hold BTC.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:24:11
It seems nobody wants to fork core. Core will die if it isn't forked, and development has pretty much tapered off since the beginning of the year. It can only last about two years at most like this.

I'm up to 15 of OPs. He mentioned it was a stupid password. His old passwords pretty much fit that bill and took only a couple seconds to crack the hashes against the plaintext section of the database. 
This data is all posted publicly somewhere. I just grab any dumps I find on pastebin/darknet/IRC/torrents and aggregate it to a sqlite database. Do this for a few months and you'll hit over 1 billion leaked identities. It makes for an extremely powerful brute forcing tool. I am pretty confident I can loan this database to recover his pwd

It isn't rich supporters. This community censors the fuck out of information. Everyone else in every other bitcoin and crypto community is happy. This is why Coinbase doesn't give a fuck about all the people moving their BTC out of their exchange. The moment a BCH/LTC and BCH/ETH pair comes up once the dust settles, you can consider core dead.  
Unfortunately I was too late to warn anyone. I felt it was coming and an hour after I made this thread BCH was announced on GDAX. If core can't fork itself it will become the Ethereum classic of Bitcoin. There's only one way you can save BTC-Core now, and that is increasing the block size. And there isn't a single developer left that would advocate for that in core. There's a reason satoshi himself tried to increase it. It was one of his last posts. 
If you want your wealth to survive this ordeal I'd move it out of BTC and into alts until the dust settles, and HODL the BCH you have. All the posts on the front page of this subreddit are just proving the point I'm trying to make... 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:43:17
I started in a different era. I taught myself C back in the day when RAM was measured in megabytes. It was a dominant language for a long time until the performance of higher level languages caught up. Now I'd probably learn from GoLang or Python. I almost exclusively program in Python now as a security pro, because it's such an invaluable and versatile tool. It's not well known, but under the hood of the most widely used Python interpreter is a C compiler. If you static type your code, you can actually compile it like you would with a C based language and it will run just as fast as pure C. You can even compile it to JVM or EVM bytecode. Python is also a very easy to understand language.    
If it's too high level for you, definitely check out GoLang. It's everything I wished I had in C when I was growing up and learning.

Tokenizing bitcoin is NOT the same as forking the main blockchain. That's like considering whipping up any ol genesis file and considering it a real blockchain without any kind of proofs or clear direction behind it. I guess it's not a real blockchain until you have a meme-tier bootstrap.js website and an ICO. What makes a blockchain real in proof-of-work chains like bitcoin is miner adoption.

That's my point. This isn't happening *because nobody is doing it*. Yes you have BCH and Bitcoin Gold, but the rest of the community are idiot hardliners who see forking as a bad thing. Those forks will die off eventually unless all (or a majority) of bitcoin rallies behind one of them. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:52:41
Yeah, that is why I try to format the data manually or semi manually into a standard format. It will do it pretty quick on my laptop even. If you write inefficient python code I can see how it would be slow but it doesn't take more than a minute to parse even a file that is 1-2 gb. You use an imap process pool. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:53:39
This is exactly why Bitcoin should switch to PoS eventually. It gives nodes the capability of earning Bitcoin - which incentivizes running a node in the first place. Both you and provided case-in-point arguments for this.  


And this is the main reason I'm questioning why the hell the developers have abandoned bitcoin. I'm not talking about forking to some flavor-of-the-month like BCH or Bitcoin Gold. I'm talking about making a 5 second change to the btc-core and forking that. Implementing this fork would be easy and the block size can be later reduced. Changing a couple of lines to give serious relief to the BTC-Core chain should be a no-brainer. All the downvote brigading won't change the fact that Bitcoin core has lost it's ability to fork completely (at least for now). If you want to be taken seriously as a payment system you have to compete with Visa and Mastercard, and a nearly $30-per-transaction fee has been met with disaster for Bitcoin. Almost all commercial projects in BTC have been abandoned over this last year, IN SPITE OF the huge surge in cap and price.    


People need to stop bothering with that fork. It was abandoned completely. It's adapt-or-die time for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:23:40
I mentioned it in another comment. Basically I gather ALL leaked data I can find. Pastebins, public dumps, darknet forums, private pastes on IRC. I aggregate them to a database so I can use it for penetration testing, or stuff like this. Reused passwords are extremely common. I don't want to publicly post the likely passwords that OP has but I will work with him to identify which are his actual old passwords and not one that turned up on a similar firstname / last name search or maybe a leaked account with a duplicate username. This way I can help OP if in the off chance he reused an older password or some combination of one. I've got 32 cores, 96 gb ram and 12 GPUs dedicated to cracking this right now ;). Right now I'm working on generating the wordlist. It is looking like it will approach 20 tb at the moment... 
It doesn't take long to hit over a billion records (you could do it after a year). I'm currently at a bit over 4 billion gathered over 3 years. Many of these are hashed passwords, but they've already been cracked.  
**If you want an example, PM me your email address** and I'll pull up all the websites that have leaked your data and send you the record of what was leaked.

Not all the data is accurate due to the way I have to search. I'd have to confirm certain information first before I could dig up more accurate information. For example: 
I searched on your username and it appeared in a hack that occurred on crownbingo.com back in February of 2013. I highly doubt you're a 55 year old woman from the UK who signed up for a bingo site almost 5 years ago if you're on So obviously, you share a username with that person. OP's username leaked 2 email addresses that I've been pulling passwords off of. After about the 2nd or 3rd hop down a rabbit hole of daisy chained data it's very unlikely that it would be relevant anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:46:01

8 to 10 char bruteforce with 24 chars is still insanely huge, 659 terabytes of plaintext data. Need to narrow it down further. 8 char with a 24 char set is about 1 TB. I will check that.

We couldn't afford college so I did the next best thing and just taught myself. Eventually I was able to make enough to go to school very briefly (on a grant), but left after I got a tech certification to avoid debt and the waste of time that the comp sci program was. If I were to go back to school I'd go for mathematics. It would help my understanding of the bleeding edge machine learning algorithms coming out.

Why would I use Bitcoin for anything really? 
Alright, let's be a retailer looking at processing payment cards. Why would I switch to Bitcoin instead of Visa when the fees for Bitcoin are sometimes in excess of $10 per transaction? Visa charges &lt; $0.10 for the same service. Obviously I'm not going to pay over 100 times the price just for the ability to process less than 1% of all financial transactions. I'd really cut into my margin, and selling anything less than double the transaction fee would be too risky. 
And Bitcoin itself is worthless as a currency if you live in a country that isn't falling apart with runaway inflation. It's far too volatile to be a currency. For example, one day I could have enough to pay a mortgage, and then the next day the price slides 20% and im now 20% short for the mortgage.  
To be honest, Bitcoin **is** useless. All of their developers gave up. It's only the bag holding or super optimistic ones left.   
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:15:35


Lol. Still in USD. And I'm almost positive they will evaluate at the USD worth of BTC and not the properties evaluation in BTC itself. BTCs evaluation still comes from USD still, and not it's own. You can't buy property with bitcoin. It will get converted to USD or evaluated against it somewhere along the line.  
Also, looks like the correction happened finally :)

BTC won't be like USD until BTC is directly exchangeable in real estate. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:49:22
That's the thing. Bitcoin has more value as a speculative investment than a currency - it's like digital gold. Ethereum on the other hand has value beyond speculation. You're buying processes in a global supercomputer if you're holding ETH.  
I'm happy my BTC is doing awesome, but it's going to crash hard one day - I'm HODLing until I can buy a physical asset, like real estate, with my BTC. And I'm HODLing ETH so I can host a node in Proof of Stake. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:40:32
Just being realistic here: Unfortunately you'll find the cost of developing on top of Bitcoin is 200x the cost of pretty much any other chain. Thanks in part to the outrageous transaction fees. Just to move data around costs around $0.08 per byte right now. At this time Bitcoin cannot be used for much more than speculating a value on a digital currency. Traditional cloud infrastructure is significantly cheaper than Bitcoin. The only ones that beat cloud infrastructure in cost at the moment are altcoins - pretty much any of them.

You're absolutely right. And also the bottom is more like 3k, which is still damn near 3x the price of what it was a year ago. With all the complicated tax laws and the fact you can't buy it on credit anymore, it will obviously not hit $20k again, at least anytime within 2018. You had *idiots* taking mortgages out on their house at the ATH. That's the kind of stupid mentality that drove it through the roof. If you didn't cash out at the top (or near it), you're just too unreasonable.

If a rich person walks into a 7-11 in the hood, but leaves their Lamborghini running in the parking lot with no one in it, would anyone be surprised it gets stolen? This is the same situation as using an weak or publicly available password to protect all of your cryptocurrency.    
Is it wrong to steal it? Yes. Will the victim get any sympathy for lacking basic common sense? No.

[Lexis Nexis and a few other companies were breached a few years back.]( These breaches leaked tens of millions of social security numbers. They're available for purchase on a couple of sites, and the rumor mill has it that Equifax breach data is starting to show up in private IRCs. There's been tons of social security numbers leaked. It's reasonable to assume that if you had any kind of credit history in 2013, your information is for sale.  
If for some reason your targets SSN is not for sale, you can get it by gaining access to their utility accounts, or their insurance provider. These companies are notoriously insecure and also leave your accounts active, and often have password reset capabilities where you don't need access to their email. So you just check for password reuse on every insurance company they've ever used and that usually get you in, and almost always gets you access to some old bill with their SSN on it.  
If you're still confused what I mean by password reuse, PM me your email and I'll see if I can't dig up your old passwords. There were over 1,700 websites that were breached from 2011 and onward, which usernames and passwords posted publicly. These include sites like BTC-E, Bitcoin Talk, Instagram, LinkedIn, DropBox, Yahoo, and so forth. So, if you were incredibly stupid and used the same password you use to login on BTC-E on your coinbase account - congratulations, you lack any kind of common sense, and clearly should not be putting tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of your dollars publicly on the internet for anyone to just walk by and take.

If you're an American and held/sold more than 20k worth of crypto last year, then you need to file a 1099-K and pay income tax on it. The price is based off of what it was when you sold it, and you're required to income tax on that sale. So if you've been actively trading it, you could easily have a box 1a gross of over $4 million - even if you only held around 2-3 BTC. You then deduct the cost basis out of that and pay income tax on the difference. 
That is what is triggering this mass sell off. People just got huge tax bills in the magnitude of tens of thousands of dollars, can't afford the taxes, and are being forced to sell off or liquidate completely to pay the 25~39.6% tax on all of their HODLings. It's especially bad news for Bitcoin because you will get taxed at the ATH price but the asset value is down more than 50%. You a huge amount of tax for an asset worth less than half of what it was at the ATH in December. This will drive Bitcoin's price further down and it will struggle to recover throughout 2018. 
I mentioned I'd keep popping back up every once and a while to mention bag holding Bitcoin is a terrible idea. It's so obviously fucked from a developer standpoint. I actually do develop on blockchain platforms, and like most developers, I abandoned Bitcoin entirely, because the Bitcoin core community is too slow to adopt change and has too much infighting to remain agile enough to adapt to enterprise needs. 
Here's a real cost estimate of transaction fees in implmenting a blockchain project for a company with 120,000 users:
- Ethereum: $0.04 per user per month.  
- Monero: $1.27 per user per month.  
Bitcoin though? Came at a cost of 483 sat/byte. At the time, that was a cost of almost $0.08 per byte. Processing this data on a fucking 1980s 8 bit processor would be cheaper and more efficient (not to mention **way** faster)! Averaging 263 bytes per transaction means the cost per user per month was a whopping $20.32. Just plain dogshit vs Ethereum or Monero or any PoW ledger... There's no way you could pitch "yeah, this blockchain app will cost you north of $2 million a month just in transaction fees and excluding ops cost and and labor, while running at 1/100th the speed of your existing solution" to an enterprise seriously.
Like most developers, I tried to get on with Bitcoin. But it just didn't make sense to try to develop on top of Bitcoin. Other solutions are cheaper, faster, more efficient and more secure:
[Vitalik Buterin himself tried to develop on Bitcoin, and couldn't.]( You can't argue that guy doesn't know what he's doing. If he couldn't do it - nobody can. It's time to let Bitcoin die.

I was digging through your history from another comment. Although we disagree on other points, I have to point out this was the same story with me. I liquidated 200 ETH to buy a property and had to jump through these same hoops. I had to get the funds as a gift, but I had provided 3 years of 1099s, w-2s, 1040s, bank statements, gdax statements, etc. And they still didn't want to do it in the end. They didn't believe an asset could gain 9000% in less than a year. Thankfully I happened to have someone willing to do the amount as a gift and have me wire them the amount from my bank account back to them ��

The last thing I wanted to do in December was end up bag holding a ton of crypto when the bubble inevitably popped. Sure I didn't maximize gains as high as a could but indefinitely came out ahead of today's prices �� 
The best piece of advice I received:
"Never turn down a life changing amount of money". So if selling everything would mean being able to buy the house you want, or another rental property - don't hesitate, and just do it. You can buy back in at any time after that. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:55:10
Not necessarily. A majority of Bitcoins price came from the fact you can buy it on credit. Couple that with all the hype and you had millions of random people buying in, with money they didn't have. Credit cards companies shut down the ability to do that. Then, on the other hand, you had people mortgaging their house to buy more of it (at the ATH no less). Bitcoins price was artificially inflated by loans and credit. Now the ability to do that is gone and a lot of people are cutting their losses. 
You also have people selling off because they got hit with new tax regulation. If you're in the US, you need to file a 1099-K for your trading, and pay income tax on less cost on the sum of all sells of your trades. So if you made $100k trading crypto, you now owe 24~39.6k% of that to the IRS. A lot of people don't have $24k~$30k laying around. Particularly if they bought it on credit in the first place (they have to pay the cards off as well).

If you sold it and bought back in you'd have more than doubled the amount of coin you hold now.

Hell no. It's going to go way farther.

I'm definitely feeling a 3k bottom as well. I'm just glad I liquidated everything in December.

Except if you want to go to production, then that is the real cost of how much data costs on the actual Bitcoin blockchain. The cost will no longer be free.

Oh, that's super easy. Barely any hacking required.  
- Dig on Twitter to find a target with crypto. 
- Search leaked data for their leaked passwords. 
- Grab their name, address, phone number, and alt emails.  
- Find out if they have a coinbase account by attempting to register using their email on the site. If you get a 302 to /dashboard then they don't have an account. If you get a 302 to /login, then they have already registered that email on coinbase. All other exchanges have similar username enumeration vulnerabilities, and none of them are viable for bug bounty programs and therefore won't get patched.  
- Try logging in with their leaked passwords and the email that is registered. This works almost every time, but lately people have stepped up their game - but that's easy to get around too.  
- If they have SMS two factor authentication enabled, call their phone provider and give them the information you dug up off spokeo, and request that they redirect all sms and calls to the new number. You'll need their SSN but that is easily obtainable via purchase through SSN DOB, or by checking password reuse on their utility or insurance company.  
- If they have Google Authenticator there is a way around this too, by tricking coinbase or other exchanges support to remove the Authenticator from the account, by accessing their email and generating a support ticket.  
- Now you can login and gain access to their coinbase account and transfer all of the crypto out of their account, then shapeshift it to XMR.   
- If password reuse doesn't work, we can reset their password by gaining access to their email address. To do this, reset their email address password by intercepting their SMS two factor code using the previously described method. You'll then be able to gain temporary access to their email.  
- Reset their password on coinbase and use your login session inside of their email to click the link and set the new password for their account. 
- Now you can login, drain the account of all of their crypto, shapeshift it to XMR and enjoy your unearned crypto.  
But technically you earned it by spending hours spelunking through the internet to find the one idiot dumb enough to put tens of thousands of dollars on the publicly available on the internet, and barely protecting that information with their shitty password that was publicly posted 2~4 years ago when any number of websites they used got hacked. If anyone is wondering, this is how hackers are stealing your bitcoins.

Lalalala all you want. Have fun getting reamed on taxes for the value of BTC at the all time high while it's now worth not even half of what it was. Ouch. Bitcoin is only going down the shitter from here. It is so completely obvious it failed in dev.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:48:15
They're selling it to pay the $20k+ they now owe the IRS on their 1099-K
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:29:59
He ended up selling at 13k or so... 
People are incredibly stupid in thinking Bitcoin is even useful as a currency. It's only purpose is to be a currency, and yet it is so volatilie it never could be. If it swings in price you could either lose money as the buyer or seller, depending on which way it went - so there is too much risk. I got rid of all my BTC when the transaction fees climbed over $40. At that point it was clear to me it's a failed technology. I don't think Bitcoin will recover. It will never see that all time high again, because the hype and ability for average people to buy it with money they don't have is gone now.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:27:13
Yes: 
There were really people taking out morgages and maxing their credit cards out buying it.
