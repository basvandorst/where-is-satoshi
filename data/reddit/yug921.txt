Why would they stop when stupid people are actually sending the coins?

This song is amazing. 4 really good tracks. New switch of style. Real fire.

I’ll never sell my BTC for less than 2k over market
@_date: 2018-09-07 18:36:56
Why do you need 5$ worth of bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-09-07 21:37:13
Twitter can only do so much. Their software is only so capable. They can flag certain phrases and words but so many posts on Twitter and deleting any post that mentions bitcoin or eth wouldn’t work. And when known scam accounts are deleted new ones are created.

Ahh I see. Yeah I’m not aware of the details. I wonder how many posts and comments reddit gets daily vs twitter. It would be nice if they did something. It’s so annoying. Also if no one sent money to these addresses ever they would eventually stop posting.

That would be hilarious if they agree to a lockin price and shit goes to the moon. Just set up a futures contract with your parents and leverage 10x.

Where is your conviction to buy bitcoin coming from and how strong is it? From my observation in your replies it seems that your conviction is wavering. Perhaps your parents can sense this and don’t believe you have a full grasp into what you are investing in. If you believed in bitcoin’s future strong enough you wouldn’t be posting on Reddit you would be finding a way to buy bitcoin. Convince your parents you are convinced once you are convinced.

Seems pretty inconvenient to store in a wallet

If people wanted cash wouldn’t they have sold their Tethers for cash already. They were obviously using Tether as a store of value and perhaps they keep it in bitcoin as a fine alternative for a store of value. Also wouldn’t the amount of Bitcoin sold from Tether liquidation be equal to the amount of Bitcoin bought making the whole move from Tether to Btc to Cash a wash?

You want to buy low and sell high. Ask yourself “am I buying low?” and “Am I selling high?”. If the answer is not “yes” to one of these questions then don’t do it.  Simples. 
Ps HODLing is fine too

How can you hope for a valuable decentralized currency enter into the market and not be touched by everybody? There is no iteration where big players don’t take part in Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:34:08
I knew when my dad bought bitcoin that we would be in some sort of bubble. Well he finally bought around 13k. Should have gone with my read ��
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:13:58
That’s likely a coinbase issue not bitcoin. Bitcoin will scale
@_date: 2018-11-18 01:39:12
Yes but they weren’t decentralized, and that’s why they are gone...

Bitcoin isn’t pretending to be anything. It is what it is. Label it as you want. Only people pretend. Not Bitcoin.

Whenever I hear this I assume the person saying it is a BCasher...

It seems that what Bitcoin is changes with how people use it. Are we really looking to define Bitcoin here or looking to define its use case?
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:42:28
Notions that derive value are irrelevant to what Bitcoin is. Why not have micro payments, distributed ledgers and wallets? 
To fully understand what you are getting at I must understand your definition of a “currency”. It may be that I completely agree with you, but first I must know your definition.

I’ve heard Roger Ver say this so often that I associate it with Bcash
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:56:04
Then Bitcoin is many many things. Hopefully world reserve currency ��������

I was once described as a child, now I am described as an adult. Neither of those descriptions accurately defined me.
