I tried it.  It took a day to get coins and it costs 8% over an exchange.  But it works.  
  
A different way: Use Revolut app to buy euros at a good rate and then transfer them to Coinbase or Kraken exchanges. 
NB: Be sure to activate your new Euro account in Revolut! More &gt; Profile &gt; Account Details &gt; Euro and click Activate.  This gives you a Euro account in your name with your own IBAN.  
  
In this case it may take 1 or 2 days to send money to Kraken.

Any recommendations for which of these would be a good alternative to Kraken?  I'm a US citizen residing in the UK.

Hi there, thanks for asking.  
  
I am two thirds of the way verified on Fire.   They want an ID, and two different pieces of mail with my address.  I probably could do that.  With Fire would be a way to get from Revolut to Kraken and back.  
  
However, Revolut said they do still do transfers to other exchanges.  I've seen the list a couple of places, and it includes Bitstamp.net.
  
I submitted for verification on Bitstamp, and within a few days they verified me.  So I am trying that  as an alternative to Kracken.  I haven't checked the fees or anything like that, but I do know one or two people who use them, so I assume they are within the realm of reasonable.  I am now waiting for my first transfer to go through.  Revolut says they've executed the transfer.

This was my fiat to crypto on-ramp.  (And my off-ramp, too.)  Now it is busted.  
  
Anyone know an alternative way to send Euros to Kraken?  And receive them from Kraken?  
  
I live in the UK, and aside from Revolut, I only have a GBP account.    
  
I'd be willing to get a Euro account if it is cheap and they send and receive to/from Kraken.  
  
On [older posts]( there's talk of using Fidor or something called a Fire Euro account.  Anyone familiar with these options?

Doesn't work with me.  I'm stuck and losing hours on this.  Care to share exactly what bank details you have for Kraken that are working for you?  Thanks.

Well...  _Somebody's_ awake.  Thank you.
