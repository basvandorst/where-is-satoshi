No clue nor I care honestly.
I just want to know why it hasnt been kicked out of the mempool  yet since far more than 2 weeks have passed.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:53:42
Ooh, gotcha, so core by default kicks out transactions after 2 weeks but that can be changed if you tinker a bit with the settings? I actually did not know that. 
And what do you mean with "rebroadcast a transaction"? Waiting till the mempool kicks it out and once that happens re-send it? If so, wouldnt that be a completely new and separate transaction just as any other?

Exactly what i was looking for. Ty

Simply because not everyone just holds bitcoin like you do, people trade bitcoin as well.

Yes. Its there on electrum, but not on copay. They are both HD wallets and therefore generate their addresses based on the master private key, right? I mean all addresses are derived from the master seed. So why does it show on Electrum and not on Copay?
Also, Copay also handles change addresses as well.

You can read a bit on that [here]( along with other related articles.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:31:01
It does offer custom fees, so yes.
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:47:19
Any way to get an HD original non compressed version of this? Looks amazing, feel like framing it lul.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:40:31
Can identify.

@_date: 2017-11-24 19:17:40
No, that's the entire price total for 50BTC in 2013.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:03:54
You run one yourself?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:18:02
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:52:48
Gotcha. And agreed.
It only affects upload though, right? Any clue as to wether it will screw my download speed home connection?

Sweet! Cant wait ! Wondering if I should get the new props as well or not ! Would old mavic + new props  offer a noticeable difference? Im also wondering wether I should get ND filters or not. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:56:33
Dont quite understand this.
Back in 2013 you tried to buy 50 BTC and your payment method failed?
Now 4 years later you are able to resume that same deal which didnt went through under the same exact price?
Am I missing something or what?
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:15:18
Congratz! I just literally ordered the mavic FMC and can't wait for it to get to me. I wanted to get the platinum but the mavic sale sold me on it.

Might be just trolling though.

Futures would still apply in the event that it comes back, right?
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:57:40
I actually thought the exact same when I first saw the pic. The comments made me realize it was actually the total.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:41:44
You don't run it full time due to bandwith limit or because of some sort of hardware limit by the RaspberryPI3? Also, what do you boot from?
@_date: 2019-04-12 17:00:26
So as to encourage adoption maybe?
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:37:05
Sweeet! You guys sell the liquid only or the vape as well?
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:12:54
Tell that charity to make some sort of offcial public announcement proving the ownership of that address if youre expecting people to donate to them.
 Not saying I dont believe you or your intentions, but after all this is still the internet.
@_date: 2018-11-22 04:03:48
Yeah I imagine how much of a pain it must be, man, glad you still keep up with it!
Best of lucks!
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:12:57
I got to know it back from the silk road days. But only really got into it and actually own coins due to the need to receive money from abroad with non ridiculous fees.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:27:16
Well for some reason OP’s tx wasnt kicked out after 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:54:23
Not that funny by now...
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:37:14
Sounds good. What else did you have to buy or use besides the PI for it to get it up and running stable?
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:35:04


Thanks for the reply. It's not negatively affecting my life besides my time invested in the matter. Apart from that then I'm golden I guess. And yeah, can't agree more on the nature part!
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:34:39
Lmaoo, glad to hear I'm not alone then!
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:26:48
Sounds good, might give it a go then ! One last question, how do you power your Raspberry along with all other components necessary?
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:39:36


Wallets are only used to store coins, not buy/sell. As for a wallet recommendation, Electrum is wonderful.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:18:31
I meant basic feature as probably every other wallet besides core offers them, not basic as in basic to be programmed or whatever. As to the false sense of backups, care to elaborate on how storing a .dat file which can get easily corrupted / lost is better than storing 12/24 words?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:53:54
What exactly do you mean with metadata?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:07:33

@_date: 2017-09-08 01:02:16
Could I only use an HDD to store the OS + node data so as to keep the costs down?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:11:05
Any specific reason as to why would you store 7+ BTC on a wallet which doesnt offer such a basic feature as mnemonic seeds? I asume it was core, right? Hurts man!
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:26:50
Definitely, gotcha! Im just too scared of file corruption compared to the pros you just mentioned, but those are certainly strong points to take into consideration which I was totally unaware of. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:08:58
You didnt wrote down your mnemonic seed?

You mean tx descriptions such as "payment to Susy for 5 pepperoni pizzas" for example?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:10:45

I couldn't care less why they don't offer their products on IOS, I honestly don't care nor I came here looking for smartphone/OS advice. 
If you don't know the answer to my question, then please do not reply to something I never actually asked.

Text was:
"This site sells BCH \(Bitcoin Cash\) as BTC \(Bitcoin\), so it definitely falls under false advertising and as such shouldn't be brought up when people search for "buy bitcoin".
Please note BCH is a completely different cryptocurrency than Bitcoin. Don't let people fall for this crap."
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:41:58
Glad to hear that ! Can’t wait.
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:13:02
According to the official document, along with his unencrypted laptop they also found 'text documents containing the private keys of multiple cryptocurrency addresses which stored millions of dollars.' .To be honest it all sounds pretty fishy to me, but thats what the official statement says lol.
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:33:16
You can accomplish that with Purse.io

They recently started offering phone support. You might wanna ring them up.
