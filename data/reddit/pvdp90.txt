Problem is, those negative points aren't...well, negative. Sure, blockchain is complex, but less so than the current Fiat banking system. Also, at least anyone can try to learn how blockchain works because all of it is available (open source and all), which is leagues better than the madness in the current banking system.
Sure, crypto has some cons, but these aren't it.

I have no debt and a  2016 car to my name, plus a few (single digits) thousand saved. Not much, but at least I don't owe money. I'm younger and don't have a family tho, I'm starting life.
Im not wanting to see the fiat system fail, as it would obviously ruin a lot of people's lives. All I want is for this fearmongering to stop because the arguments that crop up against crypto have started to resemble that, akin of shooting at your own foot.
As all things, let crypto evolve naturally and, with time, popular adoption will tell where people put their trust and money in.

I entirely agree with you. The complexity isn't an issue. If the system being complex isn't a problem for Fiat currencies and for the population at large, then using this argument against crypto is void of any basis. 
Maybe before people wanted a currency backed by a government but nowadays I wouldn't want that and people are slowly starting to think this way too.

A bit off topic

this is good for Bitcoin but NO Bueno for Dubai.
As someone that lives here, this will just be used by the hundreds of scam artists that are in the real state sector to further rob people blind, plus it will also be used by the high balling crime lords out there to buy real state and launder money. this country is not ready for Bitcoin, sadly.

Well done PF!
These puzzles, they interest me. Are they pure puzzles or do they require specific skills, such as coding?
I would love to give them a go. Also, coming from the PF guy, I feel like it would be the right thing to donate a portion of the prize should I ever manage to solve one first.
EDIT: that chatlog....god damn! Thanks for the laughs, scammer!
