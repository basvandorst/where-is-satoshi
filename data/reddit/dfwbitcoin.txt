The problem is that they said it is only for incoming deposits. Which only saves them money on spending those deposits. There is no segwit on out going transactions. 
The majority of bitcoin transactions are people withdrawing smaller purchases compared to sellers larger deposits.  So this doesn't help anybody besides localbitcoins. You still pay the same incoming deposit fee to them, which they recently raised. It may save you a couple bucks on a miner fee but that's it.

Same here.  When I was interested in buying the prodect, I had instant response.  I have been hammered with problems lately and I rarely receive any response.  When I do get a reply, it is blaming me of doing something wrong.  Still having the same problems over the past month!

The only way that you could simply make these atms compatible would be by only accepting payments from debit cards, which is extremely risky.  I don't see this being very successful. The main users of bitcoin atms are the unbanked.

Because of chargebacks. Unless you verify ID with every transaction it will be a nightmare and you will lose a lot of money.

Use the site to SWAP one coin for another.  You will get amazing the same rates you would on poloinex.  Changelly is great imo.  Swapped 50 zec for some bitcoin and it was done in about an hour.

Use ^
They use poloinex exchange rates and allow you to swap coins for only .5%  no limits,  no verification and very reliable.

You are worried about $30 worth of etc?  I would say the stress of that is not worth the trouble

Use Changelly.  They only charge .5% and have fair/accurate conversation rates. Shapeshift can cost you a few % and avoiding exchanges is better.  They partner with Polo so they use them to gauge pricing. 
No limits either
