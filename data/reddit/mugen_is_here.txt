Nope. That's a wrong, paranoid guess. I read his post and it clearly reads like he was excited and mentioned crypto to them. And then they brought down hell on him. He tolerated them because he had faith in cryptos. But now, the crypto crash weighs on his mind. 
For heaven's sake, give the guy a break. The last thing that he wants right now is having to justify how he feels.

OP, just ignore this whole thread. I replied to him too. This whole thread stinks of invalidation. I get how you felt because I had a similar experience with my co-workers.

I would love to see more articles actually projecting the future of BTC and less BS articles analyzing what has already happened. One definitely needs more prediction than the other.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:10:34
Just buy the Bitcoins.

Day trading involves a lot of speculation, constant monitoring and tense moments. It's not that I don't find that appealing but it's just that my day job doesn't permit me enough time for it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:37:03
Yes. But then everyone else is so much richer that 1m means jack shit.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:49:35
Get yourself a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:54:32
Which ones which?

I do not understand this sentence. English doc?

How is inflation a requirement for Fiat money. It's a something that happens to Fiat but not a requirement. This whole thread reeks of b$ in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:46:05
Can someone please explain the background about all this? What's going on here?
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:01:12
What do you think about the future of Doge coins?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:42:18
Buy them and HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:15:40
I came across something called Raiblocks. That seems to have zero transaction fees and claims to be faster than any other crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:43:38
Okay what's the Plot twist?
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:57:54
If that's the correct price,so be it, 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:02:09
How about pointing out some memes?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:05:21
Does anyone know why the price goes down when the bills are printed?
@_date: 2017-02-22 05:04:00
What's the answer?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:49:12
Aah. Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:09:34
What's FUD?

Normally long term capital gains can be exempted from taxation provided that they're used to buy a house. Maybe that rule could apply to bitcoins, isn't it? Since the Govt. doesn't have a clear take on taxation for bcoins maybe one could interpret it as a sale of a property (because if they don't interpret it as a sale of a property then the whole point of capital gains shouldn't kick in). What do you think?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:52:01
Yep. HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:57:15
It's going to cross 10k once again. And that'll make news once again and being in the Joes again.

Bitcoins have been increasing like crazy year over year. There is nothing specific in this post as to why not to invest. As long as you're investing for the long term you're good. 
This post just compels you to worry over it. It's like saying "invest.. but wait you should not invest because it's not safe.. but invest.. but wait it's not safe". Worrying over your investment isn't going to make it better. In fact it's more likely to get you to make worse decisions. If you invest some money in it then do it for the long term. Put the money into it and then don't worry about the weekly fluctuations. And just like you invest in the stock market you should invest a little amount. Don't invest everything you got into this.
 Just like any other investment that involves risks.

They're trying to prevent the price from falling further down. Relax. Just set the buy price at a particular number and then forget about it. Whenever they open you'll immediately get it at your price.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:20:21
Yes but the question is whether it will keep rising because 1, Bitcoin cash shit, 2, some exchanges are saying that you cannot withdraw your cash anymore. The only way to withdraw is via cash shit.

The whole thing of capital gains comes into play when we sell a house. I feel that on one hand if we say "capital gains" then we mean we're selling a property. Isn't it? Oh God I'm hoping that the money that I get from bcoins might be used to buy a property and save tax at the same time.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:28:55
I wish I had also purchased it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:28:10
Yes butI cannot purchase property with them I guess.

Check out the statement made by John McAfee. He's declared that he's going to eat his nuts publicly if it doesn't reach 500k.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:37:51
The other question is how come nobody else ever gets hold of the shield.
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:25:35
How about cutting that guy a little slack?
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:57:06
It's like a toddler trying to do something that it's not supposed to do,  getting hit, and then letting go of it.
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:48:28
Save it. This was exactly the same reaction a year back which prevented me from buying it.
@_date: 2016-07-11 16:36:41
I'm sure there are lots of predictions about startups. It's just easy to look back *after* something goes bull and then point out who all had rightfully predicted it all.
