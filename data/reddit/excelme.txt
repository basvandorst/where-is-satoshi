If you would like to earn bitcoins to donate for yourself seperately (Completely removing my involvement), you need to first create a new account on BTC guild. Then create a worker with your account to replace mine. Next thing you need to do is get a address from the donation site  Copy that address in your Settings&gt;Bitcoin Wallet address and set an automatic payout (lowest is 0.01). Now you are all set, when you've collected enough bitcoins on your own, and once it reaches your payout threshlevel, it will automatically send the bitcoins to the charity. 
Any questions?

If you would like to contribute I wrote up these simple instructions to set up.
**SET UP &amp; INSTALLATION** 
1. Download and Run [bitcoin miner]( I use GUIMiner the most popular and this is simple the software that will do the actual mining and essentially all you need. Here is the official link 
2. Select **BTC GUILD (any)** as your server and Username: **BTCharity_1**. (Password is anything you set)
3. Hit **Start Mining** and that's it, let it run it the background as you collect. You will see it working when you see a hash rate showing with shares numbers slowly rising.popular and this is simple the software that will do the actual mining and essentially all you need.

I do pay for electricity, but I am looking at it just like how I pay for internet service. My PC is on almost 24/7 so that was not the biggest factor to me. 
Also I'm about to post an update soon on how to do the same with little to no effort.

I am at a measly 0.03~ at the moment, when I started I linked the donation address to the BTC Guild account wallet so once it reaches 1 BTC, it will be paid out automatically.

I appreciate your response. However you have to consider that the main reason I got into bitcoin is because of how intriguing it is to me and I'm also a crypto freak. So I take some plreasure in doing this. As to donating 100$, I simple don't have the money, if you do i encourage you to do what you have just suggested.
