As opposed to this guy, who ignored his wife and MIL's repeated warnings that he was throwing their family's money away. True love.

"Buy the dip" = "help me get out of my current position by buying these worthless coins"

Quick question: when the last Bitcoin is mined, how will transactions be confirmed in the block chain?
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:33:07
Once all the Bitcoins are mined, how will transactions be verified? Miners expect to be compensated somehow.

No different than everyone else saying it will go up.

Shame most of those desperate people will get exit scammed by a scummy exchange or see the value of their money evaporate.

Under-regulation and regulatory capture are the two biggest problems in the traditional financial market, I'd agree. Cryptocurrency doesn't even have a regulator to capture.

I literally can't believe how delusional people are here. Crypto is a series of nested Ponzi schemes that rely on idiots like you to believe they're helping to "fight the system".

The market cap for all cryptocurrency has fallen nearly 60%, your statement is ridiculous on its face.

What a terrible assumption, Bitcoin is awful for conducting actual transactions.

How does Bitcoin accomplish that? To me it seems like it relies heavily on existing banking infrastructure to function as a currency.

So it's good that over half of coins from 2017 ICOs are dead or near dead? It's good that exchanges are exit scamming every week?

I meant "worthless" as a combination of "cannot be used as a currency due to lack of accepting vendors and price volatility" and "a poor investment asset due to high volatility, because while it does show strong periods of growth it also occasionally loses &gt;65% of its value".
I didn't mean "has a value of $0", just that I'd be better off using Paypal and investing in stocks.

The irony is that you're stepping out of a system where financial assets are tightly regulated and exchanges have law enforcement breathing down their necks and stepping into the financial Wild West. 
Your distrust in the government is being used to steer you into a scam. If you don't trust government backed banking, you should trust cryptocurrency *even less*.

I know, I can't tell the difference between "never going to wake up to my losses" and "maybe I can convince someone to buy my worthless coins" anymore.
