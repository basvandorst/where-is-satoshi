You don't understand economics.

He's right.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:01:00
Bitcoin is a fucking currency.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:43:35
TIL Bitcoin literally killed Hitler.

You're saying that people will stop buying things they can't afford. That won't happen.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:04:05
Perhaps that would happen if the entire world was on bitcoin, but if nobody was lending money then I assure you I would start the first bitcoin bank in a second.

Typical Bitcoin community. "BITCOIN IS THE PEOPLE'S CURRENCY AND WILL SAVE THE WORLD!!!"
Go read an economics book.

Your attitude is so pathetic. Bitcoin isn't a fucking money tree. Bitcoin isn't a commodity. Bitcoin is a fucking currency. A CURRENCY. Or at least, it's supposed to be. The reason it fluctuates so much is because neckbeards like you keep circlejerking over the fact that you "bought in" early enough to make some money off the people who are losing money on this. Just because you made some incredible gains on this bubble doesn't mean you're an intelligent investor, it means you're a lucky idiot who is going to lose all of your money when this ponzi scheme eventually collapses.
INB4 "LOL BUT BTC ISNT A PONZI SCHEME!!!!!" okay then why does 50% of bitcoins belong to only a few hundred users?

Replace "Quark" with "Bit" and you could say the exact same things. Take 1 look at the frontpage of this subreddit and it's equally a circlejerk.

You are a near-sighted bafoon. Please cash out your Bitcoins and go on vacation forever.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:35:03
Don't you guys get tired of jerking each other off all day?
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:18:14
You aren't? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:13:20
So you think the concept of debt will just disappear because people will use Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:36:40


You know you just posted a thread comparing it to gains against USD right?
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:04:41
You don't understand credit.
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:00:39
About 500 people control 50% of all bitcoins. It's similar.

My question: how the fuck will anyone get a loan without banks?
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:03:49
You know that debt/loans/credit are a vital part of an economy? You can't just assume they'll disappear because you're favourite cryptocurrrency doesn't support it. I love the idea of Bitcoin but to say that a major financial concept like debt will disappear is really naive.
