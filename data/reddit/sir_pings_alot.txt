Hey man, sorry for the late reply, I don't check this account very often.
To your question - this kind of solved itself, I tried a couple of weeks later and it worked without a hitch. I'm not sure if it was just some trouble in the beginning or if there was an update to the app, but it works perfectly now (I can buy and sell BTC directly from the BitStam app).

I've also just transferred some BTC out of my Bitstamp account, just to be on the safe side - I will update once it goes through.
edit: The transfer has gone through without a hitch, though again, that was BTC, not a fiat withdraw. Given the size of BitStamp and the amount of money flowing in and out, I wouldn't worry quite yet, at least until we hear from multiple sources.

Well put - in this regard, Bitcoin is a great alternative to something like gold and silver, both of which have been used in the past in these cases. BTC is easier to buy (and hold), easier to sell/use, you can buy in small increments, etc.

Thanks for the input. I'm thinking of just dipping a toe in lending, to diversify a bit, so only to lend a small portion of the Bitcoin I have. I've clicked around a bit and am trying to decide which site has the most users, as with all investing, I'll try and diversify as much as possible (lend very small amounts to a large number of borrowers).

Awesome, thanks!

Yeah, I'm keeping an eye out for businesses that accept Bitcoin - I can't wait until GOG or Steam get on board!

This is one of my alt accounts, I have different accounts for different stuff on Reddit, made this one specifically to post, but I've been a long time lurker.

Didn't BitStamp recently release a bitcoin-based debit card?

Thanks :-)

Not working for me - when scanning the QR code I get the error "Wrong API Key" (this is on iOS).
