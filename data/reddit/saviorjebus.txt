Might hit $1000 by August, brace yourselves

Oh guess if you were so sure you'd be a multi millionaire and would of done a leveraged trade 1:25 on bitcoin right? Stop talking out your ass, no one knew what it would do. And you still dont.

thats what you get for banking with low tier banks

$5000 is a big deal to me.. and i got it for free, the wallet the dude sent me it from has almost 300k bitcoins, insane

I have my bitcoin on blockchain.info but have the private keys, so do I own it? 
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:04:52
Thanks for the great info! 
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:56:05
And yet no customers lost money.. and everyone goes on about how bad banks are?
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:45:56
Why do you people keep saying its got a finite supply? You do understand once all the bitcoins have been mined they'll just vote for more coins to be added. There is no set in stone rules, have you not learned anything from the past few weeks? 
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:43:36
if you want to be a weirdo, yes.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:28:21
thank you so much!! the dude just sent me 2 bitcoins, i cant believe this is real, you have changed my life! 
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:17:57
its only in usd, not gbp
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:02:18
Nah, I'll wait till it drops another $500 before buying. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:51:02
It will drop hugely post August 1st.. common sense. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:23:19
op you sound way to paranoid, no way in hell the biggest bitcoin exchanges would do this. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:41:57
If quantum computers are able to crack this, is it the end of bitcoin? Surely bitcoin developers are already thinking of ways to solve this and add extra protection. 
Thank you for the great response btw.

In regards to your comments about no proof that cryptographic technology is actually secure, this was very interesting. From what I read it is very secure, can you shed more light on this please? Great read!
