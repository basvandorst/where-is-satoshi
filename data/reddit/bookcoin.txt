We appreciate your thoughts and certainly agree that holding coin is beneficial!  For those looking to part with a portion of their coin, Bookcoin offers an opportunity to do so at a competitive cost relative to other methods of conversion into fiat while also helping, in whatever small way, to further validate the currency and, thus, pushing the value even further.  That's, of course, something we believe everyone would agree is a good thing!

Since making the announcement of Bookcoin's Custom Order feature, we've had an incredible inflow of visitors with fantastic suggestions.  As such, we've made some adjustments.
First off, we've clarified our Shipping policy right on the Custom Order page.  We will honor Prime Shipping, or a Gift Card is another option, of course.
Secondly, we've added an auto currency converter on the page for international orders to include GBP, AUD, CAD, and EUR on top of the USD.
Finally, we've reformatted the order page to be more concise and user friendly.
All of the input has been very helpful!  Please feel free to provide feedback!
