With Bitcoin, there is constantly support underneath. There are fundamentals carrying it along, the whole way. There's nothing else I have *ever* seen that has traded as clean as Bitcoin. I don't really mean to compare it to a pump and dump, so much as to observe how strikingly clean it trades compared to anything I have ever seen. It does so remarkably.

Not sure what difference it would make.

What I'm saying is, as a whole, from the moment I began monitoring the chart since it was around $3.00, it has traded in a structured way. Typical with scam companies/pump and dumps and even fortune 500 trash, you'll see the price trade erratically, and that is considered normal. From the onset, Bitcoin has the most perfect trading chart I have ever seen. This is how real solid assets increase.

Well the most prominent thing I see is the fundamental support is evident in the chart. It never seems to fade off, like it does in every stock I have seen. In stocks, when fundamental support falls away, you see a bunch of cheerleaders posting online, trying to create a psychological support, and 100% of the time they have failed. Bitcoin's chart clearly shows it's intent. Yes there are periods of consolidation, testing of price levels, etc. but it's still been unlike anything I have ever seen. It's just so wrong for anyone to call this a bubble. I've waited a long time to say this, because I'm admittedly not great at explaining things, and so when I say things I want to be 100% sure what I am saying is true. I feel confident that what I'm saying is true. There may be someone out there who can explain it better. I am not a teacher, sorry!

Exactly. You got it :)
