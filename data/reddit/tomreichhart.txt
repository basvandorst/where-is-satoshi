That's funny. Respect.
@_date: 2016-04-27 13:34:26
Cool down. This is just business as usual.
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:32:21
Are you serious? Or is this hidden cam show?

Our pleasure. 1000 bits @_date: 2014-12-31 14:33:14
Ok, well done. Next task for our oracle: please tell me the price for midnight AEDT Sydney Time December 31, 2015. Thanks in advance.

You have my support. 1$ @_date: 2014-12-11 19:51:25
Somebody sent another 87,550 bits to his address: 1EyosiaYh9gVEP7VKPTyrFGSSoS8QDSsbb - Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-24 10:21:32
Sure it's fun. That's the main reason why I did it.
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:59:37
You have my support. 1$. Don't stop asking.
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:35:40

Well Done. You have my support. 1$

Ross, awesome. You boosted my tip income by a factor of 14. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:02:29
That's a very good approach. I hope you can excecute it. I like your product very much. Spend more time on UI please. It will pay off.
@_date: 2014-11-24 20:10:02
Well done. 1$ @_date: 2014-12-30 08:59:53
Bob, don't worry.
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:20:11
The qr code on it is pointing to bitcoin.org - i hope that people get curious and scan it.
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:50:46
Thanks for the time you spent helping Bob. $3 @_date: 2014-12-31 12:01:16

@_date: 2014-11-23 21:31:12
Not sure if this is a good answer. The reason why someone trusts a currency is based on his/her believe that it will have similiar value in the future. On top of this papermoney (FIAT money) is supported by government as legal tender. Everybody is forced to take it by law. And everybody needs it to pay his/her taxes. The question if a specific currency has intrinsic value or not is not really relevant.
@_date: 2014-12-10 14:57:07
Makes sense. This is what I did: [Bitcoin Car](
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:20:10
That's a very good point. Great idea.
@_date: 2014-11-24 12:00:55
Rod, Thanks. I will forward your tip to my daughter who made the design.
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:54:21
I like it too. 500 bits @_date: 2015-05-28 12:06:00
@_date: 2014-11-24 12:17:06
I didn't loose any so far :-)
@_date: 2014-11-24 07:31:43
Thanks Titan, my first post led to my first tip. You made history for me.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:14:24
That makes sense to me. The potential is huge. Multisig and other Smart Money usecases are just at the beginning.
@_date: 2015-01-25 12:45:12
Respect. Great video.
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:56:56
Respect. The world needs more people like you.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:55:50
I buy you an 'h' 100 bits @_date: 2015-01-24 14:03:59
NSA here. Saw this from my satellite.
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:47:51
Fine that you are able to compute some figures. But what is the idea behind your exercise?
@_date: 2015-01-17 14:50:51
Thanks for typo hint.
@_date: 2015-01-17 14:03:23
I saw the videos some time ago. but I didn't know that he is so bullish on bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-04 11:23:23
Respect. You are a frontrunner.
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:03:39
This is all meaningless. To many variables / assumptions / speculations to make a reasonable statement.
@_date: 2016-01-01 20:22:18
Makes sense. Kicking the can down the road while working on a better solution. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:52:33
YOU ARE RIGHT.
@_date: 2016-01-03 21:02:24
No you are not. I fully understand your point.
@_date: 2016-01-04 09:49:08
Correct. This is a very good example how the establishment reacts on disruptive technologies.
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:31:11
Right, that's not trolling, just insane.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:52:31
Fully agreed.
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:58:07
Great idea - give it a try. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 20:06:00
It's e-cash

Your 'ad hominem' propaganda sounds like childish bullshit talk from kindergarden.
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:20:57
I like your humour. Nice picture.
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:22:31
Perfect vote.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:11:03
I think you are getting what democrazy means.
@_date: 2015-07-06 07:53:09
Roger, checking the site's content I come to the conclusion that you are in a conflict of interest. Promoting Bitcoin/bitcoin and your investments on the same site is questionable. I'm sure that you will find a way to resolve the conflict. Independent from that the design should be improved. The video is broken too.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:29:55
Cool picture. Like it.
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:20:19
Looks like the mods are busy with deleting XT posts; they should delete this one instead.
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:55:54
So you have a proof of reserves? Or should I just believe what you are saying?
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:02:09
The Bitcoin Police was here. That's rediculous.
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:17:59
Nice picture. And I think the headline sums it up accurately.
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:24:03
Is the leverage  just made by manipulatng numbers in their system like Fractional Reserve Banking?
@_date: 2015-04-11 07:54:57
I think you are on the right track. Last week I was in Singapore and went to Oyster Bar which was listed on coinmap.org. Nobody there had a clue what Bitcoin is. Pretty frustrating.
@_date: 2015-04-11 07:57:38
5000 bits

And then some green people from planet Mars will land and they will sing the blockchain song.
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:37:27
I will unsubscribe. Just searching for the link to do so. Can somebody help?
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:35:55
Makes sense.
@_date: 2016-05-07 13:12:13
One reason is not excluding the other.
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:36:26
Your proposition is not a good one.
@_date: 2015-02-01 09:53:56
The watch looks far better than the price.
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:35:33
One of the best videos for sure.
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:57:37
Oops - I find it totally annoying that some business people in bitcoin space have such a flat learning curve.
@_date: 2015-02-15 10:31:17
You are not showing values for coinbase exchange and Kraken. Why?
@_date: 2015-02-14 14:17:19
Respect. Good answer. 1000 bits
@_date: 2015-02-14 14:28:16
Respect. Great Job. 4000 bits
@_date: 2016-07-30 14:19:37
No need. You speak for yourself, Travis. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 22:48:46
@_date: 2016-07-03 08:23:09
@_date: 2016-07-30 08:24:08
Travis, only stupid guys think they have full knowledge. You are obviously one of them.
@_date: 2016-07-30 14:23:39
Sure Roger makes mistakes, he is a human. But you guys cannot hold the candle to him. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 11:01:18
Social gathering like Bilderberg. Theymos go for politics; you have talent.
@_date: 2016-07-24 17:06:34
Bitcoin ETF approval.
@_date: 2016-07-30 08:19:24
Travis, I just read some of your posts. My conclusion: your ego is bigger than your brain.
@_date: 2016-07-30 08:01:50
Roger Ver is a great character. He is living his belief. I respect him.
