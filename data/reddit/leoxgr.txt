I would keep the profit in coins on a wallet, so as long as i dont withdraw more than i deposited i shouldnt need to pay taxes right?
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:44:01
Yeah, yesterday same amount of btc was deposited as bcc and earlier today i sold at like 500€
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:19:32
Kept my coins at kraken, got no problems lel
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:27:32
I could buy/sell bcc since yesterday on kraken without any problems at all
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:26:04
Im logged in but no bcc yet
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:44:01
Lol i walked past this store just yesterday ��
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:01:23
Okay but if its just the value of btc, that you get bcc for and you sell bcc afterwards its the same amount right? So you dont make any profit you just trade it back right?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:56:25
Sorry for asking im new to cryptomarkets, what do you mean by selling bcc for free btc? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:05:09
Oh alright, so if there wont be a fork would you suggest to buy now? I dont believe in a fork. And thank you for answering.
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:15:15
Or is it just.for securance in general?
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:03:55
Ok right and to trade again i just refund it back to kraken. Which hardware wallet would you recommend? Thanks for answering btw
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:10:45
Haha alright, yeah i will buy today probably, also investing in ltc! 
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:07:18
Alright I understand thank you! Would you recommend to store all keys private for the next weeks or is it just important for kraken?
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:14:03
Or isnt there any relation? Im just confused by all this new Information the last days
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:30:26
Im currently holding it on kraken, do you know if they support bcc?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:48:44
You think it will split? I would stay with Btc
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:37:58
How do i get my private keys from kraken tho?
