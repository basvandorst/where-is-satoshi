They are the only ones I've seen actually making legitimate progress. I've looked at Wirex and other ones and it seems like they are all having issues with their partnerships especially with Visa and getting their cards frozen. I don't really give a damn what company it is as long as I have a physical card that works like a normal credit card for both in person and online purchases.

Yeah and that's why I always find it weird when people say block chain is good for being anonymous. Unless you are going to great pains to essentially periodically launder Bitcoin, it's pretty easy to track everything you've ever done with it.

Also travelling internationally frequently. I am constantly moving countries and using different ATMs and shopping at different places and my cards get frozen for fraud very frequently. I can't wait until a decent crypto card comes out for international use (looking at you Monaco)

Well that's basically the commodities futures industry to some extent. Interesting thought for sure

I did something like this when I felt Bitcoin was overvalued (at about $12k before peak) and I sold some to buy bottle service for a night out. I sold after the peak too to pay my college tuition haha

I realize this is a bitcoin subreddit, but the question seems pretty simple. Do you believe bitcoin is going to be increasing by 17% each year any time soon? Don't get me wrong, I'm ultimately bullish on bitcoin and still have money in crypto but you can always get back in. Many hands are still being shaken out and bitcoin could very easily get down to $1k or $2k before it starts to rebound. I'd get what you can, pay off your CC debt and deal with your current situation and just slowly build your position back up. There is nothing wrong with selling and buying back in later, if I had simply done the HODL method, I'd only be up $3k for the year rather than realizing massive overvaluation and selling around $16k for closer to $14k in profit. Bitcoin needs to stabilize and get more widespread adoption before you actually see it as an investment rather than a speculative tool.

Pretty similar in Hong Kong as well

I'm not sure this service exists but I imagine it would be pretty straightforward. I would basically just write up some code from existing menu generators, let owners drag and drop photos and descriptions to some preset templates and then integrate a checkout function. In theory, a customer would select their drink/food, add it to a "cart" and then you could probably just use Bitpay integration for the conversion and QR code generation. If you wanted to handle the Bitcoin yourself you would probably have to set up some kind of hot wallet which would be much more difficult. The real winning formula here would be to also have a Bitcoin ATM in your business too. That way if people don't have Bitcoin already, they can buy with your ATM and then try your system out. Win-win IMO

I've actually debated going to bar owners in college towns and telling them I would design them a digital menu free of charge integrated with bitcoin QR codes if I handled the payment processing and volatility on my end. Obviously this requires a lot of work, but the benefit of the business owners is that a lot of students are pretty tech savvy and either a) already have some bitcoin or b) would be willing to try it out if they got a drink discount. In addition to this, they would have a lower rate than a traditional credit card processing fee and not have to worry about disputed charges from students who overspent from drinking too much.

Where is that hoodie from?

Can you actually get him to release this data over time with names anonymized? I'd be very interested in this.
