What about XRP?  Ripples tech seems fantastic. Made some good hires as well recently.

Why is he recommending anyone "blow" their savings on alt-coins that are "going to come crashing down eventually"? Seems like the dinosaur media are confused.
Edit: Maybe it's not so much a hit-piece on BTC directly, but it's a sneaky little jab at cryptocurrencies in general, throwing them all (inc bitcoin) under the same banner which he outlined in the headline and intro paragraph. Let's face it, most people don't read past the fold of an article.

Mine arrived today as well!!! :D 
Edit: Goddamnit I'm reading the comments and have buyers remorse now. Is the Trezor wallet really that much better?

Same here! Bought a LOT at $7200. WOHOOO
Don't really care as I"m in it for the long term. I'm hoping it will drop more so that I can buy more at discount prices.

Bought in at $7.5k (ish) late 2017 and when it hit nearly 20k I held. Greed I guess but it felt so bullish until I noticed the mainstream media attention and coverage, and your average Joe talking about it. Then Bloomberg covering it constantly made me feel like we were being set up for being made and example of.... then futures arrived which worried me but still held. 
Watching it crash over Christmas with my Dad and telling him we should hold this is normal... but a few days ago it dropped close to our initial substantial investment. So we sold and hedged. But ready to buy back in once we feel that bottom has been hit as we know it will bounce back and it just felt like a sensible move to cash out and hedge in USD until buying feels right again.
Back in the early(ish) days invested $2k at $150 ish p/BTC then panic sold at $580 when it stared crashing. At least I made profit. I remember when it was $15 and when it hit 60 we were like wtf is going on. I was tipping mates 3,4,5 BTC lol.
Bitcoin will bounce back. I think it’s being manipulated by Wall Street, the media and hedge funds. 
Long live bitcoin.
