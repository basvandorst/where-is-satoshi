It isn't exactly rationalization if statistics state that this can and will happen. As far as your uneasiness goes, do you get uneasy when you flip a coin and get heads 10 times in a row?

A) The dev is interested B) The dev has hundreds of people demanding his time C) You yourself have been unable to keep up with the questions in this thread. Imagine that times 100 all while you have lots of programming to do.
