I tried to get mine back thought paypal recently, they said that they couldn't do it, however I did tell me to ring my bank. 
You can ask you bank to do what's called an Indemnity payment on the charge. 
Basically they will refund you the money straight away, provided that what you say is legitimate and that BLF are a scam and have broken code of sales.
I got the money back within 24 hours, and BFL seems to have not changed my order status, so I might still be getting one which is nice, but I'm not sure?
I'm UK based and I paid with a debt card, so it might be slightly different for you. 
Best of luck

Basically it's a compensation payment that can be made for  particular loss suffered by a person, which is charged back to the company.
While Google for Germany Indemnity payment I just got lots of World war repayments, I've suggest that you contant you bank for more info, you might need to provide documents to back up your claim, order conformation, emails correspondence about delivery etc, anything that might be able to make your case stronger. Best of luck.
