I like your point about "liberating" your identity from the institutes of power. And of course bitcoin is a powerful tool in the globalization and ability to do commerce around the world.

I appreciate your answer, but in further discussions, try not to belittle the people you are debating with by telling them they lack free thought due to societal pressure or critical thinking ability. 
I asked the question because I was curious, not because I wanted to be accused of contributing to a totalitarian society. 
I get your point, but I will claim my right to debate the problems with anonymity - because in some cases it is problematic!

Well yes I have, but I would argue that things aren't as dire as they have been. I don't think we are close to a totalitarian society at all in the developed world. 
Look, I get what you are saying, but I don't believe society is on the verge of "going to shit" and in that process spiraling towards a dystopian, totalitarian society. 
It seems like privacy as a concept has both pros and cons, and I'm just trying to understand both sides :)

Wise words. Thank you for your reply!

Yes, but liberty for all, right?
Terrorists, criminals and others who benefit from the anonymity.
Is that a fair price to pay, and why? :)

But isn't this already possible today? I mean in my country I'm not obliged to reveal myself if I win a big prize. No one will know beside the bank and the lottery. And they have the duty of confidentiality.

Hope they are right. :)
