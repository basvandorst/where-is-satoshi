It's a saying, no need to get triggered over it.
If I was being literal in addressing the sub I would've used "ladies and gentlemen" instead of "boys".

I understand, I used "boys" to give it a *drinking cold ones and watching football with the boys* kinda feel. A lot of other things would've worked too

That was literally like 10 days ago. $1,000 in 10 days is fucking absurd.

The only positive effect of Socialism: it makes my Cryptocurrency wallet(s) worth more

People trust the hype so they're hanging onto their BTC. Since so many people are hanging on to BTC, there's less BTC in supply, so demand is high. People who want to jump on the BTC train are willing to pay top dollar to get their hands on BTC, and they have no choice but to pay top dollar since hodlers won't let their coin go for any less.
The $30 dips are hodlers losing faith in the hype and panicking to get rid of their coin. It bounces right back up after that.

You must be joking, taking all your eggs and putting them all into another basket isn't the way to play. You gotta diversify that shit man, put some into BTC and buy a whole ETH while they're cheap.

If you're gonna buy, monitor the markets closely, once you see a $30 drop you buy (there've been consistent $30 drops all day). 
BTC went up $1,000 in 10 days. All the conditions are right for it to reach $4,000.

Although the fees are bs, I just use CoinBase. It's quick and simple. I'm not too much of a stickler about fees unless they're huge.
