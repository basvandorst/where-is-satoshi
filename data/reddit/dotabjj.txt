thanks.  do you dump your alts for btc during a bullrun or do you weather the storm and hold?  they eventually catchup (well not all like Neo and Eth).  do you go in and out?  
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:01:34
1 successful altcoin trade makes a years worth of mining very insignificant tho:( .5-2x btc gains (even more) from alts happens everyday.

wow really?  so miners can do what ever they want just like Roger and Jihan likes it.

If you can be robotic about it, it will work.  But we are emotional.  you won't know how you'd react when you suddenly lose 50% of your capital value.  I tried to trade alts. Alts will usually rise in btc value, eventually, given enough time as more and more people speculate... but I hate the feeling of losing btc so I still pulled a stop loss instead leaving my money in.  It's a bad feeling and I can't handle it.  I don't wanna gamble my btc.
you also might take more risks when you get a taste of high gains.

Theoretically, the bulk of miners can completely abandon btc for the chain with less value for the lulz.
You also forget that the shitcoin that occasionally takes bitcoin mining power is centralized and owned by 2 individuals that could be put in jail or killed at any time.  Bitcoin is decentralized and is bigger than a few individuals.

alts are called alts for a reason. look at the charts.
this is a stupid post specially when Lightning is just around the corner.  Lastly, SECURITY.  no way a new alt can claim better immutability than 8-9 years of bitcoin and surviving 2 consecutive hostile forks/attempts.

Because out of all the coins, bitcoin is the only one without a ceo/heads. Decentralized. Can’t be shut down and censored. Can’t be controlled by backdoor boardroom meetings (failed segwit2x takeover)
It’s not just about fast efficient payments. We already have paypal and visa.
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:48:50
security is only proven through running time.  8 years for bitcoin.
Ethereum and it's offsprings, in it's young life has had the DAO and 2 parity wallet hacks.
But now with Lightning Network demonstrated in Mainnet, even the claim that it is old and slow is no longer tenable.

Hello Greg,
Just curious, without Poon and Dryja’s paper/LN idea, what would be core’s scaling roadmap today?  Still guessing segwit but what would be alternatives to lightnin if it hadn’t been discovered.  Alternative payment channels?  Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:54:34
I think If tether is a scam, and it accounts for a huge demand for btc, then btc crashes when it’s revealed they are printing money with no dollar backing and demand is fake.
Is this the correct interpretation?

Uhm, if a huge chunk of bitcoin demand is in tethers and it suddenly disappears/proven to be a scam,  then demand plummets.   Fomo goes away and  normal demand may not warrant this price range.
It matters that tethers is legit.

Alts are premined with their respective ceos and heads.  We already have visa and paypal for that.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:30:14
Which POS coins are in circulation now?  serious question.
Still confused about POS.  an asset is valuable mainly because of it's security (can't be faked, immutability, guaranteed scarcity etc). In POS, security of x is reliant on people not wanting to lose x asset value (penalized stake for cheating).... which is only valuable if it's.... secure. seems like circular reasoning. maybe it works.
In POW, an outside resource has to be expended/staked (electricity).
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:36:24

It’s absurd to think that stock to flow model doesn’t stop after all the money in the world is consumed.  Common sense.  Supply/Commodities run out. Stock to flow models will always fall apart after some time.  It doesn’t mean it’s useless in the mean time.
Perhaps s/f ratio is bad but using reductio ad absurdum selectively against it and not to other models is a weak argument against it.

\----For example, after 5 more halvenings (20 years) the S/F rating for Bitcoin is like 1600 vs golds 62. The S/F charts project Bitcoin would be worth much more than all wealth on planet earth (hint: that’s impossible).
poor reasoning and I hope it's an honest mistake.
You mean to tell me that models that accurately predict bacterial and viral growth and spread can't possibly be right cause if true, bacteria and viruses will occupy the whole universe?  Of course not.   We can have models that is accurate up to a certain point.  At the current state of adoption (or lack there of), there is a ton of room for growth.

I'm actually considering it mainly for increasing my btc holdings.  just pure speculation, with gains being brought back to Bitcoin.  a tiny percentage of course when we are at 100k.  the downside is that bitcoin goes x5-x10 to 500k and 1m, which is still fantastic as we still have 95% of our value in bitcoin.

u/starkbot hypothetically, if we yolo and implement LN in mainnet right now, would it lose people's funds immediately and crap?  or is it serviceable and you are just being cautious like responsible devs should be?
perhaps there can be a live beta version on mainnet with a clear caveat that it could have bugs and all, and loss of funds is a reality.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:42:04
It’s almost like using metric and imperial at the same time.  I was ok with mbtc. 
Or just teach people to use satoshi.  It’s quite easy when you assume that there are always 8 decimal
Places after the “.”.    Instead of counting 0s you ignore them and just look at the numbers from the right.
Ofcourse all merchants would have to strictly follow the 8 decimal places format all the time. Some learning curve but is logical.

Internet stuff usually replaces nature and brick and mortar stuff.  (sure, it's useless in a zombie apocalypse).
let's wait and see.  Bitcoin is backed by math and code.  portable and stealthy.  you can't take gold cross boarders without unwanted attention.
that is the value of bitcoin.  portable wealth+freedom.  permissionless and limited.

Ideally, you shouldn’t trade, but if you have to, at least only do it on the first high.  Second time it approaches that price, it usually breaks out/goes higher.  (No double tops or double bottom “rule” according to traders).

many ways to view it.  
If we assume that BTC will be the king, eventually going to 100k, 500k or 1m in 5 years, all these forks are just nuisance, and even beneficial as it allows us to sell them in exchange for the real thing.
another view is that it takes away some value from the main coin, in which case you can choose to hold on to it and diversify.
I choose to keep selling them at a good price and ride the Bitcoin rocketship.  worse case scenario is that you rebuy these coins if they really get traction as a main competitor to Bitcoin.
also, it's value is usually a small percentage of the main coin as it's support is minuscule.  there could possibly be a fork where the value will be half but that is yet to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:13:03

It’s also funny how traditional traders hedge their bitcoin by investing into alts in light of a huge market crash.  I was strongly adviced by a stockbroker to do so.  He really thinks if bitcoin fails or gets conpromised, that alts will also survive. Lol.  
Tho of course, alts could multiply easier than btc at the moment with their diminutive prices (more attractive to newbies) and smaller market caps.  Which ones out of the 1300 tho?

Securing the network is not a waste.
My understanding is:  If your security method has other uses, like for example heating your city when there is an ice age (hypothetical) then more companies are incentivised to invest more hardware as reward is doubled by 2nd use case making it less secure.  Everyone has mining power then and if they just happen to mine bitcoin too by producing heat, they can also just happen to do a 51% attack as it doesnt cost then anything extra, they are using it for heat.

A lot of people, even non criminals. Surveillance and privacy is a problem as governments are slowly removing cash.

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:07:45
no, your sentiments and the need to insert the complete name of bcash betray your intent:)  it's kinda obvious.
you clearly know the core/lightning roadmap and it's potential and focus on this interim moment where it's yet to be implemented.
the security of the whole blockchain takes precedent over being able to buy coffee with it and that function will be online in the future. you know  that is being taken cared of but yet continue to shill.  In the meantime, coinbase hasn't even adopted segwit yet, creating opportunity for bcash shills to attack bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:57:35

the fact that you do not acknowledge my reply to your post, with data, makes it clear you are not sincerely assessing Bitcoin's merits.   you go and jump into another talking point, rinse and repeat.  gold was volatile as fuck and only stablilized "recently".  what's you next talking point?

@_date: 2017-12-31 15:29:32
Exactly my point.  Gold was volatile af in the 60s-70s in particular.   Bitcoin is 8-9 yrs old.  Give it time.
It’s utility as an immutable ledger is immense.  That is what money is: a ledger.  We used precious metal as it was scarce.  Bitcoin can’t be faked and not only scarce, it’s limited.  
But yeah, if your assertion  is that bitcoin could go down to zero someday then I guess i can’t disprove that.  Will people suddenly lose interest/trust on the integrity of the immutable, unalterable blockchain? I dont have a time machine and crystal ball.   Maybe people will stop using the internet too.

You judge an 8 yr track record by the last 10 or so days.... and ignore the 12x ytd, which was 20x just recently... 
There is a strong upward bias.  Lastly, this “deflation” is much better  for venezuelans than the venezuelan  currency where price changes for bread before they reach the check out counter.
Bitcoin’s high volatility is no different than gold’s in the 1970s (pls google it).  The higher the market cap, the lesser the volatility is.  It’s currently less than 5% of gold’s.

security and decentralization is prioritized, THEN coffee money is next.  unlike the bcash people who naively think that simply enlarging blocks can bring them to visa levels, and that it's ok to just have "a couple of dozen nodes" to check transaction as Ver said (massive centralization).

@_date: 2017-12-24 11:32:19
the issues bitcoin is having now mainly concerns the blocksize.  Lots of other blockchains have bigger blocks, even faster intervals between blocks and this bloats the blockchain tremendously making it impossible for you and I to run our nodes at home in a few years.  it would cost a lot of bandwidth and thanks to the repeal of net neutrality, an avenue for censorship or control.  verizon could ask for a premium rate for anything bitcoin related for example.
Decentralization is very important to bitcoin, specially the base layer so blocksize needs to be as small as possible as the bloating could be unwieldy in 10-20 or 50 years.  
If I'm not mistaken, Ethereum's blockchain is now bigger than bitcoin despite bitcoin's 8 year existence and ethereum's 2-3.  It's not a problem because Ethereum's community don't care if it's centralized, clearly headed by Vitalik and co.  
Bcash/BCH runs their nodes on alibaba servers and they are fine with it.  it's a centralized coin headed by Ver and Jihan Wu.  it's community don't care as long as they can be the next paypal. 
as for Bitcoin, 2nd layer solutions are coming.  let's see then.

To be fair, when asked last week at baltic honeybadger, one of the dev’s answer is basically: we are understaffed and we need more devs working on it.  If you want it faster, participate and code.  No date was given.
So 18 months is probably reasonable.
Less than 10 or 15 people are working on lightning?  Whole 200bn bitcoin rests on their success.

Being immutable, secure and unhackable are not absolute and perfect claims.  They are falsifiable/scientific claims and they can be disproven.  Who knows if crypto is really secure? (Problem of induction)
When it comes to store of value, tenure and the Lindy effect is irreplaceable. Sure altcoins can have better tech, faster transaction etc etc.  **Running time** is something that cant be beaten, other than an even longer track record. This is extremely important when storing family fortunes, but maybe not in coffee money.  Running 24/7 without hiccup for 8-9 years.

Bro, why the heck are they selling another token just to scale?  Copying from lightning and just adding a token. They even named it Raiden.  Tokens tokens tokens.
Also, can you point to a use case other than cryptokitties and money syphoning (ico) that is working on the ethereum platform?  Tens to Hundreds of millions per project.  Where is the product? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:31:18
You don’t get what bitcoin is then.  You dont know what inflation-proof, censorship resistance, stealth and trustless is.  
We already have visa and paypal for fast payments. 
I’d be happy if banks actually use xrp, but they don’t and won’t ever. It’s a scam and yeah, we can make money off of scams.  I might buy some if that makes me more bitcoin.  
I just hope they won’t release the rest of the 100bn xrp and print more soon.  It has now exceeded bitcoin’s total market cap.  Amazing feat.

bcash argues that you can accomplish what LN proposes through gigantic blocksizes and datacenter nodes instead of home computers.
tasty transaction fees all going to miners instead of the 1 or 2 per month or per year from lightning users. in just a few years, transaction fee revenue will already exceed miner reward.  in 2032, 99% of all bitcoins would've been mined.  Miners know that transaction fees will be their bread and butter pretty soon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:28:09
a strong, real-world use demonstration of lightning will force them to upgrade.
segwit blocksize upgrade is underwhelming.  I think a common notion is for a thing to change the status quo, it has to be 10x or more better.  segwit without the upgrades it allows is not too spectacular, in layman's eyes.

Yeah  there is a decay. if you look at antminer projections from last year, it was double that, but value is now 16x ytd so its still profitable.
The good thing is, hardware is stuck at at 16 nm at the moment so antminer s9 has been the “best” for a while.

Bitcoin can pretty much co-opt any altcoin innovation, and that makes altcoins irrelevant in the future. Privacy coins like monero for example will become obsolete when bitcoin adopts it’s own anonymity implementation.  
One thing that altcoins can’t do is prove that it’s more secure than bitcoin simply because bitcoin has an 8 year running time.  How else can you prove security other than running time?  For majority of life savings and hedge funds, it’s bitcoin.
So if an alt can provide faster transaction and cheaper fees than bitcoin, then maybe it could play a role as you say.   That is if lightning network and rootstock fails.  We will have to wait and see.

you can demonstrate that coin X is faster than bitcoin by simply making a transaction.  you can do the same to demonstrate how cheap it is to transact.  centralized coins with very light userbase/transactions are more efficient, specially if they don't care about bloating their blockchain and maintaining decentralization.
However, the only way to demonstrate that coin X is as safe and as secure as bitcoin is to overtake it's running time of virtual uninterrupted security \(more or less 9 years\).  How do you do that without bitcoin breaking down completely or... a time machine.
would you rather place your life savings, family fortune or assets of a huge hedge fund on a 1\-2 year old blockchain \(most of which have already encountered multiple hacks\) or the 9 year old Bitcoin blockchain?

The firm belief comes from it’s unique qualities as a decentralized, unconfiscateable, uncensorable, permissionless, immutable, stealthy, portable, unfakeable, secure, guaranteed limited, cross boarder store of value and means of payment.  You can literally leave your country overnight with all you assets intact.  This is pertinent to venezuela, argentina and now turkey.
Tldr, secure, portable, stealthy and limited vs a growing network that’s even gaining acceptance from it’s fiercest critics: banks and financial institutions.

Because what do you need a slow database for(blockchain) when it doesn’t offer censorship resistance and immutability?

as long as bitcoin doesn't have a fatal flaw/hack, it's gonna be a thing.  It's gonna be a huge thing and there is no need for pro-active user initiatives to "promote" it (like needing to buy coffee and pizza with it even if 2nd layer is not ready yet).  It only needs to exist, survive and developed.

you can spend some on goods, not buy and sell whole coins or chunks of it.  
I can see using it as a payment system as long as it's easy to "top off".  I've never been confident with trading from strangers until bitcoin.  spent thousands without worrying that I'm getting a fake or charge backed.  
The OTC exchange I've bought from at 2600s is now asking to buy from me at 4k. Lol.  It's pretty liquid now.  a good store of value that's fast and requires less trust.

Watch jw weatherman’s latest youtube video about dollar cost averaging.  (edit: he is against it, see video below, and he makes sense)

Again, how long? If you cost averaged instead of multiple bulk buying 4 months ago, you'd have lost money.  General trend is upwards, and fast.  
Some dollar cost averaging is good but spreading your 200k over 6 months wouldve been disastrous during the 1300-now range.

Did google, amazon and (insert successful stock here) follow a moore's law growth?
Just curious.  
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:07:13
Kidding. Don't mine.  Buy some and hold tho there could be a pullback. No one knows.  
Just never sell at a loss.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:00:54
I only started bitcoin 3 months ago and I already got 3 trezors, 1 ledger and 2 cryptosteels.  catch up bro. haha.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:57:27
at this point in time/history, if the power or internet breaks down, it's the apocalypse.  you need bullets not gold.

Order trezor from amazon asap
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:07:11
Trezor plus hidden passphrase seems "unhackable".  Weakpoint is that i eventually have to give instructions to next of kin on paper.
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:27:14

Yeah.  We are all part of a huge choir and need some contrary views.  I am compromised.  I'm mentally all in and think bitcoin is for real.
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:52:06
Are you still buying at 2500+ prices? Just curious.
@_date: 2018-10-23 07:14:21
I just wish the owner of 1 million btcs could be more composed and less of an asshole.

Your instincts are correct.  Stay away from altcoins unless you are willing to gamble.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:53:06
Wondering where is he now. Made some very positive bitcoin comments a while back
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:45:04
There has to be a sweetspot between spreading your purchases for a good average and taking too long that you get left behind with price spikes like this. 
After all, we are all here believing that the general trend of bitcoin is UP.
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:21:09
I don't think this is true. Bcash is their defacto currency of choice there. No one is celebrating the 3200 "bcore"
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:27:59
Im asking what is the optimum rate at which we dollar cost average when bitcoin price rises are steep and in an upward trend more often than it drops down.
If we have 10 k.  How many incremental buys would beat a single 10k purchase in light of bitcoin's average daily/weekly/monthly price increase?
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:51:32
Bitcoin lives in 4k land now.
@_date: 2018-10-12 08:30:40
do you really think that is what they'd do than to acquire more btc as it's being adopted by more and more countries?
destroy the currency and bitmaim instead of earning more and more of it?
seems plausible.  again, if they do that, the rest of the community will abandon double sha56 algo for a contingency.  no more china problem.
btw, Modern Investor doesn't know what he is talking about.  It's ridiculous how many misconceptions he holds despite being in investor for a long time.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:47:32
They would but they also would want to include other necessary fixes so we dont hardfork everytime there's an issue to be resolved.  
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:55:01
do it.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:25:51
thanks for sharing:) I guess I'm not too late.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:30:33

@_date: 2017-08-04 14:13:27
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:00:35
only problem I encountered is that you'd have to choose between using btc and availing of your tax rebate.
and they also would rather use credit cards because of the language barrier. less hassle.

@_date: 2017-08-25 14:29:10
can anyone explain this to me?  starting/processing a full node takes months to a year???
Either Luke-Jr is too paranoid or this is a real problem that we must deal with asap.
I guess, this is where the existence of Bcash can help us.  unless we really are ok with centralization/miner only nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:36:31
because people are still trying to buy.  unlike you, we are not yet set.
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:39:54
It's gonna craaaaash. just bought more.

So I guess we are going to the mfmoon.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:48:05
so there is a plan to reduce the blocksize smaller than 1 mb?  I didn't know that.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:18:00
I'll start buying small stuff at atleast 2x... then more and more when I'm comfortably ahead.
bought my cryptosteels a while back.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:02:41
Also a passphrase.  Even if they get my seed, wallet still hidden.
Unfortunately i have to leave a complete easy to use backup, with instructions for my next of kin in case i die.

@_date: 2017-08-17 06:04:38
Passphrase.  Simple words, names that you can easily remember. It's not stored in your trezor (supposedly).  You should have used them from the very start to hide all your transactions in case of breach or government/tsa inspection.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:43:16
I hope he knew what he was doing.  And the possibility that electrum and electron were using the same wallet file.  
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:27:37
u/PeterTodd:  "Technically speaking, lots of things, such as a lack of replay protection, inability for lite clients to detect what chain they're on, the missed opportunity to fix various protocol misfeatures, and of course the fact that we have no reason to think doing what's a combined 8x worst case blocksize increase is particularly safe. Far better to let segwit activate and analyze the effects."
They want to play it slow and safe.  See what segwit and lightning can and can't do.  Hardforks are  a big deal and other issues/fixes should be done with it so we dont fork everytime an issue needs to be resolved.
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:15:48

Maybe leave some money for a massive dip.  This is just for psychological reasons.  A regret protection. otherwise, just buy:)
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:17:24
the fork is alive and kicking.  could give us headaches in the future. 2 bitcoins is 42,000,000 coins.  A new investor could simply choose the "cheaper" coin as it's more appealing.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:19:08
1)I think you should create a new clean seed with Trezor so your seeds won't be in a file like in electrum. (tho you might use electrum hardware mode with trezor so it's prolly the same.  I just use the trezor software itself.)  
2)  Make use of a passphrase from the very very start.  that way, all your transactions are hidden from plain sight.  then put some btc on your open, surface account on trezor.  that's the only thing visible under duress.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:38:35
I on the other hand will get out of alts as soon as I break even in BTC, or at least usd value.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:06:03
That's why a successful trade could be detrimental in the long run.  Compels us to do more and Our luck might run out.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:00:19
But we used bitcoin to buy those alts, so we still lost money.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:27:36
you're back.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:36:46
No one ever knows. Just buy some now and buy again in a few days.

The answer is google to incorporate their own centralized 2nd layer solution the same way all gmail users have google drive, docs and photos.  Google bitcoin wallet is the key.  Imagine sending and receivinf btc by literally just emails.  
This is for the masses( and for smaller amount of btc) we still have our trezors and own wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:07:21
If bitcoin falls, gbtc and bitcoin etfs fall with it right?  Or do they have shorts/insurance against it? Sorry, unfamiliar with securities and stocks, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:53:10
so how is this side "blockchain" protected from hacks and fraud?
or have we accepted that this is vulnerable to attacks therefore this is only coffee or light shopping money?  They said this network can be open for years... how is it secured?
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:24:43

@_date: 2017-08-15 14:30:07
priced at 4100;)    Loss aversion means they prolly won't sell at a loss, which should be good.
@_date: 2018-10-23 08:46:19
the insult and block two punch combo against otherwise polite (at worst, slightly snarky) comments is just too temperamental for me, In light of said person owning 500k-1m btc.

IOs wallets have been good to me. Passed 20 btc on jaxx, none lost.

No it provides a base layer. Larger market cap, less volatility. Besides we're not all buying lambos at the same time.
It's just too early. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:35:39
how can everything go wrong? aside from ww3 nuclear holocaust,  massive solar flare or a zombie apocalypse, all of which affects our lives outside of bitcoin anyway.
Even if the blockchain is compromised, a hardfork with improvements could still be done.  a massive bump, but survivable.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:23:50
Hard to predict when they stop being excited.
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:02:21

I agree... that's why they should never get a vote or a say on the development.  bip9.
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:01:41
It should not be a surprise if the 2x hardfork gets majority of hashrate.  it IS a miner cartel takeover/coup. majority is signaling right now.  2x will have a huge hashpower.
 
This is a test for bitcoin.  should we blindly follow hashrate and chain length, whatever the rule change?   what if a conglomerate of banks and countries came up with a hardfork with even more hashpower.... blindly follow?
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:03:51
good point.  Bitcoin holding for 8 years is against common investment strategy.
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:50:11

I bought at this price yesterday. Lol
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:48:10
what does it mean that the block was "created".  and why do miners have an option to mine empty blocks.  
Does the blockchain create a block later to be found by miners through brute force?
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:19:26
Aaaaand it's gone. J/k. Im genuinely unhappy.  I will be buying more soon.  I want my 2800 coin prices back.

it's easy.  I suggest you go to the Hitbtc.  slightly lower bid for your bch but only 2 blocks confirm.  
sending to bittrex or bitfinex means your selling tomorrow. 20 block confirms.

@_date: 2017-08-16 16:18:42
FUUUUD.  Tho this is the kind of Fud that might drive price up to secure coins on both chains.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:52:13
I hope you didn't sell all your btc.
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:08:58
True, but the point is: if Bitcoin fails, then no other cryptocurrency can ever be trusted with someone's life savings.   People will always point to bitcoin's failure despite having the highest hashpower and security.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:17:57
I guess it's a different mindset. You earned usd and that's your target which is fine.  I'm into growing my btc so spikes like this would've lost me money (btc if I slid out into fiat).
Trading pros could do well. I'm just gonna go long on this.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:45:31
Yes i've been using diff addresses.  It's the spending i'm worried about.  Specially when we land on the moon.

How hard is cracking a passphrase?  Let's say your seed was compromised, but your account is hidden in a passphrase, it's still pretty safe right?
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:27:23
hahaha.  if bitcoin ever makes it,  still very early.
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:47:51
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:18:13
you should also have a trezor duplicate at home right?  the odds of your home and bank burning at the same time is pretty nil. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:54:18
good thing 99% of my btc is on a passphrase...  I do have to leave some on the surface account for credibility.

tho I can see the value of trading (buy low sell high) when your only concern is making some USD.  the price trend is usually up so it seems safe.  Hard to go wrong as long as you never sell at a loss, right?
opportunity cost of losing BTC value is tremendous tho.
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:55:49
help me understand how blocks are created.  when is the moment of creation?

But in the end, they'd all want max profit.  Ex: Preference for maximized On-chain transaction fees could be shared by any miner, regardless of hardware or country.  
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:49:12
If it's still really the early adopter stage, maybe we should set thing straight.  For example we clarify that "wallets" don't really contain bitcoins but just keys to access, monitor and move them within the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:48:36
Yeah, spend some if you have to. Enjoy life.  
@_date: 2018-10-30 07:15:51
This is my go to examples for digital scarcity.
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:14:17
As long as youve already moved your btc to another safe wallet (new seeds), there's no way you can fuck up.
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:47:26
I misunderstood then. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:49:22
Are you still buying above 2k?
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:25:41
totalitarian governments can't destroy bitcoin, only slow it down for their subjects.  and centralized versions of bitcoin/crypto already exist.  
and yes, why make a centralized bitcoin when you already have Visa?  
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:59:14
try to sit on it for years next time.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:11:08
True. But who are the others? 99.999 of the population dont care about bitcoin. They think it's a ponzi
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:57:35
good thing they liked each other.  
Heart was snarky with the other guy (Daniel Krawisz)
@_date: 2018-10-02 20:57:24
People live, people die.  Hodling is relative.  If you dont need the money now, keep it/some on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:00:02
no prob.  
I redid my whole wallet with completely new seed so my default/open wallet is clean (some btc for credibility).  all major transactions/btc are in passphrased account.  
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:35:21
If this bitcoin thing ever takes off and becomes 10% of financial activity in 10-20 years, we are still very early at 2017.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:38:03
how do you know this?  anyway we can know their pay out schedule?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:13:34
I don't think so. Lol.
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:30:53
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:48:53
True.  Visa is just too good for consumers as it is so it may live side by side with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:03:35
You dont hardfork "just in case". You hardfork when you have to. Zzz.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:31:53
selling at 100x is an extremely smart thing to do.  Bitcoin/crypto is just an anomaly.  not selling at 500x or 1000x, 2500x is insane.... but that's what I'm about to do in the future (while taking some profit here and there).
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:18:45
Just search on youtube those keywords. One of the most important videos ive ever watched.
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:43:15

@_date: 2017-08-13 07:17:12
Shit. Thinking of buying more:(. But correction might happen.

Why not Both.  But stocks are ath.  One thing is for sure, put some. Money on bitcoin (10%?).  
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:46:55
maybe this is for when LN is well established and polished.
but at this stage, Most btc transactions are speculation/savings, not retail transactions for coffee and pizza.  We'd have to use the blockchain to move large amounts of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:19:19
How? Another hardfork?  It would be hilarious.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:03:02
Hahaha. So this gif has been around for a while now. No wonder so many are sick of it.  At least now it has a segwit rocket upgrade.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:21:04
thank goodness.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:44:58
if the price go up when it doesn't halve, it sure as hell would when it does in 2020 (every 4 years).
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:24:07
That too but we don't know when that is.  People tried to wait for another crash at 3k. And yet here we are.  
Up to you. Waiting could be good.  I'm ready for it as well. Buying more.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:52:42
I mean, why no next day roll out?  it's been said to have been in testnet for while.  It's activated on Litecoin for months...

What is it?
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:15:00
Don't worry, people like me who held off buying thinking it would go down to 2400 are essentially on the same boat.
Again, buy the dips but don't sell.  Some traders hate it when we say hodl but man, this 3200 jump is a good case study.
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:37:48
also treated as potentially hostile.
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:04:13
Is it as volatile as when you first got in at 5 and 10 usd?  Seems like there is an inverse correlation between volatility and large market cap, right?

So was your first account banned and you're back for more. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:43:53
yes play around with smaller amounts to get comfortable.  you can make as many wallets you want. just remember them and try to use strong passphrase (4 simple word strings or something)
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:47:21
Thanks.  I hope you get some btce money back. There seems to be hope.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:11:46
thank you.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:04:17
you can't fuck it up if you write it down on paper.  you have to try it to learn it.  why not send like 10 usd worth of bitcoin? worst case is you lose 10 bucks. but your money can't just disappear from the blockchain.
Educating ourselves is worth more than that and could save us a lot of money in the future.  Only way to learn is to actually use it.  It's safe.
no rush.  just try it when you are more comfortable.  I've moved a lot of money from different wallets and passphrases.  You gotta trust the bitcoin network.  Why else are we in this if it can't be trusted?
Just write things down clearly.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:05:01
I have no idea about Dash.  it has a different system. some sort of proof of stake in parallel to mining.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:16:30
so a block is not anything definite, but something that matches a criteria (with a number of 0's)?
so is difficulty=number  of 0s required? thanks
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:41:31
At this point, putting in money that's less than what you can afford to lose, but still significant part of your networth will be a source of regret years from now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:33:45
exactly.  these "bitcoin goes to zero anytime" people doesn't bother to give scenarios why they think it's probable.
@_date: 2018-10-17 19:43:20
watch a Seifedeen Ammous video on his book the bitcoin standard. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:53:54
You can make 50 bucks per bitcoin you already own after we are allowed to trade bch.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:34:11
Can you look for me and tell me about bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:26:54
to the Moondials lol.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:10:49
That expenditure of energy is what makes it secure. It means for people to attack it, they'd have to set up an infrastructure to specifically attack it.
Imagine if seti at home/folding at home or amazon/google servers could be reverted to bitcoin mining anytime.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:23:39
Why do people's trust and adoption of bitcoin follow a technology rule?  Behavior is very different from chip manufacturing right?
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:38:57
I don't get why it's only 2x.  price is 10x.... is it compensated by lower difficulty?  but blocks are too few in between.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:12:35
Can you send me some mushrooms? hahaha.
not yet a bitcoin millionaire.  I'll fuck with people's minds then.
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:14:45
Great story bro,  a healthy amount of bitcoins you got there. Working on getting to 100. Might take a while.
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:35:12
 Going for 4k We are really doing this right now huh?
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:12:17
My bad.  I guess this is closer to Clam Coin.

I hope it works out for all of us;)
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:12:39
wow. glad you got it back.
@_date: 2018-10-06 09:15:50
Yes.  
But long term effects might be bad particularly the fact that the firm who holds the etf is one single entity that is no different from mt. Gox.  Or any exchange that can be hacked or harrassed by governments.
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:14:08
Bip9 right?
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:10:50
can you state your non-trivial scenarios to drive bitcoin to 0?
world power grid and internet collapse aside? alien invasions and nuclear holocaust mad max style scenarios are out too right? maybe satoshi going insane and selling his 1m coins to 0?
If 900 shitcoins can't die and still hold value, how can Bitcoin with it's community, investors, brand name and infrastructure go to zero and yet 900 other shitcoins survive?
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:57:12
I'm ready... and I'll still probably buy more.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:56:31
Is anyone going to gain access to your trezor anytime?  at worst, Trezors are still great home wallets, perhaps not too secure when traveling.  We aren't even sure yet.
again, everyone should be using passphrases anyway, even for the very first account.
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:27:17
I guess the banks are creeping in
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:54:07
because you would need gigs per block  to match visa and it's not enough.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:57:25
counterfeit money works that way.  some people accept it right away.

will ETF price depend on Bitcoin performance?  Aside from tax issues, what else?  thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:34:13
Sold my gtr a year ago. Money sat on savings. Then used it to buy btc. Profit.
You can still do it;)
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:25:58
Question is: at what point would you cash out to diversify?  If your crypto is now 80% of your net worth, might have to buy some gold, stocks or good old cash for safety.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:24:40
I'm talking about common phone calls.  heck we often prefer texts and forego voice calls altogether if we can get away with it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:58:28
How can a seller drive up a price?
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:53:22
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:55:03
it's a combination of things.  If say, we can create gold in a lab, in a molecular level, then we wouldn't be willing to give it the same value as the natural occurring ones.  Same as lab diamonds.
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:08:33
New money from bcc fanatics coming in and we taking it.  But that was fast. Slept for a few hours then boom.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:11:43
Very good and quick so fat except when wallets of pumped coins suddenly go into maintenance when needed.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:27:43
Not sure about that. I'm pro bitcoin segwit/core but mining cartels are strong. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:21:14
Yeah. It's mini gambling
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:48:13
Secret Passphrase. Duress passphrase
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:34:55
I too refuse to buy dips. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:05:59
Hmmm, holding for 5-10 years is not that quick.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:59:32
How about nodes?  what are the min. requirements?  
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:40:51
Because of transaction spam?
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:06:01
Your transactions will be displayed in perpetuity in your trezor.  So in cases where you are held at gunpoint or asked by your parents/ the government to show your trezor, they will see eeeeverything from the very start.
Unless you hid your accounts in a passphrase. It's a neat feature that you better learn to use as early as possible.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:05:36
Sorry kidding. Bad joke
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:12:14
I never predicted any price:)  but yes, a huge price drop is very possible.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:18:03
aside from a nuclear holocaust and large solar emp burst, how?  If 900 shitcoins can exist and can't go away, what more for Bitcoin?
The internet suddenly disappearing?  Then we need guns and ammo cause it's the end of modern civilization.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:22:49
What if it recovers?  
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:36:11
the currency to sell/buy bch is btc so I guess yeah.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:11:50
turning point for bitcoin.  It has to be demonstrated, for the second time In a few months that it can't be counterfeited by simply duplicating the blockchain with  contentious hardforks.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:28:17
Consider it as your 25th word but this time, not stored in your device. Completely new, independent wallet. You can make as many as you want. You can use your non passphrased wallet as a decoy.
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:28:44
Thanks for the tip.  Mine will arrive soon
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:21:32
I guess I've been watching Andreas Antonopolous a lot.  Watched 40+hours of youtube videos on bitcoin and the fact that even mainstream financial institutions and governments are taking notice.  
I'm still betting 20% max so being wrong on this is not fatal.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:15:35
Do you still buy?
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:07:45
I'm treating it like any other shitcoin.  people will pump and dump it.  I might ride the wave if it's extremely cheap.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:28:07
I just realized that perhaps  the real electrum and electron cash uses the same space to store wallet. Dat files. 
On osx, i had to rename my old electrum wallet so i could input my seeds on electron cash. It is a clone of electrum after all.  I don't know if this is relevant to you. Perhaps you are viewing the wrong wallet? Overwritten?  Maybe electrum is mistaking your electron cash wallet?
I assume you wrote the seeds to your new btc wallet. Perhaps delete all wallets on your pc and recover seeds. Might be cleaner.
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:53:08
Haha.. looks exactly like today's posts.
@_date: 2018-10-06 09:21:10
Point is to keep blocks as small as possible.  This bitcoin project is decades to  hundreds of years.
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:18:01
Bcc can stand for bitconnect, or bitcoin cash aka bch.  Just check their real names at exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:57:34
Isn't it barter/swap if it's treated as a commodity? Coffee for your magic internet money?
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:42:57
I will literally give away money to strangers if this happens.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:07:24
I came in late but my confidence in btc is quite high.  I'm putting in a lot and I could lose a lot but I gotta take risks in life.  This is looking more and more a sane bet to make as time goes by and social awareness goes higher.
@_date: 2018-10-12 20:08:31
This is not ethereum.  Scaling? We got a token for that! raiden!
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:28:17
If you are sure, are you shorting it?  I think some exchanges are allowing that.  You should.
@_date: 2018-10-30 07:15:46
This is my go to example for digital scarcity.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:33:02
Electrum will ask for the extra word although I haven't tried it yet as I don't want to expose my seeds unnecessarily.  perhaps try to ask r/trezor or r/electrum?  
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:01:46
That’s what I’m saying, bitcoin will still end up driving metal and mineral mining.  Bitcoin mining will literally be mining (and construction).
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:42:15
Yeah, if you need it, then sell. Gotta pay for living.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:05:40
I hope they wake up and get into it.  Scariest thing is that the majority of regular folk don't get into it the same way we never got into video phone calls despite the availability of the tech.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:51:37
Congrats then :D
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:48:30
thanks for the insight!  I guess people like Andreas Antonopolous started "preaching" at around 2013 and may instill some confidence on holders back then.  Or atleast give non-techies/non-cypherpunks like me an understanding how big this thing is.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:03:58
it should work on wallets that use bip39 and 44.  perhaps electrum?  
I haven't tried it yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:01:14
It's not made by 1 company?
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:04:21
fair enough.  we just have to call out the "it can all go to zero anytime" people.  Heck, if Alt/shit coins can't even go away, all 900 of them, with crappy blockchains and low hashpower, Bitcoin is here to stay.  Whole internet disappearing is a global catastrophe.  It's the end of civilization as we know it anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:38:58
At your own risk.  Trading often doesn't end well.
Easy to sign up to Bittrex and bitfinex. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:13:22
Couldn't they have written/coded a difficulty adjustment in? like right off the fork, 5% difficulty?
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:35:41
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:33:49
That was a very rational reaction at that time:). 
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:36:57
I'm not so sure that's why I'm putting in just 15-20% of my liquid assets. But I'm cautiously confident and optimistic.  If bitcoin fails,  I'm glad I still took a shot at what seemed to be a great technological advancement. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:37:38
Yeah, if the internet breaks, it's the apocalypse.  we need guns and ammo and our neighbors will try to eat us. bigger problems than bitcoin transmitting blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:06:55
let's send him some love, folks,
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:30:08
Check his tweet about a 30 dollar bitcoin hack that could destroy everything.  I dont think he retracted.
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:06:33
Yeah, but it won't destroy bitcoin.  As long as Lightning network takes off, we can do well with less hashpower anyways. If it's a dud, then we'll have to join the bigblockers.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:20:13
I bought 118 worth at 2600. Not sad about it. I supported the network.  I bought more during that time too
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:59:21
Yeah, the bear market from '14-'15 looks looks miserable for a hodler.  It must've been very hard to resist selling when the price spiked from that slumber.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:24:18
When you check coinmarketcap markets, top volume was korean exchange half a day ago
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:56:30
my take away:  Either Satoshi is dead, or he is a bitch (he could have burned his keys but he didn't).
seriously, he could  fuck all of this up.  I hope he doesn't move his coins for 20 years.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:54:06
Go to the asks side(right). Sell at last price. Set to max amount. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:12:27
Great presenter. i wonder why D'Angelo turned his back on bitcoin and even made some cryptic doomsday message on twitter recently.  Sad.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:49:20
some of my btc are on altcoins.  I know I won't lose USD value if I'm patient, but BTC Value has gone down tremendously and will likely to go down even further if bitcoin shoots up more.
opportunity cost.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:38:50
Glossed over that part.  in my country, exchanges have a 100usd premium over most international/american exchanges.  Same as okcoin in china perhaps.

@_date: 2017-08-17 07:30:52
If true, and they actually get a hold of your trezor, then yes.
But the passphrase created a whole new wallet that they would have to bruteforce, giving you time to at least move your btc to another safe wallet.  It's an extra layer of protection.  
If your passphrase is secure enough, it might take them a billion years.

I guess a good analogy for this is the US military size and budget.  It’s excessive and most of these military assets never see battle.  Some could say having that many planes tanks  and carriers and nukes are wasteful.
But it’s the show of force that’s effective and keep the enemies at bay.  It’s like the bitcoin hashpower. Come to think of it,  It’s actually a form of proof of work as Andreas points out. Excessive Military might and opulence,  serves a purpose.

“That's still completely different from the "its a store of value because its rare" argument that gets applied to "bitcoin is digital gold".”
Completely different might be stretching it a bit.  China and russia hoarding it while jewelry demand has gone down doesnt support that thesis.
Former goldbugs in the gold business disagree with you so “completely different” is hyperbole and overly dramatic.  You know it’s not true.  At best we can say that gold jewelry use-case is a hybrid.  A feedback loop between scarce store of value and decorative wealth display.  
No one would wear or hoard gold jewelry if it grew on trees.

Dollar Cost Averaging should be checked against the average daily/weekly/monthly/yearly growth of bitcoin.  If not, you are averaging into a loss in bitcoin holdings.  We all are here believing that the trend is upwards and to the moon anyways.   
I think one redditor pointed out that buying 250 usd a month will never get you 1 btc, ever, at this rate.  or something to that effect. (can someone do the math at which rate we should dollar cost average and stay above bitcoin growth?)

then, for security during border crossing, you turn off the passphrase feature,  your passphrased wallet will then be hidden but will not go away.  It's safe.
Ideally, you should've used a passphrase from the very start so your default trezor wallet will not have logged in all your btc transactions open to inspection by government/homeland security.

“Fiat currency issued by a government will always have value because even if we were a completely barter economy we would have to exchange enough goods and services to collect enough currency to pay our taxes.”
Like the venezuelan bolivars huh?
Bitcoin is sound money as defined by austrian economics. Like gold, It’s money voluntarily adhered to by people, without the need for government coercion and force, Or demand for taxation.

The difference between this and pyramid scams is that the person at the very bottom may not gain more value as the early adopters did, but they'd have the ability to be their own bank.  A store of value that is borderless, portable and can't be confiscated.  Limited and deflationary.

bro, Ethereum only proved that it can make clones of itself.  Even if we grant that it is a new way to raise funds, there are more scams/vaporware than legit projects.  
even if we agree/prove Ox works, all it does is reshuffle ownership of tokens among owners.... it doesn't solve a real world problem, outside of crypto.

trusting that amount to be accurate \(assuming it's electricity cost\),  it also involves mining equipment that unleashes it to magically appear, out of thin air, without paper trail or noise of accumulation  and fabrication.
It would take months of stealth and conspiracy, that then could be subverted by an emergency hardfork.  bitcoin crashes, but survives.

@_date: 2018-06-06 20:01:51
Correct me if I’m wrong, It’s not completely useless as it is counted towards the overall hashpower/difficulty adjustment, right?  Difficulty is security. Invalid blocks are part of the design of electricity expenditure in exchange for security. In reality,  a valid block is just as “useless” as the invalid blocks anyway as it’s sole purpose is to secure bitcoin and nothing else.  (People who dont understand this idea keeps bringing up “useful” algorithms like protein folding or primes)  There is no waste, but intentional expenditure.
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:02:45
Off to sleep. Just look up gold volatility in the 60s and 70s.  Bitcoin volatility is due to it’s tiny market cap.  We are still very early.  
I can’t argue with you on utility. I already showed that gold utility outside of store of value/speculation is 10%. 
If professional speakers and economists on the subject can’t convince you, I’m not gonna do a better job. Best of luck to us.

yes, but the way blockchain is marketed, they seem to imply that it can exist without decentralized, selfish crypto rewards (the evil, wasteful bitcoin)
blockchain alone, without the limited token reward(cryptocurrency) that incentivises independent miners to commit electricity/money to secure it is just an inefficient, malleable database.
Private blockchains are useless and pointless but companies are spending millions on consultants on how to "blockchainize" their businesses. No working products so far.

a bit too long so I'll leave it at this (I give up when I have to defend/explain the notion that having a new asset class/monetary system is more valuable than videogaming). 
 Just one note on bitcoin mining being "blind".  Actually, it's designed to find a block every 10 mins thru difficulty adjustment.  There is definitely a block to be found with regularity that's why we can point to a pretty accurate schedule on the halvings and the last satoshi on 2140. 
There is no need for prospecting. the protocol assures it.

===But mining companies always do a prospection mission to find out where the gold is and always use the most efficient methods to mine. There's no such thing with Bitcoin mining, except for the use of smaller chips, which have a physical limit.
doesn't change the fact that tonnes of material need to be extracted, moved and processed (bitcoin's invalid blocks).  The trucks  and heavy equipment are mostly there to move valueless material, to get to the small amount of gold. even if we imagine there is an asteroid with gold deposits in it,  time and resources is still spent on moving all the excess material to get to the gold.  this difficulty and scarcity is replicated in bitcoin.
==That's entertainment, which is actually beneficial for people. 
I'm all for it, I love gaming too.  But I'd argue having sound, hard money to avoid another Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Greece, and now Turkey and maybe Italy.  protection against hyperinflation and financial crisis is more important than entertainment.  This is gold that you can teleport and subdivide easily, can never be faked and double spent.
==freedom from central banks yes, but who owns the means of production to where the bitcoins will then flow?
Initial distribution is a problem yes, just like any money.  main difference is that bitcoin can never be inflated.  your savings can't be slowly stolen from you through quantitative easing.
your transactions won't require other people's permission... and 3 working days too.
===Current fiat system is mostly electronic and cashless, except for some other third-world country.
banking infrastructure, buildings, datacenters, banking fraud, hacks, bailouts have costs too.  and again, gold mining, storage, security and transport is costly as well.

The invalid mines blocks are artifacts/consequences of the pow design.  There is no other alternative to brute force trial and error other than... magic.  Which makes this extremely secure and immutable.
(Invalid blocks are akin to the 99% waste material in gold mining.  All the digging just to get the yellow metal.  They are necessary byproduct to extract gold.  It’s a difficult process and if it were easy, gold wouldn’t be valuable/hard money)
Whether expending this much electricity (which is roughly the same as video gaming at the moment if im not mistaken) in exchange for freedom from central banks, imf and inflation is worth it, wed have to wait and see.  
Not to mention the costs of the current fiat system and gold mining/security is also substantial, but can be potentially replaced by bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-06-23 19:59:44
hey, I'd just point you to this 
It's the value proposition in a nutshell.  It's basically Gold that is stealthy, teleportable, unconfisceatable, microdivisible, unfakeable, readily verified to be genuine and guaranteed to be limited.
You can't buy coffee yet with it (not for long, lightning network is being worked on), but as a stealthy store of value (secure container) and transactions over 100 dollars, it already is very useful.  not to mention the deplorable hyperinflation conditions in Venezuela.   I could get kicked out of my country and leave overnight and not have to call my bank, only for my assets to be frozen.
**before you say gold is "useful" (you did), Gold's industrial use is only less than 15% of supply  and that includes the electronics use which didn't exist 50-60 years ago or so. for thousands of use, gold had no non-decorative/display of wealth use. some primitive dentistry? sure.  Most gold is used as a store of value/jewelry. Scarcity is the main value driver. If we value metals on usefulness, copper and steel should be 100x gold.
just watch the video if you have time, If you remain unconvinced, then I am not sure what else might. at least you know what you are rejecting and are fully informed about it.  maybe it's really not for you. at the very least, you can better argue against it.

The whole point of pow mining is proving that value is being infused into the bitcoin network thru electricity expenditure.   It has to cost something.  (In a sci fi world where electricity is free, then proof of work may no longer make sense)
Proof of stakers dont get that.   It’s a promise to be honest when it cost them next to nothing to acquire those coins (miners have to spend and pay for electricity that could go to waste if it’s proven they cheated).  Proof of stake also can’t prevent attacks, only punish after the fact.

It’s about cost and sincerity.
It’s like a bouquet of flowers from a florist,  a nice car driven by a car salesman, a well suited tailor.   Bitcoin mining has to be costly to be secure. Once mining is subsidized by something else,  more people are incentivized to dabble in mining without going all in.

because it's always good to measure your "investments" against the  value if you just left it alone in bitcoin. opportunity cost of missing out on bitcoin gains.  you may have increased in usd but lost out in btc.

 Imo, people who bought in at sub 1k  and never bought again still missed out unless they risked atleast 15-20% of their networth.

Or perhaps there is a phase where the opposite might happen.  Maybe if the value keeps going up, holders will just keep buying stuff as they get cheaper and cheaper.

@_date: 2017-11-05 06:20:26
here is my layman's understanding, 4 months in:
1) Perhaps people know things cost energy and assume that the benefits outweigh the costs. (check the other thread we are discussing about the costs of traditional banking and gold, both of which bitcoin is attempting to compete, (even replace) with).  Hollywood blockbuster movies "waste" tons of energy too, although perhaps cgi is solving many of that.
we need to study this.  perhaps we need to end gold mining as well as it is environmentally destructive/toxic. no one bats an eyelash.
2) It is still very early in the game and development and the ratio between energy and volume is not 1:1.   Lightning is a second layer  on top of bitcoin that basically takes 1 on-chain transaction and slices and dices it to multiple off chain (virtually no energy requirement) transactions before being settled back into the blockchain. digital IOUs.
another is what the other bitcoin clones are doing which is just plain and simple brute/bigger block size which bloat the blockchain and require more internet bandwidth.  
as I understand it, none of which directly affect/require more electricity cost. Bitcoin scaling is not an energy issue. It is pointless to compare transaction per kwh.  **electricity cost is mostly driven by profit and bitcoin price**.  perhaps it's impossible to untangle the electricity consumption with bitcoin price, but for us to "solve" this, it's important to keep the record straight.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:24:14
you get these problems when 
1)people are actually using it
2) your devs care about the long term health of the blockchain... Unlike some blockchains like ethereum that is soon to be abandoned for "proof of stake" as it's bloated into an enormous size just for short term scalability.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:22:33
Then that makes even less sense why people choose it over bitcoin.  Can’t be faked,  portable and immutable ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:41:25
well,  conventional wisdom is to stick with 5-10% of your liquid assets.  I kept buying till 25% -30% (I still have fiat on an exchange on standby-I know, bad idea) .... but now bitcoin as grown, it's now more than 50%:(  
Let's see what happens a year from now.
@_date: 2019-02-14 06:20:17
It’s not that you used your brain,  it’s what you came uo with.

btw, what happens to online brokerage accounts like tdAmeritrade when we die?  do they simply call tech support?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:51:39
because when it stops giving people enormous returns, it will still give them an uncensorable, stealthy, immutable, fast, secure store of value and payment system.

"2.3 Intrinsic Value
As the enabler of the PDUP, Bitcoin is therefore intrinsically valuable. BTC helps its owner get paid, cheaton his taxes, shield his assets from a messy divorce, gamble, engage in underage drinking, defend his lifeand property, get stoned, and get laid.
For those suﬀering from ransomware or capital controls, PDUPs may be the only payment option. Victims of Venezuelan hyperinﬂation [9] (to say nothing of the entire slavepopulation of North Korea, or the women of Saudi Arabia), may ﬁnd these “illegal” blockchain payments tobe the only digniﬁed alternative to suicide."

@_date: 2017-11-16 16:50:18
assuming you have a large amount ready depends on how tiny you make your purchases.  If you do 100 usd a week, at bitcoin's recent rate of increase, you will never amount to 1 bitcoin. the rate of increase is too high. dollar cost averaging as suggested by some people here relies on bitcoin crashing like post mt gox and '14-'15 bear market for it to be beneficial.  Maybe they are right.  who knows.  
I'd lean towards lump sums.. maybe break your lump sum into 5 chunks and buy weekly.
If you are not in bitcoin when you have fiat ready to invest, then you are effectively shorting it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:46:03

Satoshi can cash in, yes.  But he’ll have to do it slowly to not crash the market, thus getting less value.  And he has to do it stealthily as people are watching his wallet, again, if known to move, would crash the market.

but no reason to restrict it to your original investment.  don't fall for the "house money" mentality.  It's all money.  your money.  take out more, or less depending on your analysis.  
you are effectively shorting bitcoin and that's not really a great idea;)  I might do it when it reaches 10k.  perhaps 10-20% and then wait for the dip.  I have no idea what'll happen.

The other example is ecuador with 16 mn people.  Perhaps it’s better as they atleast have 99% electrification.  (Without checking the actual
Math of the motherboard article, who knows if it’s correct)
One thing to think about if it’s not yet mentioned (I assume it already was), is that current electricity usage is not required to run the network.  Bitcoin will run for a smaller fraction.  
What drives the electricity is the profitability which is voluntary and the free choice of individuals.
With this in mind, it too is manipulative to say that “xx number of kwh is required for each transaction”. 1) not required.   People just like mining and they can do what they want 2) current bitcoin transaction volume is **very** low and It is still being worked at.   Lightning network, if successful, along with mass adoption will drive down the per kwh  ratio with transactions. Transaction number doesn’t have to correlate to electricity use.

Someone who wants to use the network.  Bitcoin is useful even if doesnt raise in value.  Stealthy, portable, uncensorable store and transmitter of value that can never be confiscated.  Borderless and inflation proof.

In casinos, gamblers treat their profit as “house money” therefore taking more risks with it.  I think money is money no matter how we got it. If you feel it’s no longer safe, why stop at your initial investment?

My friend is doing the same: buying a small amount to “test” it out.  
Honestly, what’s the point?  You could see the charts and know what it did a few months ago.   That 500 could’ve 5x’d instead of that 20.   I jumped in with guns blazing and could’t be happier.

But there was a clear sell at 7300-7500 so we could rebuy now and still profit.
I of course was too chicken shit/lazy to do it:(

Just make your account on bitstamp and follow their instructions. Also coinbase. Takes a few days to be approved so just in time for your funds.
No one knows what will happen to the price. Some say it’s too steep now.  Goodluck.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:18:50
It’s deflationary in practice where people lose their keys and access  regularly during this early phase. It will be truly deflationary when we start dying off in 2 decades locking bitcoins in limbo forever.

I kinda shorted bitcoin by keeping a pretty large amount in fiat (about 10% of my current bitcoin value).... and now bitcoin is back to ATH.  we can never guess the price.

Because if it isn’t anyone with a AA battery can alter the blockchain.  
We have to weigh the bitcoin costs against goldmining costs, storage costs, shipping costs, infrastructure, bank and employee costs, etc etc.  Bitcoin replaces all these.

nothing will go wrong as long as they don't sell (long term).  I was under the ATH for 2 months but kept buying.  Dollar cost averaging but with bigger chunks.
as long as the bitcoin protocol is not broken/compromised... it's a safe bet.

You sell some bitcoin/fractions of it in the hopes price goes further down so you can buy more.  Ive only lost bitcoin that way.

@_date: 2017-11-30 08:53:06
the pin shouldn't matter if you have the seeds.
try the seedwords again, carefully... maybe on electrum.org wallet.  maybe play with derivation. did you use a passphrase maybe?

because 50-100k per day new users  weren't there yet 4 months ago.  It's getting crowded (not in the bigger scale, just relative to what it was early this year).  9k will be cheap next year as demand grows.

You know what’s priced in?  Whales dumping their cheaply acquired coins.  
You need to account for the stock to flow model too which heavily attributes price to flow.  It can be falsified in a year so we’ll see.

Not a good time for that. This is a crucial moment in bitcoin price growth.  
Only money we can afford to lose, But if we lose it, it has to sting or we might be missing out on an opportunity of a lifetime.

It’s still experimental so there is some real risk involved.  I do have the vast majority of my net worth in bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:26:57
if true, this is fraud. I hope it's shown in coinmarketcap.

If you don't need it, and it won't break you if it temporarily crashes, why take it out?

@_date: 2017-11-26 09:26:28
I guess it’s also good to hear dissenting opinion. Bitcoin doesn’t make any sense as an investment. How is not taking profit after 10x even 100x make any sense?  Only in bitcoin.

glad I was greedy enough to go at it when it was 54k ish.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:08:20
haha... same with me when I started at the ATH at 2900.  was very expensive at that time.  
also, I just got into stocks.  my portfolio is like less than 1% down for weeks now and I'm feeling down about it.  while my btc holdings are more than 100% up (averaged as I still bought recently).
@_date: 2019-12-30 03:41:09
Litecoin is the first “bitcoin can’t scale coin”. The original bch.
It’s also the reason why people like me didnt get into bitcoin at 900.  It added to the confusion and made bitcoin seem less scarce and copyable to the masses.
It’s effect is indistinguishable from any other shitcoin.  Same as any scam. And yeah, charlie lee cashed out already.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:24:40
You will if you wanna sell high and rebuy low. Taking advantage of dips.

dipping that low to 5.5.  (what do I know) but people want as much btc to "double" their coins during the fork.  no sense in selling before.
No one in their right minds would dump btc over this sham coin with 2 part time devs and fake nodes housed in Amazon servers.... although perhaps people will also not rush to dump ALL of their b2x as pumps from Ver and Jihan could hike the price up.  
safest is to wait and see.... but definitely looking to dump when price is good.

So was the halving priced in back in ‘15/16 before the 2017 bubble?  Cause the market was well aware of it and sentiment is identical today.

@_date: 2019-12-31 01:16:51
There are atleast 2 blocks since 2017 that had more than 12.5 btc fees.

@_date: 2017-11-03 13:26:44
If btc loses, it means that bitcoin is not secure, decentralized and  is open to takeovers.  It’s a failure and maybe it’s time to abandon.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:40:14
still some uncertainty.  maybe in a few more years when wider adoption occurs.  why not stick with 25% for now? It will be 50-60% before you know it.  happened to me.

because at the very core, bitcoin is a network of storing and sending money securely, **without permission**.  the very last person to buy in may not earn great returns, but would still benefit from virtually instant transactions of value that can never be confiscated, stealthy and can be brought with them anywhere in the world.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:53:18
first of, no one knows what will happen to the price.
but one thing to think about is that we've come up real high pretty fast so yeah, there *usually* is some pullback.  In fact condition yourself to suffer another 30% crash. Maybe it shoots up even more?  who knows. If you are ok with that, and just hold, then you will probably be happy in a few months.

No. When it comes to store and security of value, TIME in is irreplaceable.  8 years and running 24/7.  No one will put their life savings on anything less tested.
Plus, if bitcoin fails/breaks, the whole of cryptocurrency can never be trusted with huge value again.  Payment channels for coffee and loyalty tokens? Sure.  But never huge fortunes.

I think the op is talking about the era of bitcoin global usage.  Meaning its value is no longer volatile and no longer expected to explode higher. 
It means the people will still be incentivized to invest in businesses if the returns exceed bitcoin price/value appreciation, or simply to get more btc.
People will still invest.

You already acknowledge sovereign money tends to get inflated and debased cause of “govt liabilities.”
People wont voluntarily choose money that slowly evaporates over time.  No one chooses to lose money, even through legal, surface taxation.   Heck, the fact you file tax deductions is an example of this. Human nature,  game theory,  or just common sense. They will pick digital gold.  Uninflatable, uncensorable, unconfiscateable, stealthy,  fakeproof and portable.

this.  when the whole world uses asics for some non-bitcoin but useful reason (like global heating for an iceage), the reward goes to the miners who take the extra step to expend extra energy dedicated to bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:54:56
interesting.  makes sense if difficulty is static.  There will come a time when that asic heater will become a liability IF it's not as efficient as an ordinary heater.
I don't see that many people using old asics for heat tho.  But that's prolly cause of the insane noise more than anything.

although centralized systems will always be more efficient (in exchange for security and immutability),  it's still an unfair yardstick, cleverly chosen to mislead people, since Bitcoin solely relies in electricity for nearly everything it does.

A financial adviser who uses the word retarded.  Lol.
New forms of money need to go through many stages first before it’s market grows large enough that the volatility plateaus.  It first has to become a collectible, speculative object and a store of value.  
Look at gold volatility in the 60s/70s.  Compare bitcoin’s market cap to other assets.  It’s in its early stages.  
Now explain how an immutable ledger is bad compared to money that can be printed easily by governments.

Sorry, when it comes to security of the store of value you entrust your whole networth with, the first and the longest running,  the one that hasnt been hacked will always be trusted.  No amount of theoretical claims and innovation can supersede actual running time. 9 years.

I don't know how they secure their blockchain but without a token (for example: 12.5 bitcoins per 10 mins plus transaction fees) incentive that attracts miners and expend  millions of dollars per day worth of electricity, it can easily be hacked and altered, just like any database.

Of course, there is still a small chance that bitcoin can have an unrecoverable bug.  Who knows.

transaction fees.  we already saw a few blocks where the mining reward is more than the 12.5btc block reward.  in less than 6 years, it will be likely that transaction fees will be the main incentive for miners.

All of your 3 points miss the whole purpose of the expenditure of energy in bitcoin.
The energy cost is mostly for security, not for function or transactions.  In theory, all bitcoin transactions can be run by a couple or a handful of computers with little electricity cost, But there is little security.  That is what shit/altcoins are doing now.
Efficient asics/miners are only relevant against other miners not using the latest and greatest machines.  It has little effect on the environment since there will always be an arms race.   Efficient machines can also be bought by potential attackers/bad actors so it all boils down to electricity consumption. 
What can be done for the environment is using sustainable energy sources such as more hydro, geo,  nuclear and solar power plants.

transaction fees being high (in the recent months) had nothing to do with miners needing to pay their bills.  they were never mining at a loss, even in the recent crash (maybe if it stayed at 6k for a prolonged period, maybe).  they can still make money even with zero fees for the 12.5 btc reward, specially when it was 15-19k. (see empty blocks).
transaction fee is all about block-transaction congestion (be it artificially/maliciously inflated, normal or inefficient usage).

Not familiar with PoC yet but I'm sure we will hear more about it soon enough if it gets traction.  just saying that storage is a universal, readily available resource, unlike sha256asics.  unlike poC,  when you want to mine btc, you commit to it with dedicated hardware, and no turning back.

(I may have jumped a step so sorry for the confusion)  I'm guessing (assumed) the reason you think this is that they are mining at a loss.  If you agree, then my point in showing the chart is that people did mine at a loss for over a month with bcash.

Peter Todd on what's wrong with 2x:
Technically speaking, lots of things, such as a lack of replay protection, inability for lite clients to detect what chain they're on, **the missed opportunity to fix various protocol misfeatures**, and of course the fact that we have no reason to think doing what's a combined 8x worst case blocksize increase is particularly safe. Far better to let segwit activate and analyze the effects.

When asic mining becomes useful (hypothetically, there’d be a mini ice age and eveyrone needs heating), the block rewards still go to people who are willing to “waste”and expend energy on top of their heating needs.  
Bitcoin rewards go to people who dedicate their electricity to mining.

Are you talking about wallets with less than a dollar of btc again?
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:45:14
one of the arguments by Jimmy song is, whatever the method, be it staking or storage or hashing, people will always expend resources to get as much of the reward as possible.  Production of hardrives just obscures the cost and presents unknown attack vectors, aside from electrical usage and infrastructure required.

The software can be changed to address the offending bug hence creating a new chain (old chain abandoned) I think it happened a couple of times before in the very early days.  
Your funds will still be on the new fork. Forks happen all the time btw for no good reason (altcoins like bitcoin cash etc).
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:02:40

@_date: 2018-02-14 18:36:51
let's pretend that btc adopts POC.
problem is, with 12.5-15 btc reward every 10 mins (for btc example), people are incentivized to invest on more storage hardware to get that reward.  People won't stop at old harddrives. It will always be a competition, and there are already established datacenters that could decide to join in.
  as for purposed/useful algo or data, I hope my understanding is correct but I'll try: it could be beneficial, but it will just increase the competition and consumption since everyone is incentivized by a: the reward b: useful data.  
an analogy.  a gun in your home is very good for your security IF you live in a gunless neighborhood, specially if no one else has access. In a hunting town, where everyone has a gun, suddenly your pistol is no longer relevant.  you need more guns, with more power.  
It's an arms race.  a useful system/algo will mean that for a blockchain to be secure, you need more of it since everyone is running it.
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:58:32

Infinitely divisible is the opposite of infinite supply/inflation.  1 bitcoin would still increase in value, meaning the holder of a single satoshi would have more buying power instead of less when more people want more bitcoin.
no additional satoshis are created, just divided further.  micro/subsatoshis will be "created" as a unit of measure but it will only prop up the value of a satoshi.  this is the complete opposite of inflation, adding more bitcoins on top of the 21m.

One thing to consider with PoC is that more companies can invest on massive data centers that may or may not be used for securing blockchain/burst.  Meaning lots of competitors can shift between poc and general data storage at their leisure. Amazon can join in with minor tweaks to their infrastructure. 
Bitcoin is secure because the hardware that is used to secure and attack it is dedicated.  No one has spare asics that they can summon to attack the system.  They have to commit to it.  That’s why bitcoin just can’t/shouldn’t switch to “useful” algo.  Hardware has to be dedicated to make it costly to attack. 
Just a thought.  Maybe poc/burst doesnt have attack vectors similar to bitcoin.  Maybe it’s not vulnerable to 51% attacks.  If it’s good, maybe btc adopts it.

If that's what you can afford, that's good.  Always good to have more bitcoin.

energy is not the only metric for carbon footprint tho.  and that is the whole point right?  environmental concern.
We have to measure metal and mineral resources in hardrive production (mining) for example. The point is, If the reward is 12.5 btc,  people will spend up to (hypothetically) 11 btc worth or even more to get that reward, no matter which method (electricity expenditure or hardware investments).
But hey, let's try it.  let's see how it does securing 100-200 bn worth of value.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:38:45
thanks for this.  learning something everyday. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:48:31
 the point is to spend money thru expenditure of electricity, making it HARD to acquire and corrupt bitcoin.
Maybe it works in small isolated cases.  But to intentionally make mining useful?  I think it won't work as intended.
When mining is subsidized with side uses (such as heating for example), then serious miners would have surplus investible money to BUY more hashpower.
They will keep investing money on electricity to get more BTC rewards and we still end up where we are today.  A network that can be mined by dabblers and opportunists will not be secure.   The Double Sha 256 algorithm POW is intentionally "Useless" for anything other than securing bitcoin.  
Imagine if there is an ice age and everyone now wants a miner since it's now cost-effective. I have a miner, your grandparents have miners,  Government has miners to heat their cities,  etc etc. every one has miners.  The mining difficulty sky-rockets requiring even more hashpower.  Who do you think gets the BTC mining rewards?  The miners who SPEND more than their heating costs to edge out the regular folks who just "dabble" with mining.   The difficulty always adjusts.
Bitcoin rewards go to people who intentionally SPEND money on electricity.  you can call it a waste, but for those who understand the importance of inflation-proof,  hard, immutable money is, it's a legitimate use of electricity.
TLDR.  Difficulty adjusts  and the btc rewards will go to miners who intentionally "waste" electricity which secures the network.  Incidental benefits, maybe, but not intentional.  Maybe Iceland can heat the whole nation, let's see.

haha nothing bad will happen.. just a slight regret that you didn't sell at a higher price then buy back in...  But we don't know the future, so just sit back and relax. buy more if you have extra funds.   I bought at 2900 and it stayed at around 2500 for a month or 2 then dipped to 1800, then went 4k.  I still bought more at 4k+ and will buy more.

honest question, prior to the dec 22 crash and then the jan. follow up crash,  were you still dollar cost averaging during the incredible bull run or did your weekly buying stop?  wasn't there a time where the bullrun makes small weekly buys counterproductive?
and without this crash (hindsight is 2020),  dollar cost averaging would have been a losing stratedy (before this recent massive crash).
of course now, you are proven correct, but that also means we believe the market is predictable in that it will always crash and never achieve the point of no return s-curve exponential growth.

Yes, look at gold in the 1960’s -70’s.  Btc is less than 5% of gold market cap and liquidity.   It’s easier to manipulate and prone to wild swings.
It’s unconfiscateable in that unlike your bank account, it can’t just be frozen just because you attended the wrong rally, or when the government needs more funds (cyprus, gold in india for ex.).

@_date: 2018-02-20 17:08:10
Uhm. This is still a dip.  A safer dip.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:00:51
good explanation.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:54:17
Wow. Et tu bloomberg? FUD
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:07:37
true.  same with us speculating on altcoins.  we know they are mostly shit, but there could some money to be made.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:11:18
I'm gonna have to ride this wave down. Until the bitcoin blockchain itself is broken, will buy more.
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:24:16
Ok thanks
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:19:34
Again if you dont need the money right now, dont sell.  Not unless the bitcoin protocol/blockchain is broken/hacked.  
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:20:31
ah strawman. to be expected.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:17:57
I predict Bitcoin will break 5k in a few hours.  Typing this Oct 11 2017.  
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:50:27
Do you hold other assets like gold to this standard?
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:58:25
that's how people miss dips.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:23:12
it is unstable, but probably not THAT unstable.

@_date: 2017-10-14 15:26:17
I used Jaxx a few months back with pretty large amounts and never lost a bitcoin.
sure it's buggy and sometimes it doesn't sync, doesn't display dollar value but never lost anything.
can you check the addresses on jaxx that you've sent btc to?  in Blockchain.info? you should be able to see your btc there.
also when restoring, make sure you've spelled the first 4 letters accurately.  1 wrong letter and it's a different address.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:36:21
they bring in USD.foreign currency for what other people see as mickey mouse mooney. mining will never be banned.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:28:39
Fine.  Can you point to the particular problem concerning bip39?  I vaguely know funds could potentially be misplaced, something to do with the derivation path.  Misplaced, might take time to find but not gone forever, right?
As for support in the future.  I'm quite sure that devs will keep this in mind as seed word keys account for a huge number of user wallets, specially new ones. Backwards compatibility.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:00:00
Why not?  Anything i should watch out for?  I plan to park some of my money on amazon, google and netflix instead savings account.  My btc holdings is enough for now.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:23:07
Bitcoin's year to date is 7-9x.  Just something to consider.   You may be hopping off at a critical moment.  But I too don't want any debt.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:08:45
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:04:01
ok.  ignore that occasional profitability parity is achieved through lowering/adjusting difficulty until gameboys can be used to mine it.
let's keep the eye on the ball: 1) low hashrates can be supported indefinitely by a community.  2) majority hashrates don't always attack the minority and leave it alone 3)  again, will you blindly follow the higher hashrate blindly?  this is the point of this subthread.  we are not talking about the merits of bcash.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:58:16
Good for you. Safe trade if you are after cash. But for us bitcoin hoarders, could lose us some coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:17:10
Bought at ath 3200 3600 3700 3900 4200. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:40:49

@_date: 2017-09-14 20:28:37

Traders/People just need to take profit. Not everyone hodls.
Normal.  
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:10:01
It's not a requirement to keep the network running.  Bitcoin can run at a fraction of the current hashrate.  
Maybe it will taper down as mining reward goes down.

@_date: 2017-09-14 17:51:22
no matter what price point you bought in, unless you sold at 4k upwards to buy low, we all incurred an opportunity cost/loss, that includes the whales and long time bitcoiners  who got their hundreds/ thousands of btc cheap.  
 I'm not a trader so I don't play with my money.  we hodl, well be fine.

1 datapoint.  
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:49:56
agree.  coming from a high of 5k and staying above 4k for a pretty decent amount of time, I Think this price is pretty solid. specially in the bigger, longer scale.
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:23:21
I think andreas antonopolous pointed out that for you to have scaling problems, you’d have to have scale.
Not sure of the stats but do you think litecoin would be just as fast if it was to deal with bitcoin’s transaction volume?
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:23:04
So bitcoin will still be run by banks in the end.  I'm not saying you are wrong, just that it ends up the same.
Not the end of the world. Regular people are still benefiting from it's deflationary aspects.

And then of course trezor or ledger nano s.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:17:43
coinbase wallets are not seen in the blockchain as they are in coinbase's internal wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:38:27
IOs/android wallet for ease. Mycelium or greenaddress
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:06:02
Specially after a massive crash.   Buying at 19k, all in would’ve been a short term disaster, long term inefficient allocation.  
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:04:27
So you don’t need more storage as competitors build their own storage farms?
Mining’s hardware requirements is to storage’s electrical requirements.

It's unfortunate that the chinese people are caving in and selling.
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:13:31
everything is a bet.  not buying now will cost you if there is no further dip, buying now will cost you if there is a dip.
the same people who say:  past performance doesn't guarantee future performance also insist that historically, there are huge dips after great gains.
buy some now, then buy more later.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:33:55
maintaining these machines making sure they are clean and always running, apart from the heat and noise also takes a toll.

Bizarre thinking about compromise when say, sending people to mars.  Should we appease metalworkers/cartel if we already have more advanced composite material?  How about appeasing the oil cartel by using old rocket technology if we already have a better fuel source?
Bitcoin should be treated the same. Only the best solutions.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:53:46
first rule of bitcoin:  nobody knows what will happen to the price (apart from the general trend that it goes up).
Buy some before the fork so you have coins on both chains.

@_date: 2017-10-10 20:39:35
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:34:36
Unless you bought a shitload at 900, as in comparable to the money you want to invest now (atleast 45k) you would rather miss the trip completely rather than accept that you have to purchase a more expensive ticket?  
assuming you believe btc reaches the very probable 10k.  is 5k still too expensive?
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:24:27
strictly speaking, it's not cold storage.  cold addresses are generated offline from virgin pcs running an ubuntu software from a trusted source.
that's why I still don't have one and I'm sticking to trezor. haha...  my paranoia level is not enough for it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:27:57

Atleast you didnt sell at 7k to rebuy at 3k as some probably did.
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:33:59
He’s saying you will get your chance and we have no idea what happens to the price. My brother was fomo’ing real hard at 17k.  Cussing why bitstamp doesn’t approve him.
I doubt he bought the 6k dip.

This is not going to end well.
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:17:33
good for you, although, if you can afford to buy in bulk/higher amount, do so.
at 300 a month, you will never reach 1 bitcoin based on the average monthly/yearly growth. I could be mistaken and perhaps bitcoin could crash down to 1k again where this amount is tenable.  
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:58:36

Bitcoin being digital gold is enough for me to be happy.  Being an established asset class means it can reach 10s of thousands. Mainstream adoption as a payment network is the gravy on top. Granted, it's a lot of gravy.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:05:15
It kinda is as far as btcc is concerned 
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:38:26
not really, just go side by side with it... or at the very least compete with gold as a store of value.  Mainstream consciousness too... not necessarily mass adoption.
I'd consider the equivalent of what electric cars/tesla is today a success.  not mass adoption, but pretty mainstream.  drones too.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:59:50
well, sept 30 is the deadline for the chinese exchange closures.  maybe spread and cost average till then.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:41:55
Bigger problems than losing temporary access to your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:13:18
I won't complain if it does go to 20,000 but it would seem like a failure.  10 years is a long time and it would still be a fringe investment if it's only 20k by then.
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:39:50
I dont think they are after or care about consensus.  They are after control.  Bch showed us that they are willing to mine at a loss for over a month for political/future gain.

The ledger nano s is probably easier to stick up our butts than the trezor.

Is it me or you are in the same boat as anyone who has bitcoin who didn't sell at 4900 to rebuy at 3200?  
Lost opportunity.  I didn't as well.  Better safe than sorry I guess.
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:59:44
I’d take math and computational power over tradition then.

@_date: 2017-10-06 13:45:16
better safe than sorry. alternative scaling like LN should be pursued first.
how big do you think blocks should be in order to match even half of visa scale? do you think 200mb blocks are enough?

The amount of bitcoin is not changed.  the means to which it can be subdivided and used is just increased for convenience.  but yeah, for accuracy:  "It has the opposite of the **effects** of inflation".
when I say prop up, I only mean an increase in the network effect as people with smaller/tiny capital can now participate.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:16:19
dollar cost averaging.   At this current bull market, you will end up with less coins if you split your buys into very small amounts.  perhaps a bigger chunk like 1500 or something.
me, I would wait for a dip and buy a whole or half coin... then buy more and more.
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:50:41
OP, this is the correct image.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:08:54
buy some now, buy some later. or just buy.
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:16:54
I think Pow change is disastrous for everyone. In that scenario,  new pow chain is an altcoin that will have to fight it's way up and claim the name bitcoin.  Old chain will still exist so it even has to compete with that along with 2x who by then might have taken the btc ticker.
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:15:27
1.  Small blocks=full nodes are easily set up by individuals=decentralization.  This is part of what they want to take away from users.
2.  Alternative scaling solutions like lightning network are being looked at as there is no way simple block size increase even to 200 mb can compete with visa anyway.
3. There are more fixes that also require hardforks and they’d have to be coded in along side blocksize increase (assuming it’s necessary) to not waste opportunity.
4. Needs testing so it can’t be done anytime soon.
5. They could still go on with their “official” NYA s2x fork because core is blah bla blah.
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:07:33

Large blocks will outpace technological advancement (17% per year) making it harder to set up full nodes for people without ultra fast(expensive) internet connections.
Full nodes is what protects us from miner takeover like 2x and it's exactly what they want to remove.

If all you're after is more usd, then your strategy is ok. We are for increasing our bitcoin holdings and that kind of trading can leave us with less bitcoin when the price spikes up like it did from 2900 to 4k+

pretty complex and I've been using computers for a long while now.
but your method doesn't require a printer so I might try this.
I actually have the ubuntu cd package from bitcoinpaperwallet.com.  ran it on my gaming pc (pretty high end last year) and it gets stuck on the loading screen.  probably not for everyone.  Not to mention I have to clear my printer's spool/mem right? and will it even print?
(can I just risk it and do it on my regular pc?  I think we can lower our level of security at this point in time?)
I stuck with the Trezor and I recommend ios wallets to friends.  I think paper wallets is too esoteric and might turn off new users.

the bitcoin protocol says you do.  you alone can move it around, even "destroy" it by sending it to a burn address.

somebody photocopies the whole ledger/book so you also have some money on the photocopied book.  you don't have to do anything tho you might want to sell the copy coins before it loses too much value.

the goal of a lot of people here is to accumulate as many bitcoin as possible while it's "cheap" with the assumption it will be 10-20k usd  plus months or years from now.  
so score is number of bitcoin.  (you can short it and buy more when it dips or invest in altcois... both could lose you bitcoins if price suddenly spikes up).
I don't like to gamble so I just buy and hold... and buy more during dips.

buy before the fork and move your coins to a wallet you completely control, where you have the private keys.  basically wallets that let you write 12 or 24 word seeds.

are those machines still viable at this level of difficulty?

that's just a time stamping service isn't it? It think companies have been doing it for years.  and you can always do that with bitcoin mainnet and it's more immutable.  also, does that require a smart contract? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:55:07
If bitcoin is adopted, then tx fee income will rise from the current 1-3btc per block. It's possible that the next 2 halvenings will already place tx fees higher than mining reward.  Point is,  looooong before mining rewards are depleted, miners will be incentivized by fees. Under 12 yrs for sure.

guys, help me understand:  bitcoin already is 6x this year alone, 10x 12 months ago.
If bitcoin just doubles yearly, that $50 will be: 50k in 10 years.  If 4x a year, the yearly average since inception: 52 million.
These numbers are of course absurd.  so does that mean that the growth rate we have now is as good as it gets and bitcoin has gone "parabolic"  or are we filthy rich, we just don't know it yet?

Because this upgrade is poorly thought of and untested.  It's also not badly needed if not for  the coordinater transaction spams. **It also wastes the opportunity to include other important fixes that also require a hardfork** and circumvents the over 100 developers who made bitcoin what it is today and putting in the hands of a couple of has been devs under the influence of miners, corporations and businesses.   See: NYA backdoor agreement.  It's a powergrab disguised as an upgrade.

It's just a good marker/frame of reference.  so you will know if you've  kept up with the rising btc price.  100 usd a week means you will probably never, ever  get to 1 btc.... or .95.  or 1.05.

The fact is, bitcoin always functions for transactions over 1k usd.   Even during peak mempool, It’s already useful for institutional settlements, and large value transactions, maybe not for coffee.  That alone makes it better than  gold.
Lightning and other layer 2 solutions will fix the pizza and coffee problem, and more.

The last bitcoin buyer may not have 2x or 10x but they will have a stealthy, immutable, uncensorable, unconfiscateable, uncounterfeitable, instantly verifiable, instantly tradeable, teleportable, (again) limited non-inflationary store of value.
Andreas Antonopolous has tons of videos about the value of holding bitcoin and yet he seldom (never?) talks about the bitcoin price or gains.  that's why I'm in bitcoin even if I can never see 20x ever again.
I can get kicked out of my country and I don't have to scramble to arrange for my bank to move my assets.  I have my trezor, and if I have to, memorize my seed words.

There could be a sidechain where you can lock up your satoshis for an even smaller denomination.  
It’s not inflation since these “altcoin” corresponds to a tied up bitcoin value.
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:14:42
///after all, who would spend their cryptos when they will be worth more tomorrow? but if noone spends the cryptos, what's the point?
I dont know man,  people die.  We need to spend our wealth.  We need to eat.  We can’t live in or ride our bitcoin.   We cant take it to the grave.  Gold has been a store of wealth and worked for thousands of years. Fiat is a recent invention.  
Once you have your 10-20x it’s easier to spend. At least that’s true for me.  Heck I’ve spent some bitcoin and i havent even made 3x.  
Also,  Are you saying gold is not a good store of value since it’s hardly inflationary (slow inflation).  Worked for monarchs for thousands of years. Working for the vatican.  Besides,  i can keep inflationary fiat on the side.
I dont know, it’s kinda hard to choose evaporating wealth over deflationary or limited store of value.

Out of 1k coins, you could get lucky with 1 or 2.  That is bad probability.  Chances are, you have a shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:26:18

---you absolutely got it right, gold is a means to store wealth. this is a completely different use case to what many cryptocurrencies try to deliver, which is a new, disruptive form of payment.
Isn't the main reason for this is simply physics and the limitation of this store of value?  It's hard to carry gold coins around and securing them involves more money and risk.  you can't also pay for coffee with a nugget of gold. and you certainly can't carry gold bars around safely to pay for a mansion.

If you only look at bitcoin as a payment method like a paypal, then sure.  In fact it probably may not beat paypal.
But bitcoin is more than that.  It’s a new asset class. With no ceo to arrest or manipulate.  It’s gold that you can teleport and hide.  
No,  bitcoin’s 8 year running time can’t be beat.  Time and it’s high value bounty is the only proof of security.

Typically most ios/android wallets (even trezor which i highly recommend) will give you a new address once payment is received.  You can keep reusing old address or use new one.  Funds will all go to same address so dont worry.
This is a standard feature of most wallets so dont be surprised if it gives you a new receive payment address.

We may have to be careful how bitcoin is advertised.   Saying it's a great investment reeks of ponzis and pyramid schemes.  We know it's not a scam but we have to acknowledge it grows the same way: network effect.
The safe way, although less spectacular way is andreas to really just enumerate why this is one of the best inventions in the last hundred years.   Being your own bank, anytime and anywhere in the world.

@_date: 2017-07-14 09:31:40
I meant that being a miner is likely to compel them to do what's good for their self interest, which is bigger blocks, and  possibly reject segwit and off-chain scaling.  Being a bitmain-hardware miner incentives you to reject segwit that fixes asicboost.
So even without explicit coercion from bitmain/jihan/ver, they would align and block vote somehow.

I agree. one has to prove that the lightcoin price change was truly "random" or by pure chance, the same way coin tosses and roulette tables are.

concerned that ETH and ETC could happen.  ETC is not going away.  If this happens to Bitcoin, even if the fork is tiny, we can no longer advertise it as "there can never be more than 21 million". at least not with a straight face.  It's a very important definition of bitcoin imo.

It might weaken and have a momentary setback or could spike up again.  We can't know for sure at this time.  But I'd have secured a good amount of coins by then.  If it forks, I'd have coins on both chains, one of which will be crowned THE bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-07-21 08:12:45
It matters.
how much btc you can accumulate now dictates your future wealth.  If I had 200k to invest and btc is at 1500 rather than 3k means I'd have double networth 20 years from now.  butterfly effect is huge if we really think btc is going 100x.

"&gt; I bet you the the market swings that we have seen of billions of USD in market cap are not even millions."
I just addressed this wild assertion.  
as for the old Ponzi accusation.  Bitcoin value is derived  from Network effect.  Are all network effects scams? and do you really think stock prices are fully dependent on the company's actual profits and not on the speculators who buy into it's shares?
Bitcoin is a great technology for value transfer and storage.  How else can you instantly send a 1m usd value in 10 minutes, without permission from 3rd parties, 24/7, extremely secured and easily confirmed,  to anyone in the world?  Is there any other financial technology that's even close?
If that's not valuable to you then I got nothing else.  you win.

@_date: 2017-07-14 18:57:14
sadly, this makes a lot of sense.  Banks will may use ripple, but probably no this publicly traded ripple.  Same with the ethereum enterprise where they will just use the technology.  
even if banks use xrp, they'd prolly use it as a token, perhaps a fraction of an xrp for each transaction. 
But shouldn't they make that clear?  atleast ethereum is open about it's private eth network for big companies.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:11:08
even if they honestly signal for segwit itself, they are still intent on the 2x hardfork in 3 months. instead of waiting and seeing if segwit+lightning is enough to handle the transaction increase and delay the blocksize increase until it's absolutely necessary and thoroughly tested.

I really do believe in the tech so much that I think speculation is ultimately "safe" if they don't panic sell at bubble bursts.  One thing we know for sure: the larger the market cap, the less volatile it is.  Bitcoin is more stable now than ever (ok, that price spike last thursday was pretty huge).

Ponzis, pyramid and bitcoin can be put under the network effect of wealth creation. The difference is:  the very last person to sign up for bitcoin may not lose (or gain) value, but benefits from the borderless, uncensorable,  stealthy and portable store of value that bitcoin provides.  
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:29:17
I would still use bitcoin as store and  instantaneous transmitter of value, even if it didn't have the potential 2x-5x gains in a few years. across boarders, without anyone else's permission. money that can't be seized from you. 
I only need it to be stable enough as a store of value.  with enough market cap, it will happen.  It's gold that you can teleport. or I wish it is.

I may be using the wrong term as contentious may mean something else technically.

@_date: 2017-07-16 12:39:53
I just got in at the wrong time (ATH).   I'm still glad I'm in the space tho.  I could have went on with my life ignoring bitcoin like 99.99 of the population.  Also, note that for a month, BTC hovered at 2600ish so dollar cost averaging would still be "high" at that time.  unless by dollar cost average you mean buy once a month.
I am planning to migrate a chunk of my networth.  I think it's substantial.  should I spread it out over months of dollar cost averaging?  It would mean that I have faith that bitcoin won't shoot up to 3.5k or more when segwit transition is smooth.

If it's demonstrated that segwit can handle transactions without the need for bigger blocks, then insisting on a 2x hardfork is unnecessarily dangerous, and should be seen as hostile by the community.
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:58:03
Sub 2000. For newbie like me who bought a bunch at the 2500 average, this is no longer fun.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:38:42
After the fork,  Be sure to move your btc to it's new permanent address before you move you bch/bcc unto an exchange.  I will probably use bittrex. Never use the original wallet again. 
You seem to be new (newer than me). Best bet is to do nothing. Goodluck
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:04:47
Surprised that's enough to pushback a 45bn marketcap and probably 2 bn daily transaction volume.
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:33:22
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:27:45
80+% signalling segwit2x.  we know that that much mining power is under the influence of Bitmain/Unlimited.  Is that the correct interpretation?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:34:15
Wallet Looks ok but don't do any transactions july 31 onwards unless it's all clear.
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:01:14
the exchanges can decide which one is bitcoin, regardless of quality and knowledgable user  support. (Most users don't spend night and day on reddit/youtube and bitcoin talk)
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:46:16
It seems that they don't.  Ethereum,  ripple and altcoins have billions of dollars on them.  Everytime I bring up bitcoin with friends, they always bring up ethereum as if they are equals, and will surpass bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:50:00
will probably do this.  I Think even at 50 bucks, it will be worth it. 
 thanks
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:17:09
I do know there is no central authority in naming the coins but I think companies like Coinbase have a lot power over this.  
Who gets named Bitcoin/BTC is a huge deal, more than quality of code, to the public.
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:23:36
still not to late:)  If this thing is truly going to take off, still plenty of time to get some btc.
@_date: 2017-07-01 10:47:07
Store of value that can't be confiscated and that is magically portable IS great utility, even if we stick with minimal gains.  Ideally bitcoin should be in all forex exchanges. 
we also know there is much more room to grow;)

If Nchain truly believes Wright to be Satoshi, they'd bring it up. Even his own team thinks he is full of shit.
@_date: 2017-07-04 07:11:02
Is it the same on trading sites like polo and bittrex?  You actually have the btc on standby right?
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:43:24
I've processed a lot of btc over the last month and none took more than 3 hrs even with minimal fees.
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:47:47
Change the units to mbtc and suddenly bitcoin is "cheap".
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:34:13
but it's essentially a traditional bank tho.  I hope the off chain solutions being developed are something else.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:02:21
possibly a buy dip.

@_date: 2017-07-15 10:13:44
Nice bait and switch. Segwit, not segwit2x is supported by the economic majority.   
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:23:02
If the exchanges somehow all agree to "kill" or simply rename the lesser bitcoin, maybe that could happen.  Don't know how this works exactly.  
I think(hope) any contentious hardforker will fail.  we'll be alright.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:28:23
that is a huge statement. and sad.
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:28:55
we have till tomorrow.  this is gonna happen you guys.. and if not, we got a nice price dip to get more bitcoin and bip148 on aug. 1.
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:57:39
I came to the realization that buying the same amount from a drop is more reasonable/better than buying when it's at the peak.  Market cap is higher and it will tend to rise up again.  I'm new to this.
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:04:41
Trezor officially supports bch so watch for their blog post.  
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:26:16
so the most likely scenario is:  Segwit activates thru segwit 2x, bip148 fails, but market/community also doesn't support the hardfork come oct/nov?
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:18:03
I vote for 1500.  Need more coins
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:28:27
Do you still acquire bitcoin now or atleast in the last year?
or are you good?
I just learned that long time bitcoiner Trace Mayer still buys bitcoin and lots of long time holders insist on getting paid in bitcoin?
I figured there comes a time that spending thousand of dollars to add .5% to your bitcoin holdings gives diminishing returns.
But then, if it still has potential to go to the moon/mass adoption, then we can never stop putting money in till little old ladies start using them playing bingo.
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:56:40
Yeeeeessssss!!!! So happy right now. Need more coins
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:43:44
I could use a few more buy dips;)  but ultimately, segwit and the moon.
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:53:21
Until you look at the 2bn daily transaction volume.  Or do you think that is faked?
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:06:34
then no compromise.  only the best devs should work on bitcoin code!
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:48:57
July 31. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:01:24
So no need to move my btc to a "burner" wallet for the fork. Sweet.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:58:04

I missed this guy.  
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:24:09
I'm ready. moved all my btc to a burner wallet.   I will wait and see whether to dump my bch asap or wait for the pump from r/btc.
cheers guys.... 
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:28:25
Being limited, digital gold and being a good store of value was never the the selling point of ethereum.  slightly different.  But yeah, people will still throw money at Bitcoin.  we just wanna make money and high returns.

@_date: 2017-07-25 13:34:31
too many people signed up at coinbase and other exchanges since it was 1-1.5k.  that market cap/daily transaction volume ain't going down that easily.

Download your own wallet with private keys. Buy from Coinbase. Then move funds to your wallet. Ez
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:22:10

as long as there is no permanent split/fork, we are gonna be driving lambos.  I'll be satisfied even if the only usecase of bitcoin is store of value and it's fast transmission across borders.  but we know it will be more.   
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:04:55

@_date: 2017-05-28 14:51:34
You can transform your older btc to 148 by simply transferring it to another 148 wallet right?
should we buy now or wait till bip148 is available? again, this is not for trading but for the long haul.

please tell us what happens when the 2x HF happens and the core developers continue with the old chain.  which one is called BTC?
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:11:42
In the end they are right. Bitcoin, the brand will survive this scaling issue, even if it ends up in the hands of crap developers.  Money can still be made.
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:06:09

Shouldn't we all move our btc to a burner wallet before aug1 for easy management?  That way we don't have to trash our existing wallets+passcodes that are paper and cryptosteel backed up?  Imagine having to rewrite these seeds and pull them out of safes and safety deposit boxes.     
After the fork, return all btc to their secure wallets, confirm, then go to bch chain and dispose of bcc.  Is this correct?
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:04:07
This.   
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:07:05
I get confused.  bitcoin cash it is.
@_date: 2017-07-12 09:29:51
as long as we are clear this is the real reason why miners and r/btc are opposing segwit.   Transaction fees over technological advancement for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:47:50

wondering about the extremely high 88% support for segwit2x instead of the vanilla bip141? perhaps, miners, regardless of affiliation really want bigger blocks (so badly, even coming from inferior developers).  understandable, I guess.

Yeah and btc immutability and it's claim as limited and deflationary currency is thrown out the window.  It's no longer digital gold.  Clones popping up randomly using the same name is not good.  
But yeah, we can't stop altcoins from forking off.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:15:57
I think Tone Vays said something like: If bitcoin fails as a store of value (like gold), no other cryptocurrency will succeed.  I agree completely.  Bitcoin has to succeed.

Could this happen in actual bitcoin/Mainnet?
if so, what would be the real world consequences?
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:52:55

if you are a new buyer, that actually dictates your future networth tremendously.   we could be having 30% more bitcoins if we bought in a more opportune time, like this week.  This scales to our total networth 10 years from now.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:47:02
I think  we are safe from this suicidal ABC hardfork/altcoin right?
although if they truly are suicidal, core BTC will be left with a drastically decreased hashrate.  not sure the consequences of that.  
when they lose money, they'll just come back anyways.

Guys, what happens when 90% of miners went ahead with the 2x fork on Nov?  That is not technically contentious since hashrate is theirs.
what happens to original bitcoin line if we chose to stay? long difficulty adjustments and slow block times.  prone to attacks? etc?
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:59:23
Speculation but ultimately, portable store of value. If it ceases to give us good returns in investment, it can still allow us full control of our wealth. Borderless and can be taken and sent anywhere with internet. It's awesome.

it will most likely be fine.  my only regret is not buying my bulk right now, at the lower price.  in the end, if this works out, we'll be pretty ok;)
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:04:55
Oh. I wont be selling. But i doubt i will forget this that easily I'll always know that i could have had at least 30% more coins if  i bought today instead of 2-3 weeks ago.  Butterfly effect:)

I guess it's safe on a trezor once they support it. Not using the wallet again was for wallets like eletron cash which is a shady ripoff of electrum.

Breadwallet seems to have good reviews. Although i have lots of wallets installed on my phone, I mostly used jaxx for a substantial number of btc and never lost any.  It's a bit buggy for me now but it still works.  I even used the shapeshift function.  Good wallet.
I think phone wallets are very safe.  For long term storage,  get a trezor/ledger tho. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:00:14

True Bitcoin will die but a Bitcoin of some sort will survive.  The Brand will go on.

Scarcity means that current holders will always have The exact fraction of the whole 21 million supply no matter what.  1 bitcoin will always be 1/21000000 forever.  Subdividing bitcoins to how ever many decimal places will still not inflate the supply as far as the holders are concerned.  
Latecomers can buy my breadcrumbs.

I admit, 10% of my crypto goes to alts, ... and I'm ok with losing that money.

I know you are being politically considerate to muslims but jihad is always a violent act/warfare against infidels/non-muslims, and does not deserve our respect, unlike say,ramadan or eid fitr or their other non-aggressive endeavors. Fuck jihad and jihadism.

That's historical revisionism.  Originally, it's warfare, and currently it's still warfare as far as extremists are concerned.  this santized non-violent version is a modern invention.
also notice how non-extremist clerics call for jihad against Isis and terrorists. do they mean spiritual struggle? or is it a call to fight them with arms/force?

If say you already bought 10 btc at 2500.... and ifnow a btc is worth 25k, will not be worth it.  10 % increase in btc not worth another 50% fiat investment.  But I'm not good with math or investing so perhaps I'm not seeing things right.

If antonopolous and other bitcoin preachers are to be believed, we are essentially in a time machine and buying the next big thing, bigger than google and amazon.
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:48:13
It's safe for me so far.  the IOS version that is.  
shapeshift is great.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:39:41
looking at the bitcoin price history,  had I discovered bitcoin during '14-15's bear market, I woudn't have gone in.  perhaps this hype cycle, although costly, is the kick in the butt I needed.

No, second best time was a few days ago at 2200 before the massive spike up.  I missed it:(

Bitcoincash will be a demonstration on what happens to the 2x chain IF it's done as intended, haphazardly and by subpar developers.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:45:00
we failed, boys.
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:54:37
Love jaxx. It also has shapeshift for major altcoins.  
@_date: 2017-06-27 08:59:50
Anyone here actually actually has a btc bought lambo?
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:30:40
My question to you is, are you long time hodlers still acquiring more btc and putting more fiat in btc to this day/recently?
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:25:03
Andreas antonopolous youtube videos. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:04:16
I take it that your confidence in bitcoin is pretty low seeing as you are not incrementally getting more?  hehe.
hoping for the best for all of us.
@_date: 2018-12-30 10:17:56
We have a hindsight genius here.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:32:36
I think i'll be elated enough if it's 100k
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:06:09
I think it's psychological price markers that is believed to influence buyers and sellers.
@_date: 2019-05-24 06:46:02
if if if. If there is a magic machine, sure anything can happen.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:05:16
I just go here and you guessed it: Dota and Bjj. lol.
and r/btc for the fud.
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:45:43
are buying it as backup/duplicate of your 1st nano or is it a 2nd account?
bought multiple trezors.  not sure if I should stick to 1 device (with a clone) since it has multiple wallets anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:18:23
thanks for the link
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:52:32
How would this action be seen by the bitcoin/cryptocommunity? 
Would he incur a penalty in reputation or is this just playing the game?
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:03:46
I kinda went in with all guns blazing but I do have enough ammo for one more fight when btc drops to 1.5kish
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:18:43
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:02:03
Aaand the alternative is to ban money completely?  
Ban transportation?  
You folks still dont understand that hard, sound money is needed.
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:58:13
Why hasn't this been posted on r/btc who claims to be uncensored?
@_date: 2018-12-30 10:23:49
Looks like a dystopian movie
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:13:20
There are a few youtube videos of michael
Lewis and brad katsuyama that you have to watch.  It's quite popular.  Flashboys is the name of the book.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:11:17
Exactly.  Having an algo that can be mined by multipurpose machines is not as secure.  Miners have to be all in.  No dabblers.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:29:49
Are there long term ethereum hodlers or are they freaking out right now?
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:00:18
At least it's not onecoin.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:36:03
best app for monitoring so far!  just sad to see my blockfolio fall 15% in a few hours after waking up "rich"
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:24:17
Ok, I watch a LOT of Bitcoin/crypto videos on youtube and I notice almost all... or literally all of them are pro SEGWIT.  
even alt-coin investors speak favorably about it.  Where are the r/btc youtubers?
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:44:33
my friend was able to get his coins, no problem.
