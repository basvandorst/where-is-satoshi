I don't like Coinbase behavior relating to the 2x fork. What is the next most reputable exchange I can shift my buying and selling to?

As you can probably tell I am not a coder, I see the August first showdown as kind of "prisoner's dilemma".
My primary concern is the role of Bitmain or the large number of miners whose revenues would be negatively impacted by the SegWit evolution. Do you have an opinion why the risk may be overblown that Bitmain will induce a hard fork as a move to protect themselves from Segwit negatively impacting their established business model?

Question: If you dispute what clock930 said, once step 2 as you describe it is complete, then will we know for sure about Bitmains decision? What can I watch for to see definitive evidence of step 2 and that Bitmain wont hard fork with ABC?

I'm still researching... but it seems it may have something to do with "ASICboost"... something that is advantageous to Bitmain but unable to be utilized if SegWit goes through. 
I have concerns about Bitmain as a powerful entity (potentially state-backed) in this engagement, and what seems to be a track record of deceitful behavior. If you can help me remove my tin foil hat with evidence contrary to my concerns, I'm just trying to do due diligence...
Today's spike in the price seems to have some relationship to a tweet from Bitmain signaling cooperation. I am suspicious of this considering some of the research I have done. 
Do you have reason to believe there is nothing to be feared from Bitmain or that their role august 1st proceedings is irrelevant or overblown? I am just trying to educate myself like many investors.
