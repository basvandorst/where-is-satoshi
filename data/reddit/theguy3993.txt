If I make a new thread they reply within couple hours so no there just doing it on purpose. Over 45 Days now not even a status update. Just waiting to see who makes the Class Action Lawsuit first. I have read there is lots of people they are doing this to some with tens to hundreds of thousands. They will get slapped with an international lawsuit soon. Especially since accepting an account from Canada then demanding more information without a reason or without explaining what that information will be used for violates our privacy act.
