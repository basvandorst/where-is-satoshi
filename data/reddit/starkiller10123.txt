Why would you sell? Do you prefer fiat to bitcoin? I'm taking my coins to the grave or spending them all. Fiat is trash. Also not looking to pay that capital gains tax just to convert my coins to fiat. That being said I would convert certian amounts to fiat if I need to purchase anything that can't be purchased with bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:15:47
I don't recommend robinhood. They treat it like a stock, so you can't transfer to an external wallet or use your bitcoin at all. Just buy or sell. Sorry but you don't actually own your bitcoin.

Are you shorting bitcoin? I'm genuinely interested why someone who's never invested in bitcoin would know enough about it or care about it in any way. Like why come to a Reddit page dedicated to (and name your account after) something that you admit you've never even dabbled in. Sounds super sketchy to me. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:34:58
You notice they are all recently created accounts? It's almost like someone is farming these accounts out and intentionally creating FUD to get people to overreact.
