I’ll say this. If no one bought bitcoin, do you think it will reach 10,000 regardless of whether you use open bazaar. Right?

It has to happen. I am not referring to whether it can. I am I now obliged to call you an idiot also. By the way, I am not a idiot and I wouldn't think you are too. Just misguided.

Because I love BitCoin and I want to correct its worst failing as I see it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:00:27
Try thinking harder and you'll understand. I suppose. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:30:34
Just as how we transferred value to gold or even clay tablets in the past. We didn't exchange money for gold but goods for gold. Gold in itself was thought valuable therefore people trusted it as money. That particularly is what I think is the biggest failing of BitCoin. 
  
You can't for example spend an entire day on BitCoin in a big city.

You need to buy bitcoin in the first place to use it in OpenBazaar2 now, don't you?

It really shows that you are not an expert. There is no need to repeat it.

What is a "Fud" bro?

I am sorry but can you give an example or something because I am definitely mistaken and don't know how to get in to BitCoin so I can travel easily?
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:56:06
Let me get this straight as I am very interested in getting some bitcoin so I can travel safer. 
I buy 1 bitcoin worth about 4000USD in the US on Coinbase and later sell them for Euro equivalent of 4000USD with a minor spread?
If so why are there different numbers for bitCoin sellers and buyers?
Please explain like I am five if possible.

Thanks for your answer. I'll read up more on it. And, thanks for the correction. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:38:03
Or do I have this all wrong?
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:44:15
I was looking at local bitcoins for buying bitcoins which costs 4300 odd USD to buy and to sell it is 5000 odd USD.  
I do have the nagging feeling that I have something done wrong in my calculation though as there are wide different rates for selling.
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:35:25
I don't understand your answer. Please elaborate more.

Thanks but that still is about 8% which is far larger than Western Union fees in a international wire.
