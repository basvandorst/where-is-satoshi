Is the war over? Did I miss a resolution?
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:32:40
What about Airbitz?
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:09:49
Very cool company. Most companies in the space would have ignored you until you made a reddit post complaining about it.
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:35:04
Haha, nice sales pitch. Well it got me to click.

moving money outside of the country.
@_date: 2016-04-02 19:21:52
Surprised on such a large round. Doesn't look so impressive from what I see. Well its good to see investment in bitcoin is still coming. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 13:42:59
This list is good, but its not as clear as it could be. I would suggest an infographic with all features and ratings.
@_date: 2016-08-20 13:42:46
I do not think the creators would be so keen on handing out $15000 for a single blog post in this case. If it was only bitcoin payouts someone would have to actually pay that bitcoin out. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 13:42:28
I like E-Coin. The rebrand to  has taken longer than I would have liked, but excited for it. Please come to USA as well Wirex!
@_date: 2016-04-10 11:58:01
Join an affiliate. I am an affiliate of E-Coin and it pays instant bitcoin payouts.

From what I know about them you can be 100% anonymous. With their high fees I would not know why someone else would use them. Do you have a different opinion? I have not tried them. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 15:19:18
this is the best question when picking a card. There are foreign currency transaction fees, ATM fees, so its best to know what you are using first. 
@_date: 2016-04-02 19:25:18
Love it. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2016-04-19 13:40:51
complete ripoff. I would imagine the only ones using them are criminals anyways. 
@_date: 2016-04-02 19:24:03
No offense meant. Just thought there were many more BTM's in the US than this. I suppose regulation is making it a very slow process. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 19:58:54
there sure are a lot of there types of articles coming out constantly. Anything new here that has not been said 1000 times?
@_date: 2016-04-19 13:40:15
If you in USA this is your best option.... well only option right?
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:42:02
The arms race continues on
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:56:17
yes a virtual card is only $3 and you can load it and use it anywhere. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:42:55
I have used and wrote about e-coin. I will pick one up on another account. Nice promo!
@_date: 2015-12-16 07:23:19
I would suggest using a virtual bitcoin card.  has one for $3 and can be bought and used instantly. There are other virtual cards as well like Spectrucoin and others. You can buy a card, load it and use it all online and super fast.
@_date: 2015-12-16 07:25:13
What would you expect them to say? The day they start endorsing bitcoin is the day their currency is dead and its too late.
@_date: 2016-03-11 12:31:36
these are very cool! I have been wanting to get some presents for my nieces and nephews.  
@_date: 2016-03-17 06:44:34
Bitcoin is the least of their concerns. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 19:47:09
What does this mean for newbies?
@_date: 2016-03-11 12:30:31
Aww... looks sweet. I have been thinking of an upgrade. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 23:18:16
This is disgusting. Coin Desk is supposed to be our  source of news. No retraction? No public Statement? 
@_date: 2016-03-31 15:11:22
This map seems way off. Also is this all the ATM's in US?
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:06:51
this has not been the case for most altcoins. I understand the new supply, and the theory but its not always true in reality.
@_date: 2016-03-11 13:55:11
My economic courses always seem to fail me with current economic policies globally. Will it go boom? I think so but seems to keep growing and growing the pie.
@_date: 2016-03-11 12:27:19
Its good to see Bitcoinist has came out and ran a story. They are a good news site that probably just made a mistake. I have followed this story and been amazed that Coin Desk has not made a statement. Rumours are they were tipped off that the conference was a scam and silently removed tweets and the press the published on the conference. Its bitcoin and a scam comes every week, so its easy to make a mistake. To me this is criminal negligence by Coin Desk to not notify the public, post a new announcement, not even a tweet. Who knows maybe 50-10 tickets were were bought from reading the Coin Desk article and others alone. I am very disapointed that they would simply not address the issue. In fact I just looked up that this could be a criminal act what they have done. News Outlets have standards to uphold.  
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:52:16
This all seems like specualtion. The only thing I would expect is the mining difficulty would decrease some at this point. Price rise? I would say wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 15:00:07
The conference was being promoted for a couple weeks pretty hard by a few news outlets like Coin Desk and others. It was everywhere. I know at least 3 companies who were sponsoring the event. There are some theories that some of the news sites were actually collaborating on the scam together. So who knows for certain but my guess is 100+ people affected. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 14:47:33
I think they are all the same. Wirex charges the same rate. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 04:34:54
Nice work team! 
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:17:00
Nice work! E-Coin has my vote as I love my card. I am wondering what they have coming out soon? "In Year Two, you can expect us to keep getting better at what we do. We are already working on E-Coin’s next features and products, so look forward to the best Bitcoin debit card you can get in the market." I wrote a previous blog about my experience with E-Coin before. *disclaimer I work in bitcoin currently and nearly live on my E-Coin card. I am a large supporter of E-Coin. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:12:13
Very cool guys! Long time E-Coin user. What does this mean for people like me? I have 3 cards and hope I don't need to get new ones. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:43:51
Banks should be afraid. They can be 100% replaced in the next 10 years. No need for these corrupt institutions in the future.
@_date: 2015-11-24 08:58:16
Now how do we get Fox News to state this?
@_date: 2015-11-23 15:29:54
Well I did get lucky with the price bubble, but I was actually ok with buying bitcoin at market rate, then converting it with e-coin at low fees, then using my card on my trip and avoiding foreign currency charges. With this I was planning on saving a little, but I did get lucky with the upward swing. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 09:53:52
I am a huge fans of bitcoin cards, but not so much of Coin Base. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 10:12:52
I was just thinking the same thing about my basement. I really want to keep it going, but....
@_date: 2015-11-23 08:26:22
I think bitcoin is a new concept and will take time to catch on. We should just share our experiences. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 15:56:56
Lots of false rumours appear online. I think it is probably tough for smaller sites to generate ground breaking news. Sometimes when you think your breaking something big, it turns out to be garbage. That said give me 5 sites not named Coin Desk I should be reading?
@_date: 2015-11-23 11:35:24
Yes one card is USD, one in EURO, and in GBP to avoid currency exchange rate charges.
@_date: 2015-11-24 14:31:38
"Digital currencies and distributed ledgers are innovations that could have an impact on many areas, not only on payment systems and services [...] This might lead to changes in the way that FMIs and other market participants operate."  the secret is out....
@_date: 2015-11-18 09:27:13
Most people I talk with have no clue what money is, and when you tell them, they roll their eyes.
@_date: 2015-11-23 06:39:07
I use mine because I do not expect millions of merchants to accept bitcoin directly. I travel to Europe with my btc debit card an use my bitcoin everywhere. The merchant there accepts my bitcoin which in my case is my e-coin card. The merchant receives EURO in his account even if I were to pay with USD card. Bitcoin is another currency and I think the VISA/MASTERCARD gateway is the logical step.
@_date: 2015-11-23 06:43:51
Yes I believe there is an "enlightening" happening right now slowly. We are years away from the tipping point but the information is now out there. The under 40 generation still has a chance to change the financial future. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:42:22
I prefer  there are others as well such as Xapo, and Shift in US. Here is a review of the top rated cards. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 15:52:29
I would not feel comfortable with $1 Million in any market.
@_date: 2015-11-24 06:43:33
with e-coin you convert bitcoin to fiat with loading. So you can convert when you like, for example when the price increases you can convert or load you card. For example I was using my card when the bitcoin price was $300 and I converted at $450 already. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 11:03:37
What a joke of a list. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 06:27:54
HAHA... actually pretty funny first 3 minutes.
