Indeed, I would say... Beware of this banking troll!!!... as I see him coming from far!!!! 
He is trying from every angle to embed crypto-currencies in a trusted third party framework in order to control it and kill its momentum in favor of his preferred so-called permissioned banking ledgers of the status quo. He  knows that he can't fight Bitcoin but he can fight the credibility of it amongst its users. He has been playing the masses from day one and that is the main reason of the existence of ofnumbers.com
I hope it becomes slowly clear that this Banking agent has a clear hidden agenda when mingling with respected community members and spinning and debasing every comment whenever he can. He does this in a very efficient and soft but very persistent way. The methods he is using makes me think of the kind of methods used in intelligence and counterintelligence. 
The example of a Kimberley process proves it clearly again. He might not be but i reckon that he is very well aware of the fact that the Kimberley process has serious issues at hand and that it only holds up as long as the countries issuing the certificates play honest. This is uncontrollable as you have local politics involved and in the said countries even more than in others, honesty is at the very least, a very questionable concept. There have already plenty of examples of falsified certificates issued by so called 'respectable' third party issuers. 
I don't even understand that respected enthusiasts and members of the cryto-community keep on feeding this troll with ideas and leads. You know that he is trying to find ways to undermine the community with half truths and continuous manipulation efforts.
