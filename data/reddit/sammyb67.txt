@_date: 2019-07-13 16:13:48
Caitlin Long is the shit!!!
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:04:02

@_date: 2019-07-19 16:23:21
Poor mnuchin can’t even tell a decent lie...The US had anywhere from $40-$50 Billion in cash stolen in Iraq...none is accounted for
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:54:24

@_date: 2019-07-28 17:19:58
Hahahahaha! Some more stupid shit! Who cares, a lot of people lose money in the stock market every day, it goes on! Invest for the long term or don’t invest!

Who cares
@_date: 2019-07-18 09:51:48
Who writes this stupid shit????
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:47:24
He would have lost his ass if so, plus he doesn’t fuck w equities
@_date: 2019-07-03 11:05:31
Hope not, would love to buy some more at $50 bucks
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:15:09
Fuck Roubini...he sits on the MasterCard board, he’s bought and sold
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:34:40

I’d rather see $3k....load the wagon
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:45:39
Mungers view is simple, he and Berkshire Hathaway’s largest holdings are Wells Fargo, Bank of America, etc...munger and company are not looking for competition
@_date: 2019-03-24 17:50:08
Hahahahaha! You are that fucking stupid, I was buying btc when it was $50 and then shitheads like you show up
@_date: 2019-03-23 12:44:33
Bitcoin doesn’t need Wall Street, that’s a huge misconception. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:39:35

That’s bullshit and you clearly don’t know how to use google, he worked for them! Keeping the registers of the Jews remaining in cities.
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:31:56

Guns, bombs, and cash
@_date: 2019-03-04 11:10:11
@_date: 2019-11-12 15:56:25
That makes sense, they control their clients money until they realize they can take their clients money by selling them crypto. Complete bullshit
@_date: 2019-11-11 00:45:33
@_date: 2019-11-23 18:40:38
Yes, sell me yours and move on

Don’t be ashamed!!! You’re just a broke poser, that’s all!
@_date: 2019-11-08 02:20:40
Actually he’s dead wrong. The market cap of gold going back 5000 years?!? Gold is a joke and they’re finding more of it every day
@_date: 2019-11-11 00:46:10
Maybe so, we shall see
@_date: 2019-11-09 16:56:32
As is every other concern with bitcoin and crypto!!! Way exaggerated
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:52:13
Like Hitler. No loyalty to his own people.
@_date: 2019-11-16 12:24:19
Now analysis is on time of year??? Come on man
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:52:55
Anything can be manipulated that easy, if they shorted gold, oil, etc. you’d see the same dip
@_date: 2019-11-13 22:45:47
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:38:06
Oh fuck off, there’s no excuse for helping hitler.
@_date: 2019-11-08 17:56:48
Racial??? You must be a fucking idiot???
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:45:20
I agree, I was on the street as well, the system is set up that way and a lot of it goes back to education by parents and school.
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:07:42
Who cares, let’s talk about the manipulation that the govt is doing to bitcoin and crypto, that’s much more important
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:08:05
Forbes is a joke
@_date: 2019-11-27 11:10:53
Forbes sucks, these are opinions of stupid people that know nothing about btc or crypto
@_date: 2019-11-25 13:58:21
Good! Who fucking cares! It’s doesn’t change a damn thing!!! Keep buying!
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:26:59
Gates does because of Buffet, Buffet owns more banks than anyone else. He also deplores competition. Moats, remember?
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:14:40
I disagree, there’s a difference of being an early buyer and a get rich quick scheme. I’ve been in this space since 2014 and have never moved anything to fiat only adding more.

Question: What are your conflicts of interest, Mister Roubini?
Answer: I sit on several financial institutions boards of directors and on the board of MasterCard.
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:13:20
@_date: 2019-03-24 17:31:56
Bitcoin didn’t do this you fucking idiot, traders and programmers did, there’s a reality check for you
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:05:14
They’re a bunch of uneducated opinions, fuck em
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:06:22
So you’re a bch guy?
@_date: 2019-11-16 12:31:36
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:25:31
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:54:47
Hahahahaha! Cause you’re a broke fuck and don’t have any btc! Just like I thought, a busted loser!
@_date: 2019-11-23 15:30:59
China’s government sucks!
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:45:25
Fuck JPM, is the Fox now guarding the hen house?!?
@_date: 2019-11-10 15:03:36
Mister Roubini’s also sits on the board of Mastercard and several banks, he’s owned by them. He is their bitch!
@_date: 2019-11-07 20:20:46
FBI doesn’t have a chance against bitcoin, other than tracking criminals on the digital ledger!
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:18:51
Government control at its best!
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:13:56

Not a few, a lot of hedge funds going short gold would absolutely crash it or anything else
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:07:26
They still don’t get it
@_date: 2019-11-14 13:36:39
Anyone that listens to a word that come out of Paul Krugman’s mouth is an idiot. Paul Krugman is the dumbest economist in the history of the economy
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:09:23
I hope so! I’d love to buy some more on the cheap!
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:27:38
@_date: 2019-11-13 21:29:57
You’re right.
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:01:02
Let me guess, the government kept all the money and probably the douche bag that “froze” the assets.
@_date: 2019-11-03 21:25:23
When it becomes enough of a thorn in their sides they will address it. I wouldn’t go begging for the tax man
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:07:14
I’m very sure you don’t have a clue. Study markets and get back to me.
@_date: 2019-11-30 14:14:02
Who cares, what’s the long view of bitcoin?!? Looks pretty to me!!!
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:06:16
Do some research and we will discuss him. I upvoted you
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:08:28
Absolutely agree
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:23:29
Always good to have cock suckers like this around, they stand still while crypto takes over
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:22:26
And Porsche
@_date: 2019-11-13 13:53:11
This stupid article has misspelled names and words! Who’s writes this stupid shit
@_date: 2019-11-03 12:20:36
You are exactly right! The EU knows it’s losing control, big time, they also know that btc is a digital ledger so they can clearly see where the money is going, this is 100% about control your freedom
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:27:22
O’Leary is a retard.
@_date: 2019-11-24 17:11:55
Can we bet on it???
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:18:45
Promise??? I’d love to buy some more that cheap!
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:25:00
Governments hate to give the power back to the people! They’re gonna have to start serving people again to survive
@_date: 2019-11-11 23:58:48
Stupid shit
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:45:12
Actually you’re wrong. It’s very ready for them. 
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:46:45
Which article? Google him, Roubini is a self serving shit bag
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:02:25
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:37:33
You clearly aren’t looking very hard.
@_date: 2019-11-23 18:28:55
Actually they didn’t, they stole everyone’s research, ideas etc and forced their people into the manufacturing sector, basically all the Chinese people are slaves and the ass kissers get a little more money and food
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:48:18
Sell me your btc and that way you can move on
@_date: 2019-03-29 10:10:47
Bitcoin isn’t illegal in Russia  
@_date: 2019-03-19 16:54:43
Fuck that guy
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:39:21
Government need to serve the people not the other way around
@_date: 2019-11-10 15:04:47
Yes, please! I’m not done buying
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:58:44

@_date: 2019-11-15 10:47:04
All that will work itself out. Already is
@_date: 2019-03-27 23:55:17
AUSTRALIAN Bank is scared to death! They know they’re done!!!
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:05:31
I’m not freaking out! I’m stating the obvious! Why are you such a dumbass?!?
@_date: 2019-11-29 17:20:49
It doesn’t matter if it’s tough or not, life’s tough. If you’re playing the long game, $3k drop isn’t shit, if you’re playing the short game, you’re a fool.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:09:15
No shit, that’s the only reason the government let them have futures was to try to stop btc.
@_date: 2019-11-10 12:50:53
Hahahahaha! That motherfucker is gettin it!!!
@_date: 2019-11-21 10:21:24
Bloomberg panel trying to control when people buy btc...just a few years ago Bloomberg was calling btc a ponzi
@_date: 2019-11-29 17:03:45
It’s not been tough at all!!! Great buying opportunity!!!
@_date: 2019-11-23 16:10:48

Peter Schiff! What a self proclaimed dip shit!
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:07:11
Hahahahaha! He is deeply hated in Hungary! He helped the nazis. He is a piece of shit!
@_date: 2019-11-11 12:04:12
Me either
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:07:23
I agree 100%, there is no freedom from any government, it’s all control. Absolutely ridiculous
@_date: 2019-11-30 13:47:40
That’s exactly right!!! Like every other fucking government
@_date: 2019-11-23 23:57:48
The Chinese govt are thieves, there is no propaganda about that
@_date: 2019-11-29 15:16:46
Won’t ever happen
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:43:49
Who cares, let it do its thing

@_date: 2019-11-29 14:17:25
Why are you worried about it?!?
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:21:58
Are you kidding? Of course central bankers (old, wealthy, white men) don’t like bitcoin! They’re bankers, fuck them!!! They’re the reason bitcoin exist in the first place! Buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:14:40
Hahahahaha! Clearly he doesn’t have a clue about what bitcoin and crypto even is
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:06:15
A lot more
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:45:17
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:18:35
It’s not a battle it’s not even close! Bitcoin wins hands down
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:30:49
No, the futures market that began in 2017 did that
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:18:34
Stupid post
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:40:43
Peter Schiff is so full of shit it literally runs out of his mouth every time he opens it. He hates bitcoin and crypto because it’s better than gold and he knows it
@_date: 2019-03-26 01:34:40
That ain’t shit for him
@_date: 2019-11-13 22:10:20

@_date: 2019-11-07 13:40:22
Well in the first few paragraphs, it clearly says that they don’t understand cryptocurrency and they don’t know how they work...well fucking start learning!!! Mitt Romney is a fucking dim wit
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:34:15
Bannon not a fascist, he’s a capitalist and everyone that screams that stupid shit has never studied hitler. It’s actually the people that are screaming all this fascist shit are the real fascist and socialist.

You’re the one calling people names, enlighten me!

@_date: 2019-08-05 13:35:09
Where does Bloomberg and Forbes get these assclowns that know everything!!! They hated btc until they realized there was a market for it. The efficient market theory is complete bullshit.
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:22:59
Pomp is dead on!

Up to you, it won’t matter

Good God, Bitcoin will be fine, it’s only 10 years old, relax! It’ll be exactly what it was planned to be!

Keep believing that shit!!!!

Hahahahaha! Store of value???? Go to your bank and wire $10,000.00 to another country for less that a dollar and within 2-3 minutes...holla back if you can do that within 48 hours for less than a $100bucks! Store of value???

This idiot! Get yourself some gold so you can go to your local exchange or pawn shop and they’ll rip your ass off buying and selling, then transfer that gold instantly anywhere around the world 24/7/365 at little cost...I wouldn’t listen to a word this douche bag is saying!

The fbi has tricked criminals from the beginning to think they can’t trace crypto, that in itself is hilarious! It’s a fucking digital ledger!!! Law enforcement will be solving crimes in the past once they fully figure it out! You can’t go back in the block and replace that purchase, it’s there for eternity
@_date: 2019-10-28 15:04:36
Promise? Can we please go back to $7,300?!?

You don’t have a clue what fascism is. You are probably a socialist wishing to live in a fascist system.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:56:18
You’re wrong, not when there are derivative contracts on btc.
@_date: 2019-10-02 08:50:56
Maduro is a fucking idiot, he will fuck it up like Hugo Chavez did Venezuela and then the rest of the world governments will do all they can to destroy crypto in the name of this retard

So, smart contracts have no intrinsic value? Eliminating the 3rd part doesn’t have any intrinsic value? That’s trillions in savings, right there. These governments and the people in them are fucking idiots!
@_date: 2019-10-28 22:04:59
I’ve noticed that too
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:32:46
Actually it is, the govt allowed btc futures derivatives to stop btc

That too!

Keiser is wrong about Buffet and I love bitcoin. Share buybacks are not fraud or illegal. That’s like owning bitcoin and when the price drops it’s not ok to buy more because you already own a bunch. Buffet is shrewd and a brutal business man and he is not looking for any competition against any of his businesses or holdings that’s why he hates bitcoin. A hundred bucks says geico is taking crypto in 18-24 months

Muslims are 1,000% about control, look at how they treat the women and girls. Crypto will never work for Muslims unless it’s controlled by some man. Hell, women just got permission to drive in Saudi Arabia, Iran is killing girls for not wearing hijabs, complete bullshit. I think it’s funny when a man “in control” makes all the rules for the women, a complete disaster.  That’s Islam.

None of us will be here to know! Buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-12-07 12:07:06
That may be the case but just because it’s not producing a “product” doesn’t make it irrelevant and private company blockchains rarely work without a currency to go along with them. Hence the miners and the bakers. Plus, this is 10 years old and look at what it’s done already.
@_date: 2019-12-09 01:51:41
You’re exactly right!!!

@_date: 2019-12-08 18:35:28
Nah, not following America anymore. Brad Sherman is an arrogant cock sucker that like other Democrats are now warmonger instead of diplomats. He is owned by the banks and war machines. He know crypto is going to make governments serve people and people not serve governments and that scares him because he’s a power hungry cuck.
@_date: 2019-12-19 07:57:19

Pennies when compared to what banks stole from people
@_date: 2019-04-29 17:00:59
I don’t believe this shit for a second. I think it’s a bullshit and they’re trying to scare people away from crypto
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:03:29

Alas, here is mister roubini’s whole argument! Bitcoin threatens everything his whole life has been about! Can’t be by the people for the people, it has to be government controlled!!!! Fuck him!!!

@_date: 2018-11-23 22:07:54
Ridiculous article. You think the man that was selling horses was glad to see Hebert Ford roll into town with his Model T??? I hold a lot of Berkshire stock and bitcoin, Buffet is a genius no doubt but he’s not going to be for anything that threatens his largest holdings, ie, banks. Neither will Mister Dimon, but we’ve already seen his hypocrisy. I’d be willing to bet that Geico is taking crypto by the end of 2019. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:05:18
Hell yeah! I’d buy it all!!! I’m not shorting it. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:17:36
Anything innovative douche bags like Krugman and Roubini hate, because it completely destroys everything they know and they are very unwilling to think outside the box and their reputations. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:34:05

@_date: 2018-11-21 17:29:45
It already has and in Africa and Asia and western Russia. The only place it has struggled is in the US where our monetary system is controlled by greed, fraud, and money laundering Banks, and banks hate competition!

Hopefully it will get below $2,000!!!!! 
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:26:57
This guy is spot on! Banks and governments hate competition!!!
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:49:12
Real terms? you want to do the buffet / hedge fund bet I’ll do it. $100k is great, we can make it a cool million if you want. I could really care less. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:01:32
Just think what the banks have made over the centuries making money on the Longs and the shorts...that’s why they love the central banks and hate crypto 
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:08:04
I wasn’t proven wrong on anything, you love your traditional bullshit fiat, you love big government, traditional banks, taxes, sucking cock, etc....I don’t! I’m choosing a different path than you! You’ve got $180k saved up in your piggy bank and I have millions spread across multiple asset classes. No big deal to me!!! 
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:39:20
Exactly what I thought. Enjoy the evening. If you grab a set of balls and want to bet hit me back, I’ll take all your money! Take care!

Dude, I grew up hard and I am a self made finance private equity guy, I was buying brka in 1990. I am also a value guy. I have a lot of respect for you, $180k is a lot of money and congratulations on your hard work. I completely understand your logic but I will tell you this, the days of fiat currency are over. I understand everything you say about govt, taxation, regulations, roads, prisons, etc I get it. Think about this, when my accountants tell me that they are having to take courses on crypto and Blockchain technology through the cpa program, crypto isn’t going away. I took one of my accountants with me last week and let her watch me send a business partner of mine $800k of crypto in less than 30 seconds for .39c. If I go to the bank that same wire takes all day and cost me $300. You tell me what’s more efficient? Efficiency wins every time.

How do you have any idea what he knows and understands??? 
@_date: 2019-01-26 19:54:35
JP Morgan has plenty to worry about besides the price of bitcoin!!!

@_date: 2019-01-14 18:24:11
They’re right 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:13:49
Hahahahaha! The fucking article didn’t even mention the “analyst” name! Who writes this shit and then post it???? It would be a dream for it to go below $1,260!!!!
@_date: 2019-01-24 03:40:35
Bitcoin is peer to peer blockchain technology, for my own sake I like not having to go through a third party corporation. I can pay or be paid without anyone refusing service or holding my money. I like freedom. Just me. Take care.

How many more times you gonna post this stupid shit? Who’s paying you??? Hahahahaha! The article is worthless! 
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:18:31
Bullshit! Who makes this stupid shit up???
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:12:48
Agree, Krugman is the Nobel idiot!!! When he comes out against anything I start buying it immediately!!! He hasn’t a clue!!! 
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:22:23
Probably because the govts, banks, etc always say bitcoin is for laundering money which couldn’t be further from the truth 
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:19:55
Good, the could do a lot of things 
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:03:30
Badass! Are you selling these? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:10:50
Fantastic! Try doing that with a gold bar or coin!

Sell everything y’all it’s over, because these ass clowns said it is!!!
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:37:47
Actually it’s not. Bullshit article. Here’s a real JP Morgan Article with real names! Shows what complete crooks JP Morgan are! 
@_date: 2019-01-22 22:48:50
Duh, Find any bank that says bitcoin is money
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:17:54

@_date: 2019-01-16 15:17:31
Who cares 
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:48:25
Bullshit, this is what the federal reserve banks are saying...they hate competition 
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:57:52
Some of buffets biggest holdings are banks and financial services, of course he doesn’t like bitcoin and crypto! But $100 says geico is going to be taking crypto in 3 years or less 
@_date: 2019-01-23 12:05:47
More bullshit from the BIS, they’re scared shitless, they literally are fucked and they know it. Kind of like Barnes and Noble when they blew off Amazon in the beginning, instead of figuring out how to compete or play along they picked it apart...poor bastard economist has zero understanding of btc 
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:12:50
You’re right
@_date: 2019-01-10 11:23:11
Everything!!! All this stupid shit people post, literally nothing of value in your post! 
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:05:36
Thank you for posting this!!! So sick of these shitty thug bankers! 
@_date: 2019-01-05 11:49:20
They’re trying to be the governments to it so it’ll look like the crypto space is self regulating 
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:48:42
Worthless article 
@_date: 2019-01-23 12:30:31
I agree, what I was saying is, they don’t even know how to poke legitimate holes in btc. When central banks can cause recessions and then turn around and cause a bull run there is something very fucked up about that! Very! 
@_date: 2019-01-22 00:18:16
Great! This is the best way for crypto to spread!
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:42:29
Not confusing at all
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:19:37
Hahahahaha! I love it!!! Those fucking banks know they’re fucked!!!!
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:27:42
Who cares 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:45:08
Hahahahaha! These stupid fucking articles!!! The article never names “the expert”!!! Who post this ridiculous bullshit???
@_date: 2019-01-27 00:15:47
JP Morgan and Co are a bunch of goddamn crooks and they aren’t looking for any competition!!!
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:06:30
Damn right! I hope she cleans up! 
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:17:58
Great! 
@_date: 2019-01-20 16:05:57
Hopefully 
@_date: 2019-01-23 06:01:58
Won’t ever work. Central banks are the biggest monopoly there is and they don’t want any competition fucking their country’s civilization! 
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:23:53
Hahahahaha 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:29:06
The super rich at Davos didn’t catch on to btc in the beginning otherwise they would be all over btc and crypto, it’s what makes douche bags like Jamie Dimon look so stupid 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:34:17
Arizona accepts btc as well I think 
@_date: 2019-01-23 19:05:09
Thank goodness Jeff knows the secrets, thanks Jeff!!! Hahahahaha!!! Sell everything now!!!
@_date: 2019-01-24 01:05:43
@_date: 2019-01-07 12:02:33
Thanks for the drama, no one cares 
@_date: 2019-01-03 12:11:58
Sell all your btc y’all, it’s over! Warren Buffet and crooked Jamie Dimon says btc won’t work and that it’s a Ponzi scheme....wait both are owners of massive amounts of banks stock...maybe there’s a different reason they’re bashing it then
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:00:57
Maybe millions of viewers...billions, plural, is a huge leap
@_date: 2019-01-20 14:42:50
The SEC is owned by the banks, they will never embrace btc and that’s why at some point they will be out of business....just ask blockbuster about Netflix...it’s coming 
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:06:54
Thank you for the wisdom!!! I’ll sell everything now! 
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:47:57
I understand, but what they’re saying about btc and gold are right 
@_date: 2019-01-24 03:21:48
It’s also interesting that PayPal is 21 years old this year and when it came out it was scary for people to use, will be interesting to see where btc and crypto are in 11 more years. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:17:03
Are you kidding, I agree!!   I would love to buy again under a $1,000.00!

@_date: 2019-01-31 09:41:41
What do you expect from the world gold council??? Of course they’re going to say btc isn’t gold but who gives a fuck what those antiquated ass clowns say

Let me guess you are a Roubini/Krugman pawn. Both of which are fools. I’m willing to put my money where my mouth is. Let’s bet $50k that in 5 years there are crypto currencies tied to the blockchain that has 25-50% of the free world using it. We can put the $$$ in escrow! 
@_date: 2019-01-26 19:50:02
I love Charlie, he is absolutely one of the smartest men I have ever heard speak, when he talks about bitcoin I believe he hates it because he knows the threat that it is to banks and payment systems, and that’s why I love btc!

Hahahahaha! I always love the big government lovers!!! You look to the government to save you! No one is cheating on their taxes, Uncle Sam always gets his, I just don’t need the government to run my life and apparently you do!!! I’ll bet you your net worth, the little $180k. Let’s bet it all on if crypto becomes mainstream in 5 years. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:18:01
Duh, who cares what Wall Street and the rich douche bags at Davos want??? It completely changes the game for those pricks. Btc and crypto is the great equalizer!!! I love that PayPals always is chiming in now, he knows crypto is coming for him

@_date: 2018-11-30 09:58:09

Meanwhile in San Francisco his bank,  JP Morgan was hosting a polychain, cryptocurrency conference! At some point all these bankers will realize the gig is up and people won't use these institutions that have fleeced the world for ever! Jamie Dimon knows that bitcoin is superior to fiat and he can't control it
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:46:20
Funny, no one ever compares btc to stocks, what about the folks that bought/owned Lehman brothers, Wachovia, etc at the top? They lost fucking everything and that’s an actual government regulated bank!!! 
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:17:18
Fucking right!!!!
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:50:05
Hahahahahaha!!! Regulation and taxation get you recessions and depressions and manipulation!!! Look at the hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and laundering and interest rate manipulation by your traditional banks! No thanks!!! I’m not saying it will be bitcoin but some crypto(s) will absolutely replace fiat. Why don’t you take a look at the countries where it’s working? Africa? Russia? South America? Asia? Why do we need banks? To charge us ridiculous fees? You clearly have never used crypto and seen the frictionless movement of assets! But then again, climb back under your regulated log and put your cash in your bank and let them fleece you!!! Wonder why Abby Johnson at Fidelity spent $2.8b getting ready for crypto? JPM using ethereum to build on the Blockchain? The canoe? Hahahahaha!

It absolutely solves it. Are you a fucking moron??? Do you know how many thugs, terrorist, cheaters, have been caught because they used bitcoin. Look at Silk Road. The fucking fbi and cia convinced the people that they couldn’t track btc when they were tracking them the whole time. What the fuck do you thing a ledger is??? Take some accounting classes and figure it out.

imagine how much energy it takes to track that dollar, how easy it is to launder, steal, embezzle, buy drugs, support terrorism, etc. can’t do that with crypto and a ledger! Governments will slowly figure it out. They are owned by the banks right now, but when they figure it out there will be a major shift to crypto / blockchain...major savings
