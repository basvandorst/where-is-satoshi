It’s not that hard to implement.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:51:20
Channels are powered by individuals and the coins don’t leave them 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:18:28
Then they’re still in a Coinbase controlled channel

What minimizing size?  No one is making size smaller than it is now.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:04:38
11 for me :((
That’s 160k now
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:27:41
Nice try irs
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:42:23
For ‘sale’
Not for ‘sell’
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:14:03
GallowBoob in /bitcoin?  
Mainstream boys.
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:40:35
They could have implemented it by now, look
at how fast they did bcash and how well that is going for them 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:08:48
LN is what we are discussing 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:59:19
Do you not understand how channels work?
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:05:48
So basically find out what he Super-frantically shits on and buy it, same with Goldman and Morgan.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:38:33
Exactly: how many people in the world even understand how electricity works? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:28:35
Hm. If someone gave me that much cash I would put it all into s&amp;p 500.  But I am lazy and I don’t have an account on an exchange.
If fidelity linked up through Coinbase to buy coins, I’d do that immediately though with my entire 401k, since I am young and can handle high risk.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:53:27
Betas gonna beta
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:13:44
Mines up 40%
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:38:49
Nope, they’re perfectly fungible for counting discrete items, and less is probably more appropriate in most cases.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:38:45
Yeah it does
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:44:43
What if you mined the coins? 
Do you pay taxes on panning for gold?  Do you pay taxes if your two cows make a third cow? How does that work?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:15:31
More of annual bonus.
Lots of jobs here have salaries that only pay out if metrics are hit. Especially in NYC in Finance.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:11:21
They mean the same thing.
9 is less than 20. Not fewer.  Less therefore can be used for discrete counts.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:26:01
None of that says pay on fork asswipe 
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:25:31
Why not? This is unclear to me. I can't fork bitcoin 100000000x and make coin base support every fucking fork.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:28:37
Tx volume is not millions 
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:18:08
Smooth criminal?
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:51:57
Except no, you buy .00000000000000001 Nathan coin for 1 penny and suddenly your coin is more valuable than bitcoins.  You prop it up artificially just like bch is now.
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:42:23
My point stands~
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:16:24
It's more like a lot of tiny transactions for 0.00005 bch at $30 which overvalues a full 1.00 bch
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:28:06
I am sure you're a shill 
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:42:04
Right so who is to say what Coinbase has to do?  You could make nathantrader.com and claim your coin is worth $50ea.  The only exchanges with bch are fly by night / fraudulent.
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:26:38
He can, he's an idiot.
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:25:27
Fidelity already integrated with coinbase, so it's less than years away
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:14:40
Then you’re an idiot

Figure out what the currency supply of the planet is, divide by 7, then divide by 21M

    //TODO: write important stuff
@_date: 2017-05-28 06:58:01
So it's dropping to $500?
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:52:41
4 yrs ago they were $10
@_date: 2017-05-12 02:38:08
Target away :) 
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:47:06
I do?

Build a little sales breadcrumb trail at whatever prices make you happy then sit back and eat popcorn

My phone wallet is nearly 20k :/
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:27:51
Even invented bitcoins. Other countries can only take from our culture and technological advances

I have a little Linux box. Doesn't go on the interwebs.
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:48:12
Match it up against that graph that has a 5k high this time around.

Conflation of uncorrelated concepts does not remotely make you correct nor comprehensible.

GS is pump and dump.  Just subscribe to r/wallstreetbets for a week or two and you'll see how GS operates
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:38:24
Lol tens to hundreds of millions in positions.
Check out $MU and $AMZN for recent plays of theirs, including ratings manipulations.
As for their impact on bitcoins, I dunno.  I can't imagine they are a big player yet. Maybe their buy-in was behind the most recent price climb
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:48:43
Reading through a 3 mo old acct is all the detective work you did???? No backtracking my ip???? ;)
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:15:02
Just because other countries adopt our terms doesn't make them applicable 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:43:18
America has basically done everything of note for the past 100 years, so yes.
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:43:41
20-&gt;5 IS the pattern 
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:45:16
Generation labels are for USA people only, not Malaysians or Chinese or other countries.  The Greatest Generation makes no sense applied to Cubans.

1.4M is what I need.  That's ... a huge increase in bitcoin price from now, for my holdings though.
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:58:54
People could, long ago.
