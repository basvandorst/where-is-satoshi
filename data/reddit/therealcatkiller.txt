If you look at dates, MtGox are blocking withdraw since the Bitcoin is crashing, or at least since the Bitcoin reached the max amount of 1250. It smells bad, very bad. Might be another SheepMarket.

MtGox is terrible if you plan to buy and sell quickly. It's sort of laggy.
I use Plus500, a basic trading platform and had good results with except they reset your positions every day.
In other words it depends if you plan to trade or to invest.
To invest MtGox should be the best choice if you are in Europe.
To trade, look at Plus500 or AvaTrade

this is what i did. i sold all my BTC and stopped looking at bitcoinwisdom. but even if i am not in front of my PC i still can see bitcoinwisdom and some green and red and black color spots. i am also still having panic selling random attacks while i see anything cheap.

Governments need money. And the new way from them to get some is to fight the world of money. That's clearly what they said during the last G-meeting and what the European governments are worried of at the moment.

I have been trying to do that but it didn't work. Apparently a lot of banks are currently banning bitcoin and any trading exchange. And a lot of people are saying scary things about bitcoin too at the moment.
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:00:38
banks need computer to record transactions
bitcoin is a peer to peer currency = computers used to compute transactions can be yours, mine....
that's it

I am French. I am trying to use the same account I already used to deposit the money to MtGox. So I don't see why they don't want to transfer.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:46:00
this post is top number 1 in r/bitcoin it's not nothing. thousand of people are going to see it and it's not necessary good for apple.
i stopped buying apple following things that looks like this bitcoin ban. they want to control and lock everything.
their stock option is going nowhere as well as their product strategy, they ate all their white bread.
power to the people.

If banks keep having no control of bitcoin transactions:
France is going to ban bitcoin. Followed by Germany and the rest of Europe.
Then, they will put pressure on US government to do the same thing. Or in other words to ask Goldman Sachs and their friends to stop playing with this.
In 2 years no one will talk about bitcoin anymore.

i think he cashed out 2 days ago and started this crash. maybe.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:33:40
Well.. I don't like Fundraising. They are a way too many of these kind of things in internet. And I feel the money is generally not used as it should really be.

sounds like a troll to me
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:32:49
calm down, use lowercase.
i wanted to say almost 20 years, the time is passing a way too fast for me i don't want to relate.
not sure who is right, but if there is something i am sure is the fact i am not a faggot, i stopped smoking few years ago.
i hope you are right and we will stop to pay banks and work for them but sadly i doubt it's really possible.

I am still waiting. It's been a month now, ticket opened 9 days ago and no answer. It's a fucking scam that's just the reality.

Max price is apparently the price of 1 ounce of gold. Which is approximately the same price of 1 ounce of Platinum.

Ok I pretty much over exaggerated the title but apparently a lot of banks are currently banning bitcoin and I would not suprised HSBC would be the next (Hongkong Shangai Bank Central)

Or maybe he is just buying some weed on Sheep market Reloaded.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:12:25
Doesn't look very official even if it was published by Die Zweit. They really can change this decision if they took one. And make new laws with European Central Bank. Sorry it's not to contest but I am trying to think about all the possibilities.
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:05:34
Non US based. I have 2 HSBC accounts, one in the UK and the other one in France. Both have same name, mine. They are very normal accounts and should work anywhere. I found another Reddit post where a lot of people are complaining too. Damn I was sure this Bitcoin thing will have a bad end...

Basic to make money: Buy cheap, Sell higher.
Problem with BTC: it's already too high, there is nothing to earn anymore, it might keep moving from 800 to 1200 but very randomly compared to any other stock. BTC is like dynamite, I also believe there are a lot of trading bots on it, that makes everything even more harder to trade.
Read, explore, study.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:50:09
Its not a question to survive its about not giving my money to a corporation like apple who locks everything and wants to control us.

@_date: 2013-12-10 06:50:31
i have read this somewhere, cnnmoney or business insider, a blue and white website... they explained BTC crashed when it reached 1240 USD. it was exactly the price of 1 ounce of gold this day and this time. the price of gold always had a lot of influence in the world of money but i am not an expert.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:12:41
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:23:19
yes this is what i am figuring out.

Same, let's show to Apple what the Bitcoin community is made of : Let's Boycott Apple
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:18:16
there are better ways to earn money than BTC. at this point BTC is very risky especially for someone 16.
learn to trade stock options, it's the same thing than BTC and you can plan doing this long term.
people who made money with BTC are just comparable to people who won the lottery.
earning money is never really easy, unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:43:30
Unfortunately I don't believe anymore in BTC, I think I don't want to allow myself to think about this anymore. It made me crazy like in the early WoW days, that's what I liked but it was a way too insane. I didn't even know it was possible to focus on something that hard.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:44:48
it's hard to believe there is no way to block these coins in this kind of situation. can some hackers or someone find this guys and cut his genitals maybe?
