Modern coins have very, very little copper in them.

I mean, I could understand it though. My dumb, stinky, fat little cat is pretty much my entire life. I wouldn't be able to live if I didn't do everything I could to save her. I would also literally have to be dragged out by the firefighters.

That's 30 days, if they comply. I'm sure it takes a lot longer than that to get a judge to order the sheriff to kick them out.

I know it depends a lot on which state you're in, too.

Oh of course. Once I saw that my wallet was worth like $10k I would have been happy to cash out. There's no way I could have held until it reached over six figures.

I had a friend trying to turn me on to the idea of buying some back then, around 2010. If I had put $5k in, and ehdl until last November, I'd have had about $2 BILLION.

More like, I had a guy that I sold weed to.

I understand that, but it's my understanding that it's to acknowledge comments and posts that contribute to the community as a whole.
With no benefits and with my content contributing zero to help Reddit be a better community, I'm left wondering if it "means" anything.
Either way, I appreciate it and I hope that everything works out for everyone.

It was $19k four months ago.

This is cool, but does silver actually do anything?

Why is this a positive? Relatively small companies are making massive dough for simply providing a medium of exchange?
Even if the service is "free" they are still pulling in ridiculous bucks from selling advertising space and user data.

Pizzagate confirmed.

You can always barter your body. Might not be ideal in many ways, but that's how most do it.

I didn't necessarily mean prostitution. Just any physical labor in general.

I have a regular bar that I go to often. I was there a while back and they had a jar of blank matchbooks on the bar. I took them out and wrote "BUY CRYPTO BTC ETH LTC" on all of them.
They got mad and told me to never do that again. Now, they don't even keep matchbooks out anymore.
