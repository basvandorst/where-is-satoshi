Yea, and those people have done a great job solving the global warming crisis, mass starvation, etc. What you're talking about is a chain of command with some oversight to make sure people are doing those things. When there's no oversight like that, people aren't solving much of a damn thing unless there's immediate money in it. Tons of investment money and programmers trying to make the next big social app, much less of it in the things that actually matter.
That said, I'll clarify my statement: Relying on some general nameless group of people to do something of their own volition isn't the best of ideas. And that's playing out right now with bitcoin, as it's crap right now for what its intended purpose was because people HAVEN'T been upgrading it. Reminds me of MySpace in that regard, and that should concern the bitcoin community, especially now that there's competition.

As opposed to "do X and I'll send you Y bitcoins." scams? Scams can work both ways.
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:16:54


Not necessarily - but don't pretend that no regulation is some magical fairy land where all is right in the world. Especially given the way bitcoin is  where transactions are irreversible, it is very inviting for scams - much in the same way Western Union is except with even less risk for the scammer. The bad comes with the good - ignoring its existence as I said will simply alienate the outsiders the bitcoiners are trying to convert.
Simply saying "okay we'll put all scammers on a blacklist" doesn't help much after the fact. This will likely be the first in a long line of major scams that happen with the aid of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:29:09
You're right, I am a noob...the run up in April last year had caught my attention so I started following bitcoin more though was aware of it before then.
The difference now is it's in the public eye. Doesn't matter a whole lot what the people heavily into bitcoin think - they'll be behind it regardless of things like this. But there were likely a lot of non-community people - the kinds of people we all want to use bitcoin to make it grow and thrive as a currency, including the businesses that accept it - who see something like this happen and start to get wary. They don't know those old scams either, but they know this one now, and may have been affected by it.

Don't loop me into that. Any time one exchange holds most of the activity, it's incredibly dangerous. The same kinds of people I'm talking about, the people that champion anything that could be seen as good and tell people to ignore the bad (or paint it good with a flawed brush), are the ones who wanted Gox in the spotlight because of the higher price there and the more attention they were getting. In reality, there needed to be competition, and as we're seeing, thank god there was or else this would be almost a doomsday for bitcoin instead.

"haha finally, people who used them are getting fucked!"
MtGox isn't the loser in all this. What's happening to the GoxBTC price is exactly what people are afraid of could happen to Bitcoin as a whole. The fact that it's playing out live as we speak on what was once the self-proclaimed 80% market leader is not a good thing for Bitcoin at all. Want to get new people into Bitcoin? Having a sitting example of how they could lose their ass off is not going to help.

As someone who is not intimately involved with Bitcoin or any of these orgs/businesses, I would have to say no fucking shit. This sort of thing is pretty obvious from a marketing standpoint, but people want to believe that such an entity is looking out for the best for bitcoin and more importantly (for most people with bitcoins, not speaking to you or anyone in this discussion specifically), help its value grow.

Because people see an official-sounding name and think it's official and basically let them represent bitcoin.

I find it hilarious that this argument keeps coming back up while people will then say "omg fiat has nothing backing it". This is NOT the argument you want to make for using bitcoin. Otherwise, people can start saying crap like fiat has more "intrinsic value" because they can use it to buy anything from anywhere and can't do that with nearly any other unit of trade including bitcoin.

I don't have any bitcoin. Yes, I'm simply someone who's been following along with what's happening. I don't have bitcoin because I have absolutely no need for it - to buy things at places where I wouldn't otherwise shop is about all I'd use it for at this point. I DO however see the positive uses for it and would like to see it succeed, which is why posts like this come out of me here and there.

Without speculation, Bitcoin would still be at $50 or less (probably closer to $20 or $30) wouldn't have nearly the amount of press it's gotten, would have opened the door for other altcoins to gain steam over it, would have not been nearly as adopted as it's become and so on. Ironically, the speculation everyone around here loathes is part of what's securing bitcoin's success (assuming the "big crash" doesn't happen).
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:16:53

I had a bit of epiphany just now with reading your comment. There is obviously a finite supply of gold in existence. It may still be mined in some places, but it's an element and the earth contains a finite amount. Of course this aspect is what bitcoin was modeled after.
Now let's say that the entire world's currency becomes backed by gold and all the notes that can possibly be printed are printed such that the world's gold supply is represented by notes. What do you think would happen to the value of gold/those notes? Would continue going up, right?
Now look at the major fiat currencies. Like it or not, they have been stable in value and as such trusted to be used as currency, but inflationary as a whole and designed to be that way. Central banks even take measures to try and keep it at a certain inflationary rate.
What if for a currency to be stable, it needs to be inflationary as opposed to deflationary? There's obviously a spectrum, with Zimbabwean dollars amidst that whole hyperinflation mess on one end and bitcoin lately on the other. Currencies obviously need to operate somewhere in the middle - from slightly inflationary to slightly deflationary - to be stable. Major inflation causes problems as Zimbabwean dollar indicates and major deflation causes people not to trade it for goods which stops it from being a currency and possibly wrecks shit in the process depending on how much it's relied upon.
I'm sure there are probably economists that can or have weighed in on this but I'm just posing the question whether a currency that is at all deflationary can remain stable over the longterm in today's world. We know it could in yesterday's world but let's face it - the internet and virtuality of things has vastly changed the world and we've seen even how some technologies become worthless in a relatively short span of time.
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:57:07
*I* understand that about BitPay, but if bitcoin went through a major crash, there's the remote possibility that someone pays in bitcoin, some lag in the conversion happens and BitPay ends up paying a lot less USD than expected. Again, remote possibility and the more I read on here, the more I doubt something like that would happen (and I'm not sure people would be spending bitcoin on things during a crash anyways) but I'm sure you all know how it is - some people out there still see it as "fake money".

Zimbabwean currency went to nothing because it became absolutely unusable as currency because of the ridiculous changes in value (which in the case of it was inflation rather than deflation). The irony there is that you HAD to spend it IMMEDIATELY when you got it or you'd get half as much with it the next day or worse, so there was still an economy running with it, albeit a very unstable one given the situation.
Bitcoin's massive increases and these kinds of mini-crashes are too resulting in it becoming widely unusable as a currency. Many people are still using it because they believe in the idea of bitcoin and are trying to make it work, but as a percentage they are going further down and down with the mass of speculation entering into bitcoin. It's turning into an investment rather than a currency, and my point is it can't realistically be both in the end - for the reasons I outlined in the OP.
I don't have anything more to back it up than my thoughts and beliefs, but they're no less valid than people pointing to gold as proof that bitcoin is viable since it's modeled after gold.
@_date: 2013-10-03 07:38:10
It would be good if bitcoin enthusiasts would stop supporting the existence of such a black market and rather work harder for legitimate uses of bitcoin. Then again, unfortunately silk road and other not so legal stuff is a huge source of bitcoin economy, so it's understandable for bitcoin enthusiasts to support it. Kind of a catch 22 - the industry that most needs it is one that governments will always do what they can to hunt down and stop, and legitimate industries have yet to see a need for bitcoin aside from a tiny fraction of companies in various industries.

Isn't that what can be done with pretty much any new virtual currency? Isn't that in essence kind of what's happened with bitcoin albeit to a lesser extent and over a longer period of time? I mean doesn't Satoshi supposedly have a pretty large amount of bitcoin himself?
That's the problem even with bitcoin having essentially come out of thin air as well. Decentralized or not, anyone getting it early had really good incentive to get others to buy in. Unlike all these other altcoins though, others have bought in. The question is, is that what makes bitcoin better or what?
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:15:15

It was designed to be like gold in its scarcity. The problem with that is that perhaps in olden times, there was a need for metals like gold to be used as a currency because they were durable and widely known. Gold in and of itself does have other uses too, but we're in completely different times now and it's turned into an investment rather than a currency for the most part. Whether or not that's the reason why currencies changed from the gold standard to fiat, I have no clue. Perhaps gold only became investment after it stopped backing the world's currencies and I'm not boned up enough on history to know at least the publicly proclaimed reasons for the change. But I really don't see at this point how it can stabilize. It stabilized for a long time after the first big crash because people were tentative about investing in it - so the focus once more was its use as a currency. But here we are again, where the investment side of it is exploding. I just don't see how it can end well with that cycle continuing - it seems evidently clear that the free market is always going to creep back into investment side after crashes except for obviously after THE crash is if happens, when it's abandoned entirely and becomes worthless.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:16:18
I wonder if anyone can answer this - with people selling immediately after MtGox opens up, given someone has to buy for a sale to take place, doesn't that also mean someone is getting possibly unknowingly arbitraged out of a bunch of money? i.e. someone's getting an advantage and someone else is getting screwed?
Not sure I'd cheer about that...
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:00:00

The problem is that if it ever truly crashes to the point where it becomes abandoned, it will be dead, not dying. Zimbabwean dollars can at least be used as toilet paper, so they're minimally worth the paper they're printed on. An abandoned virtual currency wouldn't even be worth that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:10:25
For sure, wide adoption is needed for it to ever truly succeed as a currency, and perhaps that might stabilize it, but especially now with history being written on it and more and more of that history being dominated by speculation, that's becoming a taller order by the day.
People keep mentioning bitpay taking the risk out of accepting bitcoins, and perhaps it is designed to do that, but people are then assuming that it will work flawlessly as designed under all circumstances, including attacks like those that have been happening. I don't know how it works so I can't really comment on how possible that is except to say it's in the realm of possibility.

The thing is, to me as an outside observer, the more realistic dominant use of bitcoin is precisely that - not so much for tax evasion as there's plenty of ways to evade tax, but drugs and other illegal stuff. There is enough of a market of that stuff that it could live a long life with that purpose. As much as it can be useful as a more convenient international/online currency and I truly hope it becomes that at some point, for most people there's not a need to deal in anything other than the currency they already use for other things.
I do like the thought of convenience of merchant setup and the lower fees, but again - hard for a merchant to want to adopt it given its volatility. I wouldn't accept bitcoins for domains at this point, and case in point is the dip today - even if it comes back up, if I NEEDED that money in fiat urgently for business expenses, then I'd have effectively lost over 50% of what I received for it if I sold it before the crash happened. Additionally, in some cases that kind of decrease would cause not just lost profits but lost investment if what I ultimately convert back ends up being less than what I spent on what I sold. Especially with unique assets like domains, that's absolutely crushing and completely defeats any reason to use it.

How would it not be considered stealing if it's something other than money that is worth a certain amount of money?

Could be said by Enron before they went caput or by Facebook after the initial backlash of their IPO. One is worthless, the other has bounced back tremendously (albeit to overvaluation).
Right now, whether you like it for not, for most people currently owning bitcoin, it is an investment, not a currency. That's the problem. And all the investors are looking at current value, at the $280 peak and thinking "how did I fuck that up?" because most of them didn't sell at the peak and make gobs of money.

As much as he is all naysay and doesn't really have anything positive to say about bitcoin, there are a lot of points he makes that aren't entirely baseless that people here are quick to ignore. There's a spectrum with him on one end and the people who believe there are absolutely no issues with bitcoin on the other. As usual, there's a happy medium, which unfortunately are usually the types of people that are attacked here for bringing up issues that are legitimate issues about bitcoin.

IMO that's highly improbable on a wide scale. Almost everything bitcoin is used to buy is things that were initially bought with fiat money. No one wants to lose money, so they at the least have to base what they're selling by what they paid for it. If there's ever a point where a massive amount of things are only ever bought and sold using bitcoin, then that can happen, but how in the world would things ever reach that point? I just don't see it happening.

Funny, I just made a post to gauge potential interest in buying premium domain names with bitcoins as that's what we sell - hadn't noticed this thread.
NameCheap has done an impressive job with marketing and have been one of the top growing registrars as a result. It doesn't surprise me at all that they'd be among the first registrars to accept bitcoin, and I imagine it will work out well for them.

But bitcoin was deliberately designed like gold - deliberately designed to gain value over time due to scarcity. Also, to compare to gold then, "a period of years" vs. gold which has been mined for what, thousands of years? You could say gold is to bitcoin as bitcoin is to altcoins.
Forgive me if I'm wrong but I thought I saw somewhere Satoshi's holdings were at some point worth over a billion dollars. Do you think that because it took a whopping 3-4 years to realize that wealth that somehow bitcoin is an "accidental" version of these newer altcoins? Or is it just a slower version of them? The beautiful thing about the decentralization is that people have no idea who Satoshi is. If the day comes when he starts cashing out, the price tanks and bitcoin ends up crashing, then this glorious love of him will turn into absolute fury - and no one would have any idea who they'd be furious at.
Remember that it was still a new concept then, but bitcoin wasn't the first. A lot of people bitching because altcoins aren't the first, but neither was bitcoin. It's simply been the first decentralized one that's taken hold.

Is there really any way possible to truly convince someone that they could absolutely prevent any sort of insider trading? It's impossible to prevent - asking for a company to say to the contrary is simply silly.
They could block IPs and maybe even block outgoing communications from within their building, but I'd like to see them stop someone from going on their lunch break and taking the opportunity to tell a buddy to sell sell sell.

Good for you. I'm too am confident it will go up again. Can't imagine the killing some people made selling at the peak and rebuying when it crashed. There are lots of profit plays for sure in it. But not everyone has made money with it, and I think it's important to realize that rather than treating it like some infallible investment.

Show me a story that says credit unions will start charging people fees to deposit their money. Not that they're all devoid of fees, but many of them are, and on top of that, many operate on the free ATM network for fee-free ATM services, so you can't play that card either.

I will say that my biggest issue with Schiff is that he seems to hold the same position about gold that a lot of people here hold about bitcoin - extreme and blind bullishness, and I think as much as there is some validity to the uses of gold (which honestly his examples of necklaces n shit needs to be really updated - gold has many uses in a lot more important devices/machines etc. than a fucking necklace), he ignores the exact same thing he proclaims about bitcoin - it's valuable until it isn't. Written documentation of information and history has been around since humans existed on this planet, and now computers/tablets/phones and the like are starting to be the medium of choice. The once absolutely unimaginable thought that print media and especially print reference and news could be in jeopardy is coming to life before our eyes.
His answer to that is that there could be a virtual currency backed by gold, and then goes into weak ass arguments about why it'd be better, forgetting the golden rule that "whoever has the gold makes the rules". Ultimately his problem is that while he could be taking the stance that "there is no god", he's taking the stance that "all these other gods are wrong - mine is the one true god". Not good.
With that said, what if someone does develop a better digital currency, and there's enough of a fever over it that people who were adamant about bitcoin being the future go down with the ship while the new "Facebook" of virtual currency takes off? That is a very real issue, and mimics real issues with paper currencies. In saying that, your comment is actually right, which doesn't mean they aren't real arguments - if anything, that's exactly why they are real arguments. To say with absolute certainty that bitcoin is "the one" is pretty silly. Today's bitcoin being tomorrow's Zimbabwean dollar is still a very real possibility that people need to not lose sight of.
I deal in domain names - it's been my practice for close to 10 years. Look what's happening in the domain space now - hundreds, potentially thousands of new extensions coming out. .com will still be the king - for now. Anyone saying with absolute certainty that it will remain the king in the future or even that domain names themselves won't be completely overhauled sometime in the future is lying to everyone and themselves. We don't know what will happen. As much as almost everyone in the domain industry, myself included, feels that they won't have a major impact for quite some time, it's already had an impact on the domain market. I know because I used to make most of my living selling domains to other domain speculators, and over the past couple years since this new GTLD plan came into fruition, the reseller market has REALLY softened - enough to where I abandoned it entirely, and thank hell I did before I "went down with the ship", not being able to get my money out of my holdings and having no backup plan.
Bitcoin isn't without its risks. Some of them people can do something about. Some of them people can't. The sooner people here face that fact and get off this "only say positive things about bitcoin" stance, the sooner the discussions here will mature and potentially lead to ideas that will help it succeed.

Have you never seen the movie Boiler Room? If someone put their savings into bitcoin when it was over $1,000, especially if they were hoping for quick gains to cash out in weeks/months and use the money, a crash that wipes out half the value or more is very serious to them. A lot of people are getting into this not fully understanding what it is but because they've seen ridiculous gains over recent times, which is perfectly understandable and human. So a crash like this all of a sudden makes them feel like they were taken, even if they weren't. It certainly doesn't help that most of the bitcoin community acts like a cult.
Stop assuming everyone bought in at the beginning of the year and realize that with all the price rise and press over the past year, the majority of people getting into bitcoin are more recent. And THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL WANTED. These are people you WANT to support, unless of course you DON'T want bitcoin to succeed, in which case so be it - hate all the newbs and laugh at the suicide hotline posts and have fun doing that.

That said (and I agree - Schiff would start to speak 5-10 seconds into every time Stefan spoke), there was the one time early on where Stefan rattled off about 8-10 points in constant talking before he let Schiff respond (a la Bill O'Reilly sometimes). That's no better than interrupting someone. I was kind of worried about the rest of the interview after that, but it was just that one time thankfully.

The fact that an attack can have any kind of major effect on the value is really not good, and there are most certainly people involved in it pulling the strings and playing bitcoin like a fiddle for massive gains. As long as it remains profitable for them to do it, it will keep happening, and this sort of thing will turn merchants away from using it which will weaken its underlying value as a currency.

The "MySpace" effect - if the public ever starts getting bored of covering it, if businesses start ignoring it more rather than less and less over time, etc. - anything that would cause the only holders to be the same people here that say that this shutdown means bitcoin will go up shitloads, as they'll be saying "it'll go back up, just you wait!" if and when it torpedoes down. Posting graphs showing the last time it was $1 and what happened after, then the last time it was $0.01 and what happened after, etc.

1. Your post is asking a whole bunch of stupid questions. No one can predict shit, even long-term. There are long-term bulls here as well as some people who believe it'll eventually crash into nothingness, and even both of those opinions aren't without merit.
2. You are representative of so many posts here when bitcoin surges and/or crashes - the extreme speculator.
3. You don't actually contribute anything with this post - simply make demands that expert analysis is needed, when a true expert likely wouldn't tell anyone anything if they had a clue how to predict this market. Why would they?
I've not invested in bitcoin, merely taken an interest in it this past year. I think it can be long-term viable, but I have no reason to buy bitcoin right now. Ironically my primary business is in domain names, another virtual piece of investment, and I feel much more comfortable with that. I have no reason to spend bitcoin vs. $ as everything I need I can buy in $. Anyways, that all is besides the point, because you know damn well your post was "experts, come in here and help us all make money" - aka "experts, come in here and help me make money".

The average person doesn't get into bitcoin for one or more of 4 reasons:
1. They're afraid to use it or simply thing it will crash since it's completely virtual, copycats come about so easily and they may have heard of things like Liberty Reserve and e-Gold crashing down in the past and think of bitcoin in the same way regardless of the differences. The periodic price crashes, even if they are to "last week's price", doesn't help that cause. There's never been a case where their dollar one day buys 50 cents or less worth of stuff the next.
2. They're not afraid to use it but don't see a reason to use it, perhaps only see it as a way to hide buying drugs and nothing more.
3. Even if they saw a reason to use it and would like to, they don't know how, or they're afraid they'll somehow lose their wallet or it'll get compromised like what's happened to various people.
4. Even if they knew how to use it and are confident their money is secure, many of the places they'd like to use it don't accept it. Yea they might be able to get a Gyft card, but then that goes back to  - why use it to add extra steps to an otherwise easy purchase?
Sure, a lot of people here can rattle off rebuttal after rebuttal to these reasons, but there they are - still why the average person doesn't use bitcoin. To ignore that and just call the average person an idiot is being the bigger idiot.
