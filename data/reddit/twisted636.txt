Hi im coinbase_rick i see you think our prices are too high. well we think that the extra $10usd mark up per bitcoin and our new raised fees are perfectly fine. Remember use bitcoin dont let banks screw you all those extra fees.

Would I just move the wallet.dat in place of the default one?
would it need to synchronize before it shows anything?

Wait until there is a shortage of coins then watch the price. One day we will see coinbase and other exchanges not be able to fill orders due to limited supply. That will allow people to sell at extremely high prices. Basic supply and demand. 21million coins 7.5billion people. 
It's fun to watch exchanges go up in price as more people buy in but when you can start using bitcoin is when the price will really take off.

The "solo mining" setup shows you are using a pool; so inst that pool mining?

I was on board with Bitcoin unlimited before but I have to tip my hat to this guy for finding asicboost.

Bitcoin is already centralized, to mine with any profit you HAVE to use a mining pool. That puts centralization in the hands of about 5 people since some people own multiple pools. Also the core development team is a central location.

I saw a few of your post the other day, where did you find the miner at? With the S1 you will be mining at a loss due to electrical costs, if you are young and maybe living at home then your parents will be paying the cost of electricity. However I will HIGHLY recommend not leaving that miner running when you are not home; from the looks and age it would be a serious fire hazard.

BTC had years to fix it's protocol; now the wolves are out. It will be death by 1000 cuts. This will be down voted like crazy on this board because most people on this board are moonkids here for the price. If you want to read honest info on what is going on check The end of bitcoin has already started if people want to see it or not but once segwit2x happens and that sell off hits you will see it's game over.

To be honest this guy is either 
A) a useful idiot
B) looking to push a new cryptocurrenty besides bitcoin

If you are new you should use a service like Coinbase to buy. It's easy to setup and links to your bank or credit card. Personally for new people I would recommend keeping the bitcoin on the coinbase website until you can get a hardware wallet to move it to. Make sure you backup the private keys for the wallet and keep it some place safe.

You made no points in your post just name calling. Try again; start with why it's a shitcoin, why people who support it are clowns, how r/btc is a bunch of morons. Name calling is not advise.

Before the website went down I was watching a bunch of buy and sell orders for less then a penny going off not sure if that has anything to do with it but it looked weird. They just kept coming in buy oders for 0.000002 over and over. the same would happen on sell orders too.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:48:42
Yesterday on polo there was an order for 1.5million opened in the buy orders it was very under priced but yes people do hold a ton of money on these exchanged. It's not smart but they do it. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:39:17
1hr later and you may see the under 1800 price. Currently $1879 on polo
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:28:09
I think this is spot on I just wanted to add one more thing. Alot of the big sell ordered would get pulled once more sell orders opened with a lower price. So you would see a large 200btc order open then a ton of smaller 1-20 btc orders open for less then that. They keep the big 200btc order open if it gets close to really selling the btc they pull it let the price go back up and then repeat. I watched it happen the past few days multiple times. I got to the point I could almost pick out the orders that would be pulled before they really sold. There is so much dumb money in crypto right now just look at some youtube videos everyone thinks they are traders and when the price drops a bit they all jump in and try to sell. 
* edit: I also would like to say this is not over I think we will see this keep happening until the weak hands exit or the people behind this finally take the profits. Personally I don't think its far off to say we could see the price go under $1k before it stops.
