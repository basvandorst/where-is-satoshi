SCP-9011:  Bitcoin wallet
Class: Euclid
"A $1000 laptop solely for Bitcoin transactions, which must never be connected to the internet...."
Honestly, SCP creepypasta is increasingly what this type of advice reminds me of. :)

Does the integration with Coinbase mean that people retain control over their own BTC, and not have to create a PayPal specific wallet?
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:16:54
There's also selective element blocking on Adblock :-)

RT will no doubt put out negative messaging about Bitcoin as long as the latter is opposed by the Russian government.
Edit: thanks Putinbots!  xx

Which are clearly shown in the classic bomb shape with a fuse sticking out them. :P
I'd tend to agree with the caution expressed here. But hey, it's not like it's the official logo of Bitcoin, and it's street art, which is often more edgy anyway.
@_date: 2014-11-10 09:07:22
Agreed, I received a phishing email in the weekend which pretended to be one of those "agree to our new terms and conditions plox" messages, checked with Coinbase support without clicking it and they confirmed it was a scam.

He was fortunate his insurance agreed to cover it, then (even if only 50%) - health insurance companies always seem to try to exclude "existing conditions".

Where I live we now have to present driver's licence and proof of residence for every WU transaction. Further information is required if the value is over $1000.

I've seen a number of posters on this sub alone who had claimed to have lost tens of thousands of USD equivalent because of Gox etc, losing their life savings, even worrying about their marriages as a result.

I thought that was AuroraCoin?

I worked in IT support from the late 80s through to the early 00's, and I distinctly remember in the early 1990s a (middle-aged) office worker saying to me "why would I need email when I have a phone on my desk?"

I got chills when he said "bitcoin is not internet money. It's the internet of money."
I also thought his analogy of regulating the early internet with CB radio licenses was particularly apt.

That's what's worrying me.  And not everyone has the time to spend 6 months properly learning another OS, however awesomesauce it is compared to Windows.
I'm thinking something like the Trezor is a better bet.

I wouldn't call myself a "hodler", but I started buying a small amount since February, when the price was about $800-900. I stopped buying when I saw the price wasn't going to the moon (and because I needed to save for something else).

No matter, the website dev will no doubt steal their idea and make a fortune through his own website. A few years later there'll be a movie about it.

A similar difference as there is between $1 and $10,000 in fact.

What is the word in the Vice video that chinese speakers use for Bitcoin, does anyone know?
Never mind - answered my own question: 比特币 or "Bǐtè bì" in pinyin.

Has it fixed the weird bug that sometimes doesn't update the number of recent confirmations in the transaction history until the wallet is reopened?
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:34:27
Make sure your website has sufficient visibility of bitcoin so that when someone searches for "bitcoin" in Google maps in their local area, your business is one of the ones that comes up.

FTFY. Also, he would know about not paying debts, [because he failed to pay his contractors until the media made a big issue of it](

On the other hand, some VPN services used to access Netflix from outside the US accept bitcoin :)
