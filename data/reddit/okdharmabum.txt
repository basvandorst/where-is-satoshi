Can you not change the limit on the bandwidth?

Living in Korea, this has been about as "on the radar" and DPRK attack. I've been getting my updates online because no Koreans I interact with have really heard of if or care. Much bigger in Seoul, I'm sure.

I'd like to know how to do the same on a rasberry-pi node

Yeah I'll be curious to see if issues arise in April after the first real money is being seen this year.

Underrated comment. You win.

Totally. Not asking for the steps involved, as that's part of the challenge/joy of this kind of project. Thank you for sharing, as I've been trying to decide for a while now if I should buy a kit or individual pieces to build something similar. Cheers!

Details on this setup, please? Would love to build something similar to display several different real-time screens, and your looks awesome.

I've been looking at that 2.8" display as well but dont like the case they normally suggest that is black. Your case, does the blue board fit snugly?

Ouch. Last year I paid four hundred to have a hard drive successfully recovered by a forensic lab. It was only pictures and videos from my past five years of travel, but I still can't bring myself to throw out the recovered hardware even after having it all backed up and made redundant. Mine didn't even have bitcoin on it, but I immediately realized how important backups are.

Keeping btc savings on ledger, spending smaller balance from mobile app?

Same here. Did you go legacy or segwit?
