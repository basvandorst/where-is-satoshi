I bought a Trezor I have buyers remorse Ledger is better because of coin support Trezor forces you to buy newer models. Also the shipping price on the Trezor was ridiculous.

I'm guessing you're just wanting to get rich off Bitcoin? Did you transfer from Wall Street?

10 years ago this would have been an acceptable response I would have agreed with. Now it looks like a ploy to pander to a new market and try to stir a buzz. Car dealerships are scumbags.
