You'd be surprised how many invalid blocks make it through the things that don't validate like the relay network. Certain block explorers frequently show results of completely invalid blocks. This mostly comes from miners running things which aren't really validating Bitcoin nodes, most recently a Chinese pool broadcast a PoW-valid block which contained transactions spending outputs that don't exist. Bitcoin Core runs a validation over block templates it produces so this software isn't capable of making invalid blocks.

BitGo has a blog post announcing that they'll enable it for all customers soon, I believe other wallets do have support but not enabled yet. Bitcoin Core does support making SegWit transactions, but I don't think the front facing wallet uses them by default just yet. Wait a few days for the dust to settle and people will likely be talking about this more.

Segwit is a block size increase to 4MB, more like 2MB with normal use.

No, they can be 4MB. 2.7 is an estimate for how much they'd be utilised by the current mix of transactions (multisig transactions take up a little more space than non multisig ones, for example due to the number of signatures involved).

You'll notice that all of the coup attempts do the same thing, they branch and never merge more than a handful of patches from other implementations. BCH went out of their way to make their client incompatible with rebased commits, altering tens of thousands of lines of the codebase with manual and automated whitespace changes (probably). I wasn't able to confirm that all of their changes didn't change behaviour, but there's literally 100,000 changes between BCH and Bitcoin Core they forked from less than 2 months ago.

SegWit is already a doubling of the block size without being a hard fork. 


Nope. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:17:45
It alters consensus parameters, one of which is the block size. This is a hard fork change which is backwards incompatible with every validating Bitcoin node (it's kind of only partially compatible with Bitcoin Unlimited / Bitcoin Classic and that tripe). There's not even a specification for what things are changed in this client, it's just a large block of random consensus changes and no proper releases. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:17:15
Still an interesting bit of trivia, there's lots of pitfalls in the bitcoin block format. As you've no doubt learned the amount of data hashed is always the same, unrelated to the number of transactions contained in a block. It's always 80 bytes, padded to 128 bytes as part of SHA256. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:21:01


It will be an artifacts of whatever custom software they're using, we'll never know unless they come right out and say it. Many miners do cheats to attempt to get around the fact that even 1MB blocks are very slow to make their way through the bitcoin network, which results in effects like this. 


There's an incentive towards using systems like lightning, which do have their disadvantages but aren't centralized, don't have a risk to the user, and allow for a significant amount of privacy improvement over regulat Bitcoin.

No, it didn't. This is a pretty muddy definition and none of the descriptions at the time did a good job of describing it. No version of Bitcoin below 0.7 was internally consistent, depending on the way in which it synced it would find the consensus rules to be different. The biggest impacter was stale blocks, if you did any reorganisations on the way to the head of the chain you would run out of BerkeleyDB locks more quickly and fail earlier. 0.8 returned the rules to a consistent state by removing BerkeleyDB entirely, but the fixing (and discovering of the messed up consensus rules) was entirely accidental. Even if 0.8 had not been released, the network would still have fragmented with anything larger than a 500KB block (which slush was responsible for mining, in this case).
Just to make a point of this, you can sync a default 0.7 node past the point of the "fork" if you are careful with managing how it is syncing. If it were a real hard fork, there would be no situation in which it would pass (say, if it considered a particular block invalid due to a specific rule), where in this case it's nodes randomly imparting new and unexpected limitations on the sizes of blocks due to their internal database configuration. The instructions given at the time to increase locks to make &lt;= 0.7 nodes compatible is almost certainly wrong, I tried this recently and couldn't get to the modern chip of the chain under any circumstances. We'd have hit these issues very soon even without slush mining a large enough block to trigger the issue using his custom node software.

Pruning has existed for years and is even available in the GUI.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:22:46
It does in a way, it makes it very cheap to make large transaction graphs which aren't necessarily shared with anybody. Unlike in Bitcoin where all parties can see all transactions, in lightning only the parties to a channel actually need to share anything. The speed of the network means you can do casual privacy transactions as you please, just in the background swap some coins with someone, you've now just muddled the transaction graph even more. This isn't really possible with Bitcoin due to the high latency of block confirmations among other things.

The minimum viable size doesn't have any room for altering the coinbase, which would make modern mining extremely inefficient, on the plus side it would make covert asicboost impossible if you only produced minimal blocks in this fashion.

Segwit is a soft fork, it's backwards compatible with all the nodes which exist in the network and all software which is in use today. You can download a copy of 0.8 from 5 years ago and it'll sync no problem at all. BCH is a hard fork, no validating software is compatible with it, all wallet software has to be altered to work on their network, everybody has to change their software to use it. 


They do, Segwit absolutely reduces the ability for Bitcoin to be decentralized. The has other features (like UTXO pressure reducing) which hopefully offset this, combined with the orders of magnitude performance increases in Bitcoin Core in the last few releases, perhaps the effect won't be noticeable. The simple fact remains that bigger blocks are bigger though, and this does have a significant cost (I don't run well, any nodes on residential connections anymore). 


Signatures are not removed, this is just nonsense which has come from segwit detractors. If there was no signatures how could the network be validated to be correct? Miners could just blindly steal from anybody, there's been no trust in miners like this in any release of bitcoin, or indeed any cryptocurrency system because that would be completely and utterly nuts. 
Segwit accounts for the signature space differently to how it used to be in Bitcoin, where signatures are still part of blocks but are counted less towards the 1MB limit. This reduces an effect where it is cheaper to bloat the UTXO (a storage of unspent transaction data), than to clean it up. This is due to the output (destination) of a transaction being a lot smaller than the input (signatures, other data). By moving the sizes to be more in line with one another there's less incentive to just bloat the UTXO store, and more incentive to clean it up. The UTXO is the only part of the validating data that can't be removed after you've check that it's alright, so this is a very important change to be made in bitcoin.

No SegWit transaction involves "separating signatures". 


Most of the contents of a block is signatures, so weighting this data differently frees up a significant portion of the block space (often more than half looking at recent blocks).

No, "clearing a backlog" an impossibility. If I make 5000 MB of transactions right now, paying 1 satoshi in fees each, does this mean they are viable and reasonable for inclusion in the block chain? Of course not, the reason we have things like a block size limit is because the system simply can't be all inclusive. Segwit is a calculated increase to the base capacity of the network, while acknowledging that the ability for the network to be decentralized will take a hit due to the increased resource usage.

No, for compatibility at the moment all SegWit outputs are P2SH encoded.

You however can always receive funds from a segwit active wallet, and receive funds from a segwit active wallet.

Bitcoin Cash has been explicitly designed without the systems in place that allow for efficient use of the Lightning network (namely a unintended transaction malleability fix). They retained the BIP143 (segwit) transaction signature methods however, this is the most part of their modifications which make it incompatible with Bitcoin Core on a transaction format level. The rest were removed in some [hundred thousand plus]( changes in Bitcoin Cash in the month since it diverged from the Bitcoin Core codebase, I'll forgive you for missing them. If you would like to see the changes yourself, they're spread over at least 15 commits most of which are named "kill segwit". 
``` 551 files changed, 54159 insertions(+), 47974 deletions(-)```


The [codebase exists]( ), it has [active development]( and has been [successfully been used on Litecoin]( Competent development is done in test networks without real money, so of course it's been extensively developed there rather than waiting for anybody in particular to activate it on the main chain. 


Nobody is claiming otherwise, the existence of Lightning will lower the transaction rate on the main network however. The same way introducing busses reduces demand for cars on the road, having an alternative for some transaction forms will lessen the load on the main network. This effect is actually even a little reversed, Lighting and other payment channel technologies actually make viable previously completely illogical use cases, you can even send sub-satoshi amounts.

It should about double, but if people move to using very large multisig transactions it may quadruple. 


It's always going to be the same. BCH largely copied the SegWit signature scheme and called it their own, but they just don't do things like the witness commitments or block weights at all.

Signatures are not compressed, everything remains the same size as it used to be. There is now a lot more room in blocks, but the majority of it is only available to be used by signatures (and not other parts of a transaction). 


Probably 2MB of transactions normally, but this may change as people are able to use multisig a lot more effectively now. Miners have a bunch of strange incentives, one of which being the larger the block the longer it takes to make it around the network, but more recent upgrades with things like the FIBRE network make this less of an impact. 


Who knows.

You should tell that to Satoshi, who explicitly designed payment channels into Bitcoin 0.1 with sequence numbers for on the fly transaction replacement.

All running Insight, not all running the same consensus rules. That said, it doesn't have any support for SegWit baked into the software so things aren't as clean as they probably should be when using Insight. Luckily there's no specific vendor lock in here, anybody can go an add support in their own fork (like Trezor did for BCH support in their wallet), or completely replace it with something entirely better if they so choose. Given that they're fraudulently shilling for their unnecessary SegWit2x hard fork they should probably at least take the time to implement SegWit support in their own software, but there's not a lot of logic going on here.

Those transactions were literally designed to fill blocks, many of the exchanges use large m-of-n just because it's useful, Copay has a system which allows you to delegate control of your wallet to many people within your company and spread risk, with each of them validating transactions that go out of their wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:58:46
If this happens it basically destroys all perception of Bitcoin being an operable system, besides almost all of the nodes are running segwit validating software. Funny business results in denial of service not loss of funds.

They don't though, as a hard fork their blocks are literally invalid.

I don't really understand the question. There's no way in the world that people should be using deception to try and change the rules of Bitcoin, take for example Bitpay urging their users to "upgrade" their software without mentioning that it is literally incompatible with the Bitcoin that they've been using for the past 7 years. If you mean to say that I'm being deceptive, I'm most certainly not. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:49:17
This only half works as you expect, you can make a transaction with SegWit features paying to a P2PKH address, but that won't make the recipient need a SegWit compatible wallet themselves.

JoinMarket and other systems have a lot of bloat in the form of signatures, SegWit is advantageous for them to use due to the way the ScriptSig (where signatures are stored) is weighted.

Segwit2x? It is quite literally an attempt to take over control of Bitcoin, there's no technical or logical reason for it to happen, and it's been designed intentionally (by not including mandatory replay protection) to cause the maximum amount of disruption. Repeating claims like "everybody supports this" and calling the blockchain "legacy" are examples of a manipulative campaign which is designed to coerce people into accepting Segwit2x without making an informed decision. 
The claimed benefit and reasoning for 2x is that it makes the block size 8MB from 4MB with a very disruptive hard fork that requires all participants to change their software to something incompatible in a couple of months time, which simply isn't happening.

This is complete and utter nonsense, even if it wasn't this is no way to deal with it. If you're telling people to run something with wildly different consensus rules you don't call it "Bitcoin". Same way Litecoin isn't called Bitcoin, and Ethereum isn't called Bitcoin.

This is a very american-centric view of the world, you're just trying to make the values conform to the sorts of things your immediately used to. Bitcoin is extremely unlike anything else you could use, I don't know why the currency amounts should match that as well. Thankfully the currency unit has nothing to do with the consensus rules, you can make amounts under any name you want and use them wherever you want.

This would be a pretty bad idea, no wallet would know to scan for these so as far as anybody is concerned they never got paid anything. You can wrap a normal P2PKH as a P2SH if you feel like in the same way, but no software other than Bitcoin Core can recognise those outputs (and only in certain situations).

You can use it by manually configuring the settings to point to a consensus compatible node, but out of the box no, it won't work. You can easily move to a client like Electrum or Bread though and have roughly the same feature set.

After lock in the UASF section is irrelevant, all Bitcoin Core nodes above 0.13.1 (two years old now) will enforce the SegWit ruleset. Miners are including the commitments in their coinbase transactions already, it's very unlikely that they are false signalling.

@_date: 2017-08-08 03:14:19


There is an incentive to use SegWit for a lot of applications, so they will switch to them (for example JoinMarket with large signatures, multisig wallets with large spend scripts). This eases the load on the normal block space. 


This is incorrect, there's a lot of reasons to use SegWit today. For one, it drastically reduces the amount of data needed to use a hardware wallet, the Trezor developer has talked about this being a critical fix. After the soft fork, signatures commit to the BTC values they are signing which drastically reduces the attack surface for hardware wallet (which today can either choose to need perhaps megabytes of data per signatures, or risk an attack where a malicious source of information can destroy your money into fees). 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:48:55
The "nodes" are not running on standard ports, the address manager will basically never connect to them as a result. Even if they weren't all in tight IP ranges (which also won't be considered), they'd almost never be selected except as a last resort.

If a quantum computer exists, which it doesn't, it maybe never will. 


Any break of ECDSA with a quantum computer would likely be gradual weakening rather than suddenly everything falling to pieces. You can soft fork in quantum safe crypto, move outputs, destroy all the remaining ones after a long time frame. It's a disaster but not totally the end of the system. Quantum safe cryptography totally sucks in the efficiency department, think signatures 8000 times larger than ECDSA.

The whole point of this patch is that the network doesn't suddenly bifurcate on a flag day. When BCH forked away from the main chain they struggled to find any peers due to the developers misunderstanding how the DNS priorities work. They essentially had to connect to random nodes in the network, relay a bad transaction, and get banned, eventually hopefully finding another node running their modified consensus rules. For comparison purposes I have a BCH node running, it made thousands of bad attempts at finding someone to talk to before it managed to get a set of peers to relay it blocks. The developers of BCH attempted to prevent this by turning on `forcednsseed`, but this just causes the DNS seeder to run (but there's no guarantee those peers will ever be used, they're scored a lot lower than peer you already know about). They also implemented `NODE_CASH` as a service bit but didn't do anything with it that would cause nodes to preferentially peer with things it likes.

Read the quote you're treating as gospel again. Satoshi is correcting a horrific idea (people randomly falling out of consensus by changing the local rules) with something more sensible.

Most are, not all, much of the chain size (though this is becoming less significant) is still in uncompressed keys which are trivial to compress. You can still save an extra byte on every compressed key by defining the sign of y in your bit packing. 


Just normal bit packing stuff gets you a long way, almost all scripts are in either P2SH, P2PK, or P2PKH format so you can heavily optimise for just those happening. Pack the version fields into maybe a byte each (they're 31 bits long maximum due to the high bit being soft forked out). 
It's tempting to introduce layer violations, but don't pack anything further than the transaction or block level, you don't want things using your encoder to have to do arbitrary lookups of data they don't necessarily have. Define a static dictionary versioned with the packer if you want to compress out something like the satoshi dice keys.

@_date: 2017-04-17 09:27:42
It doesn't really divert more computing power to it, it offloads the issue to hoping that the majority of the hash rate won't include extremely tough to validate blocks in the main chain. There's already blocks in the main chain that exploit this unfortunately, this happened last year unintentionally when f2pool mined a block that spent a very large number of dust outputs in a single 1MB transaction. 
There's definitely better ways to go about this, BIP109 originally specified some (in my opinion ill advised) hard limits on transaction format to prevent the quadratic increases being an issue. The limits weren't very well justified and would probably have caused problems down the road had anybody ever adhered to them, these were removed in the only implementation of the BIP however, leaving no protection to speak of. Adding a OP_CHECKSIG2 to Bitcoin that didn't have quadratic blowups in the validation is also completely possible, where OP_CHECKSIG would eventually be deprecated for all but spending already existing outputs.

Yes, effectively. The efficiency gains are probably less than 30% in reality from ASICBOOST, but the software on the public machines is also extremely inefficient in the way it manages the string voltages. People experimenting with the software on the S9 claim to have got 20% efficiency independently of ASICBOOST by controlling the ASICs properly. It's possible their private farms are using both the proper control and ASICBOOST for very large efficiency gains over what they are selling publicly.

There's two versions in the Bitmain hardware. 
* One is overt, in the released software, and has partial stratum method avaliable. It's very obvious if this has ever been used and it hasn't. Its existence in the software can only be found by poking around in the binaries on the miner, it's not mentioned in public anywhere. 
* One covert and is present in the hardware only, and would require different software than is on the publicly shipping hardware. This is by all measures not easily detectable, but preventable.

Changes to the structure of validation and the network flow need care and attention because they are such critical parts of the client. The linked patch is the opposite, touching a thousand lines of code over 24 commits, additional locks, multiple threads, multiple copies of the UTXO, and changes some of the paths by which transactions are validated. It's extremely difficult to get this sort of change written in such a way that is justifiable to a reviewer, and this patch set simply isn't that. 
The original patch could throw an assert during block connecting as a testament to that.

@_date: 2017-04-05 23:29:59
This is correct. The software contains no support for the covert form of ASICBOOST, but the hardware does. There's some visible evidence of this as the shipping hardware using a large Zynq FPGA+CPU combination which is doing very little in the hardware being used publicly.

Not really, neither you nor I have actually done any review here. I have read the patch, but that doesn't mean I've reviewed it. There's many hours of work there understanding the new pieces of logic, how all of the pieces work under attack, and non attack situations. Simply reading the code as you've done isn't even scratching the surface, you need a deep familiarity with how the validation logic interacts. 
It's often overlooked but reviewing even a couple of lines of change can be orders of magnitude more difficult than writing it in the first place. Quality control is very much invisible because done properly, it's completely unmentioned how much work has gone into making sure a piece of software is safe. 
That said however, unreviewable code is unreviewable code, you don't need to do deep analysis to see that. I've made specific complaints about why this code is unreviewable [here]( beyond the amount of understanding of the rest of the code base needed to even begin to understand its interactions.

Observing one block will not tell you if it is using the covert form of ASICBOOST or not, it's possibly statistically recoverable depending on the method being used, but there's many variations. The overt form would be visible in seemingly random high version bits in the header which imply that they have been used to grind for merkle root collisions.

Generally it's held that SHA256 is not going to be weakened any time in the near future. There is no cryptographic hash function (even MD5, SHA1) which has been found insecure enough that it could not be used as the proof of work function in Bitcoin, though they're probably a bit short for the use it has now (we've done over 86 bits of work now).  


The exploit is in the way Bitcoin places the merkle root in the block header intersecting two block boundaries. There's no weakness in Bitcoin itself, in alpha versions of Bitcoin.exe there was no version field in the header which meant the merkle root sat entirely in the first 64 byte block. If no version number had been added to the header before the 0.1 release of Bitcoin ASICBOOST would not be possible.

Joseph Poon implies on the bitcoin-dev mailing list to be unaware of it, but the design and existence of the "extension blocks" code does seem to lend itself to this purpose almost explicitly. There's absolutely no reason to not have SegWit on the main chain for example, it completely ruins a lot of the benefit. Hardware wallets which wish to make usage of the value commitments would only be able to work on the extension block rather than the main block which makes this a complete non-starter.

The procedure doing the second HTTP request is named isAuthToRun, so this seems to be similar to the antbleed functions, though this is in a different binary. It appears to make the call to bitmain.com with details of the hash boards and the MAC address, and returns a yes or no if the device is allowed to mine or not. I can't seem to be able to capture the software making a request out, so it's probably not enabled in this version or is only triggered under some condition I'm not aware of. The remote server exists however, and does seem to return good/bad responses for various combinations of inputs.

The code connected to that proposal is a nightmare.

It's possibly detectable if there's very specific statistical variations in the way blocks have their transactions laid out, for example you can't swap certain levels of the merkle tree in blocks if there are dependant child transactions that have to exist in a certain order.

Long term any blocks with a low reward and no transactions will be instantly stale. After a point in the reward schedule (remember it is effectively zero sooner than you'd think), it becomes better to re-mine all the transactions in the block below you and take their fees than to mine one at height + 1. Unless you are hampered by the simple fact that there is no more space in your block, rational miners constantly re-mine the same block with increasingly more and more fees in it and never make forward progress.

Breaking it up into a couple of logical pieces (seperate commits) which have constrained effects would make it easier to parse to begin with. As it stands there's a significant number (of the 24 total) that could either have been squashed, or shouldn't have existed at all. 
* [Merge branch 'dev' into dev_parallel](
* [Fix bad rebase](
* [Fix merge conflict in thinblock.cpp](
* [fix bug where an unsolved block's height is improperly updated based](
Some of these are bug fixes for earlier commits, some are just rebases, then fixes of the rebases, most don't have meaningful titles or descriptions. Introducing bugs and then fixing them all in the same giant pull request makes it hard to work out what's going on. Two commits named "documentation changes" actually have code changes in them as well.

Stratum is just line delimited JSON over TCP. Normal implementations in `cgminer`etc don't allow you to change the version in a block header either, but the BitMain extension provides a `mining.multiversion`message which does for use with the overt version of ASICBOOST. Similarly luke-jr's pool allows you to request the whole merkle tree over stratum to do basic validation of it.

That's not how BitShare worked. BitShare either let you give 100% of the rewards to 21.co (how it operated in the 21 Bitcoin Computer), or it hardcoded the outputs to force a significant portion of the mined BTC to be sent to them, and a remainder sent to the person mining with the chip.

* Block at height 2 has 500 transactions and makes 2 BTC in fees. 
* There are 500 new unconfirmed transactions with 2 BTC of fees. 
The logical thing, given enough space and no block reward, is to mine a new block at height 2 that claims both the transactions in the old one, and the new transactions that have come in. You make 4 BTC, not 2 BTC is if you'd mined a height 3 block.

I live in one of the richest countries in the world and running a Bitcoin node trashes my connection, it's a false equivalence to say that it's only "third world countries" that suffer from this sort of effect. A good portion of the US still uses ADSL connections, which is pretty stark when you go and tell them to download 150GB of data for the full blockchain (almost a day).

The attack surface of TLS is completely insane, there's a good reason there's been years of work in removing OpenSSL from Bitcoin. Significantly more relevant, more secure, and actually reviewable encryption for the p2p traffic are possible but they won't prevent node connections from being trivially detectable. As I described in another comment, the GFW does active probing so encrypting the content of the protocol does absolutely nothing. The GFW probes will connect out pretending to be a user, do a Bitcoin handshake and the game is over, SSL solves nothing for this application at all as an anonymous rumouring network can not possibly be authenticating its peers.

A majority miner can re-write transactions, they can't steal money. Miners being able to change consensus rules is a property that Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited have, it's not one that Bitcoin has ever had. If 99% of the hashrate is making blocks that pay themselves $10M each, or re-write invalid payments to steal from you, good for them! They're spending money to make invalid blocks that are rejected by your validating node, and all the other validating nodes on the network.

Once you have a good connection to the network, you build your own internal view of who is available to connect to, and the sorts of peers that relay you good quality information. You'll preferentially connect to people you have before and try to maintain those connections as long as possible. If you don't know any peers there's a fixed set of DNS names you can lookup without exposing much information about yourself (DNS requests are kind of anonymous), and they'll return some useful addresses you might be able to connect to. Only if you have no known useful peers, and the DNS lookups all fail, do you connect to the hard coded seeds (several hundred peers with their addresses baked into the binary). If we're honest if you get to that point you're kind of screwed anyway, you're unlikely to ever find good peers. 


FIBRE traffic uses a very limited number of hosts, it's perhaps slightly less likely to be blocked due to it being more obscure, but there's nothing intrinsic about it that makes it more likely to be stable. It's designed for extremely low latency transfers, not low bandwidth or censorship resistance.

No, sorry. It reduces connection quality to connect to peers knowingly that will at a certain date all become unavailable. BCash nodes seriously struggled to find peers due to misbehaviour like this, it took hours or days of wandering around being banned before they could peer with each other. Bitcoin Core prefers to make very long lived, high quality peers that promptly relay valid data, and this includes knowing the date at which they will suddenly stop, and being proactive about not bothering with those.

This isn't a political statement, it doesn't make the network faster, it doesn't really do anything observable; it just an attempt to improve peer quality by not bothering to make connections with people that are declaring they are running incompatible software which will eventually be junk. The software will do this already when it sees invalid peers.

It doesn't help with the Great Firewall at all. 


It's removed from almost everything actually, you can't use RPC over TLS now for example. The only place it's used is in the completely worthless BIP70 payment protocol (it's essentially unused at this point due to it's huge complexity, difficult to use semantics), so it's needed for the GUI in the normal builds but not in `bitcoind`. 


I didn't say broken, they have a massive, unauditable attack surface though. Hundreds of hash algorithms, key exchange systems, ciphers, messages and responses, serialisation methods most people have never heard of exist in most TLS implementations. There's no need to use something as huge as that when you can build something lean, focused, and specific to Bitcoin with fast primitive. Heartbleed for example affected Bitcoin through the RPC+SSL socket interface, you could read out private keys if you enabled and exposed that innocuous option. It's completely unacceptable to even consider using this in the TCP network. 


It doesn't matter, in an anonymous rumour network you can't have proper peer authentication, every connection can be MITM'd without you ever knowing. Having an encryption level without authentication is at best feel-good, at worst it's just giving people a false sense of security- especially when the context is China who frequently do targeted attacks against people to probe connections. 
That said, you're free to use `stunnel` and bitcoind with your peers if you want to, I've tried it and this works out of the box today. I don't see the point but you can TLS wrap your connections pretty painlessly.

I really don't get how you've got into this mess. The output you're spending has a script of `OP_HASH160 3dc7e3cae9a19a0620e9266eb58c09c7d87fb514 OP_EQUAL`, so you need to be making a P2SH spend, but your scriptSig has a P2PKH style spend in it which is completely nonsensical and will not validate. For less than $20 this is probably not worth you putting in the time to unravel how this was made, but don't use that software in the future, user oriented tools won't let you get into messes like this.

Internally in Bitcoin transactions are references to one another with the hash of the transaction, which until segwit is not stable and can be modified. A simple example is the scripting language, take for instance the opcode `NOP`, literally do nothing. We can add this to any script to change the bytes of the transaction, but not the outcome, this is not covered by signatures who are only signing the outputs of a transaction. 
`1 OP_ADD 1` (2)
`NOP 1 OP_ADD 1` (2)
Almost all the elements can be abused like this, there's things like multiple representations of zero (negative zero and positive zero are numerically the same but not literally identical), multiple representations of how you push information onto the stack (01 is the same as 0001 but not identical), a never ending warren of these sort of issues. The simple solution is to commit to values in the scriptSig (the malleable bit) when they are in a block, but not include them in the TXID which is used to back reference the transactions. This means that no matter what changes are made in the scriptSig, the TXID never changes, and it really doesn't matter the form of the scriptSig so long as it validates. 


ECDSA signatures are themselves malleable, each has two representations which are both valid, with `s` being on either side of the curve. The encoding Bitcoin used to use for signatures called ASN.1 BER used to also be vulnerable to having multiple representations, with additional problems due to it being hugely complex and not consensus safe (it was impossible to write a compatible implementation of it, it would even behave differently on different CPUs). That encoding is no longer used, and generally only the low side form of a signature is considered to be standard on the bitcoin network.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:01:53
I used to argue that encryption was necessary for a while as well. I think it's probably a viable upgrade that can be done opportunistically, but it's not a solution to many problems and needs serious consideration to make be significantly positive to the software. Bitcoin Core has mostly been fire fighting with performance issues (there's been orders of magnitude speedups in the past, less so recently as there's not as much long hanging fruit) rather than these sort of things, so I wouldn't expect to see anything moving in that direction for the moment. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 08:42:49
A large number of keys are uncompressed, so throw away the `y`, many are repeated within a block, so eliminate them (don't do this on anything but a block level). The encodings can be tightened, most scripts become 1 or 2 bits long rather than 5+ bytes.

It's not really, bootstrapping is only done once for most nodes and you can easily work out ways of distributing this information out of band. The hardcoded seed nodes are basically never used by anybody, the DNS seeds probably only once and then never again. If you manage to make a connection to IPV4 0xB92F846D, 3106899053, maybe even 0271.0057.0204.0155 (all encodings of the same thing, 185.47.132.109), then you get more peers and are safely connected to the network. Blocking the actual p2p traffic however is completely trivial for the GFY and there's no resistance to it in the bitcoin network at all, you need alternate network layers like Hyperboria or something- but they're largely blocked in China to varying degrees. 
The GFY does some incredibly advanced things like intercepting outgoing TCP connections, masquerading as them and probing the service that's being connected to in order to identify the traffic. It really is quite an effective system and they seem to have an almost unlimited budget and appetite for demolishing any ways of attempting to escape it. They seem to be able to do completely ludicrous attacks that seem unviable like distinguishing traffic within SSL sockets with timing and session length, which most people wouldn't have really expected is possible given the enormous size of the country.

There's less focus on latency, so you can work on transfering blocks through a slower and less obvious method. If you are latency focused you make it very obvious a link is transferring a bitcoin block because you have to do it fast. Doesn't matter if you have encryption or obfuscation if you leak what you're doing heavily through timing.

You misunderstand, it literally takes **MONTHS** of CPU and IO time to sync the ethereum chain without using state commitments, ie, trustlessly. This isn't due to a broken machine, it's due to the amount of work that is needed to execute all of the scripts and deal with the massive amounts of spam the network has incurred.


Pruning is something you do when you've validated the data (ie, you don't need it once you've checked it), "fast" mode is default in Ethereum now, and it just trusts that the proof of work signifies a valid chain. If you disable this you'll find that it's effectively impossible to use the software.  
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:52:19

Funnily enough, nuances in english aren't used when evaluating machine code for a very good reason. Solidity is a ludicrously broken language that has cased numerous massive thefts like Parity multisignature wallets and The DAO. Given that at this point you literally can't do a fully validating sync (one user is over 3 months at this point with no end in sight), maybe claiming that Ethereum is the king of all decentralization is a little premature. You can do a sync of Bitcoin and validate every piece of information in the chain in under a day, for comparison, because there's lane limits and no infinitely growing storages in it other than the UTXO, which is bounded by (gasp) the block size.

No, sorry. It reduces connection quality to connect to peers knowingly that will at a certain date all become unavailable. BCash nodes seriously struggled to find peers due to misbehaviour like this, it took hours or days of wandering around being banned before they could peer with each other. Bitcoin Core prefers to make very long lived, high quality peers that promptly relay valid data, and this includes knowing the date at which they will suddenly stop, and being proactive about not bothering with those.

Yes, it takes 12 hours of CPU time to sync now on a high end processor most of which is raw ECDSA and SHA256. In non-adversarial conditions block imports are hundreds of milliseconds once you're at the tip of the chain because you can cache validation of transactions when they are unconfirmed, but we can't always assume we are in non-adversarial conditions. If we haven't seen all the transactions in a block is can be seconds or more, which is a substantial centralisation pressure (if you don't validate, you import the block quicker and make more money mining, to the detriment of the network). If you want to see the numbers for a synced node run with `debug=bench`. 
This is on a very low end processor, a quad ARM core.

Only about a year ago there was 21.co selling raspberry pi nodes for people to run, they're essentially useless now due to the increase in verification load. This is my benchmark from a RPI3 taking 49 seconds to import the most recent block at the time of writing, if you fall behind even a week of blocks you take more than a day to catch up. There's no way of doing an initial sync anymore on one of these devices, you need at least a core i5 intel processor to do it in less than a half a week. Why does this matter? The floor for actually running a validating node is increasing a lot and will be even further strained by the block increase in SegWit.

If miners are acting sensibly, they're just re-affirming consensus changes nodes already support and making sure that violating blocks aren't created.

Internally in Bitcoin transactions are references to one another with the hash of the transaction, which until segwit is not stable and can be modified. A simple example is the scripting language, take for instance the opcode `NOP`, literally do nothing. We can add this to any script to change the bytes of the transaction, but not the outcome, this is not covered by signatures who are only signing the outputs of a transaction. 
`1 OP_ADD 1` (2)
`NOP 1 OP_ADD 1` (2)
Almost all the elements can be abused like this, there's things like multiple representations of zero (negative zero and positive zero are numerically the same but not literally identical), multiple representations of how you push information onto the stack (01 is the same as 0001 but not identical), a never ending warren of these sort of issues. The simple solution is to commit to values in the scriptSig (the malleable bit) when they are in a block, but not include them in the TXID which is used to back reference the transactions. This means that no matter what changes are made in the scriptSig, the TXID never changes, and it really doesn't matter the form of the scriptSig so long as it validates. 


ECDSA signatures are themselves malleable, each has two representations which are both valid, with `s` being on either side of the curve. The encoding Bitcoin used to use for signatures called ASN.1 BER used to also be vulnerable to having multiple representations, with additional problems due to it being hugely complex and not consensus safe (it was impossible to write a compatible implementation of it, it would even behave differently on different CPUs). That encoding is no longer used, and generally only the low side form of a signature is considered to be standard on the bitcoin network.

Often with Bitcoin, they don't. Bitcoin is probably one of the most sensitive pieces of software to hardware issues, syncing the chain does billions of sha256 hash functions and hundreds of millions of signature verification operations that must be in lock step before the node can come up. This is while running at maximum IO load, maximum CPU load, and lot of network load. Nothing a consumer normally does on a computer is so sensitive to errors.

Bitcoin at its core is a list of the current "unspent outputs". The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) stores a big list of every output (a combination of a value of BTC, and the restrictions on who can spend it) which is updated every time there's a new block. All of the entries that are spent get removed, all the entries that are created get added. Every single node does this with every one of the half million blocks in history, every new block that is created, and validates that in the process nothing illegal was done (spends of the wrong values, restrictions on who can spend outputs are violated). By doing the validation they can be sure that their UTXO is correct and that any coins in the UTXO they own are valid, real amounts of money that exist. 
A "block" is just a big blob of data containing transactions, and those transactions contain instructions on how to modify your UTXO database to be in line with the rest of the network. They're not that interesting to look at because it's almost entirely cryptographic signatures and references to other transactions. You can store blocks in many different forms, it's sort of unrelated to how the network operates.

No, this is a false equivalence. What happened when BCH forked away from BTC is that almost none of their nodes could find like peers, they had to essentially connect to every single BTC peer, be banned for relaying invalid BCH blocks, and then attempt the next one. Preemptively preventing connections that you know will become invalid soon is a completely reasonable piece of behaviour and protects *both* BTC and "btc1" clients from being partitioned. Removing this protection ensures that the p2p network will abruptly bifurcate and nodes will become orphaned, it ensures maximum confusion and disruption.

Bitcoin from day one has supported payment channels (the reason for things like the sequence number and nLockTime), but at least originally there was some serious issues like denial of service due to you being able to replace transactions in the mempool billions of times. These were largely fixed with the introduction of Replace By Fee, which adds a cost to replacing a transaction with a new one. 
Though it's often not mentioned, there's actually a large number of restrictions added to the network between 0.1 and 0.5 which are largely due to realisations that the network was fairly fragile and vulnerable to attack. Scripts got limited in size (many times), opcodes were disabled, integer operations were restricted, script push limits were introduced (then restricted several times), the number of signature verifications in a block were limited. None of these are as easy to discuss as a literal limit on bytes, though many of them have a greater effect (for example unknowingly, the 520 byte push limit causes the n-of-15 multisig limit in P2SH).

It's to counter the fact that currently adding entries to the UTXO is cheaper than removing them, it's providing an incentive to clean up the UTXO database.

Bitcoin was originally supposed to use "SPV" to allow for almost fully validating security by the way of compact fraud proofs. You can have nodes do little to no validation of blocks they see, unless a single person on the network can produce a proof of why a block with valid roof of work is otherwise invalid, say, it spends outputs that don't exist. Due to various problems it's actually impossible to use fraud proofs in this way, to prove that an output was spent in an illegal way might take hundreds of gigabytes of input, so much for "simple". Clients called "SPV" today simply do no validation at all and blindly trust miners, which is different to the "SPV" in the white paper and other places. 


Most transactions are bigger than this, especially as a large number of things use P2SH multisig. 


Transactions are often only effectively transmitted once now due to compact blocks and inventory messages. In Bitcoin 0.1 every transaction and block was transmitted to every peer regardless if they had them or not, which was insanely inefficient. 


That's an intel CPU core pegged doing continuous validation. Running in this state it would be almost impossible to sync the network from zero, as the catch up speed would be something like 10x real time on my desktop. That is, 10 years of history would take a _year_ to sync. This is very clearly incompatible with decentralisation, and if it were still using OpenSSL a core i7 would never be able to catch up with the network. 
Just as an aside, all versions of Bitcoin before 0.8 will collapse with a consensus failure in BerkeleyDB around the 500KB mark. It's not valuable to take discussions on a forum almost a decade ago as representative of out current knowledge about Bitcoin, it's not even close.

Additionally, there's no reason for that domain to be an encoding of anything, it's meant to be an implausible to be registered domain to detect if there's analysis tools capturing its traffic. It's a very poorly implemented check (because someone could register it), but it's definitely not meant to be a kill switch. A more common way to do it would be to query a bunch of unrelated names and see if there's a common result (ie, the DNS is being poisoned) and exit based on that.

The extranonce incrementing pattern does not apply to coinable transactions we know to be Satoshi, such as the one which made a transaction to Hal Finney. There's zero evidence to suggest anything but perhaps 3 blocks in total were mined by Satoshi.

Yes, in such a way that you can make a proof that the file is attested by the stamp in just 1024 bytes. 
The total size used in the block chain is 32 bytes.

SPV also lacks any observable security, a miner can make illegally large blocks, or create money out of thin air, and no SPV wallet will know the difference. Many block explorers operate with SPV only security, evidenced by their following of the invalid BIP66 blocks. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:34:27


This isn't the correct interpretation, it means you consider that 2/3rds of the network aren't mining anymore- mining implies adhering to the rules. By the old rules you wouldn't be following the majority of the hashrate, but by the new rules you are. A "majority hashrate" that isn't adhering to the rules (say, paying themselves more than 12.5 BTC per block) isn't mining at all because validating nodes will reject these blocks, though they are expending energy. This sounds like pointless nuance but it is of vital importance to understanding the system.

I don't think the author had any "position" at all with any of the discussions the OP is asking about, almost the entirety of the contents they posted on mailing lists (several are lost to time now), on forum.bitcoin.org, and in known private emails are about technical implementation.

A ECDSA signature is larger than an scriptPubKey output. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:49:12


No, objectively it should have been 1:8 not 1:4. There's a balance here though, the worst case block size would have been enormous with such a heavy weighting towards the scriptPubKey. 


There needs to be some weight given to inputs, otherwise it becomes reasonable to make very stupid transactions like `OP_DROP` being spent by a absolutely massive data push that fills an entire block.

Many miners since as far back as Avalon 1 have used FPGA for communication multiplexing and work generation rather than doing this on a CPU. The S7 has a large isolated FPGA, the S9 have a combined FPGA+CPU core which among other things does ASIC Boost work creation in the "multi version" mode. The FPGA in the S9 is represented as a memory mapped device under linux, which is used by the Bitmain miner software to control the work it is given and get results.

Yes, due to a mistake, it wasn't a kill switch.

It's 32 bytes total, same size as a single ECDSA signature. 
There's zero UTXO impact, it's 0.0000005% of the size of all the Satoshi Dice transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:02:10
Using SSSS in this way is a horrific idea, you end up with all of the material on one computer to make the signature, compared with Bitcoin multisig where many parties can independently sign transactions with no additional risk.

We find the origin web server at:
    194.247.45.66.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer btc-e.com

We can verify the sanity of this claim using a publicly available [DNS history tool]( which shows that in 2012 the service was directly hosted at [Interserver]( (though at a different IP address), a cheap web and dedicated host in New Jersey, United States, before they moved it behind the CloudFlare proxy. It's more than likely it stayed there until it was taken down.

Qrator.net is another anti-DDoS service that's hosted in Russia, similar in operation to CloudFlare which uses front facing proxies to protect a service from volumetric attacks. This doesn't imply that the origin servers were in the same country, just the same as they weren't hosted by CloudFlare. 


Their website seems to be rather unreliable.

None of them do, the messages sent by bip37 clients are completely incompatible with an address keyed index. They ask "is there any hashes in any of the transactions in this block that match this filter", which an address keyed index doesn't assist with at all. There's more scalable solutions, and [significantly more private for this sort of SPV]( but nobody has implemented them into a wallet as of now. At the end of the day, there's almost no users of BIP37 SPV today. It's slow, very inefficient, not particularly convenient, and has [no privacy whatsoever](

It fixes *unintended* malleability. Malleability can be things like ANYONECANPAY transactions that allowed the creation of Lighthouse, where multiple participants can freely modify a transaction to add their own outputs. Bitcoin is very much intended to work like this, what's not intended is random mutating of normal transaction IDs.

That's not really fragile so much as incompetent implementations. It's the cryptographic equivalent of setting a lamp on fire when someone tells you to write your name- doing completely the wrong thing (rather than generating a secret `k`) breaks the system, this has nothing specific to do with ECDSA in particular so much as incompetent implementations.

Abusive usage is what fees are designed to price out, this is 32 bytes out of 100,000,000,000, miniscule. 
Now if you tried to store the files themselves, that's very expensive. As designed.

The signatures are committed to in the block, it would be insane not to. Otherwise I could give you block A (with a signature modified), you reject it because one of the signatures is invalid, and you'd never accept the real A because you'd already seen it's invalid, right? Signatures aren't removed, there's not malleable once in a block.

The way BIP37 is structured there's not really a great way to index it, you'd have to make a new construction entirely that didn't use bloom filters. Each request from every client at the moment is unique so there's no possibility of caching or any other sort of time saving method, and it does insane things like hashing every single stack element and other random parts of the transaction (for a reason nobody ever used!). There's [vastly improved systems available]( that nobody has implemented.

It's not a kill switch, it's a method of detecting virtualization (someone attempting to analyze the behaviour). This is a very common thing for malicious software to do, as analysis tools will attempt to capture all traffic to find out what the malware is sending.
