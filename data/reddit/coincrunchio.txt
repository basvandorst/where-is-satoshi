Lessons for next year (hopefully)

Maybe, but not necessarily. 
This market fluctuates just like any other market. A drop down from a fairly consistent rise over the last few weeks isn't necessarily cause for alarms, give it a few more days at least.

Just goes to show how globally widespread this can become.

When in doubt, zoom out.

Well.. if you shoot an arrow at a target enough times..

Him losing his bet is how we get a black mirror episode.

Mass adoption is coming. Things are revving up, and more of us are beginning to see cryptocurrency and blockchain bleed out into the world outside of our dedicated spheres of influence.

In a Dilbert comic?! 
This is it. The future is here.

While your best bet is hardware wallets or cold storage, it should be fine.

It’s only a matter of time. 
We’ll see it implemented slowly at first (like we currently are) and then it will explode and you won’t be able to look without seeing it. 
But then again, maybe not. 
Nobody can say for sure.

Great point, this is something I didn’t even fully consider.

Thank dodge. 
It’s clearly responsible for this. /s

Expect to see greater adoption at a faster rate. More and more people are waking up to this movement and what it means for the forward progression of our civilization..

This actually isn't a bad means of increasing publicity. 
Think about it. Crypto and blockchain as a whole is still relatively new, and while we're beginning to see it bleed into the mainstream, it still hasn't permeated the level of human conciseness needed for it to take off the way we all know it's going to.
You're essentially making people walking beacons to accelerate this process.

This is simply the natural progression of things. 
Every major advancement in history was met with some form of skepticism, hate, negativity, etc. But when people begin to see real application rearing its head, without any sign of slowing down, they begin to pay attention a bit more. 
Widespread adoption is coming, and most likely it's coming sooner rather than later.

This is awesome. Joe has a great podcast with a wide audience. Just really good for overall publicity.
