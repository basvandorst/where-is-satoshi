In the USA..


case involving safes locked with keys vs. combinations, "revealing the contents of one's mind"


CP noob loses 5th amendment rights for showing ICE agent smut, even though drive was encrypted..had he just kept the drive locked, the agents could do NOTHING if they had no idea what was on the drive


noob reveals incriminating evidence on encrypted laptop HDD in recorded jail phone conversation, at this point refusing to supply passphrase is contempt of court


comparing Fricosu case to suspected CP violator, John Doe gets off b/c prosecution doesn't know EXACTLY what they're looking for
In the UK: you get automatically owned for 2 years for withholding a password in a criminal case, 5 years if it's an investigation of terrorism or some shit

DO NOT use biometrics for anything you want to keep locked down. Like you said, a password cannot be pried from your mind, but your blood, hair, saliva, semen, fingerprint, breath, voice, iris, face (facial recognition), gait, etc etc can and will be used to incriminate you.
edit: the use of biometrics is a forfeiture of 5th Amendment protection
