10k pounds...? Soo...the majority of the population? A house is easily 10-100x that and the article does not even seem to differentiate live-in vs pure investment housing. Also, it even acknowledges the housing angle when it talks about it as an investment. Just screams 'bad writing' and trying to spin an angle. Does that mean 17% of people that own a home in the UK have crypto because that is seemingly like what it is implying. Also, the survey was only 1000 people. How are they extrapolating that to the entire population? This article is confusing and borderline insulting to the reader. Yes, I highly suspect tons of investors in the UK hold crypto, but this shoddy rag piece sure does not give enough info to know how many.

Well, in the US anyway you are legally required to report any price hikes in the currency as they are considered capital gains to my understanding. They already try to control it by basically taxing it's normal use.

Not sure if you are joking, but the founder of Xapo as well as a dozen other high-profile fixtures on the bitcoin space. He also is a member of the board of Paypal directors. In other words, he is kind of a big deal in Bitcoin as in money in general.

Gold is just shifting the value of a currency to something else that also is not a fixed point (contrary to what some think). Gold also fluctuates in price (sometimes dramatically) and is just another anchor point for a currency when the anchor is not really needed (hence why the gold standard was kind of pointless). All it ever really ensures is that the currency will have "some value" since gold will always have some value to a certain subset of people. Anything CAN have value and it is just about DOES it have value currently. No "anchor" will ever prevent a currency from suffering a crash.

Only in the top nations. It does nothing to aid 3rd world nations. 


Sure, but that does nothing if they do not want to learn and a new thing coming in and showing advantages to a system that has existed since society has existed....well there is a big hurdle wouldn't you say? Hell, anti-vaxxors are still a thing. Put that in perspective when you try to justify the supposed intelligence of people.  


And many still do not. Many never will.


Again, this is charitably for like 50% of the world. Is will inherent the same issues that the current systems have, but with yet another barrier. If you...well...exist, you can hold wealth. You need to exist and be earning more than most of the world to afford a cell phone let alone a modern smartphone capable of downloading and using a wallet.
Keep in mind, I am not saying more adoption is bad. It is not. It is great! The issue is, there will never be full adoption and it will never even be close.

I could tell you from experience that most of the people farming on RuneScape know very little English or at least pretend to given most of the time the English is....well awful when you do talk to one, which if you are a free-to-play player trying to Telegrab wine, that is super often.
From my experience most will use automatic translation in order to articulate the bare minimum to the buyers, so that they can buy the gold. Given universally understood numbers you can go pretty far. For example, 10m is going to be understood by most Venezuelans and it's going to be understood by all English speakers that play the game to mean 10 million. I can tell you right off the bat as of time of writing about 1 million RuneScape gold goes for about seventy us cents and if a Venezuelan gets to a high level account they can be making 5 million or more gold an hour. That adds up and is why it has gotten so much attention in the RuneScape community

You must not be aware of emblem farming. Some have 100+ bots running 24/7. Each bot gets a tier-10 in just a few hours. Each tier-10, as of writing is worth 1.9m gold. RS gold goes for about $0.70-$0.90 per mill. Do the math. It adds up. Really fucking fast. That is why many people in third world countries have turned to it as a secondary or even main source of income.

While it is true "results may vary" there is also such a thing as a trend. Statistically, there are probably some people in Nigeria named "prince" that will give you money, but that does not mean you should trust any of them. The reality is, when people are desperate, they ignore morals and justify theft. Happens all the time. When an area is very desperate, expect a lot of theft and do not rely on that place for honest work. The honest workers exist, sure, but when 100% of the risk is being taken by the employer, that means they need to take 100% of the discretion and that means not hiring those with a higher-than-normal chance of being a thief.

There are also...let's just say less than legitimate...sites if you are not careful that will install miners on your device. It is really shitty. I booted up a VM the other day and tried a few out that I used to frequent back in the day like Moon Bitcoin and the like. My AV (avira) that I installed on it was flipping the fuck out on every one I went on. It is sad how money fucked up the discovery aspect of many of these sites. It really added legitimacy to the currency, but I hardly can blame them with prices so damn high.

The issue is HOW MUCH you spend. Wait until a sale a year or two down the line and you will spend half price for the same thing. Living on the bleeding edge means you will get cut. A lot. If you are fine with that, sure, so ahead, but you had fair warning that you are paying for impatience.

Like I said, there is no one reason for life. Simply "living" is the best idea we have for a meaning of life, but there will always be exceptions because humans behave unpredictably at times and will always do things that counter any meaning one comes up with simply to be contrarian at times. As for a universe devoid of life, there obviously is no meaning of life since there is none, rendering the issue pointless. At that point, the question losing all meaning.

What ones do you recommend? 
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:02:55
Heat in the sense that they are saying it is a stand-in for a generic "thing needed to live." One can replace it in their statement with "shade from the sun" or any other thing needed for proper life in a given area. The point is that things humans need to live and satisfy biological imperatives will always have value as, as far as normal circumstances go, living is the only known reason for living. We have a natural desire to go on living. 
One can argue that is not the meaning of life and that nature frequently showcases sacrifice, but it is one of the best models for life we have. In other words, the point is not the "thing", but rather its application to the situation and the need it is satisfying. To illustrate this, why have Bitcoin when we already have so many currencies? Because we value anonymous (somewhat anonymous anyway...) transactions independent of a governing body. Others do not value that, so they do not use Bitcoin, but it does not devalue the currency's place in the world. It has its use and is valuable to those that give it value. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:06:37
But you still value food. Just because one does not value something at the moment, does not mean the value is gone. Also, value of a thing is almost never measured on an individual level. Do you change a product to appeal to the one person that does not like it or the millions that do?

...how? As a rule of thumb, it is cheaper to do online bill payment and debt cards than having to spend gasoline to cash checks. Very few jobs will pay you in cash anymore due to the issues cash has, so there is a cost to getting paid directly nowadays. Bank accounts suck, but they are necessary for the current system to work. If Bitcoin became the de-facto world currency, this would not be the case, but that simply is not going to ever happen.

That...literally makes no sense. MLK wanted equal opportunity and rights to live equally. He did not want censorship of ideas and people saying naughty things does not infringe your rights. The hell are you talking about? This has nothing to do with civil rights. No one has to give anyone a platform for their ideas they especially do not have to let you use their resources to say those ideas. Again, a company can take down all the people using their site they want. You have no right to their resources and it is a privilege given.

At the end of the day, Patreon can do whatever they want. They can "moderate" their userbase if they feel like. They just have to take the backlash of a million angry alt-right shitposters in this situation, which I doubt they wanted. I honestly see Paypal at fault and in the wrong here more than anything. It was a short-sighted choice that will in the long-term lose them users and that...well...is pretty shitty for everyone involved.

You underestimate the pull YTers have today. This is not the early 2000s, friend. Times change and so do the people with clout. It is also never about numbers. Never is. It is about who makes the loudest noise and...well...I am not sure if you are aware of the "audience" these guys have, but they are anything, but quiet. You can create a roar with a crowd or just one loud guy with Tourette's that never shuts up. These are people that have made mainstream news for being so toxic, so the precedent is already there. They have pull. A lot of it. Much of the current political climate in the US and abroad are at least in part influenced by people with their views. It is...worrying, but anyway. This aside, you are right about people not caring, but not for the reason you think. People do not care because they are sick of listening and just tune out the bullshit as it has gone on for years now. Anyway, you really should look into the subject more if only for a good laugh at how insane these nuts are. 
As for regulation...why? Private business can and should be able to do these things. Not sure why you would want government regulation of who can use a service. That seems to never actually lead to anything good and just shifts the burden of moderation and the like from one party to another. Money is a good motivator for actually doing what is good for the platform. Remove money as a goal by shifting the burden to a government body and who is to say who stays and who goes? What is the criteria if it is no longer the image of company and how it can use that image to make money...but I digress. Yeah, look into the people we are talking about here. That would help you see exactly 'why' they were banned and it is impossible to remove the censorship issue from it given they literally are Political channels. Like, capital 'P' politics channels that discuss current political issues. That alone rubs people the wrong way and creates a bad taste...even if their content often is... *ehem* questionable quality (obviously subjective).

Personally, I see it going back to ~300-$400 like it was back when it was being used for its intended purpose: as a currency and not what it has become thanks to speculators and shitty "investors" that wanted to make a quick buck on it. Maybe it will be a little higher due to a larger volume of people shifting the curve somewhat, but I really think the beginning will also be the endgame here and prices will be dictated by what they were when the currency was young.
