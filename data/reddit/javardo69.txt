like i said there is no selling so what you say its not true. The shares or whatever are borrowed, someone bought them before (the exchange or from someone else) and lend to who shorts, who shorts has to pay it back.

exchange lends you shares, bitcoin whatever. Imagine you take a loan from a bank, usually they give you the money and you have to pay it back plus interest (this is where the bank makes money right), now imagine this interest its the bitcoin price so you want this interest rate to be negative so you can make a profit, if it raises too much the exchange demands that you pay the loan at the interest rate it is at the time so you get liquidated. Now imagine a bunch of short sellers that got liquidated, that makes the price increase.

no, they have to buy. There is no selling. They have to always buy, you only profit you buy lower than the price you got it borrowed. Also the max you can profit from shorting is 100% thats when the price of the stock, commoditie whatever goes to 0, if you go long theres theoretically no limit, so theres actually more risk if you go short instead of long. Of course it kind of depends at what price you short.
