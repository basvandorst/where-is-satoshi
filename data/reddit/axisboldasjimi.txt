Institutional investors pumping out stories to depress the price so they can jump in.  Happens all the time and usually works.

It's called a meme.  Bad bot, no data.

Got it, so there are numerous transactions happening in every block, but only one represents the "reward", but the whole block must be processed to get a chance at the reward, right?

Name a stable currency.  The US has $20 trillion in debt &gt; the dollar is not stable, its a house of cards.

You can expect lots of corrections, the questions are when they will happen and whether the price will land below where it is now.

the banks have a very good reason to be scared - but if they were smart they'd hedge their bets and buy $100 million worth

I realize that, but I intend to use my gains to replace all my body parts and live far longer than that.

Bitcoins are not tulips precisely because they serve a very important purpose as described in this tweet.
Disconnecting currency markets from governments is inevitable.  The only question is whether bitcoin will remain the standard.

Is there an existing system to provide the computer that processes the transaction with the fee?

I agree.  They couldn't buy all their coins at $7K, so how many would they end up with.
At $7K they could own 14.2M coins - over 2/3 of all.  But I doubt they could even get 20% for $100M.  Pure speculation obviously but some basic economics would be working against them.

When do they estimate the last one be mined?

It's possible that they could spend $100B on bitcoin - the only question is how many they would get and how much of the market they could control
