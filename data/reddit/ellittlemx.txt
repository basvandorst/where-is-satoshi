The seed is only to recover your wallet in case you lose your phone or damaged or whatever reason you have this seed and can recover whatever bitcoin you had on previous phone .. to send all you need to do is press send and use pin!

@_date: 2017-04-03 22:23:38
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:41:20
I can easily say that the majority will stay with Bitcoin not BU like the majority decided to go with ethereum hard fork ! 
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:35:57
Segwit has been tested and reviewed for a long period of time by the best of programmers in the field !

@_date: 2017-04-04 17:30:39
Ver is not going to go through with this as he doesn't feel confident on his own BU coin !

@_date: 2017-06-28 23:44:08
And why would a very wealthy person throw away billions on top of billions of dollars away ? ...governments don't see bitcoin as a threat yet and when they eventually do it'll be too late to try and stop it ..wich I believe bitcoin is already to big to stop if not really close for governments to do anything about it !!

Welcome to bitcoin !! You will not be disappointed the drama is very real with bitcoin ! But non the less it's an extremely revolutionary technology! It will be one of your best investments in a fee years ! Edit bitcoin mining is only profitable if electricity is close to free and invest millions of dollars to compete with huge miners !

You can use bitcoin for anything that you can use regular government based currencies.. edit now about it being legal to pay for prostitutes idk depends if prostitution is legal in your area. If it's illegal then yes paying for prostitutes with any type of currency is illegal.

@_date: 2017-06-07 04:54:35
No ! Mycelium app for example always creates a different address when one is used so you don't ever reuse addresses it's pretty common for most wallets to do this .. It's the best and most cautious way to go about it !
