One could not have addressed your comment more thoroughly.

Damn. I had to scroll down this far for some actual logic.

sigh.   
No you didn't. That was my whole point.   
For example, [this]( would be consider "showing".   
Unfortunately this seems to have a dataset only up through 2016. I would be interested in you actually "showing" me that Venezuela made import illegal, because even our own governments public notes on exporting goods to Venezuela shows that Venezuela is still importing our goods[\[2\]](   
Furthermore both the link above and our own government supplied public notes for export shows that the U.S. is the primary economic boost to Venezuela[\[3\]]( being responsible of more than 39%(!) of Ven's exports and %36(!) of Ven's imports; A super majority of Ven's exports being - as pointed out - a single commodity: Petroleum.   
With the U.S. having such influence and decreasing it's usage of foreign petro[\[4\]]( along with a world that is increasingly ramping down it's import of Petro more aggressively than the U.S. alongside a global push for emissions decrease - it's not a surprise that this is hitting Venezuelan's hard.   
Now I'm not saying that this is Venezuelan's only issue, but it is a huge, and for a long time predicted issue. This isn't just "socialism is bad hurdur". It's far more complex than that, and taking the time to really "show" people instead of making claims would reveal this complexity.   
Other claims you made that I welcome you to actually show:  
\- Ven took over people's means to domestically produce goods  
\- Ven people weren't free to produce, import, and trade

Your question is predicated on the claim I addressed as not factual. Please re-read. I didn't realize I was corresponding with a troll.

You claim there's no logic, and then write a paragraph with a bunch of statements, without anything to hold them up.  
ie) no logic.
I can do that too. See:  
Venezueala failed because they didn't pray hard enough. They "ignored" Jesus' teachings, and then doubled down on atheism. If there were enough god-fearing officials, where they understood christian values, and promoted christian values (you know, how god intended), people wouldn't be starving.

In current American jargon Social Democracy == Democratic Socialism.   
The term "Democratic Socialist" was co-opted by Social FDR-style Democrats.

If you were an investor in the internet space, it definitely was a risk. Over and over again.

I bought at 900 a few decembers back. price topped at 1k and fell to 200 and fluctuated there forever. HODL'd for the whole time and happy I did. 
This is for the long term.
