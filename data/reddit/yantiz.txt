Ok I misunderstand...
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:04:52
I mean we have two more years to go. Things can go crazy after passing some ‘threshold’ price that captures everyone’s attention. 10k is still not astonishing enough... But I agree with you that 1 million can be hard to reach before 2020.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:31:23
Thanks anyway. At least I will keep a distance from Poloniex for now since it uses USDT.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:31:28
Is Poloniex also involved? Can I still use Poloniex?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:20:28
21club? You mean have 1 million btc?
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:25:44
I mean potentially. Nobody knows what will happen next.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:33:30
Shutdown might not come true in the short term, but the Korean gov has already discussed the closure of crypto exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:41:56
HODL till reaching 1M!!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:38:40
Theoretically it is possible for a coin to reach 0.5-2 million. But 5? I highly doubt it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:34:08
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:22:27
10 bucks and 20k return? Go back to bed and have a good dream. This won’t happen to bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:19:58
Quoinex is licensed in Japan.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:04:45
Bank of America was consistently rejecting my transaction to buy bitcoin a few days ago, but they didn’t close my account though.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:11:04
Sure. I won’t put any bitcoin to exchanges that use USDT until things are resolved.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:09:18
Exponential growth is not linear though...
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:50:54
I mean, it doesn't hurt to try the DEX.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:53:33
Interesting, I think you really hope to be busted by Tether. I am giving my suggestion but you somehow have malicious intention towards me.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:24:15
I’ve already did it when bitcoin crashed from 8k to 6k. Have you heard a Japanese exchange called quoinex? Is it safe?
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:47:23
The chance is 100%.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:36:23
Bitcoin can be served as a store of value, and we could use litecoin as fast transaction for now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:23:04
It's not about which coin to invest. The genesis era of the cryptocurrency is over. Unless you invest with 10x of your money, you won't be a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:27:15
I don’t like it, bad software interface, hardly updated.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:53:26
If there is another dip which makes bitcoin drop below 8k, I’ll definitely sell my car and buy the dip lol.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:17:14
You are right, but trading is hard to learn... If there is a method which allows you to constantly sell high and buy low, you must be a millionaire already and this method can be applied not only to bitcoin but also to stocks etc...
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:33:15
So you anticipate there will be another attack from BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:19:38
My guess is never, unless you own a full coin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:13:30
8 trillion is for gold. I don't think it's impossible to reach.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:43:22
You’ll eventually lose both.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:23:39
I only care about what amount of BTC I own, not the converted value to fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:39:43
Besides, people living in the third world are not necessarily poor. No matter how rich they are, they are still under risks because of political persecutions.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:14:42
Anyway, I am not a speculator. I only invest what I truly believe. There are plenty of other ways to be a millionaire much faster, but with much more risk.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:26:53
Trust me, to be a future millionaire, you have to spend 10-20k no matter what coin you invest. The market cap won't grow limitless. But with 0.1 bitcoin you may possibly earn 100-200k usd in the future, but with a long long time of waiting...
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:51:54
I don't know, might be emotionally irrational. Personally I will hodl until the market cap reaches the gold.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:04:06
I do have some experience in programming, but not an expert in trading and don't know how to write a good trading script...
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:20:24
I wish I could time the market, but not confident though...
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:28:36
how do you know there is gonna be a dip?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:53:37
Right. Therefore I invest $37k at the price 7k in anticipation of being a millionaire once bitcoin replaces gold.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:47:07
The Russian government should consider whether it could keep its legality forever first.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:01:04
We are responsible for our own money. It’s a double-edged sword.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:40:02
I guess owning a full coin is emotionally pleasant.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:11:06
Thanks for your advice. I will no longer reveal this info.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:56:21
1 million seems unapproachable by the end of 2018, so I guess you are pretty safe...
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:59:36
Invest more if you believe its future. Just make sure you have enough fiat to keep your life.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:37:10
Yes, in fact I understand some basic tech details behind cryptocurrency, because I am majoring in computer science. For now, I think both BTC and ETH have a chance to be the dominant ones. Let’s see, and thanks for your advice!
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:26:33
The rise of bitcoin relies on outer money to join. Therefore, more adoption is necessary. Besides, institutions are not a monolithic whole, for many of them come from different countries with different background, possibly rivaling each other and making it hard to manipulate the entire market.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:54:46
There are already institutional investors jumping in. I guess the best strategy is to hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:06:58
I don't have too much faith in ETH though, it inflates every year and may not be optimal for the store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:50:03
Time to eat ball.
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:21:18
Sex abuse is indeed involved, but relevant reports and interviews are deleted totally within China. Obviously some big guys are manipulating the public opinion. To be honest, people already get used to the ordinary bullying happening in kindergartens, but this event is extremely astonishing. It's boiling now.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:46:40
waiting for a 7000+ dip and I will buy the dip like crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:24:47
Litecoin is good though, but your initial funding is too low.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:11:06
That sounds promising.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:15:17
At first I was scared of 50 BTC, but then I realized it's actually $50...welcome
