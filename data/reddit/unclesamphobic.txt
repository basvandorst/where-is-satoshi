You can beat them at their game. To beat this type of alleged manipulation, just buy right after the price goes down drastically and sell after the price goes up. Then wait patiently for the price to drop and buy again. You will profit while the manipulators lose.
If you don't want to play their game at all, just don't buy nor sell often, but rather slowly accumulate a tiny bit each month.

Question on Electrum. I have the list of 1626 words used by Electrum to store a seed. Can I use dice to "randomly" choose 12 words from this list and then let that be my seed?
My rationale is I trust the randomness of my dice more than I trust my computer.

The logic of the article reads something like this: This is an election year where the candidates are hated the most. Therefore, BTC may reach $1000.

Best best explanation of what happened. Now I finally get it.

What's happening here? Are they just taking your BTC and giving you nothing? Or is it even more elaborate where you get a compromised honeypot fake Trezor that is programmed to steal your keys?

Nitrogen and 5dimes! Although 5 dimes asks for extensive ID when it comes time to withdraw

My bank froze my account because my driver license they had on file expired a week ago. They asked me for a copy of my renewed license and until I did it, my funds were on hold. I guess my previous ID was in order and identified me legitimately, but once it expires, I no longer legitimately exist.

Well, either they'll have the last laugh or we will. They will never sway me to change my position unless there is some overwhelming new information.

What exactly do you mean by tax-free growth? You will have to pay tax on the growth. You won't be able to touch the growth money until you pay tax on it. So there's no real savings. It's deceptive.

If you put $10000 post tax money into a Roth and grow it to $15000 and wait until your are past the age requirement, you pay no tax on the $10000 (because you already paid the tax when you were young). 
** You DO pay tax on the $5000 gain.
That's what I have been told by all the people who tried to sell me a Roth.

If you search "Bitcoin" in that sub only, you'll find extreme antiBTC bias in the posts.

Reliable shop. Been around a while. However, you only get action if somebody takes the opposite side.
So you might try btcsportsbet.eu , their sister site.
