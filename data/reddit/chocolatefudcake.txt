Are you sending them to Bitgrail by any chance?
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:51:11
Can you explain briefly what you saw to predict that?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:38:51
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:29:13
I thought the spike was going to be the first of many, wish I had sold now. booo
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:49:08
Good luck with that
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:09:20
Followed by "omfg, bitcoin is down 5%, SELL SELL SELL"
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:24:06
Sold now. Looking at the chart history all today we have a bump for around 60-90 mins then a dip and thats been consistent.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:02:47
Everyones pulling out to jump on Ripple train, it's just gone mental. but it's probably too late, everyone will be switching it back to BTC anytime now. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:12:51
Some people around here have a lot more than .0001 and still know fuck all.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:47:47
Bought at 69, sold at 80 to buy more bitcoins. Dumb as hell
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:57:01
Someones trying their best to keep the wall topped up ha
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:21:47
Bots doing all the work today. Look at the buy and sell orders. You can see the same order go through about 20 times to give the illusion of a big sell off.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:47:56
Good positive comments boys, we've enjoyed the correction and some of us got some good deals before christmas. Lay off the FUD and we won't scare any new potential investors away. Heres to 25k!
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:30:37
Plenty of time yet
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:44:48
Hasn't gone lower than 13,800 on the last few mini dips. New floor maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:07:52
This is a bitcoin sub, not @_date: 2017-12-14 18:54:14
And while we're naming coins I'd like to put ETH forward for WankCoin. Seems everyone's had enough of it for this week, right after I put 10k into it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:09:17
Lambo's aren't cheap 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:59:27
I like to sell before it goes down so I can buy more before it goes back up. TradingView has helped me make some good decisions wether it be luck or not. worth having a look
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:56:38
Started playing with LTC today and it's increased by bitcoin balance my a noticeable amount. Feel like I'm playing with fire though with the rate its going up. Did Bitcoin ever produce 100% daily returns?
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:13:35
Anyone hodlin' in such a predictable market is losing out on thousands. Maybe with alt coins and pre media btc but right now I'm making probably 5x more than if I'd HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:25:42
19k memes at the ready boys 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:56:54
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:27:38
They sell off multiple orders like spam. It's to make people panic into selling thinking it's a sell off. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:09:12
Dude I just spoke with the CEO of bitcoin and he said its going higher in 28 minutes, 100k he told me, stop trying to FUD.

Raise your hand if you're a dickhead that sold at 19k o/
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:47:21
You wont be able to throw anything, you'll be 6 feet under.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:52:23
Also xrb is gaining too, good alts to own. Bitcoin doesn't affect them 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:29:36
A normal limit order example:
Market price is 10,000, you put a sell limit order in for 10,500 and the market price hits 10,500 it will make the sale.
Limit buy order works the opposite, you put a buyer order in at 9,500 and if the price drops to 9,500 it will make the purchase.
A stop limit sell order will work like this. Market price is 10,000 but you set a sell limit order at 8,000 so that if the market crashes you wont lose everything and automatically cut your loss at 8k.
Stop limit buy order works the opposite, market price 10k and you're waiting for a dip before buying however the market starts climbing, you can set a buy stop order so that if it climbs to say 10,500 you automatically buy in before it increases too much.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:43:19
Got a link to see the futures contracts?

Fee's are nothing compared to the profits he will (probably) make.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:28:04
You put the market price you're willing to pay, it then calculates how much it will cost below.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:58:36
Another few dips to buy yet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:54:23
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:19:00
13,629.04 GBP / BTC current price on LBC. I've never heard of revolut so I cant help but I'd imagine the fee's and waiting time would probably cost you more than buying instantly from LBC.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:54:37
Stupid to buy now. The whale has been playing this game all morning. Drives the price up a little so everyone jumps onboard and then he sells causing a larger dip. Take a look at the 1m and 5m charts.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:33:56
I see why people HODL but I've made a hell of a lot more by buying and selling the little dips we've been receiving lately.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:21:49
Gdax charts not showing anything before today?

You're* simple English mate keep up. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:33:48
Buy now, it's dipping.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:56:39
This is the bump before the dip,
Prepare to buy
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:06:56
Only joking bro. I'm absolutely spannered and making zero fucking sense. Cheeky edit haha
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:22:08
Month or two? I give it a week before we're almost touching 20k. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:31:48
Roll up
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:12:54
Maybe, We'll see.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:20:19
I had to sell my favourite helicopter. Sad day 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:34:23
Ripple is centralised. That's why Raiblocks (xrb) will be better. And yes Bitcoin is old tech, but it still has a chance with Lightening network. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:46:25
No we aren't?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:28:58
FUD time is over, 14k is the lowest were going to see, time to buy back in and enjoy the ride moonwards.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:34:30
Thinking about making the switch the next time the market prices come a little closer. At the minute I'd lose out on about £300 a coin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:00:03
Am I right in saying people use bots? Watching the order book I noticed alot of orders jumping eachother by 0.01 way too quickly to be done by human hands.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:25:43
By no means am I shilling but I jumped on the XRB wagon today and it's unreal how fast transactions are but that didn't amaze me as much as the fact there's no fees at all. Is this purely because it's based on newer technology than bitcoin? And if so then won't this new technology start to replace cryptos like Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:18:36
It's like one of those jokes that nobody gets tired of hearing.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:58:56
To be honest I was expecting a larger dip, it may still come but we'll see. I'd be happy for us to get 20k out the way now, onwards and upwards.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:19:39
There's time yet for you to come out on top, you might not have guessed the top but I think the dip will go low enough for you to profit.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:03:01
While you're buying his ill take 20 or so. Money in January. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:35:08
I don't understand why people panic sell. 110% They'll be here moaning tomorrow about how they were weak and had to buy back in for considerably more than they sold for.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:51:10
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:56:26
True, I'm skeptical though. how long until it dumps, if ever.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:40:15
No walls at all, only like 1 or 2 trades happening a minute. It's dead haha
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:37:58
Actually it's illegal to trade bitcoin on Christmas day in China.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:34:22
My point exactly
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:40:25
I've got 50k in Bitcoin and I intend to leave it in Bitcoin. That doesn't mean to say I can't expand my portfolio. is my home and I'd rather have these discussions with my own random people than other subs random people. Move along 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:34:47

He means currency.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:11:12
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:57:07
Because a lot of people believe Bitcoin will burst shortly and they would rather walk away now and pay off their mortgage. I'm in a similar position, I'd love to pay off my house and if Bitcoin falls I'll be kicking myself. If I sell and Bitcoin continues to take off I'd also kick myself. Cant win really but I'll be hanging onto my coins as I believe there's a long way to go yet. I don't believe that it will replace fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:50:14
Buy now it's about to moon
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:23:21
Would you like a bitcone for that bitcorn
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:43:50
Depends on the day. I usually miss about 6 opportunities on Tuesdays but come Friday I'm usually all stocked up with a few gazillions.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:31:33
Stay away from Crapcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:56:34
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:19:23
I'll bet my whole portfolio on a nice dip soon 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:55:27
Too many people waiting to buy with lots of cash on hand, vultures. Between everyone wanting cheap coins it will never go that low.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:22:25
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:32:05
I'll never let go jack 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:07:55
and the second after your coins sell all the greedy bastards will jump back on the gain train with their extra coins, full steam ahead, next stop 20k haha.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:31:03
You really expect people not in the know to understand bitcoin.com has nothing to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:34:10
Everyone I know was the same, then since the media has been flaunting my investment gains everyone has been messaging me asking for help lol
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:46:52
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:29:58
Mini dip, did you catch it?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:01:39
This dip will continue don't worry
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:28:39
Sell and buy the dips*
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:11:55
You can download Coinbase. It's on the App Store. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:25:13
I think you're wrong, take a look at this.
 
That's just one but if you scroll down you'll see a lot of people coming up with the same TA. It makes more sense than taking off right now. I think the next moon will be after another considerable dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:32:04
I'd just like to thank the panic sellers for giving us that lovely sale.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:03:33
Using my ability to see into the future I can tell you aren't ready for Bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:09:36
Seems calm, I expect a mad storm is on it's way.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:12:40
Depends what you want, the more you put in the more you get out but then you risk losing more if it goes tits up. Coinbase app is the best place to start, it's simple and theres a few different coins you can buy into. Fee's are abit shit but it's better to pay the fee's and get less for your money but keep things simple than making a mistake and losing everything.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:11:39
Been watching this all morning. Went for a piss and missed it ��
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:14:09

@_date: 2017-12-28 17:40:49
It's in a sideways trend, not a downward trend. It's setting up a new basecamp for the next hike.

localbitcoins.com ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:20:49
every 3 seconds someone is selling 0.1 btc and has been for over an hour now. Selling up trying not to disturb the market?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:10:53
14 years old.. fuck. Hope it continues to grow and sets you up with a great start to being an adult.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:56:06
I'd just be happy with a go on Margot Robbie
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:18:35
If/when bitcoin hits $25,000 your $100 would be worth like $140. Wouldn't be a great deal monthly but little is better than none.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:16:02
The people selling at this price are gonna be very very bitter about buying back in at 20k. If I wasn't buying all your cheap coins I'd probably feel sorry for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:59:36
The ones who tactically sold and bought back in 5k cheaper are the real winners
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:47:04
Did you get to keep the LTC you bought ;)
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:02:49
"Told you so" - I cant wait for next month to say it back.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:05:26
Glitchy for me too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:53:59
Paying with debit/credit card was instant for me, it's if you're wiring money that takes days.

Be more specific. What month? What day? What time? Will it be before my bath or after?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:03:22
Why are you exchanging to euros? just use localbitcoins.com and send the bitcoin to coinbase/gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:55:56
I meant we aren't at an ATH. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:30:29
The bullshit you type continues. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:04:37
If it was on GDAX I'd already be invested
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:20:31
Once the dip stops it will be impossible to get back in with all the algos running

What the fuck is [this?](
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:11:47
I hope so man
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:11:24
Why? If you weren't confident enough to HODL at 10k what makes you confident enough to buy?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:30:08
My guess is 4 hours and 18 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:46:53
Doubled a lot of peoples investments in a couple days.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:37:24
If you're buying and hodlin' then just buy now. If you're planning to try and predict the market for day trading I'd say wait for a larger dip. They don't always come though and when they do sometimes you would have been better off buying earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:27:58
There's no fee for BTC withdrawals from gdax
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:17:29
Any brits trade with EUR instead of GBP because the markets busier? just curious
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:48
The last crash? Finally. To the moon 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:23:04
Somebody talk me out of investing in XRP, If I transferred all my BTC I could be a gazzillionaire.. major FOMO right now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:00:24
You'd only buy 7 BTC if it dropped to $30??
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:57:56
I love seeing Bitcoin rise as much as everyone else invested but it's rising too quickly again. 2k in a day? I feel a boxing day sale coming on.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:17:58
Never too late, I played with Bitcoin over a year ago and sold up thinking it was too late. Then I spent the last 6 weeks saying it was too late. Finally bought in 2 weeks ago and I've more than doubled my investment.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:51:21
I wonder if in 5 months time we will be reading another story of someone who went all in at 20k and made millions.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:15:11
Been doing this all day to me, rather annoying.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:33:30
Ooh pick me, pick me. I want to be scammed too
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:39:44
and here I am thinking £1200 was a decent swing.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:28:42
Yeah eventually processed, It's done it a few times since.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:19:09
If you purchased using the Coinbase app it shows you how much you have under accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:23:35
2 grand in a day. It can't handle this and it ever has
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:56:47
Anyone else like to piss off the algos by ruining their £150 spread with a 0.001 buy order right under the lowest sell order or is it just me
Wish they would fuck off. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:59:53
Is someone upset because they cant make a living on bitcoins predictability, bless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:14:44
So I want to get my shit off gdax and onto bittrex. Bitcoin transactions take forever so anyone know if converting to ETH and sending to bittrex that way will be any quicker?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:16:52
Seeing all these desperate people undercutting each other on their sell orders. Just stop, wait out for the price you want and you will get it. You're only doing yourself out of profit by driving your own price down. Common sense.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:46:34
Exact same pattern as before, whales tricking you into panic buying before dumping again. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:27:59
that was pretty accurate, haha
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:17:29
Ofcourse it is going down, it's a correction. Look at the charts and you will see XRB and XRP aren't affected by bitcoin like most alts
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:17:59
Today, what is it this time next year? I like the idea.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:11:16
gdax.com 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:43:49
I've made over 2btc doing this in the last few weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:14:14
My head tells me no, but my heads been telling me Bitcoin isn't sustainable for months and it continues to grow. I do think LTC will continue to grow especially as it gets a lot of attention being on the coinbase app but surely not at this rate?
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:22:34
I'd say more than a slight chance, but I'm just a random person on reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:46:41
face to face sale I'd imagine.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:50:41
If it hits 2-4k a day we get nice dips. So far (probably jinx myself) I've hit every dip almost perfectly lately. I started 4 weeks ago with 1btc and now have 3btc from day trading and catching the dips. I was just suggesting that when it rises as quickly as it has today it's usually wise to prepare for a dip. Be it selling now and buying back in or getting funds ready to simply add more to your collection. Check back here in the next 12 hours to see how much you would have benefited from my advice.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:53:51
I'll give you tree fiddy for it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:20:50
Nobody knows. Personally I think we're going to go a little lower yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:57:18
I think the main issue is the same questions being asked 300 times a day. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:56:58
My thoughts exactly, fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:08:35
Back to $13900 any second now. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:01:24
Thats what I meant, the coins appeared instantly when paying by debit/credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:07:39
Same as last week, and then up up up.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:58:57
Nobody I know knows/understands bitcoin. I'd have probably asked for a hardware wallet over actual bitcoins to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:41:09
Like I said ;)
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:56:41
Some people on localbitcoins.com don't require ID. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:46:59
only 25% of my buy order filled and then the price jumped up £1500/btc
all 10 mins after I fell asleep. sleeping is now banned.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:15:01
This guy knows.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:33:43
Yeah that is true. One thing is guaranteed though.. if I sell my btc now it will rise, and if I HODL it will drop, without a doubt haha.

Sell now and you'll be rewarded with a grand extra spending money when it dips and you buy back in. You're welcome 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:35:31
The first of many off the start line, I was expecting the charts to look like venga boys equaliser graphics

What's this "long term" you speak of and where's my lambo it's almost Christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:24:56
Would you like a slice?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:26:25
To all the weak hands, been nice knowing you. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:06:44
Find other coins to think about
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:07:26
I just used the opportunity to pick up some discounted ETH and LTC haha
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:00:32
It's bad when going to work for a days wage potentially costs you a weeks wage that you could have earned day trading. I think another 6-12 months and I'll stay at home trading full time haha
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:40:01
it "dipped" into the 13's and it has done a few times today but it can't stay there, 14k is where it's supported.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:27:15
What crash?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:38:17
Sadly yeah, I already put all my extra in at £14,900. oh well
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:55:17
I'd be happy with a peanut if you've one spare
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:08:45
The same thing you have for the last 24 hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:18:23
Why wouldn't he? if he truly believes a 10k dip is coming he would sell now and buy back in at 10k. Fucking FUD spreading..
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:45:47
I bought 100, holding tight.

We'll all be dead before it goes down to 5k lol.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:11:00
Nah man, the price is dropping because I just bought more. It's pretty standard for me haha
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:49:57
Coke but close enough 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:41:03
Seems a good sub to follow for info
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:36:20
Thought this myself. Would be entertaining 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:11:27
It's predicted to hit $20,400 then we'll have a $5000 correction for about 30 mins before blasting back to 20k. You heard it here first
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:51:01
Because everyone has put there BTC into XRP and XRB. 150% in 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:30:18
He's not acquiring more bitcoin, He's chasing after what he originally lost due to weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:52:08
I day trade, it's worth it if you can hit some of the dips. I'm probably 30% higher in profits than if I'd HODL'd. Only takes one bad move though and you're chasing to catch up. Looking back, I think I'd be better off just leaving my coins in a hardware wallet. The time I've spent staring at the order books and stuff probably isn't healthy lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:38:35
I've been saying it all week, it was obvious.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:13:17
Santa didn't give the whales any $$$, they're buying with the $$$ the took from the little people last week.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:29:02
Thought about swapping a few bitcoins for ripple but I personally think that it's close to a major drop. At least we're already riding it with bitcoin and have to be near the bottom already. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:06:56
Limit sell order is a figure above the current market price, when it reaches that price it will sell. a Stop limit sell order is if the market crashes and you put a figure in that you wish to sell at should it drop that much.

faucet has been paying Venezuelans a months salary for every hour played.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:06:25
Because "yes" would have been incorrect. A limit order isn't just above market price and a stop order isn't just below. It's important he/she understood that. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:57:33
[Guys calm down!](
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:02:11
It’s happening! 
@_date: 2018-11-08 14:54:33
What the fuck did I just read. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:08:44
Not your seeds not your bitcorn. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:06:53
I didn’t either but watching over hundreds of thousands of pounds profit disappear is still fucking sickening. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:37:27
You're one of them that bought in at 18k huh
@_date: 2018-07-04 22:57:25
Dude has heavy bags.
