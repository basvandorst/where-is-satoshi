@_date: 2015-12-20 17:41:05
Yeah, I get that. The expectation that you should be able to set your price point for an exploit as a "white hat" is what irks me. If you're in it for the money go grey hat or blackhat and quit whining.
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:11:03
If you're in it for the money then don't call yourself white hat.
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:11:43


...? Wow. You sound like an ungrateful entitled person right there. Nobody is obligated to pay you off for finding exploits. You should be happy that you got a payout.
edit: I'll save future commenters the trouble. If you report an exploit and receive a bounty and you don't feel like the bounty is enough, you're a dick. I don't care who you are. Your alternatives are use another service or go rogue. Crying because you were rewarded and it wasn't enough isn't acceptable. Being banned in this specific instance is almost certainly the result of trying to hold the exploited over coinbase's head for a bigger bounty and I agree with coinbase on this one. If any of you think you're smart enough to walk away with 100k from an exploit without being noticed by all means, go ahead.
@_date: 2015-12-04 02:56:36

No. As someone who has had the extreme displeasure of dealing with the Texas Attorney General's Office Child Support Division I can tell you for a fact that Greg Abbott doesn't give two shits about Texas mothers, fathers, or children. There is not oversight in these offices. A man *or* woman can walk in and say literally anything regarding abuse and there is 0 oversight. There will be no investigation. There will be no evidence gathered. Hearsay is taken at face value in mediation and court proceedings and refusals will be made if outside parties attempt to gather documents in order to understand how the process works via [Freedom of Information or Open Records Requests]( Frankly, the Texas Office of the Attorney General doesn't need to answer to anybody as far as the Child Support Division is concerned, and that is a serious problem [ethically speaking](

Just made my first bitcoin ATM withdrawal today. Didn't have much in the wallet anyway but seeing as how the price isn't likely to skyrocket overnight and I actually needed the money, no complaints.
Also, fuck the US government. They have time to bitch about health care and unsustainable unemployment benefits not creating jobs (how the fuck does punishing the unemployed by not giving them benefits help stimulate job creation!?) but they sure as hell have time to pass rulings to hurt promising new technologies. Absolutely unbelievable. If folks in the US don't wise up and start voting tech-illiterate "good 'ol boy" network types out of office other countries will soon be dancing circles around the US economy all the way to the bank. It's already begun and it's not slowing down any time soon.

What will they do then? I consider myself a basic user of bitcoin. I stick to the simple tools and haven't played with mining too much outside of running a desktop client (no dedicated hardware). I'm all about hypotheticals but given that I know more than many of the people in my circles about bitcoin at this point and that's next to nothing I'm not sure how reliable hypothetical cases are in this situation. The average end user in this case just wants to send and receive and will likely do so in whatever way requires the least work (no registration, no logins, no typing, etc)

I've been on coinbase for years now. I upped my daily limits to $10,000 USD buy and sell. I'm no stranger to how coinbase works. The verification is something that I already partially completed and I never had any problems. I wasn't using coinbase in any way unique to how I previously used it. Thanks for your input though.
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:21:43
Fuck it here's both of my reactions since I don't know what the price will look like by the time that I finish this comment.

I feel you. I got into bitcoin during a bout of unemployment so I definitely understand.

There seems to be some confusion in people assuming that I'm saying bitcoin is dead. Quite the contrary. I look forward to a price drop and stabilization so I can go all in again.
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:06:46
It spiked up $10 in a 24 hour period. It could drop by another $20 or $30 within a week. Whatever. I'm invested.

History inevitably repeats itself. The same money hungry powers who didn't get it the last time will weigh in with their wallets this time.

Coinbase's business will tank if they fork over the data and the IRS knows it. This is a tacit attack on Bitcoin as a platform and has next to nothing to do with taxation.
@_date: 2015-08-26 18:00:44
Fear mongering is standard fare for conservatives though. This seems pretty consistent. Point out that bitcoin doesn't fit the conservative interest of controlling capital. Liken its use to criminal activity. Spell doom for "the good 'ol days" to come. Profit.

Sometimes when you make an investment you lose. I agree that "sit back and watch" isn't a sound strategy, but neither is trying to save a sinking ship. Bitcoin isn't a sinking ship yet, and hopefully it never will be. As far as "helping" just keep on spending that coin when and where you can.

@_date: 2017-11-09 20:07:14
This I can agree with. It's reasonably suspicious that the IRS needs the data. Coinbase sending out 1099s (or whatever applicable form) would make a lot of sense.
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:47:19
I don't trust the state or banks to maintain a higher standard of security and privacy than what organizations like coinbase currently provide. After the recent Federal information leak I'd be willing to take my chances keeping cryptocurrency private and independent from any national or international systems.
The major benefit I see here is the potential widespread adoption of the currency in question, but again, I'd like to see private companies compete to make this a reality.
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:13:37


Not talking about stability here. I'm really only worried if the price hits anything below $200 at this point.


I know others have said it but it's worth repeating: if you think that bitcoin is a savings plan, you're doing it wrong and probably deserve the lesson that you will learn.
@_date: 2015-07-11 07:27:52

I bought in at $300 and $250. The only way to "lose" is to panic and pull out as soon as the value dips below what you bought in at. If the price hits $0 tomorrow then I will admit defeat.

That's what I'm talking about. Nobody should ever have the mistaken impression that bitcoin is a holding or security account or anything like that. It's like having gold or silver off to the side "just in case".
@_date: 2015-07-24 21:16:25
I dunno... I've only ever contacted coinbase the once and it was my mess up but at least they were polite about it. This whole rant smells funny.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:54:43
I put "lose" in quotes for a reason. If you're playing at being an investor you have to accept that you can't always "win". Sometimes you see a return. Sometimes you learn a valuable lesson. If you're really lucky, both happen.

If you make your own car and call it "Original Ford" you will get sued. Coinbase can only get away with what they're doing because Bitcoin is open source and Coinbase has at least enough capital to pay legal fees if it goes to court. It's a lose lose for everyone if the matter goes to court.

I don't think that a direct USD to Bitcoin replacement is practical or prudent. Bitcoin works well as an intermediary between currencies, is easily trackable due to the blockchain, and is difficult to tax or regulate.

New York doesn't have any authority when it comes to bitcoin. The federal government also has no authority when it comes to bitcoin.

I know that it's Brandon's choice to live like that but no human should ever have to be in a position where it makes more sense to forgo basic necessities in the interest of maximizing income.

Don't forget the racism- I mean "protected free speech". Yeah, that's what we'll call it from now on...

I mean if it's subject to the nanny state's will. Not if one can verify transactions.

The thought has occurred to me as well, but you're forgetting one critical point:
If BTC is indeed part of the grand conspiracy, the misdeeds of large governing bodies and private organizations will be brought to light when they are inevitably forced to start using blockchain technology. Do these entities really want to leave a money trail? Probably not.

I hear that the CEO of Duct Tape (not to be confused with Duck Tape) isn't doing too well these days. He just can't seem to hold it together.

Facts. I have a keg instead of a six-pack. Popular with the ladies if I don't say so myself.

You saw it here on reddit, folks!

How would you like to upgrade to "frienemy with benefits"?

Not surprised that it's happening in Venezuela considering recent events there. It's still sad and disappointing how far the people in power there are willing to go to attempt to control the populace.

WOW. The US has so much catching up to do at this point. Good move by the EU's court.

I bought a TV with Bitcoin back in the day. I liked my experience with that so much that I bought stock in the company that made that possible. Give it time.

Just happens to coincide with the US Government Shutdown. I'd be interested to see the numbers when (if?) the US govt gets back up and running.

No idea! I'm relieved though. Within 48 hours of initiating the sale I was on a plane out of state on business. The whole week I watched with regret as the price continued to rise. The initial $10 bump? No problem. $20? Now that stings. $30, $40 and so on I resigned myself to the reality that I had jumped the gun (for all the right reasons, mind you. An emergency came up and I was selling a non-trivial amount of BTC on top of taking out a line of credit). Today I saw the single sweetest word in human history under the status section of the transaction; "Canceled". I imagine that it was for identification reasons or something of the sort and I don't care. I'll gladly take this opportunity to search for alternatives.

Think the tide will shift when employers offer Bitcoin as a form of salary or compensation. I've asked for that in the past but it's still too new and risky for most employers to consider.

"Securities and investments". Close enough.
