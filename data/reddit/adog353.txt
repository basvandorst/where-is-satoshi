That's way more than enough to be suspicious.
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:47:30
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:34:55
BTC-E is the anonymously owned one. Bitfinex is a little bit less sketchy. They are based in Hong Kong and the owners are not well known.
Your best bet for a low fee, high liquidity and safe exchange would be Bitstamp, but they require identity verification.
Huobi is no fee but you are hedging in Chinese Yen instead of USD so it's a bit less stable. I trade on Huobi though and I trust them. They are the biggest Chinese exchange and the current market leader.
Vault of Satoshi is probably one of the safest exchanges to STORE your coins on out of all of them in my opinion, though its always safer for you to have your private keys.
Good luck!

Hey, fuck you. Amazon is great and just because Overstock accepts Bitcoin doesn't mean they're better. And I say this as someone who uses Amazon.ca(the shittiest one) which is still better than Overstock.
@_date: 2014-10-26 14:57:20
Oh please, don't cite as your source. This subreddit is wrong so often.
Also, I'm not going to waste my time having this discussion. I watched the charts throughout the bubble and it was clear Gox was leading the markets even though BTCChina would spike a little bit higher occasionally due to their low liquidity. I can't really "prove" you wrong here without chart replays so yeah bye.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:38:12
That's recent enough for it to be relevant. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:30:47
Oh, that's a shame. Ill see how that goes and if it ends up going. Thanks for letting me know before I put in too much effort haha.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:55:00
Would also like to know this.
@_date: 2014-08-19 01:20:52
Why would I be? I didn't have Bitcoin pre-recent bubble, and I started shorting it all the way down post-gox. I made my fair share of profits. I just didn't overexpose myself by trading with too much because circumstances can change.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:53:24
It doesn't seem like your request was all that unreasonable. What if this guy did something stupid and it looked like he worked at Virtex to community members?

Yes, they do. That's correct, but I can guarantee that when Amazon finds out people are carding their site to get free Bitcoin then they will put a stop to all of this. What I'm wondering is when a chargeback happens, who gets screwed over in this case? Amazon, or the CC company? Most likely Amazon.


Amazon would do at least a small investigation and would probably contact the Purse.IO user. I highly doubt they'd try to hold them accountable but nonetheless if a chargeback happens they would at least get a call.

This is terrible investment advice. Who the fuck upvotes this shit?

Holy fuck you idiots get trolled so hard.
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:59:45
So you truly believe there is an investor out there that purchased 570,000BTC using automated buys on Gox? Using a bot that was hosted at Mt. Gox's servers? Executing random $2,500,000 market buys automatically?
Edit: Also, I guess you're disregarding the part in the report where he mentioned the cash balances get created automatically when the buys get executed. Come on guys, don't be a bunch of fools. We only went to 1200 because of Marks fat ass and none of you will accept that until the bubble is popped and we're back at 100
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:41:12
First of all, U.S clients are not allowed to wire money to BTC-E. Also, BTC-E is a little bit of a shady exchange(anon, no one knows who owns them). But this isn't to say that they're bad, they have been one of the most reliable exchanges around but I would limit the amount of money you keep on there.
If you are depositing from the U.S I would recommend getting verified at [Bitstamp]( and wiring the money to them.

Yes, but having to do all of that and save 2 keys in extremely secure places is still a pretty big hassle. If you lose them then what?
Xapo also offers a debit card(which has not been released yet).
Xapo just makes it much easier for the user to spend and save Bitcoin without them having to worry about any of the technical details. Unlike you and me a lot of people are not interested in that.

Yes...he did consistently market buy millions of dollars worth of coins...it happened over 3 months. That's consistent.
IDK what to say to you. 


This is so incorrect it makes me sad. Willy bought about an average of 2900 coins per day. That's a massive amount of buy volume especially when those coins were never sold back, even though I know you think they were. The fact that you're saying this wouldn't make very little difference just shows how little you understand how supply and demand and markets work.
I'm bored of this now, bye.

AFAIK he has given no one refunds.
You have to be skeptical in the crypto space. Look at what happened with Danny Brewster. This is looking VERY VERY similar. Keep that in mind as an investor.
CEO's ignoring questions on a 6 month late product is never a good sign. To be completely honest, if I was invested I would sell any shares I had in his company but you seem to be a happy investor.

You didn't include a fee, thus mining pools don't want to spend CPU power to include your transaction in a block. It might take a little bit longer. I'm not too sure, but in the future include a fee.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:33:38
Hits just about ~7%. It's about the same as Virwox which is the only other way to buy with a credit card.

Not be sketchy and post information about your company on your website including address, phone number, registration numbers etc. Obviously that doesn't stop a scam but it makes a business seem a lot less like one.

I'm not denying that it isn't against most credit card processors rules, but there have been a couple in the past and now Circle is supposed to be doing it, but that's just a plan.
The main reason for it is because of chargebacks. That's even why credit card companies don't allow it. The reason for the agreements being ended is because the high amount of fraud. It's simply just way too hard too hard to deal with without KYC &amp; AML.
Also,  accepts credit cards today. There are processors that are allowing it they just need a way to protect against fraud, which  video verification does well.

Nothing to do with plugging into an API buddy.
So you're telling me that if Amazon realized that more and more people began using Purse.IO, and a good percentage of those transactions ended up being chargedback due to credit card fraud, are you telling me that amazon couldn't send them a C&amp;D order and then take legal action?
Amazons the one getting screwed here with stolen product. They wont just let that happen if it becomes popular.
They definitely have a case.

It does not, and after 10 days of constant discussion on the subject it still seems like half of reddit does not understand that.
@_date: 2014-06-29 22:55:14
I believe it will be either market or slightly above(700 max).
The advantage is that you get a little bit of attention and you get them all at once. If someone bought 30K BTC on market, it would definitely move the price up as people would notice sooner or later and also the price would just naturally increase over time.
The 1800$ comment was not really specifically directed at you, mostly at other people. I think it reflects terribly on our community that something like this has been upvoted to the front page.

To put it frankly, I really don't care that you were the first person to post a picture of Willy on the charts on reddit, nor do I care that you coined his name. I watched the bubble, and Gox made the first moves on every rally, not BTCChina.

What an ignorant statement. 
Bitcoin was an innovation, so yes it's important. It was the first P2P digital currency and that's kind of a big deal. People want to know who he is because what he started is *fucking awesome*. Just because he stopped working on it after 4 years doesn't mean he's irrelevant. 
Also, he kind of is supposed to have 10% of the currently mined Bitcions. What a shit post.

Unless you implement KYC &amp; AML you will have massive amounts of fraud. Even WITH KYC &amp; AML there is still a huge fraud risk. Circle claims they are going to do it without KYC &amp; AML but to this date no one has done it besides Coins.mx which requires video verification of your ID and CC.

I'm not short because it could go either way. Regardless, if you take a look at the charts shorts always peak at the bottom and longs always peak at the top. It's not really too much of an indicator besides market sentiment.
Think of what would happen if a long squeeze happened. We would have cascading margin calls all the way down. Who knows how low we could go at that point.

Yeah, it went on to 25x and 100x after losing the majority of its value. My point is, when something is increasing that much it's quite obviously a bubble and you should sell. That's not hindsight, anyone with a clear view of the situation could tell that was a massive bubble and it was going to retrace. I wasn't even that in to Bitcoin at the time and I knew that.

@_date: 2014-11-20 20:31:51
The model isn't broken, it's intended that way. Everyone trading on BitVC futures should have known this was going to happen and they assumed this risk when they signed up. If they didn't expect it they probably didn't read how BitVC settlement works because it was obvious that this could happen with their low liquidity during volatile market times.
@_date: 2014-12-14 05:28:23

My OP was more of a joke. I don't really think Bitcoin is a full pyramid scheme, but it's something very close to it, maybe something we don't exactly have a definition yet for.
Also, you say that pyramid schemes guarantee a payout. I see a LOT of people being given advice to just buy Bitcion and hodl because they'll be worth thousands one day. Like I said, it's not exactly a pyramid but it's very close to one.

Very few people will pay 20%-30% markup on Bitcoins just to pay with their credit card. The site is populated with tons of scammers.
Even if the site is set up that way, what happens is that the owner of the card ends up issuing a stolen card chargeback and that leaves Amazon, being the merchant, as the "baghodler". This means sometimes Amazon will harass you, or in this case disable the gift card.

Interac Online is supposed to be irreversable according to their faq  but apparently it is now. A quick google search on the subject reveals that some selling Bitcoins for Interac E-Transfer were scammed because they really are reversible and it just depends who at the bank you're talking to.

@_date: 2014-10-24 16:31:20
He had a **personal** bank account getting "5-6" deposits PER DAY from across the UK, then when they said they were inspecting account his first action was to withdraw all his money. 
You realize that banks have AML protocol to follow, right?  OP's account looked sketchy as fuck and on top of that on first sight of inspection he tried to withdraw all his money. What part about this seems ok from a compliance workers perspective? His account was closed because he was high risk.
Obligatory: Banks are LITERALLY HITLER GUYS XDD DAE???

Great post. Sucks that you didn't get any replies.
I agree with you completely. As a trader though I would be very sad to see my 0 fee trading taken away.
I have always been skeptical about Bitcoin market data. We always have to keep in mind that the market leader, Huobi, has lots of influence on other markets and could manipulate their data to move the price.
What sort of microfee were you thinking of? Like, 0.1%? Or even lower? After trading with no fees on Huobi it would be painful to go back to paying commission on every trade. It's much easier to make a profit on no fee.
@_date: 2014-10-28 03:44:54
Not everything is posted on reddit or reported. That's very likely imo because almost all(if not all) were operating without MSB licenses and some weren't even performing KYC/AML.

Multibit is good, but [Armory]( is also a great client. It's up to personal preference. 
Also, one thing: if I could have been told one thing before starting with Bitcoin or crytocurrency in general it would be DON'T DAYTRADE, at least until you know what you're doing. It's extremely easy to lose your money.
Good luck!

I'm not interested in having a lengthy discussion on like 20 different topics right now, but I just wanted to say that you're wrong about the block reward not being subsidized. If there is not an increase in transaction fees miners will stop making income after the blocks halve and will only continue to get worse.
This is a serious problem. Currently every transaction is subsidized by $20 worth of BTC. Since the block reward is going to eventually be 0, transaction fees will have to make up for this cost. Currently, fees are as low as $0.05 per transaction and came out to a total of just above $4000 USD for the entirety of October 10th. Everyday the network rewards $1,300,000 USD(generous lowball) worth of BTC to miners(at the time of writing), so as you can see we have a very big problem and a long way to go before this is even close to sustainable.

They do have a case that will hold up. All I can say is wait and see. Either the website goes dead because of extremely high fees to the point where CC users would never use it, or they get killed by fraud.
If the fees are 10% - 25% barely anyone who's sane would buy through them. Especially with things like Circle coming around now. 
Also, it's true that fraud is built into Amazon's bottom line but if they notice a huge influx of fraud and realize that Purse.IO is the source you can bet they wont be happy about it. I'd argue that there's quite a bit of fraud going on on Purse.IO and I've even seen some Bitcoin customers claim their items have been chargedback and Amazon contacted them about it.
Whatever though. We will wait and see :)

How many times do we have to go over this? There is still possibility for someone with bad intentions that works at Ghash...
Oh wait, there was!
At least that's what they claimed happened, but who knows the real story.
And do you realize what a successful 51% attack would do to Bitcoin? The price would tank, that's for sure. It'll definitely scare off new adopters and the general public since Mainstream media would milk the shit out of this. It doesn't matter if miners switch pools once they start the attack haha.
@_date: 2014-07-08 21:23:22
That's a wonderful attitude that will get you absolutely nowhere! Nice!
You need to adapt to what the general consumer needs. If it's too complicated, Bitcoin will never succeed. There's nothing more to it.

I've seen those abnormalities before. They definitely do strike me as odd, but as far as I'm concerned those are simply API glitches.
This is the chart that is displayed on BitVC: 
 If you take a look at Bitcoinwisdom on the same date and time there is a candle that has a high of 3930.5 and a low of 3736.6. This is not reflected on either Huobi.com nor BitVC which leads me to believe that this is just an API glitch and no trades were actually executed at those prices.
@_date: 2014-10-25 20:00:06
The price could  go to $10 and Bitcoin would still be fine. IMO a full bubble pop would be around $50-$100. Bitcoin would continue to operate as normal.

Well considering that 99% of merchants that accept Bitcoins these days immediately cash them out via Coinbase or Bitpay, using a Bitcoin at a merchant is essentially cashing out. I guess you could transfer 300,000 Bitcoins to someone and say they are worth $150,000,000 but they're really not because you wont be able to use the majority of those coins anywhere because it would tank the market.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:47:37
Like he said, the community is being very harsh. While an apology is great and all, you have to remember that in this business that is not enough.
In my opinion your exchange could be great with a few important changes that are listed in this thread over and over. 
The reality is that you now have to earn your customers, because VoS swooped in and stole lots of them from right under you. You could very easily fix this.
Also I have to say I agree with your comments on Joseph David. He seems like a good CEO who knows what he's doing. CAVirtex will go much further with a couple adjustments to how you do business.

You're wrong. It's actually completely about chargebacks and anyone here would tell you that.
WeSellDoges has a daily purchase limit of 15$ and requires an email sent from the paypal owners email. To give you an idea of how easily that is to get by, you can buy a hacked Paypal account with full access(email included) for about 15$. Much less if you buy in bulk.
WeSellDoges already got destroyed by fraud. They had to implement email verification to try to throttle it, but they will cave eventually. It's not sustainable at all when carders can get paypal accounts for nothing and just spam charges.

Standard price fluctuations. Probably because of the high amount of margin buying.
Those borrowing Bitcoin on margin are getting impatient and are eating that 0.1% cost per day. Eventually they get tired and close, causing the price to drop.

This is one of the biggest problems with Bitcoin right now, and it's being fixed.
Try Coinbase if you're in the U.S. Also, on Localbitcoins they have a Cash Deposit option which allows you to walk into a bank and just deposit cash into someones account for Bitcoins at any branch!
Good luck :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 20:08:32
Yes, that's exactly what I'm thinking. And you haven't debunked anything. I still know that Gox lead the rally.
Also, no matter how the fuck willy made his purchases, it added up to 2.3% of the existing Bitcoin while only a fraction of all Bitcoin was being traded on the markets anyway which resulted in little supply. I think a couple of things contributed to that, including not being able to withdraw from Gox.

@_date: 2014-10-25 20:40:05


Do you understand how supply and demand works? It doesn't matter how small or spread out they are.


Actually, many active traders I speak to agree with me. Gox always made the first move, and then BTCChina would follow up on it. Everytime. Just because BTCChina's price was a little bit higher, doesn't mean they were leading. Gox always lead with volume. It's comparable to Bitfinex today. Bitfinex often moves further than other exchanges in either direction but that doesn't mean they're leading, Huobi &amp; OKCoin still leads the market.
Edit: Also, your "math" up there doesn't prove anything. Willy bought and held 2.5% of all BTC in existence. That is way more than enough to manipulate the market.
@_date: 2014-07-04 19:45:14
500,000 coins is a percentage of the network. To mix coins you would need to exchange the Gox coins with someones clean coins.

There are ones like Bitcoinfog but it wouldn't matter if Karpeles put all his coins in there. They would just mix with themselves because there's no mixers with the volume that Karpeles has to mix.
Mixers are pretty self explanitory. They basically just give you someone elses coins. In this case, Karpeles has 180,000 coins so he would probably just end up with his own coins back since none of the mixers have enough volume to support that amount.

Because if even a fraction of the 13 million coins counted in that statistic were sold on an exchange the price would sink. As an example, Huobi's orderbook has maybe about 8000 coins down to 0 CNY.
@_date: 2014-10-25 19:46:25


I can't really argue with you on this because I can't prove it, but I simply disagree.


That doesn't matter, because those were buys and sells. Willy bought and held, on Gox, around 2.3% of the existing Bitcoin at the time and held them throughout the bubble. Do you actually believe that buying and holding 270K BTC wouldn't have an effect on the price? Think about how much BTC are in the orderbooks today, and tell me that wouldn't have made a significant difference overtime.


What the fuck are you talking about? He consistently market bought millions of dollars worth of coins. How is that small? Are you telling me 2 market buys of 5k coins a day wouldn't affect the market? Because it's almost comparable. Because if you are, then I'm not going to even bother arguing with you.

It's true Bitcoin can learn some stuff from a couple of the new coins out there, but he is correct in that faster confirmation times don't matter. Just because it's faster doesn't mean it's as secure.

Most people here fail to mention that it is extremely difficult to get USD into BTC-E and you end up paying a lot in fees. Also, the spread is normally higher. Normally it's $10-$15 dollars from BTC-E to Stamp and during times of high volatility I've seen as high as a $50 spread last week.

Once amazon realizes that Purse.IO is indirectly facilitating credit card fraud on their website they will have them shut down quickly. I'm sure they're just not aware yet.

Please read the report. The way the orders were placed makes it clear this isn't the case, and so does the way the users were identified in the database.

What a shame, Justcoin looked really promising.

I wouldn't say 50%, but yeah something more like 70% of the price.
@_date: 2014-07-20 23:49:00
I wouldn't really call Bitcoin a pump and dump though, at least not yet. It's missing the super large dump yet.
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:29:55
Are you serious? Ghash has history of being malicious and people are fucking brushing this off like it's not big deal?
@_date: 2014-10-25 21:38:15
I'm not mixing up anything, Willy was a series of accounts that spent up to $25M on each account, then proceeded to make a new one and spend a similar amount on that account too.
And what are you saying nobody knows? There's full fucking trade logs. He literally pasted Willy's entire trade history in the original report. You're only "done here" because you cant argue with facts from the database and you realize you're wrong.
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:47:11
No...it's not though.

This is amazing. The only thing I'm worried about is BTC-E attracting so much volume and then getting shut down by police etc.. That would  be gox ep.2 
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:50:45
Your post doesn't even make sense. Why shouldn't I say to stop supporting them?
This isn't an isolated case, this seems to be happening more and more. Money is just dissapearing, and it's taking clients weeks to deal with their poor support team and get their funds back *if they even do get them back*.
Take a look at [this]( incident, for example. At least he's been lucky enough to be contacted by BTC-E and has his claim resolved.
You can continue to support them with trading fees and even keep as much money as you want in the account, I don't care. But everyone that does this needs to realize that they are trusting their money to an unregistered business without any contact information. No one even knows who the owner of the company is, so if they decide to run off one day with your money there isn't much you can do about it.

It's alright, Vault of Satoshi will welcome you with open arms. They're better anyway.
CAVirtex has their head up their ass with 1.5% trading fees and now this. Meanwhile Vault of Satoshi is offering free trading, withdrawls and deposits for a couple months. They already lost tons of business, this pathetic shit hurts them even more.

Yes, I'm aware Bitcoin is heavily manipulated but you cannot attribute this entire drop to manipulation.
I trade Bitcoin so I'm watching the charts very often and I did not see any manipulation funny business going on while trading these drops. When that type of stuff is happening its quite obvious.
There's a clear difference between natural deflation because speculators are slowly selling back(see  and price manipulation by big players.

How about you quit brigading like most of the other Buttcoiners?
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:22:54


You said it right here. It's not the amount of monetary value that can be transferred with Bitcoin at any given time because if anyone tried to cash out a fraction of those coins the price would tank. It's a number that really doesn't mean anything.
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:11:09

Xapo also claimed to offer insurance. How about that?
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:41:42
Not really. After the drop the 880, then to 500 which rebounded to 900 it was very evident that those prices weren't going to last especially after a 10x price increase. Most rational people were screaming bubble while some hodlers refused to sell.
@_date: 2015-01-09 00:24:10
That is a bet...They haven't said anything about being online in two or three days. Did you even pay attention to the page you were looking at?
@_date: 2014-09-25 21:17:39
Lol. Even the fact that it goes in to the -'s makes it obvious it's a scam. Even if they do send you something, they will probably just end up paying out for a couple days or so then running away with all funds after that. Also, if they do pay, they will pay via VIRWOX exchange paypal withdrawal to keep themselves anon.

I don't think you know what you're talking about. OKCoin is pretty garbage, but 796 is one of the most transparent exchanges out there and have been around for quite a while.
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:25:47
That doesn't mean that continuing to relate Bitcoin with anarco-libertianism is good in any way at all.

@_date: 2015-01-25 02:38:04
It's not giving a middle finger to Satoshi. It's more about not looking like a cult. Seriously if I was just getting in to Bitcoin and I came here and saw the way people talk I would GTFO real quick.
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:23:00
Because what if the USD collapsed and then the bankers would steal his money?
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:26:54
Market cap is useless because it attempts to measure available supply when a huge percentage of Bitcoins are unavailable, i.e Proof of Burn, Satoshi, etc. Market cap is an arbitrary number that doesn't at all measure liquidity which is what you're trying to describe because there is literally a fraction of the market cap being traded at once on exchanges. Try selling 5K coins and see where the market cap is after that. It doesn't mean anything.
@_date: 2014-10-26 00:00:09
Jesus f'n Christ...I didn't say at any point that he did make any larger purchases.
But I guess this can end here. If you don't think Willy caused massive upwards pressure on the markets(if he exists as described in the report) you don't understand supply and demand. Plain and simple. Also I'd appreciate if you didn't downvote every post I made. It's pretty childish.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:24:51
Wtf at that title. Traders opening long and short positions is not market manipulation. Please stop using words you do not understand, OP.

Hey, you were wrong. Own up to it at least instead of being a sour loser especially when you came back specifically to harass me about being "wrong".

Yeah, pretty obvious. It's a shame they've profited so much off it.
@_date: 2014-04-26 20:46:46

@_date: 2014-05-06 15:28:14
Yeah, it's a shame. I understand that. Honestly this was more of a project I made for myself and I decided to post it around. I didn't even realize the site was getting a couple hits until I looked at the statistics. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:42:29
Vault of Satoshi is probably the best you will get man. CaVirtex is not much better.
If you're trying to trade just move your coins over to a nofee exchange like Huobi or something like Bitfinex. Much lower fees.

Not everyone who disagrees with you is a buttcoiner. So many people making rational arguments against Bitcoin get down voted constantly in this subreddit while comments calling him a buttcoin troll get upvoted.

That was edited in about 20 minutes after my post was made and long before your post was made.  I'm sure no one even noticed my incorrect numbers until you posted though because people downvote anyone who thinks Bitcoin isn't going to go to 10000 next year.

Well you are very lucky. Many other users did not have the same experience.

It is okay that this subreddit is positive towards Bitcoin, that is fine and expected. It's a problem though that this subreddit is organizing community marketing campaigns and promoting Bitcoin an investment while simultaneously downvoting even constructive and educated criticism while passing it off as concern trolling(or paid shills depending on their degree of crazy).

Circle also does extremely extensive identity verification that Paypal does not do. Don't you see all the complaints about Coinbase and even more Circle denying purchases? It's because the fraud risk is way too high.
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:07:06
$3 million is literally 0.2% of overstocks $1.5 billion yearly sales in 2014. That's basically nothing. Also, considering that's one of the only online "general stores" that accepts Bitcoin that's not very much at all. What do you think would happen to all those extremely loyal customers if Amazon suddenly started accepting Bitcoin? Don't think they would be so loyal anymore.

Because otherwise this subreddit would entirely consist of posts with economics "experts" discussing how the world economy is about to collapse and Bitcoin is about to destroy the banks and the entire political system. This already happens anytime an article related to any economy is posted and I think we have enough of it.

@_date: 2015-03-08 04:02:04
FYI, Purse.IO is knowingly facilitating credit card fraud.
My warning: 
A couple of examples: 
Proceed with caution. Or don't at all unless you want your house to be searched. Other then a carder only a complete moron would pay 25% markup for BTC. Think about it for a minute.
@_date: 2015-03-04 03:34:24
Lol, no legitimate company complying with laws would list on Havelock, a site that is not operating legally. Also, check out how many of the listed companies went bust and got delisted. I bet it's about 9/10. That's why no one competent would buy shares in a "company" listed on Havelock, they don't do any verification that the company is actually legitimate.

Regardless of your point, which does make sense, there's still overwhelming evidence showing that market manipulation happened and it's pathetic that people deny it still. Most of these people are blinded by their greed and don't want to admit $1250 was fake because they bought somewhere around the bubble range and are now in heavy losses.
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:47:41
Lol, anyone that doesn't think that Mt. Gox was up to some market manipulation is delusional or they don't want to admit $1250 was fake. There is no way all those coins were whales because anyone who's a whale wouldn't be dumb enough to buy at 1000. There is way too much evidence showing that Willy is real, I wish people would stop denying it.
@_date: 2015-03-08 04:09:53
Bitcoin is manipulated far more than any stock. Speculating on Bitcoin is a game of guessing where the manipulation will take the price.

Down, like it has been for the past year. I've been shorting since 800 and stopped At the 275 crash. Might get back in to it though because it's free money. I almost feel bad doing it because I'm essentially stealing money from delusional crazies, but if I don't someone else wil.

@_date: 2015-02-01 22:58:26
This is because even though they may appear complaint, they may not be (see: bitinsant) and in the end it's the bank that faces issues. There is no Bitcoin regulation in the U.K so the conservative banks stay away from it to avoid any issues.

Here we go again, the same person rehashing the same old false arguments while shouting "I discovered Willy so I must be right". All you did was take a screenshot on wisdom.
