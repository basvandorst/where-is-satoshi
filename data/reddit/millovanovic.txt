You can create wallets inside the Coinbase app. Note, those wallets are not really yours. Coinbase owns them, lets you use them for free and keeps the private keys for you. In that sense, you cannot easily make a mistake, since all the security is on their side. You can use those wallets in the same way as if they were yours, but if Coinbase goes down for some reasons, they will be inaccessible. It boils down whether you trust Coinbase to keep your keys safe (risks from hacking) or yourself (risks from common home disasters, storage failures and forgetting where you stored your details).

Coinbase offers the best user experience for beginners, but make sure to check their fees.

When you use Coinbase you may choose to send your exchanged BTC to a private wallet if you have one (either software or hardware) or you can use Coinbase's online wallet which they keep safe for you, which is again the easiest thing for the beginners. On top of that they have a vault where you can store your BTC for extra protection. Both of those Coinbase services are free of charge. The risk is that if Coinbase gets hacked (which in my opinion is not very likely), your wallet could be devalued. The risk of having your own wallet is that you could lose it or expose your private key to someone.

Europe is also very diverse. In Sweden, for example, we tend to use bt.cx.

Now you are just rude, and still no value in your words.

You are right for EUR/USD, each currency has its own account. Then you can use Coinbase to exchange them from one to another, but this is not very cheap. Standard workflow is to deposit some USD from your personal bank to Coinbase USD account (this should be free) and then you exchange that for BTC which you never sell, because we expect that the value will grow longterm. 
In case you would want to use a hardware wallet at some point (which is very good and secure option), you would create your new private key on it and send your BTC from Coinbase wallet to your new hardware wallet. If this is going to be a one-time thing, then the fee would be negligible (at the moment around $13, but often lower).

Diversification is the core of good investing.

...as long as you are the only one who controls it.

Depending on where you are, there are different options, so I cannot provide a simple answer.

The problem with altcoins is that there are so many of them. Therefore, you need to pick the right ones, knowing that 90% of them will probably not exist in 3 years from now. That said, this is a risky business with a very high reward if you play your cards right.
On the other hand, investing in bitcoin is featured with a much lower risk, but, as you say, it will not get you a super high reward.
Still, if you look at the investment alternatives of the same order of risk/reward, e.g. lottery and stock markets. I think that an educated investment in criptocurrencies would give higher returns for the risk exposures in question, compared to any alternatives and that is why we are all here.

You are right, I have just checked. You need to do it on their website. They call it "accounts" instead of wallets because they resemble classic banking/checking accounts. So the process is: you create one account for the FIAT currency like USD or EUR and then you can make BTC, ETH or LTC accounts. Still, these criptocurrency wallets/accounts have their standard cripto addresses from which you can send and receive your BTC as you would do with a privately stored wallet.
As for the owning the coin... Technically, it is owned by whoever owns the private keys, so in this case it is Coinbase. It is through the user agreement that they let you control whatever coin is stored on your account. So in practice it is as if the coins are yours and you should not feel any difference as long as Coinbase functions properly.
