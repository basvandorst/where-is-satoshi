Upvoting because I agree, we are horridly behind schedule, I'm not trying to justify this or ask for forgiveness.  Here are some facts/key points though that I believe are significant..
1) 50% of our orders are fulfilled, it sucks others aren't however we have been very clear about the pitfalls and completely transparent throughout the whole process.
2) We vastly improved our product during this time and kickstarter backers are getting that product
3) We used Kickstarter in the way it was intended, to bring a product to life.
4) Pre-orders are != Kickstarter, pre-orders ship in May, Kickstarter orders ship before.  It's a similar product but with minor tweaks in packaging and overall product.

I felt it wasn't apt.

Hey Alex, firstly let me say it wasn't me that downvoted your post.  I actually encourage open debate about how we operate..  Sorry if this got burried..
Firstly let me call you out on some misinformation you provide..


That's not true at all.  Take a look on social media you will find lots of people tweeting/faceaching pics of their ring.


That's not true at all, I can see your correspondance in Zendesk.  You also failed to read any updates we posted, you can't call us out for being ignorant if you openly admit you were not willing to read our updates yourself.


RE your pastebin you nicely removed quite a few bits from the end of our correspondance, if you want I can post the entire pastebin for posterity..
The TLDR; here is that your attitude towards our team was that you used kickstarter to buy a product and not to back a project.  **Kickstarter is not a store.**.  For that purpose we hope that by cancelling your order you will have a different attitude to crowd-funded projects in the future..
We work very hard to innovate and the last thing we need is negativity from our community...
I don't mean to create an enemy here, I hope to change the way you think, perhaps by cancelling your order I went about it the wrong way, perhaps I should have taken a naughty step approach with you..  I tried to make you understand by levelling with you but I failed, perhaps I lack the customer service skills to, perhaps I'm completely wrong here..  At the end of the day we're all human and a little bit of patience, understanding and reading/listening goes a long way...
My apologies again if you aren't happy, I understand if you probably aren't..  Maybe we should just go different ways and hopefully in a few years if our paths cross again we will both have a better experience of each other.

I couldn't agree more, at first it does feel weird to wear any ring especially 24x7!  Takes a week or so to get used to the "feel" of it
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:28:36
Agreed, cheap tags are great, in fact you can get free tags from Midas if you ask for Midas Smartrac samples!  I suggest you do that just to hack about with them :)  
The NFC Ring is a completely different beast, the tags have to be tuned to metal and that in itself is a very difficult task!
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:30:55
Interesting, well we leveraged this as a plus for BTC but the impression I'm getting from the bitcoin community is that the risks outweigh the rewards.
Also worth mentioning that the US, FTC is only maybe 1% of those BTC pre-orders, the majority are inside the Euro Zone.
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:01:02
I'm the developer of this ring and you are technically correct other than the fact that the door key you keep in your pocket is way more vulnerable to physical attacks.  We did a bunch of testing on this and found that having the ring on the inside of your palm it's very hard to obtain the data (compared to a key in your pocket)
@_date: 2013-07-21 11:55:28
steamruler is correct like a boss.
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:12:46
As the developer I can confirm this :)
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:14:54
Right I will jump on that now, 2mins
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:31:44
Pretty sure it's against TOS of K/S
@_date: 2013-07-21 18:55:46
soon ;)
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:13:03
Two tags :)
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:39:21
Yea it honestly is :|  I have some pics somewhere, please be safe people..
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:04:20
I explain why implanting in a hand is a bad idea in our "the evolution of the ring video", many of our glass prototypes smashed under skin and people got copper poison, heh :\
@_date: 2013-09-18 15:40:52
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:17:22
Ahh so it was set to private, I have no idea how or why that happened..   is the link tinkercad gives me..  Try search again if that doesn't work..  It's just a basic example, also search for NFC ring Old for another example.
We basically have a few weeks to get the final design done for the NFC Ring, it wont be a huge job to do it as the shapes are simple and I think we will run it as a community project(competition) pretty soon :)
@_date: 2013-07-26 00:14:39
I have a product on bitcoinstarter right now and I'm kinda sad about the level of support compared to the support im getting on kickstarter 
@_date: 2013-07-21 00:35:17
Please don't delete, it's nice to have facts clear for people to see :)
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:45:44
+1, let me sort in general the whole 3d printable thing out, I feel I have let the 3d printing community down a bit as I focused on the core product.. To be fair to me though I do have to deliver the 3D stuff by the end of the Kickstarter so I do have 4 weeks :P
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:02:11
haha :)
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:26:22
As the developer of this ring a fan of 1984 I agree this is dangerous so here are some responses to your critique:
* you can remove this ring
* your ID is only available should you hold your hand OPEN to a reader with an open gesture.
* $30 replaces your ID tag
* The software is open source and always will be so you can see exactly what it's doing
@_date: 2013-08-06 11:53:53
Get an NFC reader on this bad boy and integrate it with the NFC Ring! 
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:23:38
There is a video about how the ring handles security in the kickstarter, it explains it pretty well I hope.
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:14:38
No, you completely failed to watch the video about security..  Please take your time to watch this, I spent like 2 months solving this problem so at least spend a few minutes of your time before jumping to conclusions..
@_date: 2013-10-11 11:41:08
Exactly.  Good description, I always suck at explaining things so thanks for that
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:28:01
This is true, for those interested :)
@_date: 2013-09-18 11:58:01
R or C might cost a lot less?
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:07:46
Sorry but you are wrong here, the matter of the fact is you can easily cut titanium at this thickness..
However, giving you the benefit of the doubt I actually sort of agree, mostly because I really like other materials and we'd love to make more metal material rings..  The matter of the fact is when you make rings at the scale we are working at to keep the cost down we have to do either steel or titanium...
To do the same ring in platinum would be like $1500, silver probably $300, I doubt many backers would back us as a new venture at that amount, especially considering how difficult it is for non US kickstarters..
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:32:54
I wish someone would raise a bunch of money to encourage hackers to exploit the NFC Ring unlock..  
We could do with the media coverage/support a lot more than Apple....
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:34:53
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:26:44
The alpha ring does as is stated in the kickstarter..
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:36:36
You meant Crowd-funding then I think.  Crowd-funding existed way before Kickstarter.
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:28:49
Haha thanks but honestly it wasn't me that posted this :) Thanks man!
@_date: 2013-10-18 00:16:19
Alternative pay with your ring:  
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:20:32
Apologies for this, I'm a sloppy dev with a lot on (I maintain a lot of big projects for big companies)..
I think I replied to these early on, note aobut github being messy though, I will sort this out tomorrow :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:38:44
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:13:46
Haha :) This made me chuckle..  I actually made a necklace with one of my inlays in a few days ago..  Safe to say she got a lot of attention on a night out..
@_date: 2013-07-21 00:45:18
I think the NFC wiki page would answer that best, it's a lot of very small differences...

John from the NFC Ring here.
I'm working on the bar problem.  The vendor can scan pumps to get prices / details of drinks, you can then pay for beer with an NFC Ring touching it to the vendors phone.  
I shot a piece for MSN about it on Monday, it should be up in a few days.  If you want a sneak preview peep my initial proposal: 
The value pitch to a bar is:
 * Low cost to merchant (can use already existing devices[probably])
 * No need to use till for bitcoin payments, reducing time spent serving ergo increasing bar worker efficiency.
 * Bitcoin purchasers get a higher value experience because they get a little narrative with their beer (should they choose it)
I'm deploying it in the first bar in the world on Wednesday next week (all things going to plan), initially we have support from Mycelium but bitpay and coinbase will follow shortly after.
Edit: I miss spelled Mycelium
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:31:14
You will get an email response with a series of questions
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:21:53
I love your idea, the only reason why digital door locks are great though is because you have graceful fall-back in case you lose your ring you can put a code in to get access..
This is also great if you have someone turn up at your house and you aren't in , you can give them a code to get in and then just reset your door code afterwards..
Still, great idea :)
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:12:12
1. yeah 12mm along the axis, they are ~2mm OD-ID.  The rings are in a variety of diameters, yea larger inside diameter.  If you have big man hands go for the alpha ring every time, you will have way better readability and device support.
2. CAD files are on tinkercad, I thought I made them public, with so much going on today I may have missed this?!
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:39:55
I'm gonna read this as Bitcoin is good, Paypal is bad
@_date: 2013-07-21 00:48:02
I agree, I do some metal work and you should be careful with jewellery in general.  I have seen chains get caught up in angle grinders, no fun at all...
I wore a ring around my neck for a few months, it wasn't very convenient to use compared to my hand..
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:25:09
Thanks man!  Appreciate the support :) 
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:17:32
Shared on various social spam, good job man!
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:54:38
They don't look any different to a lot of normal rings, most people don't even realize I'm wearing one.  They come in different shapes, sizes and colours..  
I have been wearing one for about 6 months, I know how practical this is :)
Robbers target house keys and it costs a lot more to replace a door lock than it does to reset a digital door lock..
I have had this conversation like 50 times in the last week, it's starting to get a little bit old now :P
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:03:38
I'm the developer of this and I'm also not a ring-wearing person, it's been a struggle wearing rings but the final prototype is actually pretty comfy and easy to adapt to..  
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:19:22
The inlay is 6mm so the ring works out about 8mm, it's comfy on my little finger
@_date: 2013-08-05 18:52:55
[McLear Ltd have a bitcoin Starter for their NFC Ring!]( 
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:28:21
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-10-11 18:48:28
Yes I did, I will edit to state it.  My apologies and thanks for pointing it out :)
