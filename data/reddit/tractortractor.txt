have any recommended reading on these?

No consumption figures are based on price or cost, and neither spare capacity nor over production have anything to do with these calculations or figures. 
The figures for Illinois are based on residential consumption. 
The consumption of the bitcoin network in this analysis assumes that everyone that is currently mining is using the world's most efficient miners at maximum capacity.
The dollar figures are the amount it would cost to run all of those miners in either New York City or Chicago. 
In reality the amount of power drawn by the bitcoin network is far higher than what I've estimated, and likely costs far more as well. 
No matter how you look at it, it takes an amount of energy that could power, at the absolute minimum, a quarter of a million homes in the American Midwest to be able to run a network that processes 3-4 transactions each second, on average.

Thanks, I'll look up the lightning network

Good point - we could have half or a quarter of the miners and still process the same or more transactions, just with an increased risk of 51% type attacks.

Excellent rebuttal

How did you get to 17KwH?

Good point
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:31:00
Isn't that still pretty high? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:47:21
do you think that 8.5 KwH, or at minimum ~$1.2 per transaction is sustainable/reasonable?

I feel that this (~35 KwH of energy per transaction at the absolute minimum) is unsustainable/unproductive, but I also understand that many of you have a better understanding of bitcoin that I, so I'd appreciate any form of rebuttal/disagreement
