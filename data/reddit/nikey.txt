Same problem here. Wrote these fucks 5 times. Only once got a canned answer, and nothing was applicable.

This is misleading if it's not shown on a log chart

bitcoin cannot be printed at a whim by governments. It's hard money. That's one of the main properties of bitcoin.

jup, this one is better

The link you spread is absolute garbage and is just as one-sided as other views. 
I can highly recommend reading the book The Bitcoin Standard, for a more differentiated and well researched view - despite the name it covers BitCoin only in the last few chapters, and the majority of the content revolves exactly around the history of money and economic problems.

Just remember I told you so

As I said, it will be something you didn't think of. Just remember I told you so when it happens.

oh boy, what a keynesian fan boy. Takes macroeconomics 101 and feels like he knows it all haha
if you're willing to entertain the fact that there are multiple economic ideas and principles, then you should read some papers from von Mieses or Hayek to give you a differentiating view. It'll help you in the long term on your economic endeavors.

Of course it can reach 0.0 - only because currently the blockchain wasn't "breached" yet doesn't mean it cannot be in the future. Even getting 50% control isn't out of question. If at any point the US government would put their resources towards that, it could be shut down effectively.

Didn't know about XCP. What a really bad idea. 
At least now I feel less stupid for having lost a bit of value in the market - could have been a lot worse

I'm not arguing against that at all. Money supply has a SIGNIFICANT impact on production and affects much more than that! The core problem in keynesian logic lies in the principle of maintaining maximum production through any means, and while that can be done via taxes (i.e. the monetary view, such as Milton Friedman), keynesians prefer to do that by increasing the money supply, in order to increase (state) spending. The latter has significant downsides and in the entire history of money has always been the detriment of any advanced nation (roman empire, byzantinum, etc). 
Keep in mind that the notion of "inflation is good" is not even officially supported by Keynes - he acknowledges that this is a side effect, and not that it's something to strive for.

She's not doing it anymore though: 
Also she ran commodities, not just metals. Metals reported to her, it's not like she traded anything herself
