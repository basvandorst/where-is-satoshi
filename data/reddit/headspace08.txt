Well that's because the public usually isn't privy to early funding rounds, and so most stocks aren't publicly purchasable until IPO. If you looked at the growth from those very first rounds I'd say you'd see some fairly bombastic gains..

Exactly my point. I wasn't comparing BTC to an IPO- I'm saying that Bitcoin is still relatively speaking in an early funding phase. And no, most coins didn't start with an ICO- that's a relatively new phenomenon associated with Ether tokens. We had years of chains being launched with little to no networks in the years before.

Pretty much my thinking of the markets at present -probably a little upside remaining but the geo-political risks brewing internationality will undermine stocks at some point. No surprise money is heading to gold and on those terms Bitcoin is a good bet too.

You are the one that used the term speculation in your original comment to somehow wall off cryptocurrency from other currency and stores of value. They are simply all versions of the same thing. As I wrote previously - I wish you the best in however you choose to store your net worth. And to your point about currency 'speculation' - unless you live in the same country your whole life you are going to be confronted with decisions as to which currencies go hold or let go. And no, this is not arbitrage- it's you who are using this term incorrectly. I am again simply betting on 5-10 year windows where it is better for me to shift the place where I am holding various funds.

Its a store of value. I operate my life between multiple currencies and none will have the long term security that bitcoin provides. 3 or 4 years ago I wouldn't be able to say that with as much certainty but I've seen enough to know that the network effect is not going to be reversed. And still even with the fees in play it costs less for me to send substantial funds from one place to another in comparison to brokers or banks. If you want to buy coffees then just use litecoin/ether- but if you want a store of value then there's still no better crypto than Bitcoin.

Daily fluctuations don't matter to me. Only 5-10 windows. Am I complaining about the first 5 years? No. I would bet the same on the next 5.

Every currency is a speculation. Speculation on democracies, reserve banks, and global stability. As I said, I'm very comfortable with bitcoin moving forward. I've seen prices from $70, $1200, $200, $7000 in all kinds of order. I believe that the network affect is in play, and that bitcoin will continue to grow as a store of value. Each to their own. If you disagree with me simply come back to my comments in 5 years time and laugh at me. Until then I wish you the best in which ever store of value you prefer.

Well, to put it in fiat terms, Currently I am moving out of AUD, NZD, KRW, GBP, holding USD midterm and long on EUR and YEN. I am doing so because I am also speculating on the relative worth of FIAT currencies. I am not an American but I wouldn't recommend any of those 360 million Americans to hold their entire worth in USD. I would advise  at least some exposure to gold, bitcoin, and another foreign currency, as well as a conservative mix of stocks and bonds. But yes, when we choose to hold our net worth in a particular currency of store of value we are all speculating on what the long term worth will become.
