Not that I have found. Reddit is no longer an intellectual hub IMO. Just pics and tits to pass the time. I have been looking for alternatives though. Can't seem to find anything.

Economics isn't a strong suit around this sub anymore mate. Hasn't been for 2 years.

Too much text not enough graphic but it looks like you are on a good start
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:34:11
Because it's a fiat failing. That is all.

Many have.....I thought about it 2 years ago with my company and even then there was already 5 I found with a single Google search. Also at way cheaper rates. For some reason 2 years ago there was a rush to buy VoIP/cell with bitcoin.

Going to see a drug movie with bitcoin about gangsters isn't going to do a thing but tarnish the name more. 
And you can already buy tickets to movies with bitcoin so big whoop.

Also make sure you have 0 debt because you shouldn't enter a high risk investment if you have any. Pay that first. 
Also $50/m is the perfect amount to start a portfolio. You would most likely have better outcome with that than btc considering retirement. 
In my humble opinion btc will last around 10 years and then another will my likely replace it. How and why idk but a lot can happen in 10, it could also become the new standard world wide. Completey a roll of the dice.

In that case. Yes web browsers and protocols have changed since then. The internet is cryptocurrency as a whole while btc is just currently the most popular faucet.

I don't understand your bottom half. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:31:05
Either way why the fuck would you have that much bitcoin in one place?
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:40:42
Confused but no it isnt. there is a known limited supply. Bitcoin is also not backed by anything other than the resources directly being traded with it.

For the love of anything don't do this. If you don't want to work for a 4 decades just don't waste through your first decade. Be sound and work your ass off young and buy land to rent. Then you will be retired (semi) by your second decade with rental properties.

It definitely had some good economics buffs back in the day. Curiosity was still peaking. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:34:27
Its not really a pissing contest. First off you are an idiot for trying to live off btc. Cool but just idiotic. Btc is no where near that level yet and all you are doing is being a hipster. 
That being said. This is needed. Bitcoin tps is a pathetic compared to even the smallest of other alternative payments. If you truly want to see a world where you can live practical, and not be some hipster, on btc then we need this testing now.

What I want to know is how valid his hitman charges are. I don't care about sr, I care about how legit those charges were and they seem legit so far.......

shouldn't matter. Only thing that should matter is the votes. Reddit is become a shit show because of this, even before the poa thing. Sub reddits themselves become so smug because they have been forced out of everywhere else. Votes should decade it and mods should only be there to remove personal information and approve things in spam. Everything else should be left to vote.
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:58:32
Circle jerk or not, our discussion shouldn't be centralized. It is what ever the people want within reddits tos (the service provider) . If they want to flood this sub with giant horses they could and it should be allowed. As I said we can dictate our own content. Reddit forgets this is what made them great in the start. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:50:50
Yeah I frequent voat as well. Can't wait till that becomes the norm.

Wise enough to use it? Liquidity of bitcoin is still far harder than liquidity of even their fiat currency. Even if it is locked in a bank for a while.
Be realistic.
Ideally it make sense. 
In practice it still needs to come a far way before its truly a practical solution.
Instead of jumping on this bandwagon people should be focusing on ease of access and the markets liquidity for goods purchased with bitcoin other than online.

Isn't she also the one that didn't k ow how Facebook worked when she posted a pic and others could see it.
@_date: 2015-07-04 21:16:36
The fuck.......
Bitcoin is backed by its demand and demand only. While supply is controlled in a manner demand is the only thing dynamic that is putting any value on it.
Where does that demand come from? People who have interest in a decentralized currency. 
I have no doubt cyptocurrency will be the future of trade but for now its backed by the fiat economies and the people who trade between them. As well as the internet in a sense that if we lost it we would also lose bitcoin as we know it.

Uhh he asked who was selling........I didnt say it caused pressure.

 You don't care if the person you paid can't obtain their capital for 3 months or 4 days. In comparison to current status quo that is laughable and if a current system were to.suddenly have a back log like this r/bitcoin and you probably would be talking shit on it.
This is a huge issue. Transactions need to happen quickly. Even some consider the 10 minutes too long to confirm for a business standard. 
Pros and cons but this is definitely a huge con to bitcoin.

Vendors, when people use btc to purchase their product and they convert straight to fiat.
Also some people speculate this little boost won't last long.
