We checked the price at which we bought for the first time with some friends: $4. Sold everything shortly after that, of course.

There's a transaction with a 536$ fee (0.08BTC) 100 inputs tho
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:57:33
Oh no I'm sure it's not a mistake. I was just surprised by how much transactions cost nowadays :)

Firefox implemented this more than 2 years ago. EME is not a new spec.
@_date: 2013-05-16 16:56:47
I think it should have a QR for the public key as well. Nice design nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-05-11 09:48:19
The probability of finding such an address is so small you can assume nobody has that private key.

Banks solved the security problem with OTPs, Bitcoin'll solve it with hardware wallets, no need to worry, they'll come eventually.

Well, I don't think most of the people know how internet works.
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:17:03
Confirmed. I was able to upload an arbitrary .php ...
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:58:37
Well, you uk people don't like Euro, it's not our fault :D
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:27:30
Not if your goal is destroy bitcoin or destabilize the market. But yeah, I agree with you that using a &gt;50% attack in the straightforward way is unpractical and surely not profitable at the moment.
@_date: 2013-05-07 22:06:45
You are a bit late. From [1971]( you can no longer redeem dollar for gold. Bitcoin and Dollar are the same on this point of view, they are backed on nothing.
@_date: 2013-05-07 16:25:16
I think that the most powerful single thing we can do is asking for setting the default of bitcoin-qt and other BTC clients to mBTC instead of BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:01:48
the golden key part is amazing.
@_date: 2013-05-21 01:26:39
No it's not possible. The reason is that the security comes from the *time* it takes to confirm a transaction rather than, say, the number of confirmations one needs to accept a payment. The problem is the following: in Bitcoin the longest chain is always the valid one, to double spend an attacker needs to build a longer chain off the network and put it online making the network's one invalid. 
Building a separate chain takes money both in computational power and blocks reward (because you're not actually putting in the main chain). If bitcoin had, say 10 times faster blocks creation (and then 10 times *less* reward per block) 6 confirmation would not be secure enough because it would be far cheaper to try to generate 6 blocks off the network.  
An hour confirmation time is needed to ensure an attack costs more than its effects, and then there's no point in doing it. Note that if the price in Bitcoin rises a lot, a potential attack could become profitable, but in this case more miner will come because the reward is higher, raising the difficulty and thus the attack costs.

Is he still doing this? it seems a pretty old thread. Also I'm not in the US at the moment.

Guys please, I understand the feelings against the banking system, but *please*, not UKIP.
@_date: 2013-05-04 08:10:35
We will probably have a p2p exchange at some point on time, after that, it'd be really hard to stop bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:17:19
Plenty? I know only of [one in 2010](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin what breaches are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-05-24 11:49:52
Little addendum, using a different change address an external observer has no way to tell which is the change and which is the receiving address, especially if they are both newly created.  
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:26:06
For the curious, the spike around 10th of april is due to giving away a huge amount of coins in this post 
@_date: 2013-05-14 10:41:58
Yup. Imagine a super easy to use hardware wallet that encrypt everything inside itself, cannot connect to the internet and that you use to sign every transaction you make. Hacking that would be very very hard.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:56:46
I don't really see why people don't spread on other exchanges, on bitstamp I had been verified in 1 day an deposit took 2 days.
@_date: 2013-06-25 19:46:50
Bitstamp via SEPA works really well. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 22:37:40
In London is cloudy, as usual I mean.
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:18:57
Oh, no of course. I was just curious if I can get something professionally printed :)
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:21:59
Oh no thanks I'll just do it myself! Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:30:05
To be fair, every attempt to talk about price / market is downvoted to hell. No surprise we don't see them here anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-26 07:41:13
Or a online banking system.
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:40:12
I'm no expert but could this cause a trademark problem?
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:30:49
Oh, sorry I didn't read your comments right. But I think they were talking about the protocol itself.
@_date: 2013-05-04 07:57:04
I think you just receive the bitcoins at some point in time, and testify in the contract that you have received X sum of bitcoin and you accept it as a payment instead of USD.
@_date: 2013-05-08 17:18:07
Well, at least in Europe you can do SEPA Transfer --&gt; BitStamp --&gt; Bitcoin in your wallet in 3 days. It's not instantaneous I know, but considering that bitcoin is not backed by any institution it's not bad, transferring money to a random person takes 2 days anyway (not using visa, paypal etc).
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:16:40
This is exactly what I was looking for! Thank you!
@_date: 2013-05-21 01:36:26
When you sign a transaction you're basically saying "take this coins I own in these inputs and put them in these outputs". The miner verify that the inputs you're providing are valid and that you have enough bitcoins in it. You always spend all the input, if you have coins left they are returned to you in an another output. Say you have 1BTC in address1 and you have to pay .5 BTC to address2. Your transaction will look like
* 1 BTC address1
* 0.5 BTC address2
* 0.5 BTC address3
There's no way of telling which is the receiving address and which is the *change* address. Of course you and the recipient know this information.
The easiest double spend goes this way, you broadcast to the network a transaction to the victim that accepts your coins without confirmation (very bad). In the meanwhile you (or somebody else for you) try to find a block, if you succeed before everyone else, you put a different transaction in it in which the bitcoins actually goes to yourself. The network will accept your block and the transaction you broadcasted will become void, leaving your victim without coins.
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:16:11
This is partially incorrect. Since the process of creation of blocks is not deterministic it may happen that a single miner (or a pool) with hash power &lt; 50% mine 6 blocks in a row, thus theoretically allowing a double spend attack, but this is highly unlikely because it's usually more profitable to actually use that blocks in the main chain and get the reward, given the difficulty we have today. 
On the other hand an attacker with &gt;50% hash power could just wait until his chain is longer than the one mined from the minority (which it'll happen eventually due to law of large numbers) and then publish his lovely double spend.

Why they use mediafire to host a file on *their own* website? 
@_date: 2013-05-09 22:21:58
just like mtgox /s

I have a background in maths and I currently work in IT with a great passion for finance. I first read about bitcoin back in late 2010 or early 2011, but then I forgot to buy some (god why), I then re-discovered bitcoin here on Reddit last January and I smashed my head on the wall for 2 weeks after that.
