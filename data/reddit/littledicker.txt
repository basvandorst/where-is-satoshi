That hum reminds me of the Om in mantras. You know, that Hindi belief in which God created the sound 'Om' and the universe arose from it. 
Are we constructing the scaffolding for a singularity of connectedness?

I just used coinbase's export to paper wallet feature out of convenience. All you need is a printer and a webcam. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:44:49
I sincerely hope youre making a lot of coin with all the effort you put into trolling this subreddit.
If you are, you could just start paying me to do it for you :3

drop Duncan Trussell a line.
I messaged him earlier this week and he seemed very interested, but unfamiliar with where to get started.
I'm sure he'd really appreciate the help.

PLEASE keep your Bitcoin in cold storage, not the online coinbase wallet. I dont want to see you back here tomorrow crying about how your wallet was emptied by cybergoons.

I like you FloridaGuy, calm and skeptical.
Dont waste your efforts arguing online with who has already made up their mind about Bitcoin's potential.
If you have such a mightier understanding of economics than any of us individuals here, then please do lay the track for your own supersociety.

I often doodle my time in class away, but ever since I've gotten into crypto I haven't been able to get it off my mind.
Hope you enjoy it :)

Because price represents demand and demand is going up.
Of course the news will cover stories that are growing rapidly in popularity; they need to make money too you know.
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:11:47
Nah Occupy Wall St. is becoming synonymous with Peter Joseph's Zeitgeist movement toward a resource based economy, surely a fruitless and shortsighted ideology. Bitcoin will just be purchased by those already in power who will get tipped off. What do you think they'll talk about at the upcoming senate meeting? One world currency is a beautiful prospect for those seeking to control the money supply.
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:28:17
Likely story.

Nah, I'm in your boat. I like to have something to hold on to.
You should keep your Bitcoin in a cold storage paper wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:52:05
What a shame. Another baby boomer with no understanding of the Bitcoin claiming how it cannot possibly function the same way gold does. Gold, silver, Yapp Stones, or Bitcoin, they all have a physical base that is not fiat. 
I agree with Schiff though, we very well could be approaching another plunge to the abyss. No one has yet developed a platform to exchange Bitcoin the way you can exchange via visa, and if no one does all of this speculation will have been for tulip bulbs. That being said, I'm a strong advocate of individualism, and i'll hold my Bitcoin for the longest time.

Hell yeah, I've been preaching the gospel in the valley for months now. It'd be great to have some brick and mortars that I could refer to as places you can spend your blowstamps.
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:26:11
If youre interested in watching bitcoin grow, just buy things in bitcoin or continue holding it until it is worth what you hope it will be one day. If you gift it away, they're likely just to trade it out for fiat immediately.

I couldn't buy much because I don't have a savings or spending cash. Instead, I told all of my loved ones about the blowstamps so that they can continually kick themselves for not listening to me.

You can still give it away, just let 'em know it works like a savings bond and THEY'LL KNOW when it's fully matured. ;)

Aye, from what i've seen the alt-coins are generally just pre-mined honey-pots for those that missed the bitcoin boat.
On the bright side, you can mine the altcoins and arb into bitcoin so it's easy to exploit the wave of what-if-people buying up doge and devcoin.

I did the same in the Phoenix area. Apparently, you have to get into contact with the regional offices to talk to the people that tell franchise owners upcoming events. If you can just get ONE regional exec to get on board, you could have an entire state's subways accepting bitcoin in a few weeks.

I win on dice frequently. Gambling is absolutely riveting, and positively soul-crushing. Don't play with what you don't want to lose. Dont bring anything you aren't willing to lose into a casino, don't deposit any coin you aren't planning on losing into an online casino.
When I win, I win. When I lose, I paid for the thrill of playing.

It's really ironic how officials in Chinese govt realize freedom promotes economic growth because of the disparity seen between Hong Kong and the People's Republic. At the same time the Land of the Free remains reliant on the govt for moral direction.

A fair price is whatever you want to pay for it.
Coinbase is your easiest option, you can message their support team and tell them about your plans. They may be willing to work with you.
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:41:14
I get this a lot, but I cant help but sympathize. As someone fairly new to Bitcoin, it's proven that the speculative market can drive up the price to 1.5x what the accepted market price is. &gt;see April
What's to say it isn't happening again? 
I've got my fingers crossed that we'll drop again to ~250 so I can drop some more fiat in.

Does BTCChina accept any other currencies besides RMB?
You could make a pretty penny transferring dollars/euros into BTCChina, buy bitcoin, and then sell your BTCC code at a markup.
