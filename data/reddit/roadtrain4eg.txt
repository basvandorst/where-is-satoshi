There's a lot of effort being put into compatibility, so usually different versions are highly interoperable.

The reserve requirements are practically irrelevant provided that a bank has enough collateral to raise reserves if necessary. What matters is the capital requirements.
@_date: 2015-12-25 11:57:56
I'd like to add. By issuing credit, banks create an asset and a liability (like deposited money on your account from your loan) on their balance sheet. Or, if you get a cash loan, they create an asset, and draw down the corresponding amount of cash from their vaults.
Modern Monetary Theory says that "loans create deposits", and this is based on double-entry accounting principle. Indeed, by issuing loans money is created, out of thin air.

I wonder what's the current state of privacy-enhancing features like Confidential Transactions? can you shed some light?
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:51:53
Well, that's possible. I even think it's probable until Bitcoin has more enhanced privacy features. It looked very bright in 2013-2014, but from 2015 on the progress in this field has understandably stalled.
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:14:42
Ashamed of what? Of realizing onchain scaling limitations? Well, I'd better acknowledge that than live delusioned.
Meanwhile, 2nd layer can still save those use cases.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:32:49
You are confusing the Bitcoin protocol and the software implementing it. Software is being constantly upgraded, but changing the protocol is a different thing and is much more difficult. Go try and implement some backwards-incompatible changes to the DNS protocols, for example.
By the way, in case of DNS, some RFCs are implemented in a way similar to SegWit: new clients verify the new extensions, while older ones simply ignore the new fields. It looks hackish at times, but it's what keeps the Internet running.
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:39:08
That is a bit too simplistic. 
Actually, if the prices are that close, it might make more sense to mine BTC than BU all because of the risk of wipe-out. This skewes incentives in a way that I think can be quantified.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:07:13


Larger blocks do not necessarily mean more users, and more users do not necessarily mean more nodes.


As far as I'm aware, it's still not O(1), and in worst-case scenario it falls back to regular relay, so the argument is still valid.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:21:46
I don't think it's fair a comparison. If you want to count all costs, you should also consider that registering at reddit also took time; while you are redditing, you are spending electricity and network bandwidth (I would not be surprised if you consumed more of it while browsing through reddit than from running a node), as well as time spent on posting, which you also consider a resource.
@_date: 2017-03-30 22:40:16
In all honesty, I don't think Monero is even remotely comparable to Bitcoin in this regard. Bitcoin is magnitudes larger.
I want improvements as well, and one of those that I'd like to see is SegWit, which will significantly ease further innovation.
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:31:05


This also requires that users are able to verify this changed protocol and accept new blocks mined according to it.
The only power that miners have here is to implement softfork-like changes to the protocol. As these are compatible with current node software, they do not require user consent to be implemented.
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:38:45
I would be really happy to read more on that, if you have any suggestions.
Bitcoin, in fact, is quite vulnerable to significant decreases in hashpower, even if they are temporary. And in the zero-block-reward regime, the mechanics of the mining are different. This paper was a good food of thought for me: 
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:27:49


But the original chain will move as well. It's quite likely that initially most transactions will be relayed ('replayed') and confirmed on both chains (happened on ETH-ETC AFAIK). So while your tx is spending only pre-fork UTXO's, it can be confirmed on both chains.
This is of course unless chains are properly severed when forked.
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:56:52
Yeah, having a free market with marginal fees would be cool if it wasn't in conflict with other properties of the system. Those very properties that make Bitcoin unique: like trustlessness and immutability, guaranteed by the ability for you to personally verify the chain. Those properties that I invested in.
Not to say that actual costs here lie on the non-mining nodes, not on miners...
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:43:03
If there was only one miner, there might be a ton of strategies to maximize fee revenue. But if there are other miners who act on their own interest, you cannot guarantee that they do not just include all the available non-zero-fee transactions in their blocks, thus undercutting your revenue.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:34:35
Personally I'm in favor of some sort of flexible cap. But it requires a good peer-reviewed proposal that is not easily gameable. We haven't seen that yet.
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:22:07
Not sure what point you are trying to make. I can allow my node to accept larger block rewards than allowed by the rest of the network, does it mean it's not a consensus parameter?
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:48:35
Yeah, that's pretty obvious in case of users. But the risks also lie with the miners not upgrading, and I'm not sure increased timeframes will have much effect here.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:20:36
Logic behind this is simple.
Larger blocks -&gt; less users can afford running full node.
Larger blocks -&gt; well-connected miners get increased advantage over those who are not well-connected, by experiencing relatively lower orphan rates.


That's a fallacy. If it's not good doesn't mean we want to make it even worse.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:35:37
I always thought darknet valued privacy the most, and would be willing to pay good fees for it. Maybe it's privacy Bitcoin is failing at, not fees?..

You can go as far as call everyone who is sharing an opinion a politician. I don't think that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:12:36






These statements are too vague and need clarification.
1) Among valid chains, nodes follow the chain with the most work.
2) Miners mine the chain which in the most profitable to mine (assuming they are pursuing a profit-maximizing strategy).
The chain in (2) in not necessarily valid to nodes in (1), so you can't meaningfully link these statements.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:05:15
I see you are trying to get a good metric of what is Bitcoin according to the ecosystem. I doubt you can reliably measure that.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:27:53
I agree. Though I would support something like mid-2018.
Anyway, I'm still not sure that simply postponing it has any significant effect on the risks associated with this approach.
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:49:38
It's an idea that if the block space is not scarce (i.e. unlimited), miners will be tempted to include ever lower fee transactions in their blocks, resulting in a race-to-the-bottom situation. While there ought to be a lower limit in this scenario, fees can get very low, resulting in decreased security of the system as a whole.
It relates to prisoner's dilemma in that miners would earn more by not undercutting other miners, i.e. by not allowing low-fee transactions to confirm.
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:48:51
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:40:13
You are making a lot of assumptions based entirely on your hopes how your BU 'majority chain' wins immediately, and the other chain is abandoned, even though ETC example shows this is not guaranteed. And this is considering that virtually the whole ETH team was supporting the fork, and ETC had to pick up a different name. BTC/BU is diametrically opposite in this regard. 
So I'm not sure having this amount of wishful thinking is prudent w.r.t. your Bitcoin holdings (ofc if you have any).
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:09:17

Or you can run the new software, yet still use vanilla transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:10:47
I believe we're much better being too conservative than too optimistic.
Anyway, anything up to 4Mb blocks now seems affordable for me. This, combined with my dislike of hardforks leads me to prefer SegWit as a next scaling step.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:59:15
Yes! If you actually limit it in a way that (1) and (2) necessarily operate on a single consensus rule set, then I don't see what's the problem with these little fowls. Automatic fork resolving is built in the Bitcoin protocol, and miners here *practically* do the same thing as users: follow and build upon the most work chain. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:02:13
Jesus, these constant mentions of "free markets" everywhere no matter if it's applicable or not have really devalued its meaning.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:59:38
There was a good article by Paul Sztorc: [Measuring Decentralization]( which makes good points about how having *the ability* to run a full node is more important to decentralization than actually running it.

Sorry, I'm not an English native, so I don't understand the subtleties of using the word "inherently", but as I understand it, BU is a change of rules in all regards. Gotta note that I mean *consensus rules*, that may be the cause of misunderstanding.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:33:34
I believe one should not support or oppose something based on some "community actions", rather one should base his judgement on the technical viability of the ideas presented. If you decide to support SegWit, for example, no amount of mud-slinging here should influence that decision, as it's irrelevant to it.
I personally ignore ad-homenem posts as if they never existed. It helps to keep my mind clear, and discuss ideas, no people.

@_date: 2016-12-26 16:05:31


Actually, it would mean non-zero block reward at the time when it's expected to be zero. It adds bitcoins to supply by lengthening the issuance curve, while still staying under 21mil cap.. How large that reward would be (in dollar terms or in relation to fees) can only be a wild guess.

@_date: 2016-11-22 11:55:22
Hand over from an "ecosystem" which represents all groups using Bitcoin to a small group of users called miners.
Miners or Core cannot currently force larger blocksize on, say, end users, without the risk of breaking consensus.
With BU, the consensus is assured eventually, whether end users like it or not.
"Handing over control" in this case is losing the ability to stick to status quo.

Capitalization (as at coinmarketcap) is orthogonal to market share, especially short and mid-term. It is prone to wild short- to mid-term fluctuations due to pumps and dumps. Also it can be skewed by large amounts of coins being off-market (premine, "development funds" and so on).
If you want to measure market share, I would suggest measuring value of transactions on each chain. It's far from perfect, but still is better than looking at capitalization.

Once again, SW is an on-chain scaling proposal coming from core devs. This refutes your claim that


Once we activate SW, we will have some breathing room.


I see Bitcoin + LN as a good combination, with blockchain being closer to a settlement layer and LN being the everyday payment layer.

@_date: 2017-05-02 09:13:36
You do realize that SW also offers almost 2-fold increase in *on-chain* tx capacity, right? It gives us some breathing room to try LN. If LN doesn't work well we still can do HF, provided we will have consensus for that.
But I doubt we really need that in the foreseeable future.

You are saying HF without actually proposing which one to do. There are some HF proposals that I (and probably others) will never agree on, and some I can agree on will never be agreed on by others. Where's the compromise?
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:15:08
So, you have described two problems here:
1) Miners may have to turn off their rigs, which will lead to decreased security of the chain.
2) Miners may have to wait for fees to be enough to cover electricity costs, creating the so-called 'mining gap' effect, where no one is mining until there are enough incoming fees.
These both are very serious problems, and are actually two sides of the same coin - not enough tx fees.
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:24:31
It most likely will. The question is, will Bitcoin work or collapse under that model.
I can see scenarios where Bitcoin fails under this approach.
The most crucial thing to consider is that miners are *not* the only ones incurring that marginal cost, but they *are* the only ones who get paid for doing so.

Such solution does not seem possible, at least with the knowledge we have now. EC is a non-solution.
Ever since we had relay networks between miners, the non-mining nodes have ceased to function as a transport layer between miners, and thus are not able to enforce any limits on throughput if we have EC-like system. Only miners are able to. Which brings us back to the scenario I outlined above.

Incorrect analogy. Users are free to reject a Firefox feature, as well as they are free to use it. In case of Segwit (as it is a consensus-critical feature), you are only free to reject it, and this rejection forbids (aka *blocks*) others from using it.
