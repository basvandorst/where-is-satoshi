That's just the nature of crypto. There's no models for price like stocks where you can base it off revenue and earnings, so you have people predicting prices like $100k or $500k a coin. If you have wealthy individuals or institutions that believe these numbers, then the current values are still extremely low.

When you buy the contract, you now own the right to receive cash equivalent to whatever the price is at at the end of January. Buying futures is betting on the price going up, and selling is betting on the price going down (because the seller gets the cash up front, but is on the hook to pay in the future).
In reality, each futures contract is for 5 btc, so if the price is $19,500, then in order to buy one contract, you have to pay $19,500 x 5 = $97,500

@_date: 2017-12-18 05:55:11
What you describe in your first question about betting on a price at a given date are options, which are a little more complicated than futures. Futures don't have a strike price, only a date.
So, if the price is $19000 today, buyers and sellers will bet on what they think the price will be in one month, two months, three months, etc. The spot price of the futures contract is typically higher than the current price because there's growth to be expected.

1. Bitcoin has a peer-to-peer network of nodes that store the blockchain, collect unconfirmed transactions, and validate blocks and transactions. These nodes broadcast their information to peers so nodes learn about new blocks and transactions from other nodes. Nodes can be brought up and down at any time, and you can run your own node if you so choose. Note, these nodes are not the miners you hear about.
Miners are also nodes, but in addition, they attempt to extend the blockchain by trying to solve for the next block.
2. It's a peer to peer network. It's like bit torrent, where there's a bunch of nodes that broadcast on a specific channel what they have. They'll send you their copy of the blockchain and any unconfirmed transactions they have that you don't
3. They ask full nodes and trust them. You can ask a node that has a copy of the blockchain, "What's the balance of address x?", and it'll tell you. You're not doing any validation on your side, but trusting the node to tell you the truth.
4. Miners are incentivized to maximize the fees in their block. Since the node that mined the block gets to keep the fees, they maximize their return by filling up the block with the transactions with the highest fees. Fees were specifically designed to allow transactions to be ordered so that it wouldn't be random.
5. Wallets broadcast their unconfirmed transactions to peers. The peers broadcast it to their peers, and eventually, it gets everywhere. Miners get notified of your transaction, and potentially add it to their next block

You don't have to own bitcoin to control its price. You can do it through news.

The CME future contract is for 5 BTC. So, the smallest future contract you can buy is going to be around $80k USD. Probably not for beginners
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:19:10
Yea. Right now, if you go to the futures website:  even though the current spot price is at $19,000, the high/low limit is at 20865 / 18135.
That means that if you want to buy a contract, the lowest seller is offering the January contract for 20865, well above the current price, because they don't want to lose money. If you want to sell a contract, the higher buyer is offering 18135, well below the current price.
If you believe bitcoin will go up in the future, you're better off buying the underlying coin because it's a lot cheaper. However, some people have lots of money and don't want to deal with exchanges, so they'll pay the premium on the futures market.
If you believe bitcoin will go down in the future, and you don't own any, then you can sell a contract. However, you immediately lose money since the price is below spot, and you better be sure that it drops a lot
The futures market was originally created to protect commodity producers (farmers and such) from price fluctuations, so there's another case for people who would want to sell contracts and not just be trying to short it.
Suppose I own 5 bitcoin and I need money now. I could go to an exchange and sell it for $19,000 each, or I could sell a contract and get $20,800 each. Which one sounds better? I'll sell the contract because I get more money now. I just hold on to my coins until the contract expires, sell them on an exchange, and give the money to the buyer.

Using a separate address per transaction helps a bit. Say you have 10 btc. Instead of one address with a balance of 10, you have 100 addresses with a balance of .1. Then you rotate through them when you need to pay someone.
Also, if you transfer in and out of an exchange, your coins cannot be tracked on the blockchain.

This happens when two blocks are found very close to each other. After every block, the unconfirmed transactions all have to be validated again, because the new block could've invalidated certain transactions. So the mining machines, instead of stopping their hashing, just temporarily attempt to mine an empty block until they can collect validated transactions to confirm.

IRS released a clarification on hard forks and airdrops. They see these events as people getting free money that didn't exist before. Therefore, it should be a taxable event.
However, it's really hard to determine at what point you received this asset and what the fair market value of it is. I think the guidance is that you technically own the new coins when you download the wallet software that recognizes it, or if your coins are on an exchange, when the exchange releases the coins to you. Either way, it's really hard to prove.
You don't want a situation like Bitcoin gold. When it forked off the main Bitcoin, it was something like $500 a coin. Now it's $8 a coin. It would suck if you were forced to pay taxes on the $500 price when you didn't even know it existed.

GPU mining sounds good in theory. It allows people with regular hardware to mine.
However, it doesn't really solve the problem of centralization. There's nothing preventing a company from buying racks and racks of GPUs (people already do this for ETH, which is GPU based). It even caused a shortage of GPUs, driving up the prices for people who aren't interested in mining. It forced the GPU manufacturers to create specialized mining cards to handle the demand and cater to the market.
Once a coin becomes profitable to mine, and it has the stability and  status of bitcoin, there are going to be people willing to put a lot of money into it.

The size of the mempool is probably never going to hit 0.
The important metric is to see what the current fee is to get a transaction confirmed.
Right now, like over 80% of the unconfirmed transactions are less than 20 satoshis/byte, and probably won't be confirmed. This isn't terrible for the network since we should ignore spam transactions to keep the blocks small. You can still send a transaction in the 50 satoshi/byte range and get it confirmed in a couple hours. That's still about $1.00 for a standard transaction, which seems fine to me

It happens when you can live your entire life comfortably with only bitcoin. You can buy food, pay your mortgage, buy a car, buy gas, pay for vacations, pay for tuition, pay for hospital bills, pay for everything using bitcoin.
The reason why it's considered risky right now is because you need fiat currency to do all of the above, so you're reliant on the fiat -&gt; btc exchange rate. If the exchange rate goes to 0, then you can no longer do anything with your bitcoin. However, if the exchange rate went to 0, and the grocery store still said your can pay for food with bitcoin, then it doesn't matter. Your lifestyle is not affected.

@_date: 2017-11-24 21:31:25
Don’t know where you’re getting 36% from. 
Each block is completely independent and previous work done has no impact on the next block. 
So, in 10 days, there’s approximately 1440 blocks found. You have an equal chance for each one, so it’s 1440/1000000 chance you’ll find one block in the next 10 days. That’s about 0.14% or about one in 694.
Considering the block reward is about $100k, and it costs you maybe $1k for the rig, you’re looking at one in 694 chance to get 100x return. This doesn’t even factor in electricity, maintenance, cooling, and difficulty increases.

Nothing is for certain, and it's all based on how certain you want the confirmation.
Using the method we described, you will get the transaction confirmed at 10+ sat/B, only if a block is found right now, and only if the block includes transactions sorted by fee. There's a chance that it could take an hour to find the next block, and in between now and then, a bunch of higher fee transactions flood the pool, superseding your transaction. 
A lot of fee calculators are very cautious to avoid the above scenario. They could be using historical averages, or trying to pick the mid point of the transaction fees. If you're doing it manually, you can save money by looking at the mempool and the current trends.

For buying:
Market order: Go to the store and buy a gallon of milk for whatever price the store is selling it at
Limit order: Go to the store and haggle with the store owner, saying you'll only pay $2.50 for the gallon of milk. The owner may or may not agree to your offer.
Stop order: Go to the store and watch everyone else buy and sell milk. If the price goes below $2.50, go to the shelf and buy one at whatever the current price is.
Sell order is very similar except swap positions and you're the one selling instead of buying.

Tether is basically like a bridge between USD and blockchain currencies like BTC. Instead of going straight from USD to BTC, you go from USD to Tether, then Tether to BTC.
Tether is (supposedly) better than USD because it's backed by a blockchain, so you don't have to go through a bank to transfer it around. However, because USD is not a finite supply, new Tether has to be constantly printed for each new USD that buys Tether. It's this 1-to-1 guarantee of 1 Tether = 1 USD that spooks people. You basically have to trust the owners of Tether that they're actually keeping this USD reserve, rather than spending it on mansions and lambos.

Just look at the bottom graph, the mempool size in MB.
Each block is going to be 1 MB in size, so you look at where the cutoff for 1MB is. Look for the cutoff for 1 MB.
For example, if it's like **20+ = 0.964 MB** and **10+ = 1.049 MB** then you know that's where the cutoff is. The next block is going to include all the transactions with 20+ sat/byte fees, and then a few of the 10+ transactions.
Therefore, in the above scenario, the minimum fee to get in the next block is 20

The US treasury actually wants to have a small amount of inflation for USD, so they constantly print more and more money. A small amount of inflation tends to encourage growth. If you know that $100 bill in your pocket will be worth less next year, you're more likely to spend it than to save it. Also, it encourages people to take out loans, because if you borrow $10,000 over 10 years with a fairly small interest rate, as time moves on, the $10,000 you're paying back is worth less due to inflation. When people spend more money, it boosts businesses, which should (debatable whether this is true) create more jobs and help grow the economy. It should also increase wages, which makes people psychologically happier, but we haven't really seen that because US corporate profits are just being held by the rich rather than being passed around.
On the contrary, if you have a deflationary currency, the opposite is true, and it tends to lead to a recession. People stop spending as much and stop taking out loans. Even worse, the loans that people already have increase in value, so their debt gets larger, leading to defaults and bankruptcies.
That being said, a deflationary supply of something like bitcoin is great for driving up its value in relation to fiat currency

So, BCH has more dynamic difficulty adjustment, and one thing I found interesting is that it's currently quite a bit longer than the BTC chain. It's likely because when the difficulty drops, tons of miners pile in and add a ton of empty blocks. Then, when the difficulty goes up, they leave, waiting for the next dip.
This leads to miners trying to game the system, which seems like an undesirable feature.

You don't register bitcoin addresses with anyone. There are 2^160 different addresses, and you just pick one at random. The point of doing it offline is to be sure that nobody was listening when you chose your key randomly.
You deposit to this address by entering the public key as the recipient of a transaction.
Yes, anyone with the private key to the address can access its coins. However, the address space of 2^160 is large enough that it would take more than a trillion years to brute force the attack.
It's safer than an online wallet because in an online wallet, someone else has the private key to the address, so they can technically move your bitcoins.
