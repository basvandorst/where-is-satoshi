Yes, in America.  Most countries banking systems are much more modernized. Read the thread.

"free market" is an oxymoron.  It can never truly exist, because there is nothing preventing rich people from corrupting, bribing, or otherwise exerting control over  the "free market" because its "free" from any regulation to prevent said tampering.

The word you are looking for is "thought terminating cliche".   This works for many things, like "circlejerk" "neckbeard" or those people that like to just shout out a logical fallacy, like "strawman".  Thought terminating cliches.

These sorts of things cause over-fragmentation in small communities. Most people don't know jack about *any*coin. There is room to discuss other things. 
Also, I'd bet some of those other subs only exists *because* would downvote any other content in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 22:01:46
You all need to stop using that excuse.  The same people that want to get rid of bitcoin, want to get rid of cash. 
The ideal system is everyone using some electronic currency system, because then everything can be tracked and traced.

It costs a business money to run CC transactions. There are some places that operate cash only, and sell the gas cheaper for it. 
Dumbass. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:48:50
Well then that is dumb, because we need taxes to fund *society*.

Its starting to be used more.  I saw some CO gas stations taking it for payment now.

You missed the point of the comic.  I hate having to explain jokes, but this means "we're going to make (thing) illegal, because Terrorism, or protecting the kids. 
Not  "Bitcoin can be good or bad". 
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:55:31


Yes it is, because it requires laws and enforcement. 
free markets can never exist. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:54:42
There is no such thing as a 'Free Market'.  Its an oxymoron. Any market with no rules or laws, will be taken over by the first rich person to gain influence or find a way to game the system. 
There are no rules to stop them, so things like MtGox happen, and then the market is no longer free. 
Free Market = oxymoron 
It can't exist. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 09:07:20
Ok, better example. 
"Flea Markets" are common in the midwest. They are a LOT like Silk Road.  A bunch of shady looking people, each selling assorted goods, in some out of the way location, that borders on the illegal. (Collectables, furniture, guns,  knives, fireworks, porn, etc)
Each vendor has to pay rent to the person that runs the Market.  Now, I'd bet money, that out of the hundreds, or even thousands of these small markets, at least a few are being ran by a drug dealer, meth cook, or other criminal. 
This means that everyone on the market, is "funding an illegal operation" and even participating in one, without their knowledge. If the owner gets busted, are they all responsible?  I'd say no. 
That is a pretty similar scenario to silk road, imo, and one that probably even has precedent.

They want to get rid of cash too. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 10:03:07
Nothing, because the average person doesn't know anything about bitcoin.

I'm fine with that. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:47:55
There is no such thing as a free market.  It's an oxymoron. 
If you had a free market,  it would only be free,  until the first rich person started rigging it in their favor.  
It can't exist.  Its nothing but a buzzword.

Bitcoins are like bearer bonds. They belong to whatever jackass happens to be in possession of them.

The BC community are a bunch of assholes. They seem to try and actively keep new people out.

Half the reason Doge is so popular is because the bitcoin community tends to be gigantic assholes that don't want any new people on their coin-terf.

You can't put "upvote if you agree" in your fucking post title,  its retarded. 
@_date: 2012-08-21 11:40:11
The best thing for bitcoin is for more places to accept them as payment, and to create an incentive for using them as such. One example would be setting lower prices or something for BC purchases.
