While im not exactly sure Tao Te Ching said that, I completely agree. Too many people are spamming and throwing money away(mind you, most are only for cents) at people who are desperately commenting for money. Has bitcoin really come to this? If you want bitcoins so bad that you are willing to beg for it, it's a sign you should just pay real money for it. Nobody is going to make a fortune by begging. (That might have been a Tao Te Ching quote)

How many frenchmen does it take to mine a bitcoin? It's impossible, they keep trying to surrender to it.
