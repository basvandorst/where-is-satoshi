A few days ago I bought humble bundle with mycelium, the coinbase website said 0.0218 BTC but after scanning the qrcode mycelium showed 0.02175 BTC, I found this weird but clicked send and it switched to paid.

Look up your transaction id (right click on your transaction-&gt;transaction id (there is a -000 at the end which you need to remove)) at  , if it doesn't show up there your client has most likely not broadcasted it yet (I remember something that bitcoin-qt waits for that until it has synced with the blockchain, not 100% sure right now.)
If it does show up on blockchain.info everything is ok, just wait. If not you can either shut your client down before it broadcasts the transaction and import your keys somewhere else, or you can get the rawtransaction from the debug console (Help-&gt;debug-&gt;console-&gt;getrawtransaction $transactionidgoeshere)and broadcast the signed raw transaction here:

addresses can be generated offline, you also don't need to be online to receive. The BTC will be sitting there waiting for you to spend them again, maybe with an offline transaction: 
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:45:39
Probably because the transaction fee. If they have the default setting it is 100 µBTC aka bits (0.0001 BTC), so you can only send back 1900 bits. But in some cases transactions can also have no fee and still get included in the blockchain, still a little bit user-unfriendly:

without special configuration ARP should stay in your local subnet, so it must be something on your local network doing this.
Probably nothing to worry about, It is used to get the mac address, so your router broadcasts who has 192.168.0.11 and then it answers yes i am 00:CA:FE:45:CE and they can communicate...

Are you sure? I think if it would be coinjoin it would have multiple random input/outputs, but that does not seem to be the case (the transaction that creates the first 50 BTC tx has multiple inputs connected to the big, maybe gox, movements from the last days, then it only keeps sending the same 50 BTC multiple times)

Sorry I mean to run it from the commandline, in Linux this is easy its called Terminal/Konsole/shell. Don't know exactly if you have Windows, guess you would have to run cmd.exe and then navigate to the directory where electrum is installed and run it.
I once had a similiar problem and in the console it said: "error address not in wallet" or something. But it worked then with the link you have posted. I just did this like 10 times each in electrum and it worked:

I think to create a new transaction he would need to remove the unconfirmed one from his wallet with pywallet or something. So I find rebroadcasting is easier.
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:16:54
If it still shows unconfirmed after sync you can try to delete transactions from your wallet.dat with  and start bitcoin-qt with -rescan or you can try to import the wallet.dat into 
Sometimes this can happen for whatever reason, see here for more details:

Sorry for your loss :( do you maybe have chrome extensions installed, some are stealing bitcoins: 
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:53:52
Then it is case 1, you somehow managed to create an invalid transaction :) I've seen this a few times with people that play satoshi dice, no idea why...
I would try to import the wallet.dat into  (i think this only imports your keys and not the transactions) or I would delete the transaction(s) from my wallet with  and let bitcoin-qt rescan the blockchain. After that you should be able to spend what is left on those private keys. Hope this helps :/

Paypal is not a good method to buy bitcoins, because paypal payments can be charged back (and bitcoins can't). If you find someone who takes that risk you will pay more than market rate. 
But for small amounts I had good experience with "localbitcoins" they also have sellers that accept paypal, but make sure you choose one with a good rating: 
(but read everything, most users don't want id etc but some do! EDIT: just looked, because paypal is so risky for btc sellers, most want picture with person holding ID or your account needs to be some months old etc hmmm)
If you have a credit card, maybe  is an option, seems to work ok for most people.
@_date: 2014-08-15 01:41:50
You can do that, just make the transaction as you always would. Now bitcoin-qt does not broadcast it until you have the complete blockchain. You can now get the transaction id by rightclick/copy txid on the entry in the history (there is maybe -000 at the end which you need to leave out) then go to help&gt;debug-&gt;console and enter:
    getrawtransaction 44591f9cfa08963efd36137a4e04f180440a01ffebb97c38a962ae5206a1a113
with your transaction id, this is only an example, and it spits out some code (the signed transaction), which you can copy paste here:  to broadcast :)
A little bit complicated but easier than exporting privatekeys etc.
EDIT: but this probably only works if bitcoin-qt is only behind a few days/weeks and there are no transactions later which spend the stuff the wallet selects to create the transaction, probably will not work without blockchain at all. I only do that if I am a few days behind and have bitpay counting down on me or something :).

I would try  first, this could also work and is maybe easier.
pywallet is a python script (Requirements: Python 2.x, with bsddb and twisted packages) so it depends on your Operating System how to set it up. If you have python and the other stuff it should be as easy as:
    python ./pywallet.py --web
And then you can browse to  , goto delete tab, make sure the button is set to transaction and type all in the field - now click delete. Then start bitcoin-qt with the -rescan option (may take some time, it will scan the blockchain for transactions belonging to your wallet)
But whatever you do make a backup of wallet.dat first, in case something goes wrong.

It looks like you just bought an auction script and put it on your server (even the metadescription and keywords are not set in the sitecode...) and a 0.01 BTC listing fee is too much.

The main difference is that bitcoin-core is like the backbone of the bitcoin network, it downloads, verifies (and also uploads to other users) the whole transaction database, which is very big, like over 20GB.

Mining only makes sense if you have real cheap electricity and special devices, look here for more info: @_date: 2014-03-10 20:24:38

As I understand these transactions will not confirm, so you can't spent them. Also I think they just hit random addresses that appear on the blockchain. Saw some on a paperwallet address that was never published (except the transaction to fill it in the blockchain ofc).
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:20:02
There is a mode where you unplug it, then plug it back in and it types bitcoin address, amount and a confirmation pin code, then you unplug and plug back in and confirm pin: 
But this can be disabled then it is less secure, but more convenient :)

It was a trap. The undercovers told that they want to buy stolen credit cards and they still got the BTC from the seller + they were over the limit where they have to register as moneytransmitter (20k $ a year or whatever depends on location I guess)... So don't do those 2 things and you should be fine -_-

Yeah it's stupid, fedora disabled it because potential legal issues.
They patched it out or it is a compile time option. Only heard about this with fedora/redhat based distributions.

You just unpack it, for example:

When you create an electrum wallet there are 12 words which you should have written down. Click File-&gt;New/Restore enter a name for your new wallet, click enter/save. Next the window should appear where you can choose to create a new wallet/restore from seed, click restore from seed enter 12 words... click next, wait....... Now you can set a new password. 
Now you should have two wallets, the old "default_wallet" where you don't remember the password and a new one with the filename you did choose. If you want to make the new one default move it to "default_wallet".

It only can update the firmware if you are in bootloader mode (press both buttons while plugging in) and it will ask for confirmation on the Trezor and will display the firmware fingerprint.
Maybe its not ready yet, but its the right direction imho, just needs to be standard and supported everywhere.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:32:40
Some transactions require a fee, in that case bitcoin-qt adds a fee even if it was set to 0, maybe that is what is happening. See: 
    A transaction may be safely sent without fees if these conditions are met:
    It is smaller than 1,000 bytes.
    All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
    Its priority is large enough (see the Technical Info section below)
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:27:54
Check with this guy if he has your coins (he sweeped a lot of blockchain.info coins):  there may be a chance you get it back!
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:37:32
I don't understand how that can happen at all. Even if he somehow imported that address multibit should not allow that, maybe some kind of sanity check is needed.
    if privatekey_is_invalid -&gt; exitwithbigfatwarningsign
i hope the multibit devs take this seriously, because the address seems to be receiving coins since 2012.
Anyway I somehow doubt those coins are still accessible, that guys main address was: 1rzhWUU7LP9iyyeas4hT223kogqy6w67G
and until 2015-01-14 it looks like it was sending change back to that same address. Then something happend and it looks like change goes to the invalid address. Multibit probably thinks that address belongs to itself, which is why it still displays a balance. I really hope I am wrong here and he can get his coins back...
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:19:48
Agree that it is a bit suboptimal right now and more wallets need to support it out of the box.
1. That is not what Trezor is really made for, it itself is an little offline computer which never goes online, it only talks bitcoin stuff with the hostcomputer.
Browser-plugin is only needed for the webwallet, I use electrum which needs some python stuff installed: [trezor-python](
2. You can do that manual with this tool [cmdtr.py]( Also the firmware has a [deterministic build system]( so you can built it yourself and compare the checksum matches to the [firmware here](
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:54:46
To be honest I am not really sure, the [README]( says the wallet file itself uses a custom format. 
Best is to use the same app or just make a transaction from wallet A to wallet B. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:08:03
If it is this wallet: 
It is a hd wallet since version 4, so you only need one backup.

Oh :/ I always thought the binaries include a static openssl, I guess not then. sorry about that.
@_date: 2015-01-31 01:13:46
I think you maybe mistyped it as 1.05 and the rest got send back in a "change" transaction, blockchain seems to use the same address for that. Other wallets create a new address for change.

Not exactly new information: 
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:29:21
You are correct he said it can be changed not that it will be changed. Still makes sense to me. The whole situation is stupid anyway and also part fault of the coredevs, they could agree to some modest one time increase and it would take every relevance from xt, but instead everyone comes up with their own blocksize adjustment system or is totally blocking every change.
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:13:48
"Used" only shows up when you have addresses which received and sent and are empty again now, it looks like at the bottom where it says &gt; change.
I hope you get it working somehow. If not I hope it was a small amount... You can also try asking in the electrum subforum, maybe someone has an idea what is going on in your case: 
@_date: 2015-08-11 04:44:03
This sounds not right, it should have the same addresses, that is the whole point of the electrum seed, it always creates the same addresses based on that.
On the receive tab it always gives you a new address, maybe you are looking there? Try the "Addresses" tab, old ones are hidden under "used" you can click on that to see them.
You should have the same there on both computers, if not something is terribly wrong. Maybe try to create a new wallet on computer A and then try that seed on computer B and see if they also don't match.
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:41:00
There are more secure options for storing bitcoins, like multisignature and hardware wallets. But for 5$ your phone is fine imho. Just make a backup and you are good.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:04:22
If you know how to compile the bitcoin-core software, then there is a "branch" which only includes gavins changes for bigger blocks. This does not include the other changes in XT. Also I think it is not a classic blacklist, it deprioritises tor connections when the node has all connections slots used (maxconnections), which can make some sense, but I would have liked it more if this was opt-in not opt-out (there is a commandline switch to deactivate it.)

Afaik it takes a moment to show up, until electrum downloaded the blockchain-headers. Try to wait a few minutes (or restart electrum if nothing happens, always good to try lol) , you can also check the address(es) which should have  funds on  and see if it is really empty.

Check with some other site if port 8333 is open, for example: 
Also maybe it only gets reachable when you have the complete blockchain, not sure right now. Or there might be something interfering like "windows firewall".

Maybe a firewall issue. You can also look if something shows up in debug.log
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:26:08
The difference with this change is that it was always supposed to happen at some point: [satoshi about raising blocksize at some blockchain height](
It is not like someone is changing the max amount of coins or so, than I would agree to not support that change. But changing the blocksize should not be a big deal.

Some things you can do,
check with netstat -tulpen which services are listening and disable which you don't need. Also check firewall settings, if this is only for bitcoind, you only want port 8333 and your ssh port (default is 22) to be reachable from the outside.
Set up an [ssh key]( based login so you can disable password login.
Here is some more about ubuntu default settings which can be made stricter: 
Create an unprivileged user for bitcoind so it does not run as root user.
Also run apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade now and then, so you get security updates.

I am not sure about that, sure we have less nodes now, but I would say the nodes we have now seem to have much better connectivity and uptime.
I looked up nodes connected to me and most seem to be at amazon / leaseweb / google / MIT / cable etc, only small amount seems to be on dialup/adsl. 
See here 
Maybe we should simulate that somehow instead of guessing, also making the limit 8 MB would not instantly result in 8 MB blocks, would probably take a while to fill that up, so slower partys still have some time to catch up maybe.

Thats the folder, if you have display hidden folders enabled, just open windows explorer. Then start at C:\ and work your way down.
There is probably only one file "default_wallet" rename it "oldwallet" or something (doesn't really matter) then electrum should start again.
@_date: 2015-09-07 04:38:05
Afaik bitcoin-core does not broadcast transactions until it has finished syncing the blockchain, so the rest of the network does not know about your transaction yet, you can either wait it out (it will eventually broadcast it), or you can get the rawtransaction from the debug console and broadcast it here:  .
I explained this once in detail, so I just link you there: 
@_date: 2015-09-17 00:11:10
Seems it does work now with wallet 
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:27:53
Try to move the default_wallet file and try again, or provide electrum a wallet filename with the -w switch and restore from seed. Looks like the file got corrupted or something.

No problem, I just fired up my virtual windows 7 and installed electrum. It seems this roaming folder is hidden by default...
So you need to go to system settings and make it display hidden folders first :( 
See here: 
Then you can browse the folder and rename the file.
@_date: 2015-04-25 21:54:09
For me closing electrum and starting it again always helps if it is stuck or not connected.
@_date: 2015-09-08 13:11:29
blockchain.info can also import wallets, never used it myself but it seems it supports wallet.dat: 
@_date: 2015-04-28 22:03:24
I have a vserver in germany with 
    
    23:58:27 up 250 days,  4:01,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
and one in u.s. from 
    23:58:34 up 313 days,  6:20,  0 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.02, 0.01
both are fine and never had a problem with them :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:53:58
Just rename the walletfile to something else, then try to run electrum again, it should pop up with the screen where you create new wallet/restore etc.
Not sure how it is in windows, but on linux you can run electrum from the commandline, I could do electrum -w mynewallet and it would create a new wallet with that filename.
Most likely is some technical glitch for whatever reason. I've read it a few times that it can happen that the wallet file is corrupt suddenly. Luckily never happend to me so far...
@_date: 2015-09-03 01:49:54
Check the address from electrum you sent to with blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com, sometimes my electrum gets stuck and I have to delete the header file in ~/.electrum/blockchain_headers so it sees new transactions, don't know why that happens.
@_date: 2015-09-19 22:04:32
Yes exactly, but if your wallet is encrypted you need to unlock it first with:
    
    walletpassphrase mysecretpasswordhere 600
That unlocks it for 600 seconds. But if it is not urgent I would just wait for the reindex to finish.
@_date: 2015-09-19 20:57:03
Yes reindexing might help, sometimes this problem seems to get caused by a corrupted blockchain, it just gets stuck then somehow.
But reindex will take a long time, easily a few hours. You could also export the privatekey from the address in question and import that to whatever wallet you want, or blockchain.info also has an import function for bitcoin-core wallet.dat   (I would only use this for smallish amounts and to send it to my new wallet, like electrum or mycelium)
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:08:53
You need to go there, with windows explorer for example: 


then right click "default_wallet" and rename it to something else.
@_date: 2015-04-09 00:30:26
Good to hear :)
Electrum always looks for default_wallet (as the name suggests it is the default), but if this file is corrupt electrum just craps out lol.
@_date: 2015-09-05 23:44:45
I think it was just an example, how about a dedicated server with [500GB hdd for 5EUR/Month]( I run my node on that, initial sync is pretty slow because atom cpu but once that is done it runs just fine. Not sure up to which blocksize that could support, but right now it looks very bored most of the time. Even has ddos protection which works pretty well.
@_date: 2011-09-30 00:37:19
not fixed here, running Slackware64 13.37 with radeon 5850, phoenix still  100% cpu :( me sad now.

It should work with mycelium on android, 
also with electrum 2.0.3: click File-&gt; New/Restore -&gt; Restore a wallet, wallet type: hardware wallet -&gt; Trezor wallet, then it wants the seed.
@_date: 2015-03-26 17:45:01
Make sure both electrum are the same version, there is a bug which makes signing on older version incompatible: 
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:55:12
Yes this is possible. Bitcoin works with public and private keys, so if you have the private key you can always access those coins.
I suggest you download [Electrum]( , create a new wallet (write down the 12 or 13 words it gives you, this is your backup seed which can recreate all addresses in your new wallet. Electrum is a [deterministic wallet]( which means you will only need this one backup in the future, so write it down and put it in a safe place)
Then in bitcoin-qt you will need to get the private key of the address you send your coins to, go to help-&gt;debugwindow-&gt;console. Enter:
    
    dumpprivkey 1YOURBITCOINADDRESS
This should give you your private key of that address (looks kinda like a bitcoin address only longer)
Now open Electrum, go to wallet-&gt;private keys-&gt;sweep, there you can enter the privatekey and it generates a transaction which moves the coins to an address which is derived from the electrum word seed.
Wait for a confirmation in the blockchain and the coins should now be in your new electrum wallet.


    walletpassphrase YOURSECRETPASSWORD 120


Sigh, I write all that, try it myself, and it does not work, seems there is some bug in electrum, i reported it on github...
But in theory that is how it works. There are also other wallets which can import privatekeys, like mycelium on android.*
@_date: 2015-10-02 21:01:45
Don't think mycelium supports exporting privatekeys, but it seems you can do it like that  - found on [bitcointalk](

@_date: 2015-03-08 23:37:21
Import is greyed out for me too, it used to work, but I think is not recommended anymore, because if you *import* it adds the address to your wallet but it will not be protected by the Electrum recovery seed. So sweeping is preferred, because it moves the coins to an address which can be recovered from seed.
It seems that there was an small bug in electrum, which is [fixed now]( so sweeping will be working again in the next release. I just tried it with the github version and it indeed works again :)
@_date: 2015-10-18 07:11:50
Yeah, seems it is because I voted from another account on the same topic(s?) ( I think I downvoted some shit that the buttcoin guys posted ... ) a few months ago.

If it is caused by transaction flood you can also try to add this to bitcoin.conf

Thank you, cheers :)
@_date: 2015-10-06 04:23:47
If you have the seed words everything can be recovered.
Sometimes if Electrum won't open, deleting the config file may help.

It uses a lot of cpu importing blocks. Later blocks have more transactions so they are slower.
Should still be done after a few hours if your computer is not super slow.
@_date: 2015-02-24 09:57:21
Could you explain how it solves the blocksize problem. Afaik it is only an arbitrary limit which will get raised later. Last I checked monero a few months ago it seemed even slower to sync than bitcoin-qt so I gave up after a few days.

They have something in the TOS which prohibits bandwith eating stuff, so maybe that is the reason.

It is very unlikely that they will ever make 1 BTC back, BUT if you buy one now, and replace the BTC you just spent, you have paid with fiat :) so it was ~90$ USD. There is a chance that it makes that back. That said I will get myself a few because I miss mining, electricity here in germany is super expensive. These use 2,5 W each, still better than any GPU/FPGA. But for me it is just for fun. Other ASIC are cheaper but they are all preorder so you will wait months.

You can setup trust with "bitstamp" and then you can use the builtin orderbook and sell the xrp for btc.
Then you can deposit that into bitstamp and withdraw it there as real BTC. (sounds more complicated than it is)

Easiest is probably adding a dns server:

Yep, they will be sent out in big sendmany transactions, like this one:
They distribute hundreds or thousands of coins at once, so if you receive something like this next week, you should be good. But maybe friedcat should start to pgp sign his emails.

I don't think it will make much a difference. If anything it makes bitcoin harder to attack and thus maybe more valuable.

@_date: 2013-10-05 18:18:14
I think they were also priced that high in the beginning, because it was shortly after the bubble burst in april and ASICMiner products are priced in BTC only.
If BTC/USD would have crashed to sub 50$ levels, his miners probably would've still cost the same BTC price (and friedcat doesn't get any credit for that, its a shame, everyone else takes stupid paypal etc...)

I am not 100% sure about this because I don't have a blockchain.info wallet, but I think if someone gets a hold of the backup in your email, he can open that with your password to get the private keys which are inside. He would not need the 2 Factor password for that.

I read multibit has an option to reset the blockchain and rescan for transactions, try &gt; Tools | Reset blockchain and transactions. If that does not help, is the bitcoin address associated with the private key showing the right balance on blockchain.info?

1) Not everyone has (or wants to have) debitcard/bankaccount/paypal. The complicated thing is keeping the coins secure, but spending is very easy. My mum paid the pizza order a few days ago at the bitpay checkout with my android, scan code - click send, a bank transfer is more complicated. Some shops also give discounts if you use Bitcoin ( whollyhemp.com had a discount a while ago, gyft also had something where you get 3% back )
3) You can order more stuff everyday (Pizza, Space Trip :D), even for sites like amazon or ebay there are ways to pay with BTC (via 3rd party services like all4btc.com) - Ok most convert to Fiat, but if things get more stable this will hopefully get better in the future
