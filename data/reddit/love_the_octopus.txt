Any better resources? I am looking for anything similar in Spain

Such a shame, all the articles made it sound like it was going to remain on the mall. I was really looking forward to trying it...

Yep, but they were the only bitcoin ATM I knew of out there

A few according to  but since their info regarding Spain turned out to be not correct I do not know

Kinda far from central Madrid, isn't it? How did it end up there?

Ah, so a merchant would be able to offer services to foreign clients and keep his earnings in something better than local currency. I like it.
I just wish there were more possible goods or services we could offer from Venezuela that could be interesting for external clients without being a big company.
I would also like to talk to a lawyer to check how this would all work. Currently some people in Venezuela use bitcoin because it represent a gray area in law. While it is illegal to sell or buy dollars (or euros) for bolivares there is nothing in the law about selling or buying Bitcoin with bolivares. I will do some research on what it could mean for merchants.

Aw man... that sucks

Link please?
Also, I just heard about Bittylicious and it sounds interesting. Any idea if the site is legit?

Yeah I know. But I am very new to Bitcoin and wanted to buy a very small quantity to get to know how it works and it seemed like an easy way.
I may go to the meetup an see what I learn
