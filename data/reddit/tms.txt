This value is reserved as the fee that would be used if either of you stop cooperating and the other side needs to close the channel unilaterally. In the case of cooperative shutdown of the channel, the negotiated fee could be lower, but that's besides the point: closing a channel requires a closing transaction that must pay fees, just like any other transaction. Where are those fees going to come from?

The bug wasn't introduced in 2018

Would be great to have dates market on the X-axis, especially on the picture.
Looks like those who kept on creating 1 satoshi outputs gave up this year.

The command-line utility qrencode works for me.
    $ qrencode -t UTF8 $(bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey 1SomeAddress...)
Replace UTF8 with PNG if you want an image output and the $(...) if you've already exported your private key.

This is the most fantastic bitcoin event I've heard about in a long time!
[Another tweet]( says that "prize address will be relvealed soon".

You're right, there was pretty much no way of obtaining them except for: Mining, begging your friends to bring back notes of other currencies when leaving the country and then mailing them to some bitcoin exchange, and PayPal (got scammed once - never again). 
Then throwawayagin showed up on localbitcoins and he's pretty cool. 
If it helps you out we could meet up and exchange maybe 10 or 20 coins? I'll ask Aketh as well.

It's a shame that your comment gets downvoted because you make a valid point. It may be true that your chances are astronomical and that it well never ever happen ever, but the implementation lacks the true random generator the theory relies on. For instance, SSH keypairs are also very unlikely to collide but an [accident in debian]( packaging made the complete number of keypairs enumerable.

You can also spot these things on the [bitcoin monitor](

TradeHill? A more realistic value? 
Those of us who didn't play the (Magic the Gathering) market and don't use bitcoins to store savings are unaffected. Merchants accepting bitcoins many pin their price to the BTC-USD exchange rate anyways, so nobody really knew what a coin is worth because it's quite arbitrary (is my theory). The sole benefactors of bitcoins rise in value are those who are already sitting on bitcoins.

Hi, I like your website. There are two channels with enough remote balance for me to receive, so it's probably a routing problem.
I'm opening a channel directly to your node now to see if it changes anything.

Is anybody else having problems withdrawing (FeeInsufficient or UnknownChannelSomething errors) but not contributing to the jar?

Bitcoin is not illegal in Iceland, but utilising it to circumvent capital controls is not lawful. Icelandic citizens are free to purchase goods and services with Bitcoin overseas and I have done so many times and customs don't care. 
The capital controls make it very hard to purchase Bitcoin in Iceland, we cannot send SIPA transfers to exchanges in Europe and credit card options are few as everybody knows. But there is some action on localbitcoins.com and there's a [corner shop]( that accepts bitcoin! 
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:06:25
Not much, there's [a tiny corner shop]( and you can some cash with localbitcoins.com.

I'm confused, it does not appear that Etsy supports bitcoin as a payment method. How do I put in an order?
@_date: 2013-06-25 16:35:14
Is there any way to order this without registering on bitcointalk.org?
@_date: 2013-06-26 20:37:13
Heh, thanks, but no.
