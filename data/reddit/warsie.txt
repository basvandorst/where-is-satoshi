How long have you been paying attention to this group for?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:08
I mine monero and I do think there will be a transition of sorts because as you mention monero is more anonymous but I don't think it'll be as .massive or as quick.
I could be wrong though XD

Weird that the person who defends hierarchies all the time cares about "personal freedoms" nowadays. Fucking top kek that the dude who tells his followers to literally clean their room, not metaphorically even is talking about 'the individul'

Because the free market doesn't give people equal jobs with the same power and whatnot tgat their old jobs were. If this was a socialist society where wealth would be shared and means of production collectively owned I wouldn't care - as we get fully automated luxury gay space communism and all that.
But this is a capitalist society so lots of people will suffer

Yep. You can divide bitcoins to like 0.00000 something. An absurdly small amount which I got in 2011 basically is valued at 34 USD last I saw.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:11:28
Yes, and?
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:15:37
They don't go around working with the CIA to overthrow governments and provide most of the deaths from literally lynching government supporters either
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:14:12
Most of the deaths are caused by the opposition literally going around and killing government supporters, and most of the arrests of "dissidents" were because they were calling for the army to overthrow the government on Twitter or posting guides on how to kill government supporters online. Remember these tickets tried to work withbthe CIA to overthrow Chavez in 2003

Move the bitcoin to your personal wallet, as the fork means you will double the value. You need a personal wallet witg a private key for that to happen.

even though blacks are overrepresented in (some) forms of crime, they still get arrested disproportionately compared to that extra crime. Also, they get sentenced HARDER for the same fucking crime.
Pretty sure that is a bias in enforcing the law, especially if for say drug crimes blacks actually use LESS drugs than whites (certainly the rave/psychedelic shit. you know most of those vendors and buyers on the darknet are white people)
