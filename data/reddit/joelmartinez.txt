Not being able to read Japanese ... I wonder if anyone could tell if these claims are only for bitcoin balances held at gox, or if one can file a claim for USD that was sent to their bank account?

It's a bit of a roundabout, but you can essentially get a btc discount if you buy gift cards via gyft :) It's not huge, but it's certainly appreciated.
@_date: 2014-01-10 21:39:54
sounds delicious

Holy crap ... one of the main characters in the show "Almost Human", which has referenced bitcoin several times, is named Dorian

This event is what convinced me to buy a (few fractions of a) coin. I figured if the price didn't crash after that, then silk road wasn't the bulk of the market. Had a great Christmas!

Just out of curiosity ... how do you think that would have changed your life? Would you have made any decisions differently from what you've made so far?

How fast do these transactions confirm?

Only food servers and the lady that cuts my hair. I dislike tipping, because I dislike bartering. Don't get me wrong, I do it when it is generally accepted that the person doesn't make a living wage without tips (ie. Servers); but that's just out of necessity because of the way the system works. I wish they'd just pay them fairly and work the price onto the cost of the meal and give me one flat bill. Rewarding be or reprimanding someone for good or bad service isn't my job ... I'll just stop going there if I'm not happy with the service (and by extension the establishment that failed to have good enough quality control to train or otherwise handle the issue before I got there).

Already subbed there! The interest has hit me pretty hard, so I’ve definitely been immersing myself as best possible. I’m really looking forward to getting more experience and all that. 
nice to meet you. Will be keeping an eye out for posts in the CFL area :)
let me know if you ever want to chat solidity. I’m somewhat new to it myself (I’m a software Engineer, but have been lightly keeping up with crypto tech for a while now). Am interested in becoming more involved in the creation of stuff. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:01:52


Please stop right there. This very phrase is a red flag. I’m a strong believer in the technology, but I want the discussion to be based on fundamentals, and history is *never* a reliable indicator of future performance.

Hah! Yeah a buddy of mine recently picked up a 19’ com-pac. It’s a lot of fun. I’m in Orlando, fl ... learning in a lake, but hope to get out to the ICW and out to sea eventually. 
Once you poke around and learn about solidity, a quick 5 second idea is that you could author a smart contract to do the master scheduling ... and then create subcontracts to handle the down payment and eventual final payment. Lots of interesting options available. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:04:48
I know we’re on r/bitcoin, but this seems like just the thing that would work really well as a smart contract on Ethereum. Are you familiar at all with solidity?
Also, just got my ASA101 last weekend, and am going for my first solo sail this Sunday. Pretty jelly of your fleet tbh :)

I looked up an establishment on coinmap, and made the trek to eat lunch there. The waitress looked at me like I asked her to explain quantum entanglement when I asked if they accepted bitcoin. She asked her manager about it, and he said they're not accepting it anymore, though didn't offer any further info about why :-/
That being said, the last thing I did that wasn't a complete wash was cash out some bitcoin (via coinbase) that had grown in value, enough to buy some new parts for my motorcycle. Also, previously donated to khanacademy. Thanks bitcoin!
**edit: I edited that venue's openstreetmaps entry to reflect that they no longer accept bitcoin on coinmap**

If I needed to purchase something worth $100, and that's all I had ... of course I would :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:43:35
dude, I literally linked that same page in the text description :) The zero balance came after I reset the block chain and transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:59:09
I'm very curious why you're not upgrading. Is there a feature that you'd be losing?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:34:52
No link will automatically send bitcoin, unless you have a client installed that does that, which would be a very poor design. Just make sure that your client doesn't auto send on bitcoin:// links and you'll be fine :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:33:44
Interesting, thanks for posting this ... I've been considering trying to talk to folks where I live, but wasn't sure how to approach them (not being a salesman by trade). What's the "elevator pitch" that you use that seems to work and get people interested enough to follow up?
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:05:12
hah, had no idea they had this: 
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:29:27
ahh, yeah ... things definitely started lagging on 3GS devices the last few releases. My family finally upgraded out of the 3GS devices recently, so I know the feels. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:54:57
But wouldn't you be selling to people who would likely cash out after your transaction? That would still (theoretically) put downward pressure on the price if you buy a ton of stuff quickly 
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:01:53
Some people (like me) like to buy gift cards (gyft, egifter) with coins that have appreciated in value, effectively giving me a discount when I shop :)

I've had similar issues with multivitamin unfortunately. Not a fan. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:00:19
Are you using multibit? Might have to reset the block chain and transaction list (from the menu). 
It's happened to me and seems to be a bug. I've started to use electrum

no kidding ... for this guy's sake, please upvote this answer so it bubbles to the top! :P

You should still mention it ... One of them might just choose to buy bitpay, or at least use their business model as a case study. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:16:50
I'm not sure if anyone has brought it up, but their rejection letter stated that they were being blocked because it wasn't legal in all the places they were selling the app in. Could this be because they chose for availability in Thailand?
In that case, I wonder if they just resubmit with thailand excluded, if they would be allowed on the app store.

That has no bearing on the situation ... if I have an asset that is worth $100 USD *right now*, and I need another asset that I can only get for $100 USD, then I will exchange it :) 
If I have $100 USD worth of BTC, *and* $100 USD sitting in my pocket ... then I'd consider my options differently.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:18:09
Right, I completely understand that ... I guess I should have been clear that I understand those risks, and wish to pursue this idea regardless. I'm more looking for any huge gotchas that I may be missing :) Any coins I'm holding for the long term go offline ... but for day to day transactions (should that future ever arrive), you would need some "cash on hand".
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:19:59
If you want to buy bitcoins, then buy bitcoins :) at the end of the day, the price is whatever people are willing to pay when someone else sells. You'll find bulls that buy all the way up and down, and bears that will go on about the greater fool theory.

You have to jump through the verification hoops first ... It'll take a while, but will eventually become instant  they have a list of the exact hoops to go through the levels on their site
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:10:42
Agreed, I know of such folks. The way this will reach that segment is when someone like western union starts using bitcoin as the international transfer medium for when they remit funds. Of course, it means that they won't know the first thing about bitcoin ... but they're be using it in one way or another :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:45:49
Will dark wallet (or perhaps obelisk) have something analogous to bitcoind, that can be automated? Asked another way, can we build bitcoin services and tools on top of this :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:37:58
multivitamin?  got a link?
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:08:35
ahh, very cool ... thanks for the info, this looks like it might do what I'm looking for. Will dig into that, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:42:23
Looks like you already reset it based on other responses in this thread. But in order for the balance to show, you might have to do it a few more times. 
Just for reference, see this post I made when it happened to me:
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:22:46
Post Your request on craigslist ( ie. Looking for van in exchange for bitcoin ). Then look up existing van listings, and ask the seller if they'd be willing to accept bitcoin. 
You'll either find a willing seller, or at a very minimum, be the first exposure to a bunch of people about btc :)

The coin base app is definitely nicer (still have it installed) ... But at least you can still/always add the mobile website to your home screen via safari. 
But this really sucks. I really wish transparency was the norm rather than the exception.

Would have been nice to pay on Bitcoin,  but meh, for $8 ... It's a pretty good deal. Bought one :)

Ubiquitous availability of products. I'm talking one-click-ordering kind of convenience. I know you can order on amazon via gyft, but that's just inconvenient enough to make me not do it for impulse purchases. 
I think that the more consumer products that are easily available via btc, the more reasons people will have to enter the market in the first place. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:20:14
Stock* ... You know what's mean ;)

And/or meet the buyer at a place that has wifi, like starbucks. That way you can have that internet connection if you don't have a mobile phone wallet capable device.

Yeah, just use the current price to convert the usd to btc ... And have then pay that much. You can get fancy with giving them some % discount since you don't have to pay CC fees (ie pass the savings on) if you want as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:36:35
Awesome, this is something I was wondering as well ... I spend enough in SB, that I'll really start to appreciate that 3% gyft points thing :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:47:12
Unfortunately, I'm seeing the same thing ... were you ever able to get this up and running?
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:34:47
Here's a thought. Since we already have communications systems that reach out to other planets, we could send bitcoins to/from our settlers on mars when they get there, making bitcoin an interplanetary payment system. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:58:26
Totally understand the psychological aspect of it ... but perhaps it's on us to make it clear to anyone we speak to, that you don't have to buy/use an entire bitcoin.

Nice try, FBI

This sucks ... thanks for the detailed info, but it's a real shame how Apple is reacting to bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:38:52
Just a quick update on this. It did eventually show the correct balance, while the errant transaction disappeared; however it literally took about 3 or 4 tries of resetting the block chain for it to show correctly.
More strangely, I attempted my transaction at gyft twice more, and the same thing happened. I eventually transferred my whole balance to coinbase, and it worked fine there, so not sure if maybe there's something funky with the addresses that gyft (or really, bitpay) is passing out, or what.
