No, the burden of proof is on Tether. They're making the claim they have $2 billion in USD. That's the premise of their coin. Creating more Tether without dollar reserve is just brazen money printing.

It's a lot higher than that unless you've got all kinds of favorable assumptions.

China has gotten tired of the unproductive use of electricity (and the use of BTC for money laundering out of China) and, being China, can do something about that.

Whoever said Bitfinex'd was wrong? Bitfinex and Tether certainly didn't prove it. Tether has never proved anything.
This is a whole other animal from "is crypto solid." Crypto is supposed to draw strength from being decentralized and trustless. Tether is the exact opposite of that. It's essentially fiat money - they declare that a USDT is a USD and so it is - with the added risk of being tied to USD, meaning if USD inflates so does Tether. Now USD normally doesn't move much but again, crypto is supposedly anti-fiat, not dependent on it. 
The whole thing stinks and anyone who doesn't see this as a systemic risk is a fool.

You miss my point entirely. If I own a Bitcoin I own a Bitcoin. It provides no income or claim on anything. It is only useful to the extent I can exchange it for goods and services or trade to someone else.  There's no mandatory payment with Bitcoin as it is not legal tender and has no unique goods it can buy or debts it can settle, so its value as a means of exchange is entirely up for grabs. 
If I own a Bitcoin mining company, I can choose to either participate in Bitcoin or sell to someone else or liquidate my assets. I'm a business owner in this case, mining Bitcoin pays income and I can use that to estimate value. This in and of itself is volatile because Bitcoin is but there are plenty of businesses like that (e.g. oil). Now ASICs may be hard to liquidate but picture this being done with graphics cards and you'll understand I can liquidate for cash without either using Bitcoin or getting any consent/paying anything to people who hold Bitcoin. It does not matter AT ALL what they thing Bitcoin is worth because that's not what I'm selling. I'm selling the business or scrap or GPUs.
The Bitcoin network isn't what you are buying when you buy Bitcoin.

No it wouldn't because Bitcoin, being fundamentally a non-essential private sector item, would long since be upcharged out of profitability.

That's still not understanding what a bubble is. A speculative bubble happens in any asset when prices inflate way beyond anything that can justify them.  This can be literally anything, see Beanie Babies. All a speculative bubble is people buying not because of any serious consideration of value but because they believe they can sell it to someone for more. 
Cryptocurrency is absolutely a bubble that could crash to nothing or next-to-nothing because there are no fundamentals to price (income produced by asset) no market regulation or intervention, and a whole bunch of participants who don't know or care what these things are beyond trading vehicles. See wide variety of useless, no information forks and ICOs. Speculative bubble magnitude is hard to predict but since the overall pattern is based on herd panic buying and then selling, the *pattern* is almost mathematical. 
This obviously applies to Bitcoin itself unless you want to argue the 2017-18 spike and collapse doesn't look like every other investing panic ever.

Prepaid vs. post is a huge difference. Regular billing, it makes sense to not use electricity that will run at a loss. Prepaid, you have effectively gone long by betting that future revenue (from higher prices) will cover the electrical contract you are signing now to guarantee power. In that case you are stuck with the bill so if it is in any way profitable to operate day-to-day, you go full blast to minimize your contract loss.

Banks yes, Bitcoin no. Quebec just vetoed a 17 *gigawatt* request from miners looking to move there. 
That's several times what many cities use, including the banks. It's literally more draw than all of what NYC uses, inclusive of the finance industry.
This is pants on head. Moreover utilities simply will not allow their ratepayers (a.k.a. bosses since it's either state owned or regulated industry) to suffer to benefit Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:00:31
And how is that relevant to 19 GW of 24/7 generating capacity being an utterly absurd demand on Quebec? There is no global power plant.
Also, how is it relevant to if its like other finance? It's clearly not when (one part of it) it wants more generation capacity than NYC needs.

Miners cannot choose to hold. They have a 24/7 huge electric bill to pay that must be paid in the local legal tender. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:10:24
Miners are the opposite of HODLers. They are forced to sell continuously to pay electricity, rent and other overhead.

They may want it but if they can get it is another matter. Try selling art from no-name artists.

Fracking is a good example. Most oil fracking plays operate at and have always operated at a loss. However the frackers have an externality - their leases and loan covenants that require them to produce. They don't pump, they default and lose everything. So it makes sense to run anything full-blast so long as it covers cash costs (day-to-day operations) and hope to exit later. 
Most people outside of the companies and Wall Street don't know how unprofitable "Saudi America" is. There's this image - similar to Bitcoin really - of the revenue driving this massive expansion but in reality the flashy money in the boom areas was borrowed up-front.

Businesses generate income. Bitcoin does not generate income and also has no liquidation value. If the Bitcoin infrastructure was liquidated Bitcoins themselves would be worth nothing. If I own some financial company stock I have a theoretical claim on the company. If I own Bitcoin I have *no* claim on any of the infrastructure. I'd have to own the infrastructure itself for that, which is what has physical value and generates income.
There is no inherent value to a means of exchange that has no industrial use.

"Arbitrary death penalty" usually gets people's attention. This isn't the United States with those silly "rights." 
BTC is used to evade capital controls in China. The Communist Party doesn't like that.

You have this backwards. All traditional assets have core valuation metrics tied to what it pays you.  In the case of commodities, that's what you can sell it for at any time to industry. Gold, being a commodity, doesn't pay you yield (making it pretty risky to just hold) but it has regular industrial use that is a reliable buyer. 
Crypto doesn't operate on this principle. Bitcoin doesn't pay yield, doesn't given an underlying stock claim and has no industrial use. It's not *supposed* to do any of those things because it is supposed to be currency to conduct transactions, not an asset.

He means in an economic/industrial sense. If gold crashes, it won't crash below its then market industrial value for use in electronics and jewelry. 
Bitcoin does not have an industrial use, period.

It's called order spoofing where an order books is stacked with buy or sell orders that are never intended to fill and will be cancelled if the price approaches them. This is done to influence trading decisions by actual traders - see OP with the "good luck bears." Because this is market manipulation it is banned in regulated markets but crypto exchanges are not, so..
