Yes but it will take longer as far as I am aware. You don't own any Bitcoin right now, but Coinbase is giving you a promise that they will pay you in the future. No ownership == no new coins

You're saying prices are about to drop like last time? Or that Bitcoin will finally stop dropping after every peak?

I'm not sure because I just got into bitcoin last week myself. I believe you go through your wallet's website.
I know Trezor offers a claim tool but they are hardware wallets

Rumors that China will unban cryptocurrencies and also Amazon will add bitcoin support for all (most?) transactions.
Rumors of course

Would sending BTC back and forth (or just spending in small increments) have a large impact on my balance because of tx fees? Im using electrum

You gotta keep in mind that 1k to 10k is much larger than 1 dollar to 10 dollars, or 100 to 1k

Why would you want to?

What exchange would you recommend? I'm under 18 so can't use GDAX since it requires a SSN

Get it off of Coinbase/Gdax and put it into a wallet such as electrum. Currently you don't own any Bitcoin, only a promise from Coinbase that they will pay you that amount. Once the split happens later this month, Coinbase does not owe you any BTG because you only own Bitcoin through them. If you put it in electrum you will get your BTG
