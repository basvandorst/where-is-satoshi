But Bitcoin isn't the only thing which uses the blockchain.


...  looks silly now.  It's better to stick to what he actually said rather than play around with inventing other unsaid things.

Cheers! I like that you can make custom monikers too! That's really quite cool.

Okay, clearly I've missed something here... someone further up the thread gave a user one internet, and now you've given someone a donut, and you've been given a coffee in return. Where is this crazy list of items and their relative amounts of bitcoin/dollars?

Is 1 internet some kind of standard amount?? Change tip bot knew what you were on about immediately...

I'm not a techie. I'm trying to get involved with bitcoin, but it's tough as the level of discussion in threads is often outside of my area of knowledge. The wiki and various other links aren't particularly accessible. They're not too bad, but I know I would've appreciated an easier guide. I have a wallet now and I'm slowly getting involved, but it's slow going. I'm sure if this was my only thing to occupy me outside work, I could research at length and get to grips so much easier, but there simply isn't always time. Surely, it would be beneficial for bitcoin overall if more people could easily get involved/have the confidence to get involved?
