@_date: 2019-07-15 20:10:01
I’ll never buy/sell anything that moves 5,10,15 % in a session. I don’t care what your time frame is.

Point proved. Ty

lol, youth
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:50:20
Lemme guess, you’re gonna buy more as the price drops. Lol. Enjoy the knife cuts.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:10:30
Umm inflation much??!!
Lol, if bitcoin goes up 10% this week, what do ya think is gonna happen to prices for goods and services??
Bitcoin could go up 5% a week. All you hodlers would have a wet dream. 
In the real world, what would happen to real goods and services?? 
Can you think beyond your greed?
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:12:39
lol, ok
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:13:58
Ummmmm. .No one has actually answered my question.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:53:31
Do I trust a currency that gets hacked a couple times a year.
Do I trust a currency that trades 1,5,10,15 percent a day, week, month..
What's your point??
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:06:30
So tell me why. I’m older than most on this sub. 
Go ask your 60yr old neighbor if she’s ok with her savings/retirement gyrating 5-10% per week. 
Go ask your local Walmart management if they are ok adjusting prices daily/hourly. Because if they don’t, money will be lost. 
Is there no inflation/deflation in the bitcoin economy? 
What about the business cycle? If the economy goes south, the economy will need an injection of funds. Where will this injection of funds come from?
Just because it’s digital doesn’t mean the ebb and flow of the economy changes.
Holders luv bitcoin because of decentralized nature. So who makes the “decision”?? 
McAfee, the wonder twins, who?
You guys love the no government idea . 
As soon as you have answers to my questions, I’ll listen.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:38:01
I'd love a well thought out answer....
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:56:42
As far as I can tell, this report is based on central banks. Coiners despise government intervention. I want you to tell me if we abandon fiat, like this sub wants, who makes decisions. This article is pointless, nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:04:08
I'm waiting for a logical reply.......

@_date: 2019-11-18 21:05:12
how's that goin' for ya
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:47:33
If got in 10yrs ago and are still in, fine you win. Otherwise we will have to agree to disagree.
@_date: 2019-11-15 15:28:17
Isn't is great to cherry pick something to make you feel better!!
@_date: 2019-11-18 20:37:34
so manipulation...
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:43:18
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:16:59
My reasoning is you cherry pick an investment that is doing worse than btc and pat yourself on the back. 
Anyone can do that.

I got lots of BTC manipulation pieces. Let's go
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:47:57
Of course this will go on forever!!!!!
@_date: 2019-10-11 21:29:43
Lambo now??
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:04:27
Fine, post your findings. Links??
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:25:38
Think about what you just said. You are clearly young. I pity you. Look at history. You will get burned. Maybe not today or tomorrow.
You have been warned.
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:52:21
China is about to launch its own cryptocurrency.
RIP BTC
Billions of Chinese will embrace it. Sell their BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-16 20:39:03
All I read every day...Bitcoin is down, will buy on payday.
So what's your beef?
@_date: 2019-10-16 20:44:53
keep telling youself that.
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:17:38
Omg, how old are you? I've traded SP's for years. You are talking out of your ass.
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:56:07
You know about supply and demand right? Gold is the ultimate store of value. It's a natural resource which by definition is limited. BTC is made up, can be manipulated in any way. Manipulate gold, bitch.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:37:29
Either way, bye bye BTC
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:43:47
7500 to 10500 to sub 9000.

Everyone I know will be like, "seems stable to me."

@_date: 2019-12-16 22:06:29
oh, yeah, of course
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:25:31
BTC is a financial instrument (like it or not) . That was the question
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:20:54
Lambo soon!!!!
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:48:08
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:05:58
You are stupid beyond belief or a troll.
I hope you're a troll.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:24:02
What makes you think they are buying and holding??
They will sell at a profit point, buy on weakness, just like any other financial instrument!!!
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:06:51
what say you?
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:47:35
cuz bitcoin always bid...

@_date: 2019-12-18 21:34:49
Lol, how?

@_date: 2019-12-17 20:55:52
ugh, my bad. quote from another redditor. sry
I'm a moron.
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:35:43
Name one financial instrument with a fixed supply where the price does not go up over time.
@_date: 2019-12-11 23:02:21
It's almost Friday hodlers/bitches.
Stock up some more shitcoin!!!!
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:35:11
Ughh, this concept is true for every financial instrument. Yes there is a fixed supply. Who do think is going to own it, hodlers or billion dollar hedge funds. Since the supply is relatively limited, they’ll corner the market, dump, and hodlers be like, wtf
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:15:28
google "failed internet companies", you'll get a list a mile long.
All had a stock float, meaning total amount of shares outstanding. All failed.
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:39:43
sub 7k, time for shitcoiners to buy!!! Even though it's not Friday....booo
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:13:23
lol, cnn
that says it all
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:44:47
lol, wtf??
@_date: 2019-12-17 23:03:11
BTC store of value...
not to mention the corruption....
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:30:00
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:44:52
All you guys must be young or misinformed, or both. The fact that Wall Street has "endorsed" bitcoin by creating financial instruments around bitcoin, means you "hodlers" don't matter anymore. Hedge funds, ETF's, and banks now rule your world. Ramp ups and dumps are not controlled by you. 
You wanted acceptance  in the world, now you got it. It will not be the same. No $2.50 to $20,00. Profits will be taken when prices increase. Buying will take place on dumps.
You got what you asked for, deal.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:15:21
lol, every single time.
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:51:45
Omg, if it’s a record, Lambo near!!!!
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:45:53
You drunk?
"Name one financial instrument with a fixed supply where the price does not go up over time."

@_date: 2019-01-14 21:33:26
I’d rather short bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:29:52
I’m game. Let’s see who’s right.
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:32:36
Twins are all about pump and dump. Prove me wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:20:45
Bitcoin still a thing??
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:32:36
I bet you said that 11k, 9k, 7k and now at at 6 handle.
Pray tell, what’s “deep enough “?

BTC comment at 2:20
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:19:06
So you're not gonna buy goods and services like a normal currency with your bitcoin. I'm sure your "investment" will help bitcoin spread the word about this alternate currency that you your self won't use. Got it.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:09:29
If sleep better because of your moronic logic, sweet!!!!
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:47:17
Thank you for the pump. Now I can dump.
You stupid morons.
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:56:24
sry, thot btc was a digital currency
@_date: 2018-12-19 20:05:39
Omg I’m so hard!!
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:02:40
Whatever helps you sleep at night.
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:45:03
I still make bank. Do you?
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:45:23
Well at least people who use PayPal buy goods and services. The nail will be in bitcoin if all you coiners just Hodl. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:50:56
Bitcoin bid!!! Lambo soon!!!
