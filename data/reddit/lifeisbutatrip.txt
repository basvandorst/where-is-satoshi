I understand what it is, just purport after someone in a libertarian society winds up murdering someone, you are still going to punish them with your libertarian government.

Tbh having people in the community out there touting that insider trading should be welcome in our community is pretty much going to guarantee your average person wants nothing to do with this space.

Nothing makes some non vegans more happy than finding some way a vegan isn't living up to 100% perfect standards, it's a weird thing you start to see when you go plant based.

It almost seems like you are intentionally not getting it.
as soon as you enter into a private company that has private information trading on that information before it is made public is insider trading.
You are not the general public when you are a part of a private company and it has to do with your private company.... You are a member of that private company.

Thank you. I will read this and become savvier for the conversation with an accountant.

The value of their assets can drop because of insider trading before they are made aware of the news.

I believe that eventually if you don't turn the crypto into something useful in reality like a house or a car or something else tangible that will be useful in life, what is really the point at all in having it?

Anyone has access to Insider access trading is an entirely different edge that pretty much no one can get. It can easily rob people of the value of their assets.

Because they have insider information that is not available to the average investor and by acting on it before the information is released to the public gives them a huge advantage. Which is insider trading... Not sure how you are not connecting the dots on this one.

Your position that people in the general public who are unaware are the same as people who are in a private industry with private industry or even private entity knowledge is flawed. It would be hard for me to explain this to you unless you understand the difference in the first place.

Really not your place to decide what political ideology people should have in order to invest in cryptocurrency, in fact semi not libertarian to suggest people should be anything you want them to be. Also you might be surprised that it's not just libertarians who think the current system of government has problems.

There is probably a healthy middle ground between showering your kid in purell every time they touch dirt and eating mud cakes.

That's a really spin doctor way of putting it. They had to spend the money first then cut back and their investment paid out. Was it the investment, the cutback, or both combined?

A lot of what you are saying is true but job growth in the USA over the course of that time wasn't bullshit. It was definitely a band aid but it's definitely a different case and disingenuous or at least not completely telling the whole story to not put the context behind these things.

Look I don't want state intervention in my life, but I also don't want them to let people murder me. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:51:22
I've got a person on the internet committed to not getting it telling me they don't get it. Most people get it. Normal people scoffed at that goober on T.V. saying that. Enjoy your elitist fantasies though. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:55:42
I could have been more clear but it seems pretty obvious what I'm saying is I expect that the government does in fact enforce laws over things like murder. 
As for weird take that insider trading is a victimless crime, because it's not.

The socialism comment was unwarranted. Socialists still believe in work and working together so you can bet in a socialist world these new technologies would still be applied. People don't just stop having ideas and working. Humans are curious social animals.

Letting people intentionally trade on insider information doesn't sound much like a free market, sounds more like an elitist wet dream on keeping the market cornered. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:56:27
To everyone saying "how will they enforce it though!!!!!" you can get away with all sorts of things. Murder even. What does that have to do with anything?
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:07:22
These guys are joking about breaking the law and saying "yeah but how will they catch me" as pretty much most criminals say to themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:27:51
It's a crime because it's abusive to others. The fact there are other ways to abuse others does not mean we should not try to stop abuse where it's most obviously harmful to others and can be avoided. It is a really easy line to draw and like you said, you can still get a million other advantages without breaking the law.

Watching people talk about  how they deserve to keep 100% of the free internet money they are making is really only showing us exactly what true rich people are probably actually spending their money lobbying for and are smart enough not to just blab about. These very thoughts. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:03:54
Tbh I don't understand why anyone who can write something so well needs to joke about ethnic cleansing.

I see this as a big step in the growth of bitcoin. 
Litecoin founder said it best in a quote I will semi butcher. 
"Bitcoin for houses and cars, litecoin for coffee and _______" let's call it video games.
This is a great opportunity for an alt coin like litecoin to help fill in the gaps at times like this. 
I'm obviously hodling a little of both.

You left out the context of why both decisions were made. if Obama didn't do that in 2009-2012 our economy wasn't looking like it was going to turn around. We don't need to provide huge tax cuts to mega rich people. We really don't need them. We did need to bail out our auto industry. Rich people bailout is not a valid reason to add 1 trillion to our debt, however many years we spread it across. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:58:28
I understand but I wanted some of my money back to hedge against me losing all the money I invested, so even if I have to pay taxes that is fine. 
What I do wonder is if I took back less than I put in if that is considered profits or is it only profit after you get back what you put in? And does the fact I am still holding  play a part in it?
See, this is so complicated and I am far from a financial professional and although advice from reddit is awesome (will continue reading all of it) I want to truly do this the right way the first time and learn from a professional.

Go turn some bitcoin into litecoin and buy stuff with that and LEAVE YOUR BITCOIN ALLLOOOOONNNNEEEE
