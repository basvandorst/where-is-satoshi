Lol ?
I am asking a BitCoin subreddit for thoughts on the high energy consumption / transaction in a world where we are facing environmental disaster and winding back of unnecessary use of natural resources.
Why I need to defend me using the internet I have no idea? And have you noticed the automobile industry is going 'green' recently for some reason? Ride sharing is increasing.. it's almost as if people are reacting to the "unnecessary use of automobiles worldwide that exist only for convenience" :|

Here have an actual peer reviewed scientific paper instead:  , rather than a whitepaper from a crypto news site. Titled : Bitcoin emissions alone could push global warming above 2°C

I been here 11 years, does this make my comment more valid than yours?
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:13:08
Relevance? There is a cost to everything, but if you want to add a BTC payment for that Amazon product, add an extra 408.42 kg of CO2-e. That's the point.
Edit : Is that your 4th edit now, bit hard to reply if you keep moving the mark

I gotta wrap this up, we could banter for days, so I am gonna summarise a bit here, while trying to address your points. You like to go into weird sidetracks like explaining what a cost analysis is, and how it is performed, probably unnecessary, thanks though.
We have a pressing environmental catastrophe, the solution is very simply, to use less of everything. Consider this, BTC disappears tomorrow. What happens with all that renewable energy currently being used? It goes towards reducing the load and need for less clean power sources, putting us closer to the target of no more dirty energy. Until we are 100% renewable, creating a monetary network that uses more power than the current system is simply counter-productive and uses more of everything. We should be striving to make the most power efficient network as possible. I can see value proposition when we have excess "green" energy, but never before, and we have a long way to go.
Do you seriously think any large scale industrial business would base any costings on mining BTC, in their projections and planning? It is down 82% from ATH in a year. They would get laughed out of the bank.  This is just unrealistic in the real world and I am not going to go into this anymore. I watched the video, responded accordingly, I think its a nice theoretical justification for why BTC uses so much power, but I don't think it's valid.
The snark is because you like to make personal attacks when your opinion is threatened, classic 'smart guy syndrome'. For example : 'the pinnacle of ignorance', 'laziness or stupidity', suggesting I had a fake account, 'you lack the basic knowledge to debate this at a fundamental level'. Basically you're a bit of a dick, smart or not. And yeah sure, I'm probably smart too, but.. weird flex bro.

Are you seriously suggesting BTC solves this : how easy it is to launder, steal, embezzle, buy drugs, support terrorism? Have you been paying attention?
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:35:27
Or perhaps 2 people have the same opinion about a fairly obvious topic, that BTC consumes too much power per transaction?? *amazing!
Lol, yeah using more energy is solving the issue
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:02:47
His concept is nice on paper, but lets talk about the real world. 
Who is going to build a power station that far exceeds the needs of the local network, at great cost, for the chance to pay it off quicker based on the speculative price (and increasingly higher power consumption per BTC mined) of BTC? You just watched the crash right? No company, ever.
Why not just build the correct size station for the network and pay it off just as quick. You seem to be missing the whole point. We don't need to build bigger power stations if we don't have this overhead of the BTC network.
And again with the : BTW, attempting to subvert a discussion by eliminating a response that you can’t effectively counter is the pinnacle of ignorance.

I am not here to discuss electric cars ffs, my discussion point was really straight forward but you keep trying to make it about something else unrelated.
Lol a 'framed' question? I quoted something I read, expressed that it concerns me and asked for opinions. If it has been answered a thousand times, then use those smarts and summarise for me. Whats the solution to this problem, other than burning more power? And how does this solution fit in the context of global concerns about excess resource usage?
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:16:27
But along with that comes a slower hash rate and less effective network 
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:38:55
Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:27:13
Found those Mt Gox coins yet? Arrested everyone who bought of silk road? Stopped any sort of washing and laundering through BTC? Pick a random BTC wallet, tell me who owns it?

I have academic access, I research for a Uni... always quick to assume aren't you.
@_date: 2018-12-13 10:51:43
I am using the terminology here, the guys that wrote papers on the topic. It looks to be less than what the original quoted amount since the last sell off, but the point is the same
"Number of U.S. households powered for 1 day by the electricity consumed for a single transaction"
The methodology underlying the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index has been anchored in peer-reviewed academic literature since May 2018.
Got a source for your statement?
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:33:18
Cool, so you know where the Mt Gox coins are?
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:41:28
How much energy does it take to spend that dollar, over and over?
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:38:39
I prefer my platters from peer reviewed academic journals thanks, like this one : [ , Titled : **Bitcoin emissions alone could push global warming above 2°C**
Reposting from other comment : 
'Until we are 100% renewable, creating a monetary network that uses more power than the current system is simply counter-productive and uses more of everything.'
This is the crux of it. A monetary network that uses anywhere near the levels that BTC is scaling to is ridiculous in this current environmental 'climate'. 
How can you argue using so much power is possibly justified, when we have alternate cryptos that do not that would serve the same purpose?
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:31:45
Probably a lot more if they used BTC for each transaction. That's the point, right? 
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:47:12
*too ;)

Finally an answer, thanks , that is not just a straw man argument.
I understand that with growth of the lightning network costs will be reduced over time, although wider distribution of the problem doesn't reduce the problem itself.
I also agree that the calculations are likely off, we base a lot of these on the honesty of the Chinese Govt to be actually using as much renewable energy as claimed, which historically has not been the case. Any calculations of this scale are going to require estimates, is simply not possible to get an actual value in the real world.
I do think that in times of economic crisis, we may see a move into cryptocurrency, but the immaturity and lack of regulation on the current market, this is way too early. There is a reason they say 'hide in Gold' when things go bad. Its the safe harbour for now, and it will require long periods of stability (not pump and dumps) before investors will trust cryptocurrency as a safe haven.
My overall concern is with the emission cost to run the network, I still believe this is way too high given what the world is trying to achieve atm, zero emissions.
Your future thoughts are the ideal scenario for BTC, and though unlikely, not impossible. I hope you are right, and we all move to crypto, but I don't think BTC is going to be the final solution.
