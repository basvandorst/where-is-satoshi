Ho, funny dude, not being in camp fanatic doesn't make someone a "bcash shill".
I have written some of the best articles in German about bech32, Schnorr, Lightning, the need for small blocks and much more during last years, I gonna be media partner for the next Lightning Hackday, and I always entertained a good relationship to various small blockers during our big crazy war. So please get away with this stupid "if you are not an extremist like us, you are the enemy". I'm a journalist, dude, not a religious follower.
WRT your conspiracy assumption: No, [bitcoin.de]( did not delay SegWit integration because some obscure and covert Anti-Bitcoin-policy or whatever you thought about. It was just a matter of priority and effort-reward. [Bitcoin.de]( started a multicoin-marketplace, for which they worked very long for (and which was a very very huge step for the company and its valuation). First coins are BCH and ETH, plans was to add LTC and DASH soon. I was surprised SegWit came before this, because right now fees are ok and they would have earned much more by integrating the next Altcoin.
Second, it might be easy to integrate SegWit if you are a young company or specialized on providing wallet services. If you securely store Bitcoins since 2011, things are not the same, and require more attention. For example, Core's implementation of SegWit does not support signing a message with a privkey, which is a key element of [Bitcoin.de]( unique audit process (which is the world's first Bitcoin audit complying with German standards of audits), [Bitcoin.de]( and an external audit company established in 2014/15.
I could go on and on. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
