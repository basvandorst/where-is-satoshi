Nice try, NSA.

Hopefully you sold first so that way you can afford even more!

From a purely technical standpoint I agree with you. All of the downturns in this bull market of the past few years were met with aggressive rallies once the key S/R levels were hit. Not this time.

Yesterday i had 10 BTC and now I have 11. That couldn't have happened unless I sold. Had I Hodl, I'd still have 10. If you're this mentally invested in BTC it might behoove you to play the game because the people moving this market aren't your small individual long term investors, and a few hundred little guys like us aren't going to prop up the market with the Hodl play... Not anymore.

You don't necessarily have to sell, you could also hedge with CFDs. Point is buy low hedge high and make more coins if you know how to trade.

It would be worrisome if it drops below 750, and most likely game over if it can't hold 450

Since BTC has been trading between the fib fan levels for years, what that was - was a dead cat bounce off the 38.2 fib fan Ray from the low swing of the past few years up to the 50 of the most recent bull run and back. Let's hope it holds here because the next stop is 61.8 of the shorter TF ~850 then to 50% retracement of the longer TF... ~750

The yuan will be officially included in the IMF's SRD on September 30 which poses a significant risk to the dollar as world reserve currency.

I'm betting on 2500 before 6000.

It was made popular after the last speculative bubble when greedy noob investors (myself included) thought the price of bitcoin was going to a million and didn't cash out. The bubble popped and investors got trapped into bag holding for years. The same thing is about to happen again, and you'll see a flurry of hodl propaganda start to hit soon since price is falling.

You nailed it. This is a bull trap and we are now seeing the remaining smart money race for the exits. BTC may never be this price again and if it is it will be a while. Be smart hodlers and take profits now. You can buy back in once the dust settles.

Great point! This further supports the argument for a technical move. Wired magazine dropped a bomb on BTC (trading @ $255) on 11/6/13 which told the world how Gox was already experiencing widespread issues. Gox had (well-known) negative fundamentals when BTC was trading highs under 200. BTC went on to set new all-time highs (5x) despite said fundamentals. So what was the fundamental catalyst that caused the BTC bubble to pop on 11/30/13? You can't just say oh Gox was the issue... gox was always an issue during that build-up phase.

Back at my PC now... 
[As you can see]( the bubble popped well in advance of the Mt. Gox indecent and price returned to the mean; a continuation of the bear market. 
Anyone who says that BTC is a special and TA doesn't apply doesn't know jack about price-action or how market makers trade markets. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:46:57
I'm telling you that you got your dates wrong. [The Mt. Gox thing]( happened 2/7/14 a full two months after the bubble popped. Mt. Gox was just a catalyst to drive the price down faster than it already was. Did you bother to look at the chart I posted? 
And yes, market makers will prop up any financial instrument temporarily while they distribute their positions and even take up net short positions so they can confidently buy to cover all the way down, in very well know and documented phases called accumulation and distribution. Do you really think smart-money is going to be accumulating BTC at the very tip-top of this market now that it's regulated in China and about to split 10 ways from Sunday? I hope I'm wrong, but I'm probably not.

No, I mean when the bubble popped in 13. 2013.11.30
And yes they show up in the regards that every major rapid downturn has reversed at a Fibonacci retracement or ray.

Do you really think that a state/central bank would give af about losing fiat that they printed out of thin air when the goal is the accumulation of crypto? If I ran a central bank I'd kick off panics and then acquire more as price falls to eventually have enough monopoly on supply that I could whip saw the market into complete instability.

Those people (or entities) also have the power to bring the bitcoin market (fiat value) to its knees.

No evidence, but technically speaking btc is not in the clear yet. BTC made this exact pattern when the bubble popped in 13. Fresh high top followed by a wicked downturn followed by a strong retracement and what appeared to be new highs on the horizon actually turned out to be a bull trap
