Can use MEW for all the ETH related thing of your Trezor/Ledger :

You can probably bruteforce your wallet, there is a bunch of tools/software available to do it.

Yeah you right.
So let's go, we should all buy a cool 1 year old iPad (and the new ones are coming soon) for 100 $ more than the current official retail price.
That's fair, and super cool.
Being more expensive is OK, being way too expensive, is really not good.

I sell something somebody bought, that's all.
I'm refunding the buyer...just if we used Bitcoin instead of Paypal everything would have been faster, without those ridiculous fees.
Not everybody is trying to scam people, I have no need to steal 140 $ from somebody to survive, I get paid with my job.

163 $ for a package of 800 g ? So for you it's normal ?

Will be happy to help for the beta test (Developer inside).
@_date: 2014-08-20 12:08:34
I didn't knew that it wasn't possible to send that, or it is with a 160$ of shipping cost.
With Bithalo I could have sold the product, safely for me, and for the buyer without fees.
How many people pay by Paypal, and after few days they cancel the payment, and you finish without the goods, and without the money ?
This happened to me 2 times before...
@_date: 2014-08-20 09:15:42
Yeah that's right...a simple can of Coke here is 3.5 $...
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:57:24
I agree.
With the current price of hardware, it should not be really difficult to have a REAL hardware wallet.
3.5 " screen, small APN (to scan QR-Code) Bluetooth LTE (for future iBeacon station), NFC in case we need it, super small and optimised Android version, Wifi chip, and that's all.
Sure we can do that for 50 $...when we see the current entry price of the Chinese mobile phones...

No, it's : "Je vous payerais en Bitcoin si vous m'enseignez l'anglais !"
And "Je vous apprendrais le Français si vous me payez en Bitcoin."
P.S.: Notice the space right before the "!"...this is french.

I haven't said that we should all use a malware open gate android phone for our wallet.
I just think, that with the actual day to day technologies that we are using (smartphone, tablet and other) an hardware wallet that we don't need to plug with an USB cable would be better.
For example a simple iBeacon, or a Wifi based transfer to the POS terminal of the signed transaction will be really good I think. If the device is based on Android doesn't means that it will be crapy not safe.
I know Tresor is good, and it's the first of his kind. I almost bought one before. But this kind of device is actually not "mass acceptance ready". I'm really sure that a Credit Card sized device (6-8mm thin), with a big screen, SECURED could exist for around 50 $.
I'm an iOS Software Engineer, and for me a good wallet on iOS (coupled with iOS 8.0 coming next month) could also be super safe (using finger prints signature approval, and private keys backup in the cloud).

As I understand, we should "top-up" the card with an amount of AUD.
So it means that for example I have 10 BTC on my Coinjar account, then I choose to charge my card with 1 BTC, so my card will not contain 1 BTC and I will not pay using this BTC when I buy a coffee or a beer, but instead the card will be charged with the current value of 1 BTC in AUD so around 450 AUD.
So if the price of Bitcoin change during that day/week, I will always have 450 AUD on my card, and not 1 BTC (with a fluctuating value).
(the conversion is made when you top-up the card, not when you pay/use it)
Am I correct ?

You should transfert them to an exchange, (depending where you are living) then you can sell them for money, and transfert that money to your account.
You can try Bitstamp, Coinbase...there is plenty.
Or you can hodl them for a while, and wait the price go up (not very difficult based on that it went down for more than 1 year now...)
If you still want to sell them, first find the best exchange for you (country, identity verification, popularity...) then create an account.
P.S: If I was you, and If I don't need that money right now, I'll hold it for 2 years and see what happen :)

Support is not replying apart from automatic messages like usual, I guess we just have to wait (just adding that I have my identify confirmed).

Same here since 3 days, other people have the same issue since a month -_-

In AU there is also  you can even have a self managed super Bitcoin based account with them.

You should checkout Bitwage.
Was using that for 6 months, was living in China, was paid in USD to my Bitwage account and converted automatically to BTC on the spot, was dealing with the BTC how I wanted then.

Bitcoin has his Judas tho...Ver I’m talking about you

And Bitmain is not doing anything much than asking TSMC to produce the hardware. TSMC used by Apple since many years now for iPhone/iPad/AppleTV/Watch CPU production.

I would like to run a full BTC node/lightning + ETH Node + PiHole at the same time do you think it should be fine on a raspberry pi 3 ? An ODROID UX4 would be better I guess ?
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:04:57
The Pi 3 has only 1 Gb, the Odroid 2 GB (and a way more powerful CPU/GPU)

Bitcoin market cap is right now almost 32 B$, Facebook's is 413 B$, so it's more around 1/13 at the moment, so much room to grow !

I have an account on Polo since 2 years, was just level 1 verified tho.
I wanted to withdraw 0.316 BTC, got the email, confirmed it, then the transaction went to pending. As other peoples said, a Polo employee has to manually approve the transaction for the withdrawal to be processed.
I created a ticket and they said that I should prove that I'm the rightful owner of this account. I could not prove it with any BTC adresses but I told them that I could do it with ETH. They then asked me instead to get the level 2 verification and they will accept my withdrawal right away. 
So I provided the infos, including ID cards pictures and selfie things. That was 1 WEEK AGO. I've sent a question and created a new ticket, I've got 0 answers since.

Actually I'm looking to do something similar, with a micro-controller (the Pi is too big) a touch screen + wifi + a battery.
The arduino Yun could be a good choise for the prototyping.
Like this a powerfull secured and portable real hardware wallet.
