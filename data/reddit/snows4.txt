[My take on bitcoin...take it for what you will] (
Here's my take, could be very wrong...but an asset caught up in a mania (like bitcoin) typically disconnects from a reality based fundamental value and is based more on speculator emotions.  Just look at the amount of 'retail' investors here saying its still going to the moon.  These are the folks who are going to capitulate and add selling pressure as the market tests new lows.
1. Price is basing in a range for a long period of time, which typically means once price breaks out of the base, it will continue in the direction of the breakout.
2. Huge rally going parabolic, rally follows trendline to around 1200.
3. Price breaks the up-trend...now price is no longer more likely to continue higher...now its anyones guess.  This is followed by another test of the price highs where the remaining buyershope price coninues up, where others sell out to the new buyers because they see that it was near/at last high (called a double top).  The 3rd attempt for price to move back to the highs didn't even make it back to the 1200 level, indicating some serious weakness.  
4.  Price continues to roll over to the downside, validating the move up has completed, and the new trend is down.
