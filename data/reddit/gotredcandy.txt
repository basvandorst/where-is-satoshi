I'm not sure it is, unless the Fed's were seizing btc back in 2011.. I would attribute this to possibly as "warm" wallet of MtGox
One theory I had been working on, MK isn't stupid, incompetent and a social retard sure. It's been acknowledged that the cold storage wallets were stored in multiple safety deposit boxes, if I were the least bit paranoid, I certainly wouldn't trust them in an unencrypted form given the potential for seizure, theft, etc.
What I would do would be to encrypt them with a One Time Pad, and store that / copies of that in different locations / different companies, kind of like a physical 2FA for the wallets, or hell if you're smart enough, memorize the OTP and destroy it.
Given then SR investigations, it's possible the safety boxes containing the keys or perhaps the OTP codes have been seized, and hence his explanation for them being unavailable, or he's forgotten the OTP.

"Had" could also imply they he believes they are gone, never to be recovered.

Really dude? Can’t even add a HDD.
Also, you get the concept of time zones right?

Whose going to donate.. how are you going to provide trust to the community that you will transfer the money? What’s in it for you? How much are you going to take for a running cost..
Btc doesn’t need a ‘project’ like this.. this is your way of trying to scam some coins.

Yeah wow. Looking at your post history.. no one is going to trust you to handle btc
Just no Stacey.

Because looking at the items you’re asking about and learning about, you’re not even at the level of skript kiddy. After 5 years of studying, you’d not be making mistakes like formatting a partition, asking basic questions about brute forcing. And asking people to host a webpage to verify their identify, let alone asking them to stop their systems so you can ping it..
15/16 same shit

Might want to mention you’re 15... and have only just started learning ‘ethical hacking’

You realise dumbass that an SSD is a subclass of a hard disk drive..
But hey. I shouldn’t expect an inexperienced idiot to understand basic computing.
A capable, smart person, would take the time and figure out the issue, not resort to using reddit as their first port of call for tech support 101...
How’s that botnet coming along? :)
