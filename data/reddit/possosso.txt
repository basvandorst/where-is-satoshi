And lets not forget that since the titanic disaster also made it a requirement for all ships to have their radio on 24/7. Back then it used to be checked every now and then. 
It's horrible that loss of life or property is needed in order for some things to change, but it would be even more horrible if we did not learn anything from these tragedies.

Ahh and here in the US I'm still tackling overdraft fees :(
Would anyone know what will happen to bitcoin if BOA started using it? Assuming all legal matters were taken care of.

Is the price that was shown mt gox price? Or do they have some weighted average? I have always wondered that?

Then we could go back and buy beer with those bitcoins. It's a paddy's dollars type of situation.

No lie, a Heineken delivery service would dry up my bitcoins.

He was asking if it's correct to have the American mindset. Was not commenting on Chinese gov't as I know very little about it.

It is a perfect mind set to have. This is not a social issue so there is no minority to protect from the fearful majority. If people want to pay with bitcoins and to exchange them into currency, they have a right to. Our democratic gov't should respect our wishes, especially bitcoins, because it is such a wonderful idea that clearly works when put in practice.
Edit: spelling

But what could they do with bitcoins? I'm honestly curious of what possibilities are there for a brewing company. They could probably accept them from wholesalers, but there aren't many that do business in bitcoins. And us, the average Joe/Joette; will they deliver to our door? Buy beer online?

Don't get me wrong I would love to see any business accept bitcoins, however not enough people know about it and those who do, do not have a good understanding of what it is and how it works.
