Can I ask for a tiny bit of bitcoin? I have, like, 12 cents worth, and I don't really trust cash-to-bitcoin sites.

You'd put your business transactions in another company's hands after *not reading their TOS*?

I can't tell if you are insulting Christians, or...?

It almost sounds like you think Bitpah will ever be as successful as Google Wallet or Amazon Payments. You jest, right?

How does this thing work? I'm really interested, but I don't know how to get a wallet up and running.

Too soon.

I don't understand how supporting an alternate currency leads to anarchism. I figured that most of the people here would be interested in the cryptography and usability side, not the weird silk road side.

How? Honest question, I'm clearly new to the whole anarchism thing.

Huh - I should've done my research before I called out specific things.  
Well, I'll try to stay more open-minded.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a proponent of a lot of drugs being legalized. But drugs like desomorphine are horrifying and dangerous, and I don't know how anyone could support them.

How to end up with a drugged down, useless populous, a guide by you.

Should society not limit what people can and cannot do in order to protect itself?  
Edit: by the way, at no point during this exchange did I say that locking people up for taking drugs was a logical and sound procedure. Distribution should be illegal, but actual use should be treated as a medical issue.

I'm definitely not a scholar in the field, but as far as I know it boils down to not wanting a state to control your life - and that's noble, and in a perfect world it'd be the best way to operate, but IMO it's completely impractical.

There's a difference between having a misguided belief and understanding that legalizing every drug would be a bad thing. Legalizing some would help prevent gang violence, sure, but once you end up looking at the sketchy side of drugs you're dealing with things that can kill people.
