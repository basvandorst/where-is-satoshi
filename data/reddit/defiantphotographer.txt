It was wired. I'm going to try contacting them, considering how everyone seems to have gotten faster transfers

$20 isn't too much. It's less than $100 or $1000. I was comfortable at $20 especially when I bought it when the price was around $5700-$5800 I think. I'll be slowly investing in small amounts from now though. You never know when the next price drop will be.

I neglected to think about CoinBase to go bankrupt! Thanks for the advice! I'll be keeping them in wallets from now on
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:27:16
For now I'll stick to wallets like Breadwallet and what others suggested. I'll look into hard wallets when I get more into it.

I've heard of GDAX while researching a bit. I just settled on CoinBase because it seemed to be the mainstream platform to purchase Bitcoin. I'll definitely check out GDAX more throughly now! Ill look up electrum digital wallet too! Thanks! 
And I've seen Hodl a good amount of times on this subreddit. Is that suppose mean hold onto the bitcoin?

Not sure if it was the right term to use. I basically bought $20 of bitcoin off CoinBase. With that $20 I was going to use it to figure more out before purchasing larger amounts. And by figuring things out I mean, wallets, paper wallets, etc. 
Also my initial "investment" has gone up about $1 since purchasing. 
But like I said, I'm new to all this and wasn't ready to make a bigger purchase until I was more confident in my knowledge.

Okay. Thank you for the info! I'm going to transfer my bitcoin to Breadwallet, but I'm definitely research more into paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:42:14
Okay, so I should put in a little at a time? Like $5? 
Again, I'm new to this so I don't have too much experience.
