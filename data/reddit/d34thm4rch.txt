The thing is that neither you nor I are the ones borrowing fiat from the Fed. Banks borrow and they borrow against their assets. Assets = Liabilities + Equity. The addition in this equation might be confusing, but imagine liabilities as a negative number. Banks borrow with real collateral.
The problem with fiat is that it's a very poor store of value. That does not mean it does not have utility. If someone loaned you money, would you rather pay them back in USD, or BTC? Probably USD, because something that is deflationary becomes harder to pay back over time. That's what makes mortgages possible. Fiat is easier to pay back over time since skilled labor can reasonably be presumed to produce a larger number of income after, say, 10 years. The loan becomes easier for the debtor to pay off, the creditor profits, and the debtor has a nice house. It's a win/win.
Do you really want to live in a world where people can't borrow money to buy homes? Coz that's the "death to fiat" world.

What is your definition of "sound money?" I agree that you should be able to save without watching savings erode. In this respect, the US dollar is not good for savings. This is a huge benefit of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is good money.
On the other hand, I disagree that credit only benefits the rich. Credit allows people to leverage future earnings in exchange for having something useful in the now. I can't grasp the idea of the statement, "with sound money, you shouldn't have to borrow."


So.. you're suggesting that businesses borrow? Or that every business is traded publicly? Or that businesses with intrepid models should not have access to investors? It sounds like in one breath you said you shouldn't have to borrow, and in the next it's okay to borrow if you have a good plan. That sounds an awful lot like what we already have.

Not an argument (nice ad hominems, though). Anyway, gold's been adopted by the rich (ie, not the masses) and that's enough to support a multi-trillion dollar market cap. Bitcoin does not need to be owned by everyone to become much more valuable. It simply needs to be owned by the wealthy.

Are you suggesting that banks should be fucked for acting as custodians of customers' money? Most people don't have the agency to hoard a ton of cash. Property rights only exist through one's capacity to defend their property. Banks are useful for this. Besides their original function, they now come with a number of other useful functions, such as financing things people could not ordinarily afford. Yes, indebtedness sucks - but so does homelessness and wiping your ass with your money every month paying a landlord's mortgage. If people don't like the terms, they are free to not use them. I don't see the problem.


There was no incentive to participate in foreign banking if it didn't provide utility. It did, so HSBC found customers. Also, your analogy makes no sense. The alternative to HSBC at the time was being a shit-out-of-luck Chinese peasant with inferior local currencies, no custodial services, and no financing options for homes or business ventures. Again, net benefit.


You have not presented an argument. You have presented a sentiment (fuck banks) with a grandiose, untested economic model as an alternative to the most successful Keynesian economy that has ever existed. Forgive me if I'm not impressed. If you think I'm wrong, feel free to respond with something intelligent.

The term "collateralized by debt" is oversimplifying a bank's accounts receivable. Banks aren't lending money willy-nilly to anyone who asks for a small business loan. Value is created every day by the expenditure of time and energy by man. Value is not zero-sum, which is how a business can borrow money, invest in assets that can reasonably be presumed to generate income, and create a net worth that is greater than the debt. This is why GDP is an inverse of national debt.

Forgot to answer your question. I do think debasement is bad because money is foremost a liquidity solution to act as an intermediary between goods and services of different values. The closer that each unit of currency is to 100% fungibility with any other unit of that currency, the better it is as a liquidity provider.

I agree, which is why I think the term cryptocurrency is a misnomer. I think inflationary and deflationary monies have pros and cons. I imagine a future where people can have the best of both worlds.
On the other hand I have to disagree that gold's current value is related to its historic use as a currency. I think people buy it for its unique qualities, the least of which is nostalgia for the good old days of gold coinage. I think Bitcoin has its own interesting and attractive qualities that are valuable despite the lack of widespread use as currency (much like gold).

Gold was never a good currency. It was debased when used directly, could not account for GWP when used indirectly, and if you havn't noticed nobody is trading in gold anymore. In other words, it's entirely accurate to point out that gold is not currently adopted by the masses as a currency. Yet it's still valuable, which was my point: adoption is not necessary for value.

Think the US couldn't monitor crypto activity on the end-user's machine? Think again. Ever heard of Stuxnet? It was an unattributed malware that destroyed a lot of Iran's nuclear capability. Think the clever people behind this software couldn't create something similar targeting software related to the transmission of crypto?

In fairness the stock market hardly ever mirrors a logical valuation of a company's equity or potential for future EPS, mainly due to the onramping of retail nobodies in the last few years. Honestly the sentiment is similar to Bitcoin: buy a thing you hear about on the news and wait for a moon. Just look at Tilray price action this year.
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:57:49
What could end up constituting material support is the actual transmission of bitcoin from one account to one associated with an organization like hezbollah or a benefactor like the iranian government. I see it going one of two ways:
1: if government is competent they will find a way to identify addresses associated with terror and monitor transmissions to those accounts, or
2: government is lazy and incompetent and decides the means of transmission itself is the problem. Since we have no problem tanking sovereign currencies like the lira, i dont foresee much compassion from the feds if it ever comes to this

This would be useful if not for the volume of wash trading that occurs with BTC. Its impossible to know how much buying is due to legit retail investors, or how many sales are people who genuinely dont want BTC in their portfolio. One thing is certain though: miners always sell.

I don't think crypto needs mass adoption. Does gold need mass adoption? I think Bitcoin can become very valuable relative to fiat as an asset bought solely by the wealthy.

Bitcoin is hardly a replacement to western powerbanking. A deflationary currency is poor for lending in the first place. Imagine taking out a mortgage priced in Bitcoin in 2014. You aint payin that shit back.
Bitcoin, as you said, is an alternative to traditional banking. It is not a replacement. Banks have made the world a much better place, just read up on HSBC in China. Suddenly the Chinese had access to banking and could invest in useful things like homes and businesses that were inaccessable before. 
The anti-bank ideology in the crypto space is so juvenile. Bitcoin serves a purpose. Banks serve a purpose. Both are a net benefit.

It doesn't even need to. Cryptocurrencies have separate and distinct properties that make it attractive to own even if people still use or bank with fiat. I'd wager the majority of us still use banks for one purpose or another.

I respect your view but disagree that bitcoin needs to be used in order to be valuable. Greshams law states that bad money will be spent before good money so as long as we have fiat I see people continuing to spend fiat and hoard BTC since it is a better long term store of value

Whats funny is how this actually forces exchanges to take more coins out of cold storage (to manage the withdrawal load) or will cause friction as they take coins out of cold storage to meet demand. Then everyone bitches and comes up with conspiracy theories about how the exchange had problems when everyone tried to withdraw.

Balance sheets balance the values of debits and credits, not assets and liabilities. Hence, a balance sheet can demonstrate performance (read: equity) by subtracting liabilities from assets. Value can be added to or taken from a balance sheet at any time, provided both a debit and credit entry is made to the ledger.
Did you also know that there are free market options available with regards to interest rates? That's right, 24% of Earth's population is forbidden from engaging in contracts that involve interest ([ So why do people still use loans with interest? Because it's a better option than the alternative in a free market.

Right, but at a macro level equity is positive, not negative. In other words, the value of the world is growing. This is due to labor and production of goods and services. Net benefit.


Liabilities are mostly loans and accounts payable, and sometimes obligated goods or services.


Even if this were true, which it isn't, less than 1% of companies in the US are publicly traded. Private companies have no shareholders, so this wouldn't apply to 99% of businesses. It's a patently false statement, though. Companies go public because the influx of capital in the form of stock value provides the company with greater opportunity to grow. The equity can be borrowed against without touching the underlying stocks, for example, or the shares can be sold outright to finance the expansion of the business.
