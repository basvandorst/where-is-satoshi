Right but there are such things as short term bubbles. Look at its 2013 crash - it spiked, then crashed down, and then slowly built up from there.
Just because it had the potential to be worth much more doesn’t mean it isn’t in a bubble. Currently, it’s not worth anything close to that amount, and there is nothing that would indicate the massive serge in value over the past 48 hours besides speculative investing.

Just because there is untapped money (which could much more simply and accurately be shown through the world GDP, or the size of the USD) does not mean that Bitcoin isn’t overvalued. This post would not help in an argument about the topic at all.

I agree that, in the long term, bitcoin has the potential to grow a lot bigger than it currently is. But it can still be in a bubble. I know I keep bringing up this comparison, but the .com crash of 1999 worked the same way. The internet grew extreme amounts, and then crashed - but that doesn’t mean it didn’t have the potential to grow into what it is today.

Huh, that’s an interesting point I hadn’t thought of - that Bitcoin was designed to be a bubble to incentivize usage as a currency.
But, if it were to crash, wouldn’t it (theoretically) go down to what it’s actual value would be? And obviously that’s no where close to 10k, so how could when it crashes go down to only 10k?

Holy shit. This sub seemed like a fine place but if pretentious ignorant pricks like you are common here, maybe I was wrong.
First off, I came here and called it a bubble because I wanted to see alternative arguments and see if i could be proven wrong, or at least get some differing opinions on the matter. As someone looking to invest in Bitcoin, someone *new to cryptocurrency*, I don’t see how you could possibly get mad at me for doing this.
Second off, I was looking for an explanation. I want to learn more about the subject, not be attacked by pretentious know-it-alls like you who pretend to be too good to teach other people. You’re ridiculous.

I don't see how this refutes my argument at all. What does the gold standard have to do with Bitcoin being in a bubble?

First off Im not insulting this community I’m insulting you for being unnecessarily rude just because I was admitting that i didn’t know something. Second off I’m arguing my point because I want to get more info on the subject, and asking questions and arguing is the best way to do that. Every point I’m responding calmly to because I’m just trying to get info, and I’m not trying to attack anyone. And then i come forward and admit that i don’t know something and you just pointlessly attack me for it. You’re ridiculous.

I see your point - I do agree that Bitcoin will most certainly, in the long term, see lots of growth.
Do you think it would be better to wait for it to crash, and then invest? Right now the valuation is so high that, if it crashes, I feel like it would take a very long time before I would break even again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:09:43
But it'll be pretty noticeable when it does, right?
If I'm gonna be in it for the long haul, and I also think that Bitcoin is going to crash, I might as well wait for that before I invest.

But even the good companies crashed after the .com bubble - they just built back up after many years. Amazon, who probably handled the .com bubble the best out of any large company, still had their stock drop to a third of what it was, and took 8 years to get back up to what it was (this doesn't account for stock splits).

Sorry - looking back at it that was a really poorly phrased title that did not get the message that I wanted to get across.

Could you explain what you mean? What is 'reserve currency in crpyto'? Sorry, I've just starting looking at cryptocurrency so a lot of terminology is new to me.

I guess I was referring to “actual value” as it’s value based off its economic use rather than investors. Like, for example if you took out all the investors right now, Bitcoin would still have a value - it would just be a lot lower. Investors just turn the “actual value” into what they think the “actual value” will be, in the future.

But you could say the same thing for the .com bubble, or the 2007 crash, or really any major financial bubble. Yes, they grow crazy amounts, and yes it can take years before it crashes. But they still crash.

Please. What makes you think the Rothschilds are worth that much besides loosely connected conspiracy-theory evidence?
Your anti-antisemitism is leaking.
