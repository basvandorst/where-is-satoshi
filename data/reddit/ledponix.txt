This feels like the dip to 6k close to the end of the summer, it.'s still expensive but much lower than the recent ATH.

FUD more but the reality is Greece got rekt by banksters and corrupt politicians who received bribes for everything they did. Many of the bribes came from german industry giants like Siemens

The amount of bad actors doesn't really affect anything in this case, just a bit of adoption on LN will immediately kill the scaling debate and bcash. Cashies have been stresstesting the btc network for free and burning their own money to do it, let them.  If Ver and co are left holding bags once LN is rolled out, bitcoin wins. If they're forced to trade their bags for btc, bitcoin also wins. 
IMO it's best to see them as trolls and give them the troll treatment; stop feeding them and let them F themselves

You've clearly never heard of escrow. Good luck getting a paypal refund outside of ebay btw.
If someone uses crypto to buy something from a site that offers escrow (eg through Request Network), they'd be eligible for a refund even if they paid in BTC

1) Not into maths at all, but I believe algorithms can get more difficult by adding unknowns or something. You don't change the algorithm, you just add to it. 
2) Yes
3) Even if the limit is not a hard one, you'd have to convince miners and nodes to agree to having their bitcorn holdings lowered in price since the supply would increase and capitalization would stay the same. Good luck with that!

I think that's called an exit scam, bud. He was after BTC from the start, the BCHABCSVDIAMONDUNOBTAINIUM airdrops he got for free, and now he's selling all his shitty forks and airdrops to poor fucks that think they'll outrun the market that way.
I'd say "S" but since he'll be fine, I don't want to waste the spit
(edit: here's a long term prediction - the moment all airdropped shitcoins get purged with the rest of the useless shitcoins is when actual adoption will have finished and the mainstream, global crypto economy will begin)

Openbazaar. It's simple, intuitive and makes you think "how the hell didn't somebody think of it sooner?". It does need some help with marketing, but it could really become the thing that gives crypto RL useability.

OK even if we put aside the fact that like 80% of bitcorn mining runs on renewable dam energy (thanks, Jihan), the statement that central banks burn less energy is absolutely patently false. 
Just consider the amount of energy spent on any bank building, from the ACs to cleaning hoovers, heating and commuting of employees. Even better yet, just consider Wall Street and City of London alone and tell me those two places don't consume incomprehensible amounts of energy to function. Very pick and choosy imo
Does a harvard university professor really think that crypto is supposed to offer an alternative to just central bank buildings  and the whole of the banking sector? He's just misinformed
