You're missing out banks.

He said something that seems silly about fax machines... 
It's arguable that the washing machine made a greater difference to peoples lives by enabling them to have larger amounts of free time, than the internet.
And especially in retrospect.
Yes, lots of people have made money on bitcoin, but his point about it going up and down wildly is right - that isn't useful in an actual currency.
Like lots of people on here I have some bitcoin, and it's probably worth about 10x what I paid for it.
He said a thing which is a bit silly in retrospect, but all the replies saying something about a "sick-burn", just sound like retarded school kids, so yeah I get it - but it just sounds stupid.
[EDIT] 
I realise I didn't directly explain "it" so - just to realise the playground level of the discourse, lets do it - 
1.  he compared the impact of fax machines to the internet several years ago.
2.  he criticizes bitcoin for being volatile, which isn't useful for a currency.
3.  nobody reads his article.
4.  a panda says "herp derp, why not explain it to me by fax"
5.  the internet all says "ya sick burn broooo" and claps themselves on the back for buying bitcoin a few years ago.

Underground, heathens!

You're aggressively making a point that is ridiculous.
OK, I haven't read the bitcoin source code, but do have a pretty good understanding of the concepts cheers.
I guess you read the source code of the OS you use, understand how all the chips are connected in your computer, the supply chain that brought you it?
It's a ridiculous assertion.
No human understands how everything they use works under the hood, we have society for that.
I'm not sure why I'd bother to justify myself to Joe random off the net.
 
Ha! Just noticed I autocorrected myself to crystolographic, not cryptographic ... apart from that though, isn't wrong as an overview is it ?
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:17:30
I know your trolling, but you're question is kind of ambiguous.
I don't do tests when I go for coding jobs as it's ridiculous, but yeah we could probably talk about how it comes to a consensus etc.
Or were you asking what it is as it's basically a currency ... I remember this subreddit when it was talked about as the future of currency.
Because it keeps going up, as it's deflationary people just sit on it, Id be more interested in your opinion on that than dickwaving over who has read more about the minutia of the implementation.
I look at source code all day at work, If I want blockchain implementation I'll just use a library.
OT - I'll be glad when "blockchain" stops being the buzzword du jour to sell things.
Unless you are satoshi I'm not interested in implementation chat.

I like how everyone voted you down for pointing out the obvious flaws.
I wonder if they really all think their transactions that get logged forever on the blockchain will remain anonymous.
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:50:49
That's a US thing, in the UK personal bank transactions happen instantly (supposedly within an hour but I never had to wait) and can be done by app or over the web - I can send my mate some money and he has it then and there.

I don't even know what that sub is.
It doesn't have a chance of being used as a day to day currency because of the volatility.
About a year ago on this sub everyone started saying that it wasn't currency it was a "store of value".
You just troll, I'd prefer to have a conversation, the trolling is boring.
Are you a bot?   Your answers have nothing to do with my questions.
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:29:10
Do you mean ... I remember there was some drama a few years ago, but can't remember about what - and everyone moved here.
Are there really shills for ... who is paying them ?
But yeah, I don't have any altcoins, just bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:58:56
Why not both - I get it, but it is stupid.
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:38:11
What for, this is a pointless game.
Oh, this is really asking what bitcoin is from the beginning - FFS this is immature.
Whatever answer I give will not be the one you want - so how about this:
It's an way of coming to crystallographic consensus by wasting vast amounts of energy on computing cycles to calculate something that has no use, while using massive amounts of storage.
But, what's the point in going into detail, I'd repeat what can be looked up on the net anyway, this whole thread and the tweet thing is utterly utterly retarded and demonstrates what Krugman was saying about "bitcoin derp" in every comment (this one included).
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:59:26
is leaking.
@_date: 2018-10-31 13:34:09
Heh, shows how little I know :)
@_date: 2018-10-31 12:20:34
Maybe I'm wrong, do you see the word cash every day in any other country ?
I thought it wasn't particularly used in the US, not sure about Aus or elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-10-31 12:38:28
Heh, fair enough.
Anywhere else have cashpoints, or is the US ATM universal now ?
@_date: 2018-10-31 10:47:21
e-cash... that's someone writing in a British style.
@_date: 2018-11-30 09:22:14
Though not the case for hydro.

What is the best way to buy BTC in the UK now? 
@_date: 2018-11-30 09:24:36
Like the way you got downvoted for this.
You mention any downside here and it gets downvoted, how will solutions be found if everyone is in denial.
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:56:18
Jesus, he's tall. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:12:28
Wait a minute, surely it's the opposite?    It all seems to be austerity now, so that wouldn't seem to be i keeping with Keynsenism ?
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:54:06
  What rights does the API need ?
Cheers :)
