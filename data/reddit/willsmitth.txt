no my point is, we see a massive increase in coverage, and barely any increase in usage. And there are very valid reasons, because bitcoins are quite unpractical, for reasons that i see rarely countered. Besides 'it will just take care of itself'.
You think google would be a monopoly now if they thought like that in the early days? Shit doesnt take care of itself just like that.

Yeah and if I dont count the expenses from the last 10 years, and then in my head would have saved it up in the right stocks, I now have over 1 million$ ! 
You cant just take out some data that makes it look good, and ignore the other data that makes it look bad.

what is the difference. Total transactions arent up.. They should be up if alot of people were using it now on a somewhat regular basis no?

this is really tiny. Volume in january was like 25 million $ a day?   Would be excited if it was more like 1 or 2 billion at least.
Also note how the number of transactions per day didnt change much from january to now.

I doubt there is much variance over a year. And dont forget alot of new transactions are from people buying it to speculate. To buy like 2 and sit on it. This is probably 80 or 90% of new transactions. So we have that gambling. And almost no people using it.
ANother thing that proves my point is that bitpay only had 100 million in transactions. If you look at daily volume in USD, that is nothing compared to total volume now. Maybe 10 days in january. So a tiny % compared to the total volume.
