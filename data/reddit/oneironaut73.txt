@_date: 2018-01-26 14:35:21
I'm willing to bet this is more of a self fulling prophecy... 
What's happening? People worry about "futures" expiring, so the pull their noodle legs up and hide in USDT or USD to buy back in, and what happens when everyone gets spooked. Duh, the market goes down. 
People will get used to Futures, just as they got used to China FUD, Jamie Diamond Rants and every other reoccurring ban/clamp down.
Have faith that this market is here to stay, put your money in projects that mean something and lower your 10x in a month expectations and everything will work out fine ��

You also misspelled Bitcoin!
Ha..Made you look
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:48:03
This was what you call a “short claim”: 
Whale sells 2000 BTC, uses funds to open a leveraged short position. 
Sale of 2000 BTC goes unnoticed during bull run, people think his short position will get rekt.
Does this several times. 
At the end, he has 25000 BTC shorted (borrowed BTC) 
THEN instead of closing his position with a market sell, he deposits the BTC he owes for the short position and pays off the short instead, he closes his position via a “Claim”  (pays off the loan for BTC which has already been bought on the market by other depositors and loaned out) 
So he effectively dumped 25k of BTC on the market without moving the price.
Edit: example
For the purpose of simple math let’s assume 1BTC=$1
Deposit 1 BTC and sell at market for $1, then use the funds to open a leveraged short position $5
-$1 for total $5 short
Deposit 1 BTC and sell at market for $1, then use the funds to open a leveraged short position $5
-$2 for total $10 short
Deposit 1 BTC and sell at market for $1, then use the funds to open a leveraged short position $5
-$3 for total $15 short
Deposit 1 BTC and sell at market for $1, then use the funds to open a leveraged short position $5
-$4 for $20 short
Deposit $20 (or already in account) and pay off short INSTEAD of closing (liquidating/selling) the position
He effectively sold $20 worth of BTC with no slippage because he broke up his initial $1 dollar sells over time and then wiped out the short debt by paying back the borrowed BTC. This also doesn’t move the price because the borrowed BTC has already been bought on market by others who then loaned it to him for the leveraged position.

If you don’t mind the fees and having your coins in a custodial wallet, Coinbase is a good way lace for beginners and you can set up auto deposits etc.

Stop hunt. 
People set stop limit orders, and “someone” dumps to trigger those to sell and then buys right back effectively forcing those who stopped out to buy back in higher or walk away.
Or someone dumped and others gobbled up the gap (though my guess is the former)
I bet due to the fact that tomorrow is the NYAG vs Bitfinex a lot of people have set stop losses if the case against them goes south and the market reacts by dumping. It would make sense for a stop hunt to fish those out... 2 cents

It’s because most of the market is paired to BTC so when BTCs value goes down so does everything else.

This one is a whole different animal. Mainly because the futures are settled in actual BTC delivery not cash settled, and the fact that it’s backed by the CBOE makes all the difference in the world. 
The delay should have been expected. A rejection is what should have caused this much of a ruckus. Just goes to show how much the Bears are still in control. 
It’s a self fulfilling prophecy, people wait for news and if it’s not completely bullish and the price drops, everyone dumps to short the move. And in that process, many panic sell and bail, magnifying the sell off.

Halvening is far from priced in. If supply and demand principles were that easy to calculate, then sure. But we have no idea what the demand will be in 1-2 years, which is about the time the halvening supply shock will take effect.. IF the demand is high. Otherwise, I suppose it won’t matter much.

All you can do is look at probabilities, market conditions, fundamental and technical analysis and time your entry based off of that. 
You could also argue what’s the difference if you bought at 8 or 12k with the notion that in a few years it will be at 20-50-100k .... BUT we certainly don’t know that either. So the difference between 6 and 8k entry can be bigger than you think. It’s quite possible we stay in sub 20k for years.

It’s not really advertised because it cuts out the brokers and fund managers. I went through IRA Financial Group, they set it all up for you including the LLC structure and licensing. They weren’t the cheapest, but they were awesome through the process. Once it’s set up, the IRA custodians only role is to file your yearly IRS forms and that’s about it. The rest is up to you. Which can be a great thing or a terrible one.. depending on you and your decisions alone. Personally, it’s been liberating. You can trade freely and you could buy a rental property and rent that out as an investment if you wanted to. The main thing is you can’t benefit from anything personally, not a dime.. for instance, you couldn’t rent the rental property to yourself or take a cut. It all goes through the LLC and you can’t touch the income it generates until your IRA comes to term (basically the same rules as any IRA).

@_date: 2019-08-24 04:23:52
I guess if you look at it as a zero sum game, then BTC doesn’t fit the bill yet as it doesn’t have the same one to one benefits of many other financial services. But it has its rightful place and IMHO, peer to peer transactions are perfect for BTC, better than a credit card or cash if your not face to face. And of course cross border payments. Store of value, we’ll see, but that makes sense too. Online payments, meh.. it gives retailers an incentive because they don’t have to pay rent seeking middle men and wouldn’t get chargebacks, but then they get screwed in taxes. The customer doesn’t have the benefit of consumer protection like a CC, but isn’t slapped with interest, late fees etc. 
In the latter example, all it would take is better tax classification to make it more appealing to retail and for the costomer, third party services that provide consumer protections for buyers (i.e. use X wallet service designed for spending vs hodling, where you pay a monthly fee and get consumer protection coverage when using BTC for purchases/payments). Point being, the tech is great.. the systems and ecosystems supporting it still have room to innovate and grow and embrace.
Why not use them all? Cash where cash makes sense, CC where it makes sense and Crypto where it makes sense. 
I think people get so focused on replacing/defeating/competing with FIAT, that they ultimately undermine the very thing they are fighting to get adopted .. BTC isn’t a one size fits all financial instrument. It’s ONE of them. A god damn great one.. but still, one of many.

@_date: 2019-08-03 04:40:02
It sounds like you have a Custodial Self Directed. A Checkbook IRA uses a passive custodial IRA where you create an LLC that is wholly owned by the IRA, you are appointed as the manager of the LLC and all funds go through the LLC. You have 100% control over your investments, which can be just about anything that isn’t on the IRS list of no-no’s (which is a pretty short list).
Anyway, check it out. “Checkbook IRA”
Good luck in your ventures! ��
@_date: 2019-08-24 03:38:02
Because you can save AND spend... hodl a position and then fund and replenish your spending BTC. You’re still going to spend your FIAT on things, why not use BTC where and when you can and do your little part to push adoption. The more people use it, the more people will accept it, right?

Hardware wallet doesn’t actually store your keys. You create a 24 (or 12) word passphrase that gets linked to a bunch of keys when you connect to a wallet app with that passphrase (aka hardware wallet). The hardware wallet is just an interface to interact with your passphrase and the blockchain. It doesn’t actually store your private keys on the device. 
If you know your 24 word passphrase you can access your keys with any supported hardware device.

It really comes down to your goal.. is it to buy and hold? For how long? If so, what will you do if it drops by 10% or 30% or 50% or if it goes up and doubles in price next month? 
It’s good to set a goal and then STICK to it. The volatility and hype/FUD can make you flop around like a fish out of water.
If you are in it for the long run, one of the best ways is stick X dollars every week without fail (or month) and average the volatility out that way. It’s referred to as DCA (dollar cost averaging)
Or plop it in now and come back happy in 5-10 years ��

Yes, you can tokenize on the BTC/ETH platform, but with both of them the asset information is picked up by a Second Layer Protocol (like Counterparty). So in both chains you must spend the native currency (BTC/ETH) to process the transaction which passes along asset meta data and then something like Counterparty parses the data and manages the asset separately. Neither ETH nor Bitcoin natively recognize assets. That makes for an inefficient way to move assets (again, the asset piggy backs on a BTC/ETH transaction) and the assets can accidentally be destroyed by inadvertently sending them to an exchange. The cost alone is prohibitive enough to make those solutions ineffective for something like reward points or other use cases where the asset value is small but number of transactions are high.
Ravencoin on the other hand, has assets written into the main chain code and assets are virtually free to move around once they are issued, the cost is in the 500RVN Burn upon asset creation. And since Ravencoin assets are natively recognized, there’s no risk in them being destroyed and all have unique identifiers. 
It is also very easy to create and issue assets, even grandma could do it. No smart contracts to deal with.
If the Racencoin hash power continues to grow, and it already is a very robust chain, it will outshine the others by a landslide. 
Yes, there are other solutions, and so far their biggest advantage is the network effect. I would argue, though Ravencoin isn’t “needed”. It most certainly is unique in that it is specifically designed to do one thing and one thing only, create, issue and track tokenize assets. Plus it will have messaging and voting, two powerful tools when you are considering Securities as use cases. 
Clearly there is room for many players in the game, but out of all of them, to me RVN is by far the most compelling of the bunch.
Ravencoin has a simple beauty the others wish they had ��

People just need to use it instead of sitting on it..  if anything, buy some Alts that provide a real world solution. If we all just "hodl" then it will die slowly. 
If people just buy BTC to make more Fiat, then the whole purpose of crypto is lost.
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:01:45
Another plus in this SEC regulatory climate, is that Ravencoin isn’t an ICO, and the developers and community have been very careful to ensure RVN doesn’t get classified as a Security. It was structured and launched very much like Bitcoin was, opensource, free code which was fairly mined from day one. No pre-mine or token reserves and no company or individuals were directly compensated by RVN token issuance.
Point being, if ICOs get the hammer of SEC and are delisted off US compliant exchanges, RVN would undoubtedly stand.

The Mining issue is the biggest threat to the BTC ecosystem. Our dear "decentralized" currency is mostly centralized (mined) in China. Damnit, even our hash is made in China ��
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:30:19
The distinction between blockchain and Decentralized/Public blockchain is where the misunderstanding of cryptocurrency vs blockchain comes from IMHO. 
You can’t have a public decentralized blockchain without a cryptocurrency (at least not one I’ve heard of) Private chains, sure.. but at that point you’re closer to a centralized database and are sidestepping decentralization.
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:31:12
I think the point he’s making is that you can’t have a decentralized blockchain without a cryptocurrency (which provides the incentive/economy to secure the network.) 
You can’t have one without the other.

We'll see, as I understand it, it will lower the mining difficulty opening it up for others with smaller rigs to be more profitable... but what would a sudden drop off of 70+% do to the transaction/block speed? ��‍♂️ 
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:16:06
Yes of course there is a correlation, however alts can certainly far outperform BTC. However, the point I was making, was that buying alts with BTC or using something like a Shift card, is putting your BTC to work and growing the economy versus stagnating it.

That’s just it, with BTC. Pass it forward. But the truth of the matter is that there are more and more  solutions popping up to bridge the two, from crypto debit cards and other payment services there are even some for rent now.  They could also use things like Coinbase merchant services and accept BTC very easily.

No one knows what the ultimate impact will be, anyone here is just speculating. Buy Bitcoin based off of what you think is its value proposition and why YOU are attracted to it. If YOU aren’t firm in your resolve, you will get Rekt because the price swings will mess with your reasoning. 
Decide what kind of player you are. If your an investor for the long haul, the best thing you can do is buy a certain amount on a set schedule DCA=Dollar Cost Average) no matter the price and that’s it.  You will average out the swings that way and it tempers your emotions along the way.

If you are looking to store your Bitcoin for the long haul and expect to transact with it regularly, you can just use a paper wallet. There are plenty of resources online to generate a paper wallet. I’d start by familiarizing yourself with the difference between a paper wallet and a hardware wallet. You can watch many vids on YouTube that will explain it, then either learn more about how to create a paper wallet (again, lots of resources online on how paper wallet generators work) and/or get a hardware wallet. 
All a wallet is in the end, is a Public Address and a Private Key. When you have coins on Coinbase, you don’t have access to the Private Key and therefore you don’t really own them. You are trusting them as a third party.

Ok, but still, THEY aren’t accepting BITCOIN, Gemini/Flexa accepts Bitcoin, the merchants accept FIAT converted by Flexa:
“However, it should be noted that all of the solutions in including Flexa are reliant on third-party services. This, of course, means that the retailers are not actually accepting bitcoin directly, though it won’t really matter as far as user-experience is concerned.”
Anyway, it’s great exposure and I’m thrilled to see adoption happening, technicalities aside ��

I have to say, for prime time TV, this was actually a decent little segment. They didn’t paint Bitcoin as some criminal drug laundering nerd money Ponzi scheme and actually covered it with a reasonably respectful and legitimate tone.
The worst was the FED lady comparing the safeguards of USD (backed by gov, FDIC insured, etc) which Bitcoin doesn’t have. But they also touched on the immutable and trust-less nature of Bitcoin (which US Banking system doesn’t have). 
I would say, overall, a positive.

@_date: 2019-05-19 21:47:46
Chill tiger stripes, I’m all crypto all day long and have full faith it’s the future. But when people say X accepts Bitcoin, it’s misleading. There is a big difference between accepting Bitcoin for payment vs going through a third party, going through their KYC, depositing crypto to their wallet, paying their fees to then get converted to Fiat on their end for X to accept FIAT. 
Again, great step forward. But there are lots of options where you can do the same thing and they haven’t been getting the same hype and are frankly much more established.
Anyway, have a nice day!

What’s Bitcoin Billy??
So you know how mommy and daddy put a dollar in the bank, then the bank adds one dollar to a list of all the dollars mommy and daddy have on a computer. Then they take mommy and daddy’s dollar and lend out a hundred dollars from mommy and daddy’s dollar to everyone else, then they charge more dollars from everyone who borrowed mommy and daddy’s dollar that magically turned into 100 dollars on their computer. Then when mommy and daddy want their dollar they have to fill out a form and show their identification and tell the bank what mommy and daddy want to do with their dollar and then mommy and daddy can get their dollar out, except by the time they do, the dollar is worth less than when they put it in.
So Billy..
Bitcoin is nothing like that.
