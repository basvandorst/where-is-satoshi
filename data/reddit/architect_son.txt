This is the part of your life that you have to pay extra special attention towards.
Spend none of it. Wait until that 1.2 turns into 100 mil. Not joking. Envision yourself with 100 mil. Now think of how everyone you know is going to change how they look at you with 100 mil.
Do not reveal this yet. Not to your family. Not to your friends. Especially not to your girlfriend.
This is going to feel like the longest secret for a while, but it's going to be necessary. Now here's the real important part.
These are the last few months, possibly year, where you will feel normal. Where family will treat you like family, friends like friends, and your girlfriend will love you just the way you are. Enjoy these last few moments with them just like this, because after that, everything is going to change equally for the better and the worst. What you're holding onto is a key to a brand new room. The new room will be a wonderful one, but not everyone will be going into the new room with you. Not due to lack of love, but due to lack of understanding &amp; surplus of their own financial fears. You must hold your resolve here the most.
This is the test: if you are able to hold onto a secret, hold onto an investment, hold on to the last refuge of your days of innocence for one more month, season, year... then you'll learn how to hold onto your own dedication to your aspirations through the world that will crumble behind you. You must be emotionally and mentally strong enough to be prepared to see the world change so that you may change with it. This means possibly your family, your friends, and the woman you love.
I wish you the best of luck. I wish you prosperity in all aspects in life. I hope you find the strength to hold, &amp; through that strength, discover the resolved ability to let go.

This argument is dependent on goods *provided.*
There are a "Quantity" of goods, then there is a "Quality" of goods, which, determines Value.

**On Free Markets:** Value is based on balancing debt &amp; demand: Products are determined to have value based off of the vendor's investments, *(i.e. labor, research, marketing, distribution)*. When debt is eliminated, theoretically demand should thrive. However, when there is only demand, vendors without the ability to invest due to their being no debt, only demand, do not have the financially ability to invest, &amp; therefor cannot compete in the market. They would need crypto-funds for startup labor, but because the majority of crypto funds is controlled by, yet again, that 1%, funds will be thrusted towards random ventures &amp; not market competition. I'm all for the elimination of debt like back in the Code of Hammurabi days, but the total elimination of debt can only create controlled markets.
**On manufactured supply &amp; demand of Monopolies:** Ever hear of Media manipulation? Ever wonder why so many corporations are so invested into lobbying? Ever wonder why the "Disney Vault" is always "closed"? It isn't the product that controls the supply or demand, it's the control of the trade itself.
When Walmart went into South America to invest farmers towards growing single crops, becoming the sole investor &amp; distributor due to Walmart's, "increasing demand for the food", Walmart made sure that the farmers became dependent upon their commerce alone. A few years later, after the farmer's turnover was completely invested into Walmart, Walmart took the year's harvest &amp; paid nothing for the product. When the farmers couldn't afford the land, Walmart purchased the Land &amp; demanded the farmers resume the work for less than minimum wage. The practice continues &amp; countless international laborers continue to commit suicide over the unethical raping of their land &amp; value. Even still, Walmart "Guarantees" lowest prices, driving up demand, while taking that much more of tax payer money for what it doesn't pay it's workers &amp; steals in off shore accounts. Walmart, due to their practices, have excelled in manufactured supply &amp; demand, thereby creating an effective monopoly through a single vendor.
**On Digital Monarchies:** Bitcoins themselves have become an example of a single emotional consciousness which exemplifies itself as the ultimate form of currency. There is no united vision &amp; never will be due to the erratic state of anonymous trading, &amp; will continue to operate on a basis of supremacy over all nations economies, regardless of methods or intentions: Bitcoins themselves has become the Monarchy. 
People, for as invested, have no control over the system, &amp; are therefor complete victims to Bitcoin's Rules &amp; Rule.

In order for a Market to be Free, traders need equal value for supply &amp; demand.
When Supply &amp; Demand is controlled by a single vendor, that's a monopoly.
When that monopoly doesn't owe to any other distributors or laborers because it controls the value of trade itself, that's a monarchy.
When a Monarchy doesn't reveal trade to the public, hoarding insurmountable wealth with completely unrestricted &amp; invisible transactions towards any commerce, *be they material goods or ideological beliefs*, that's Totalitarianism.
CAPITALISM is simply the banner they choose to wave while fucking you in the ass with a Dictatorship.

An Artist creates knowing that once he has given birth to a concept, that it no longer belongs to him.
Satoshi Nakamoto will provide no answers that could ever stop his own creation. It's too late for that. Now that the potential is unleashed, understanding intention will do nothing to stop the growth. The two events that will occur, however, is a better understanding of the origins of the creation which may provide clues towards destabilizing each transaction, or get a current understanding as to how Satoshi personally feels about his creation &amp; empathetically affect the market. Last, it could potentially reveal that Satoshi is not just one individual: Possibility &amp; probability do not make for evidence but should not be excluded as conspiracy.
I make no campaigns. I've set up no grand rallies, as I am aware only the community can stop themselves from their fate. Most likely, the majority of Bitcoin users will not understand the ramifications of their actions until their own currency is gone, &amp; this is a story told too often in our history. I'm one person stating one observation, hoping that it resonates enough truth to awaken the people who have a better ability of stopping the devastation before it occurs.
I have no illusions that I will most likely fail, but I'd be damned if I didn't try.
The evidence is the invisible currency itself. That there is record of Goldman Sach and Meryl Lynch are already trading heavily is the icing on the damn cake. It's up to you to understand or dismiss the evidence. I can do nothing but watch the world burn.

@_date: 2013-05-23 00:54:10
The fuck was that?
I said "your analysis", not regurgitating quotes from your bible &amp; hoping the stink sticks.
I stated that invisible distribution would create invisible economic monarchies. This would eliminate the tradition definition of "Money", and "Man", rendering Ayn Rand's pontification utterly useless in the face of the Dictatorship.
*-"Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold..."*
She places value in a commodity, whereas Bitcoins have no tangible commodity or tangible history.
*-"Have you ever looked for the root of production?"*
Bitcoins will certainly aid to certain ends of production, but without acknowledging an eco-system, the means of production can absolutely be exploited beyond any reasonable measure, as there is no way to hold anyone accountable for halting the production, as there would be no money trail.
*-"An honest man is one who knows that he can’t consume more than he has produced"*
We do not live in the era of honest men, &amp; Bitcoin's rise is due to that very reality.
I would actually enjoy breaking down random quotes to the bones, but that would only serve to please me &amp; doesn't serve to aid you in your observation.
Please, educate me. Attempt to frame the realities which elude me. Frame the Ayn Rand ideals of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:02:24
You reiterated a quote that I made in the original post from a different article &amp; attempted to frame a polar possibility.
"Major financial firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have reportedly **been visiting online Bitcoin exchanges as often as 30 times a day**, but have refused to comment about whether they are holding the currency."
"Workers at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in London and New York have **been visiting online Bitcoin exchanges as often as 30 times a day**, according to documents seen by Reuters."
We have the same facts &amp; attempted to frame different possibilities. You mocked my possibilities &amp; framed your own as more credible possibilities than my own, even though the facts reveal over 200 transactions a week. I ignore nothing, &amp; have stated my evidence. You have mocked my evidence &amp; provided your possibilities as counter arguments, rather than addressing my arguments directly &amp; *THEN* presenting counter arguments.
I would welcome discuss the rational for possible research on the end of Goldman Sach or Merrill Lynch, I would even go as far to suggest that the IT guys are not addressing to their employers why a site is being heavily visited by individual employees on such a consistent basis, but since you have provided nothing towards discussion &amp; sought to debase an argument rather than discuss, then we have no more ideas to share.
Good luck.

I speak to the probable. Theoretically, Bitcoins exist outside any insider trading laws, &amp; could be exploiting the market as we speak.
Let's suggest that there is a firm in the Silicon Valley that is working on internal processors, but their stocks haven't been doing so well. A trader could, potentially, invisibly transfer a couple hundred thousand to the company, resulting in a faster completion date &amp; creating a rise in investor trust which would hike the stock &amp; in turn give a massive bonus to the trader.
A good trader does not go for the quick buck. They go for the kill. Seriously, often 30 times a day, over 200 transactions a week. This is not a quick buck.

Find [Satoshi Nakamoto.]( Reveal the person or group behind the currency, &amp; reveal the intention of the creation.
The other alternative is to halt all legitimized trade of Bitcoin-to-Nation currency as it incentivises diminishing the value of each Nation's currency with each transaction; It is no secret that the popularization of Bitcoins is the political escape from corrupt institutions attached to our governments, but all this will create is corrupt institutions attached to no authorities at all. When Nation's realize the threat that Bitcoins possess, they will react in either one of two ways. One, join in on the fun &amp; fuck over their citizens in a royal way, or two, illegalize the trade &amp; punish anyone that they can capture when it is too little too late, hurting innocent individuals who are using Bitcoins as a means to an end &amp; not the corrupt institutions who are really harming the economy ecology at large for private incentives. Before it comes to such drastic conclusions, countries &amp; corporations alike need to understand the danger in it's potential &amp; not allow the transactions. In order to halt trade, governments &amp; corporations need to be taught in a big way and fast. In this case, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
How could 'you' personally stop Bitcoins from growing? You can't. I can't. We are helpless to a concept that will take one form of code or another. We are all helpless to the overwhelming realities of greed &amp; exploiting means. All we can do is attempt to educate individuals as to the potential of Bitcoins &amp; let individuals decide for themselves the possibilities or the danger. I've seen wonderful organizations helping so many these past few months, but it wasn't until I saw Goldman Sach jump in on the party did I realize the impending danger just around the corner.
Please think of the possible outcomes &amp; educate others of it's existence.
