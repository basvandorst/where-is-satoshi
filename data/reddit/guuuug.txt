Your idea is super easy to hack. First of all, only first 4 letters are required to store the words. The words come from a very specificly chosen wordlist. The words also contain a checksum. Don’t think you can outsmart a hacker by obfuscating your seed. You will either break security or lose your money. You will not improve your security this way. Use the method that experts in security have been perfecting for years. Your method of obfuscation is honestly absolutely useless. I’m informed about how seeds work and I could break your method by hand.

Have a leader. Lol this guy. Should we also have gold backing btc up? And we should use a centralized system so tx will be faster, right.... 
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:45:16
I know what the issue is. Your seed is fine. It’s just a bit outdated. Ledger is very specific and requires the seed to have checksum words. Which is awesome. But your seed was generated with a wallet that doesn’t use these newer standards.
Try electrum and also try setting the bip39 switch

@_date: 2018-01-01 15:44:44
Isn’t it ironic. When the citizens choose a money voluntarily that works way better for them, that governments will then crush it. It’s like everybody voting with their money. We’re supposed to think governments work for us. But actually we have no right to choose a fair money system that actually brings us prosperity and innovation.
What does that say about what the population is to the government.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:29:37
You need to understand that the price of bitcoin comes from the market. But you bought through the convenience service coinify where they are the sole marketmaker. While blockchain.info get’s their price from large exchanges, coinify sells you from their own supply and they set the price. When you sell to coinify you’ll get even less back. Don’t buy and sell on convenience services anymore. Go look at an exchange in the orderbook. That’s where you’ll want to buy and sell.
And next time, compare the value of the amount btc you’ll receive with the price on different exchanges to see wether your getting a good deal.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:45:11

Ledger nano s had more features than ledger blue. I have a blue and i hate how useless it is compared to the ledger nano s.
The bitfi wallet is a brainwallet on a cheap stripped down phone platform. It forces you to connect to it over wifi and it communicates with multiple third-party servers. I doesn’t compare to the blue.

It's easy to blame weed for the people being bums. People can be bored out of their mind without weed. Actually, weed makes you accept a boring situation. And when I work on difficult problems smoking weed helps me accept that I'll be working on the same subject for weeks at a time.
The problem is not that a person uses a substance. The problem is that that person doesn't have any impulse to work on something productive from them selves.
Weed is not the problem. It doesn't take the drive in live away. People use weed to fill the void and they'd use anything for that. They have no drive, which is the problem in the first place.
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:50:21
Check the third spike. 0.06 btc made it spike because there weren't any new orders yet. You could instantly see the order book going wild with everyone place grid orders.

Start by investing your time into reading about it. Don't just throw your money at it trying to get rich.

You are incorrect. Satoshi may have started mining first, but he had publicly announced he would start when the software would be available for everyone. Don't confuse "premined" with just people who mined more than others because they were first.

Coinprism does everything I need right now and bitcoin has the largest marketcap. If I have to choose right now between tools that need to still work years later, using the bitcoin blockchain felt like the best bet. But I bet it won't be a problem to use any of them alongside eachother later on.

In my opinion you get better price if you let the market come to you. Many exchanges have maker taker fees. You pay a price for being in a hurry, which is what market-makers are profitting on. But of course to each his own.

Don’t buy bitcoin to get rich quick. Buy it to understand how it makes you souvereign and to understand how it gives you more freedom.
If you think you missed out, that is a sign you haven’t done your homework on what bitcoin is and why it works the way it works.
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:16:28
Start doing actual research on what bitcoin is. Educate yourself instead of coming and asking for ways to make free money. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme.

I've had similar experience, silly enough.
Companies who hold this kind of documents should take the initiative to embed a javascript watermarking tool within the webpage. The image should get watermarked clearly in front of the user before upload.

You mistakenly think I want more bankers to go to jail. On the contrary. I’m trying to point out the system is hypocritical. Seems like you’re saying all is fine, just accept all the annoyences, it’s part of an important system. Well *** that, I love that a new system is being build from scratch with the little guy in mind. And the issues with banking that we discuss on reddit are real people issues. Where I am saying, let do this better in a new system, you’re saying it’s all fine stop nagging already.
And watchdog upon watchdog upon watchdog upon watchdog doens’t sound that safe nor efficient to me at all. HSBC went on for years. Quadruple layers of watchdogs did what? It was a whistleblower who added the light to this case.

2 trillion dollars is laundered every year. This requires banks to be involved. Clearly it’s not working. It’s mainly an annoyance and sometimes devastating issue for normal citizens. And guess what else... the actual crimes have not been prevented. Banking regulations don’t stop drug dealers from selling drugs or stop terrorists from attacking targets. It mainly cripples the value network for every participant. Everyone loses in the end.

How much impact did the fine on hsbc have on the profit numbers from their money laundering. The amount of the fine was a joke. And nobody went to jail. Meantime the rest of the law-abiding citizens can’t even move 10K around.

Low liquidity. Look at the orderbooks using a programme like bookmap. You’ll see gaps where not a lot of orders are. Price will move through it very fast until it reaches a large orderblock.

Those islandic bankers where not jailed for laundering money. Iceland was literally the only country jailing bankers, but it was for crimes related to the crash. Bad example.
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:40:06
Thanks. I'll look into libbitcoin. At a first glance it looks like what I need.
The blockchain api is of course easy to use, but I don't want my service to be dependant on third-party api's or at least to minimise their use.
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:54:01
Wait, so they didn’t have a special deposit window for briefcases full of money like the news-outlets mentioned? The fine was about one month of profits.

You got a link?

They we’re jailed because of ghe economic crash in 2008, and they’re the only jailed bankers. What’s your point. Harshest AML laws are US laws. This example proves my point more than yours.

@_date: 2018-07-28 19:31:43
Stop with the iceland example already. People where protesting in the streets of that small island. The people who protested on wallstreet for the same where laughed at from the balconies. Iceland is the only friggin country with some balls to actually do something. Really, just stop about iceland. I don’t understand why you think it’s a good example. Friggin banks are corrupt as *** and you point to iceland like you’re saying: “see, bankers do go to jail when proof is undeniable”. Just because US judges don’t jail bankers doesn’t mean their not guilty. The US justice system is a joke. Don’t even ask me for examples, because that’ll escalate this whole discussion even more. Store all your wealth at the bank for all i care, have fun with it.
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:17:47
Why do they need to follow regulations and rules? They whitewash criminal money all the time and no-one goes to jail for that.
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:33:50
i’m not saying the dollar is broken because banks are corrupt, am I.
And centralizes exchanges are broken actually when they get hacked. But we’re building decentralized exchanges instead of denying anything is wrong.
You’ll always defend the AML system, because you’re part of it. You are part of the elements that make up this gatekeeper of the peoples value network. I’m glad we have cryptocurrencies finally, so I can choose a value-network that fits with my own opinion instead of yours. I like the permissionless, borderless, censorless spending of my money.

The system definitely is broken. That is why an alternative is being spawned. It’s being created out of necessity. Because the ‘gatekeepers’ are creating a shitshow out of it, which is not going to improve from within.
The law says it’s crime and it’s a crime because the law says so. That wheel can spin forever wether it’s morally right or not. The law apperantly states that users are guilty for ML as soon as &gt;10K is being moved. In cash or by bank. Oh no wait, the money is guilty. Dude, how can you even take this system so serious?
I’m done. Have fun working in finance and defending these ridiculous rules in your spare time.
Btw. Did you know for a long time AML rules where circumvented the same way spammers are abusing twitter? Simply replacing a few chars was enough to game the AML system for years. Lol, not broken at all.

No experience with green address but i think you just need the mnemonic to create a private to sign a transaction with
@_date: 2016-10-08 19:52:10
If you hash the original it might be possible to proof it existed before the modified version. But i don't think you could prove the first available hash would be untampered. Let's take police camera's for example: you'd probably want some proof of existence on a blockchain before someone malicous would tamper with the camera or perhaps erase it. If the hash exists, at least you'd know a file exists and if it resurfaces you'd be able to hash it. Your idea is valid and definitely has a future but I don't think we have all the requirements yet.

Watermarking the video would modify the data and the video would get compressed again. Which would result in more compression artefacts.

I don't think you need the greenaddress software to be accessible to spend the bitcoin. Take a look at bitaddress.org. You need to create the private key offline on your own machine. The 2fa is mostly to secure the encrypted copy of your private key that greenaddress is hosting.

@_date: 2018-07-28 19:17:10
Yeah so citizens get robbed of their freedom for small amounts of money. When banks are involved with money laundering of huge amounts themselves it’s only gross negligence. Like I said, security theatre. Meanwhile the actual crimes are not prevented. This system has become a joke. Have fun with it. There’s a good reason crypto is interesting for a lot of people. It’s to gain their freedom back.
Since you mention you have experience, i can see why you defend it. It’s your bread and butter.

I was thinking a certain party might spam the mempool to prevent transactions from reaching the attackers address before the cryptolocker's timeout. Thus victims would be out of money and out of decrypted files. There would be a hate against the attackers and against bitcoin from that point on.
