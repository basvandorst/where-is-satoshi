The Chinese are going to bring the BTC value to $500+ in 2-3 months, I swear.

EMA 10/21 with 0.25% threashold. Pure math.
+800% in 4 weeks.
I keep it going.

My impression is the BTC market follows no market rules of the traditional stock market.
You can make great money on the volatility by using EMA (exponential moving average) trading though.
My EMA calculations predict an upward trend this afternoon (EU time). BUY BUY BUY

I think you should buy it now.

Buy BTC on MtGox or so.
Sell small amounts (0.003 BTC) on ebay.
Huge profit margin.

Kraken is rubbish, stuck on $100.45 since yesterday. 
Completely unusable at the moment.
Furthermore, no info on who operates it, no company address. I suspect a big scam.

You got scammed. Fee is 0.0005BTC.

130 on Monday, I swear.
Now is good time to buy cheap.
