Given how low the value of BTC was back then, do you think this was basically just some “loose change” you had leftover from a transaction?

By default, or it's literally the only option?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:46
I think it might, gonna see a flood from bch to btc

Cryptocurrencies are not regulated and therefore it's not illegal to trade on inside information

Ya, and of course it immediately crashed again

Cool, thanks

This came to mind as being some sort of ancient form of crypto currency 
"The monetary system of Yap relies on an oral history of ownership. Because these stones are too large to move, buying an item with one simply involves agreeing that the ownership has changed. As long as the transaction is recorded in the oral history, it will now be owned by the person it is passed on to and no physical movement of the stone is required."

Well...guess I wasn't the first to make that connection! Thanks for sharing

But for a futures contract the purchaser does have the option to demand "physical" delivery (i.e. settlement in bitcoin rather than cash) at their discretion, right? Is that something likely to happen and what effect might it have?

Is that when bch trading is going live again on Coinbase? Have they announced when it is?

Could this sale on its own caused the huge drop from about $19k to $15k this morning? Both occurred around the same time

Hmm alcohol aside you'd be hard pressed to find a restaurant more expensive than about $500 a person per meal. Also not counting novelty things like $10,000 hamburgers with gold flakes in Vegas and stupid shit like that.

Haha nice to see this post made it here!
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:51:41
I thought about posting it when I first made it  but didn't think it'd be appreciated here lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:59:34
Do any of the exchanges allow naked short selling? That'd be insane.

I still think it's a bubble but clearly remember having this same convo at every milestone 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:02:56
Not mad at all, thanks for posting it :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:11:38
Haha it was really just about how the skyrocketing price is testing my conviction that it's a bubble. Wasn't really meant to be for or against.

This brings back good memories :’)
