Everyone knows BitGo wasn't hacked. However, what good is BitGo if they're going to sign any transaction without verification just because Bitfinex signed that transaction. They literally had one job and fucked it up for $70 million.

Avoid Bitcoin Core as a beginner (and as a Windows user). Many people starting out are directed to Core b/c that's what bitcoin.org says, but there have been numerous cases of newcomers having difficulty with it. Core takes over 70 GB of data b/c you download the entire blockchain, and that synchronization process could take a long time. 
Use Electrum on your computer and BreadWallet (iOS) or Mycelium (Android) for mobile. Don't forget to write down your seed and keep it safe. Also, be sure you're downloading the correct app as there have been recent scam apps on the app store.

Unfortunately, it is situations like these which have led me to discontinue promoting bitcoin to friends and family.

They are a bitcoin bank. I think they are good to have for bitcoin beginners but their entire business is against the bitcoin philosophy of 'free money'.

Trezor has a PIN display appear on the machine you're using. On the machine, each number is blanked out and on the Trezor the numbers are displayed. After the PIN, you can also set a passphrase so essentially 2FA incase of theft. And of course, there's a seed that can recover keys if device is lost.

It's up if the network, in general, is operating (i.e. blocks being mined w/ transactions). If a given user's transaction isn't being included in blocks, it's not the network's fault. It's the user's responsibility to include a proper fee. Free market during peak times =&gt; higher fees.

If any of his coins move, that means there are an additional 1 million+ coins in the market. Surely you understand the basic concept of supply and demand. Most holders would sell their coins asap.
And on a higher-level, if the creator of bitcoin cashes out, what's that say regarding his faith in the future of the currency? If Satoshi is still alive/has access to his keys, he knows he must be never move his coins nor reveal himself for the better of Bitcoin.

I'm completely against Coinbase's business philosophy. Coinbase goes against Bitcoin's whitepaper completely. Just a bank for a bitcoin and the entire idea of Bitcoin is that people don't require banks. Having bitcoin in Coinbase is no different than fiat in your bank account.
With that said, I think they make a slightly positive impact in that they're a good stepping stone for beginners. However, they should focus on helping beginners more so than being a lifetime custodian.

It's pretty straightforward that both Coinbase and Circle are bitcoin banks. If a traditional bank discovers the money in your account is used for drugs, then they can seize your money. 
CB/Circle should only be used to purchase bitcoin. Never to store it.

Assuming you're in the states, but you never specified. Send the BTC to a different service like Coinbase or Circle, then cash out. Just don't leave your coins in there.

Potentially, but be prepared to pay quite a premium rate. It's not worth the seller physically going out to trade for a $40 trade. If you buy $25-40 of BTC, I'd guess you might be paying upwards of $50-60.

There's a few Coinbase customer service reps on reddit (Rosey, Michael). I think they mainly post for PR reasons but I use Circle instead of CB as of 6 months ago. I didn't have a negative experience with CB, but by the frequency of negative posts, I wasn't gonna wait around to have a negative experience myself.

Maybe in the distant future for smart contracts, but it's not totally necessary as far as forfeiting total control. It's possible to create individual wallets so people can use their money how they please; permissionless. With standard deposit systems, someone would have to wait "x business days" to process a withdrawal, whereas bitcoin would be instant and eliminates the process screening.
@_date: 2015-11-24 18:18:17
Those increments are horrendous. From .1 to 2.5? Get the user to try it out with .1 and it works, then they'll do 2.5 and that's where the scam occurs. Wouldn't trust this off the bat.

Many outside the U.S. don't realize most of the world uses prepaid phones and they buy credits to "top off" their phones.

There are ways to use bitcoin without the volatility. People need to stop thinking about its fluctuating price and more about its real application. As an ex-poker player, do you enjoy a deposit-system where you must forfeit control of your money to use their service? Bitcoin eliminates that and THAT is why bitcoin can seriously disrupt this industry.

Coinbase/Circle sell btc for credit card. Just be prepared to supply a lot of info so they can protect themselves from fraud. Also, be aware of the fees incurred. There will be a base fee (CB/Circle fee), and they may charge it as a cash-advance (additional fee on your card). You might pay up to 10% in total fees buying with credit card.

2012 didn't show much movement for about 2 months. Halfed Nov 2012 at $12 then it skied for the next 3 months before peaking at $230 (19x increase) and leveling out. Stayed around 90-120 range for 6-7 months before the ATH peak of Nov 2013.
I'm not assuming the exact same thing will happen for the 2016 halving especially since Bitcoin is much more popular/mainstream than it was in 2012, but it's not unfair to compare historical price flows and see similarities. Personally, I think we'll see a 3-5x increase in the next 6 months. Hodl my friends.
