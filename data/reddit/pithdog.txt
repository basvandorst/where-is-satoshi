I transitioned over to 20+ character LastPass type system months ago for important things. I didn’t really use reddit until a few months ago, just lurked a bit here and there. 2FA and biometric auth will solve this issue for most people who aren’t as technically inclined to use lastpass, or those who just can’t care about security.

I only got into crypto recently. I think it is definitely from a password database leak in the past few years. I should look myself up on some of those and see what is there.

Also I had super strong generic passwords before I used lastpass, typically getting stronger the older I got. Given my Reddit accounts age, I was still using a very old not secure generic password.

I have now reported it to Reddit security, thanks for the suggestion.

Yeah it’s in 3-4, have been updating passwords all afternoon to secure ones :) thanks though.

Well it was a very old password and very basic. No capitals, no numbers, no symbols, and it was a dictionary word. So they could have bruteforced that very easily.
Or, since it is so old it could have been listed on several hacked password databases (yahoo hack, linkedin hack, etc) and just copy and pasted.

wow the difference between coinspot and BTC Markets is getting quite large. BTC Markets just hit $13,000 AUD.

I just read that it is in beta and only activated for moderators. I technically am a moderator for a subreddit no one has ever followed, which is why I have the option.

Under 'password/email' in preferences. You need to have a verified email to enable 2fa (I didn't have a verified email when I was hacked).

BTC Markets says it is a gold certification, maybe that is the part they are talking about re: first exchange?
