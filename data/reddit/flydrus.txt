I second your question. I don't see the irony either

Classic Bitfenix huh...

That sounds pretty interesting. I am somewhat technically incompetent so I wouldnt be able to do much indepth analysis on github updates. I think i would be able to do some presentations on presentations and whatnot.
Thanks for the response. Really means a lot!

Ah I was unaware of that. I didn't realize that the physical coins actually had any BTC value.

It was most likely the electrum pro wallet, which is a malicious copy of the real electrum wallet. The OG electrum team found that any keys put into the fake wallet would be uploaded to servers which would steal cryptos from the wallet.

Many think that Tether pumps BTC
@_date: 2018-05-10 18:12:50
That is actually insane. I didn't think that they would actually make a bit of a teaser like. What was the comic?
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:48:10
Although it may not be the best I think its a good way for people to get exposed to crypto.

This comment got me pretty good. �� There are so many exotic cars in Vancouver, it is insane.

If its mint condition, there is probably some collectable value for it. No btc value of course but it looks a lot higher quality than the other phyiscal btc coins out there. Maybe do an auction on ebay?
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:34:53
Yea I think its pretty effective.

It is hard to tell exactly how many coins have been lost. 
There may just be long term HODLers who have held their positions since the early Bitcoin years and have made no movements with their holdings since. It is assumed that at least a few hundred thousands of the coins have been lost  through Satoshi's wallets. I would assume that at least 3 million Bitcoins are lost forever. But that's just me.

I am actually unaware of many newsletters other than Coinrecap and Cryptoweekly. But from what I have seen, I think the biggest thing that would set my idea apart from other newsletters is the media and coin/project of the day segments. I have not seen any other newsletters who do this. 
The problem with coinrecap is that they only give prices on a daily schedule but no news.
Cryptoweekly does give news and prices and whatnot but does it on a weekly schedule. This lapse between newsletters may not be enough to keep up with the most latest information and news. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:23:16
That is all right. Would you ever be interested in a crypto newsletter \(What would it need to have etc...\)?

500k can let you live nicely for at least 5-7 years if you spend wisely.

There has been a lot of news about the mobile wallets and the more consumer\-friendly lightning apps coming out recently. I think that by the end of 201\`8, we will have a few lightning wallets which are available to millions of people while still being easy to use. 
From my perspective, the future looks bright for lightning. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 04:44:28
Yes it is.

Haha. I was there a few months ago. Used the atm and got some eth for myself.

The whole market doesn't move linearally together, some small caps may 10x if the overall market cap doubles. Honestly, (depending on where you live of course) I think a 450k profit is enough to change the lives of some. 
Its not just about the profits as well, sometimes it's more about the idea of cryptocurrencies, something world changing.

How much did you pay for them? Obviously not bitcoins but a great collectible for sure
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:10:40
GOOD WORK MAN! 
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:37:53
Maybe a combination of both would be abgood way to mix the best of all worlds. Pushbullet could be a way in which people can get the latest news (3 news pieces a day)? Then the newsletter could be more indepth analysis etc..? 
Do you think that would work?
I was also thinking of starting a telegram group for more indepth discussion 
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:54:07
I heard about it in 2012 as a way to trade things online. I didnt have much of a clue what exactly it was along with the technology behind Bitcoin until a few years back (2015?). I ended up finally buying in during the 2015-2016 but I spent it all during the same years. Been hodling (unironically using the term) since 2017.

You sir have my comment of the day award.

Local Bitcoins is a great way to cash out. Find a reliable buyer with a lot of positive reviews/sentiment and use that. 
ATMs are another great way if you don't want to go through the trouble of finding a buyer. However, they usually take at least 3\-5&amp; in fees when you sell.
