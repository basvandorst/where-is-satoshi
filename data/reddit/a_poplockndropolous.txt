I don't give a fuck about Warren. She can go to hell for all I care. What I do care about is the FCC [subverting democracy and lying to the American people]( and the White House/congress that are responsible/enabling it.

[Missed it, Forbes writer]( We obviously can't trust this writer to deliver a well informed article if they can't even properly interpret a simple quote. Toomey wasn't referring to recently falling crypto prices, he was referring to consistent inflation that all central banked fiat currencies are subject to. I really want to slap this guy's editor. Don't read Forbes as it is obviously newsrag trash now.
I'd also like to say that Toomey is Republican scum that consistently votes in line with the fascists in power. Americans: get out and vote this fall.

Have you tried classical psychedelics like mushrooms or LSD? Might not work for everyone but they cured my depression and anxiety. Not existing for a little while helps once you start existing again. I've found that chronic medications always rubber band from tolerance. But I took shrooms and acid a handful of times, and it changed my brain chemistry permanently.
Oh, and no doctor will tell you this since big pharma says psychs are taboo

It's funny, because I was considering posting how their exchange was top class. I used them to dump my bgold. UI lags a bit (no surprise with massive growth in this space), but deposits and withdrawals were quick and painless.
Sounds like FUD, but as always be cautious out there. People are people, and mods can be retards. This does reflect poorly on the exchange, but I had no problems swapping in and out.

That's a pretty fucked up thing to do OP. Now go sit in the corner and think about what you've done.

That fee is 3k satoshi. Not 50k. A bit misleading in the context of this thread.

You realize that if you manipulate the tx's, the block hashes change? This is fundamental. Nice try though, and the other guy was being a hilarious douche. Very entertaining. Kudos to you both.
