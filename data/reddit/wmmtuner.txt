Going online for advice never really helps anyone.. BUT! I did turn to it for advice and there are some really nice people around so I thought coming across this I owe something back.
What a lot of people say on here is true, please make sure you know why you're getting into Bitcoin. There's a reason why you're here- Make sure you understand it. 
Because I can guarantee you one thing, when you see the price drop- your emotions will get the better of you until you can realize where your mindset should actually be at (believing in the technology)
I held during the dip to sub $1.9k - Why? Because of my partner... Who reminded me why I got into crpto in the first place.
It's one to decide you're in, just make sure when you decide you're out its for the right reasons. Not the wrong ones!
Edit: As for how much to invest? I was told and I'm sure a lot of people here agree that you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. Which seems counter intuitive because the reason you're wanting to invest is for some sort of gain. Be smart- Don't go homeless, but where theres risk there is also chance for reward.
Good luck! At the time of writing this, we've hit ignition on an all time high!
