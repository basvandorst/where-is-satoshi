Here is (yet another) thread discussing BIP70:
PKI is dangerous, every cryptographer in the world would tell you that, and Bitcoin should never ever use any kind centralized service.

who says you can't eat with bitcoin? 
just thinking about the fact that first someone had to create a new block finding a solution to special sha256 / ecdsa hashes of a hash tree, and then someone else sold these on an exchange for USD, and then we bought them, and finally we transferred these to a local producer here in BA, its fucking crazy...cryptomeals are awesome!

A few days ago, someone posted about this farm in Buenos Aires  here on reddit. We ordered the veggie basket and some honey, and it was just delivered a few minutes ago. We were a bit scared that it might be a scam because there weren't any comments yet, but everything is beautiful, really fresh, and the delivery guy was great. 
This is our second bitcoin purchase. Feels good!

We live in Buenos Aires. It cost ~0.125 btc for the basket, plus 0.023 for the honey. We are super happy because its not so easy to find such fresh organic vegetables around here.

they deliver to all of capital- different parts on different days. Didn't try the jams this time, but will definitely do so in the future. The honey is bomb.
