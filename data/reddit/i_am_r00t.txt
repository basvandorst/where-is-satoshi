Honest question... Why is 'bcash' inflammatory?

You will never mine any BTC with CPU or GPU these days. Check out other coins that are still profitable on GPU.

Is there a technical discussion of how this guy managed to catch this? It seems like he is monitoring for weak 'R values' but how does he determine those addresses are weak and watch for them?
Edit: Found this blog post which basically describes what I was asking

I don't get it. Canada is not 'seizing' anyone's bank account. From the [FAQ](




You can go here if you want to search to see if you have any unclaimed funds. 
The process to claim the money is straight forward and very easy as well. 
I also believe that BitCoin is the way of the future and in many ways is better than traditional banking but the title of your post is just FUD.

Again, I don't get it. 


You seem to be under the impression that "bail-in" means that the bank would be using depositors’ money in the event of a crisis. As your link states this is not even the case. 
I don't know what agenda you are trying to push here but you are going about it the wrong way. 
Also, the Bank of Canada (which holds the funds you are talking about in the original article) is not a bank that consumers can use. It is Canada's central bank. The dormant account funds are transferred from commercial banks to the BoC after 10 years.

How did you get that IP address? Anyway, it's registered to leaseweb which is a large hosting provider and they will not give you any customer information unless there is a court order. 
Second, do you have a blockchain link for the transaction?
Also, where is the username Captain_Cook15 from? That's not a reddit user. 
While I don't doubt you lost money, there is absolutely no proof put forward by you other than a screen shot of some app (no link) and an IP address (who knows how you determined that IP was tied into this)

When running a full node you should take the same precautions as if you were running any other publicly available service (ie webserver) 
Use a firewall and limit incoming connections from the Internet to only the port that bitcoind listens on. 
Do not run the daemon under a user with elevated permissions (ie root) 
Keep the daemon software up to date. 
Do not use your full node as a wallet. 
Ideally you'd run your full node on a virtual machine if you can't dedicate hardware to it. 
Also if you are running a service that is publicly available best practice States that your LAN is segregated through the use of a DMZ zone. 
Assuming the above steps are taken and implemented properly you are limiting the attack vector on your node to the bitcoind daemon which is running as a non privileged user and is separate from your other network / software. As long as there no vulnerabilities discovered within bitcoind itself you should be pretty safe.

Let's just say I'm a bad guy and I want to steal Bitcoins. 
I could try the brute force method of spreading viruses and hopefully stealing wallet.dat files from my victim's computers. The problem with this approach is that Bitcoin is still fairly rare among the masses and the average Bitcoin user is (slightly imo) more security conscious than the average computer user.  The chances of this method being successful is much lower than a targeted attack.
Now if I were to perform a targeted attack I would need to narrow down my list of potential victims. Running a bitcoin node makes your IP address visible to others on the Bitcoin network and in the context of this conversation that is a potential threat.
If you are running other services on the same computer that listens for incoming connections you are vulnerable to other vectors of attack which could then lead to your wallet being stolen. 
Remember, the only way to make sure you are 100% secure is to not be connected to the internet. This is why people make a big deal about generating wallets and storing BTC offline.

Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, et al are [doing this right now.]( It is much easier than you seem to think. 
You know all those social badges (Like this, tweet buttons, etc) that you see on every website? Those badges allow the site they belong to to place cookies on your computer and track your browsing activity across whatever sites also contain badges for those sites. Logged into Facebook and you go to PornHub? ("Who clicks 'like this' on a porn site?!" is what everyone always asks.) Facebook now knows that you enjoy looking at big tits and they have your real name and all your friends names and the church groups you belong to and all of your hobbies and interests and...
Logged into Facebook and also your throwaway account in which you recall a sordid story from your past? Well, I hope you didn't do anything illegal because if a government agency suspects you of wrong doing they are afforded access to your data. See 
This is just the tip of the iceberg and a very specific and simple example of how to track a user across sites. Techniques are being developed to track a [person's online behavior across a range of devices, including phones, TVs, tablets, and computers.](
**TL;DR - Unless you take very specific steps there is no privacy on the Internet. Your data is $$$ and there are a lot of very smart and motivated people working hard to make sure that there are new ways to gather as much data about you as possible.**
