As far as i know, i’m commenting on reddit, I’m not in parliament. But thanks for the advice for when dealing with politicians! :) 
PS: if you think my argument is a “strawman argument”, i suggest you spend your energy addressing it rather than analyzing my tone and behavior.

How is what i said related to comic book guy? I’m only saying that the USD is not backed by an asset and yet it has value because people (governments) have confidence in the US. If people have confidence in crypto and the technology behind it then it has value. The same non-intrinsic value a USD 100 bill has. Very simple and non-sarcastic concept so not sure what you mean..

It’ 5:18.. anyone has experience watching these committees knows if it’s normal to be late?

See I would be.. I mean how ridiculously blind do Google, Facebook, Youtube (or again google) and Amazon have to be to simply not notice the potential threat they’re facing because of blockchain? 
And if they do, are they just acting like a baby to try and avoid dealing with the issue? Or did the big brains they hire conclude that blockchain is not the solution (which is only possible if they have a better solution i think) to their industries? 
Something weird is going on and i can’t seem to figure it out..

Never mind. It says "in camera", which I guess means "in private" until it turns green to "in progress" which is when we can watch. Please confirm/deny this if you know. Thanks!

Actually, at least 5 suckers are born every minute to whom this might not be obvious.
Around 250 people are born every minute, 2.1% of which on average are below 70 IQ, which is diagnosed as having [“mental retardation”](
I’m sorry I had to do this..
