Lol. I play Hold em and I'm pretty good at it. I see your point.  And no I'm not literally looking to sell at 1st sign of a hard fork. This was more of a way to demonstrate how this would look to the average outsider who is a potential adopter of bitcoin. Or the average casual hodler. 
Yes if you can't spot the sucker at the table, it's probably you. But just as important in poker is being able to fold as soon as you know you can't win.

I forgot i was checking the price of ETH earlier. I can't be the only one who's ever done this. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:35:59
I'm more ranting than anything.  Looking for assurance. But the point remains.  Confidence and stability are needed for mass adoption.

Actually i agree. I look at it like a growing tech startup.

Goddammit Loch Ness Monster!

I realize its different for everyone.  That's what i wanted. I should have asked "Where is the moon for you?". At least i got a laugh in this thread. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 12:10:06
It's OK. All help is appreciated. I'm not a day trader. I'm a hodler. Just looking for possible alternatives to coinbase. 
It's my mistake. I simply should have asked for coinbase alternatives. Kraken is simply the only other exchange i was aware of. I got my circle account suspended early on. Before I really cared about btc. I was playing online poker and was ignorant of the rules against sending to gambling sites. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 11:25:51
Well i did. But i want to buy more. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 13:19:56
Well if ppl must know my rent is low, my bills are paid. I buy $200 worth the end of every month. And it decides to jump some 10% days before I'm set to buy
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:23:30
$1 million though?  Cmon get real. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 03:00:40
True. I forgot.  HODL
@_date: 2016-11-20 00:54:36
I'm disappointed in you guys..... Bidding dollars. I bid 0.005 btc.

@_date: 2016-12-27 07:09:56
You seem to be getting skewed results. It's almost as if you asked a biased group.

Time is a flat circle, not an arrow. 
@_date: 2016-11-06 16:05:50
Im fairly new to Bitcoin.  The r/btc sub appears to be nothing but name calling petulant children. I get no useful information from there. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 18:11:48
You could try a Shift Card. It's a debit card that links to a coinbase account. It automatically debits your coinbase account for the amount and converts it to dollars for wherever you are buying from. Works like a normal VISA card. Its USD as far as they're concerned. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 16:56:49
Yeah. That's the 1st thing my friend says.  "$700 for 1 bitcoin is a lot."  Dealing with smaller denominations may help. Especially when we get to the moon and 1 BTC =1 Bazillion dollars. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:43:24
Obviously this is in light of the IRS' new policies regarding taxing gains on bitcoin. Trying to figure out if its worth going through Kraken. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 03:14:12
Lol yeah early 
@_date: 2016-12-29 13:51:31
I liked the part where he said "hold" 
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:36:36
Obviously I'd love $1 million bitcoin, as would everyone else in this sub.  But $1 trillion market cap is WAY unrealistic.  Screw the moon, that would be a different galaxy 
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:15:01
@_date: 2016-11-04 09:03:35
I started buying beginning of September, so im still good.  But won't say its not nerve wracking. Wish i was buying in may. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:28:08
What's it like having Christmas i in the Summer? 
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:02:11
At this rate, it'll be $900 in 4 hours 
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:36:25
If trump wins I'm buying BTC.  "To the Moon!" 
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:37:40
Circle doesn't sell btc anymore 
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:21:11
That's a scorching take
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:23:59
People use bitcoin in Missouri douche. It's not like we're all fucking cows. You realize the divide in the country isn't so much between states as it is rural/urban. Kansas City has electricity you know. And all of the amenities of a city. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 13:07:23
Cause hes some fag playing revolutionary. Being so hip to release it on Guy Fawkes day. Fake ass ANON fag
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:27:53
This is extremely good for bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-10-08 08:48:53
Get a shift card.  Mine is linked to my coinbase account.  Anywhere that takes visa, you will be able to spend your bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-10-23 00:40:52
Because he can release the info now if he truly has it.  But waiting until 11/5 is just a way of being overly dramatic. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:46:08
No you are
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:37:35
This is extremely bitcoin for our democracy 
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:04:32
Well, that's 100%. But yeah it doesn't really matter. It's all about the growth %.
