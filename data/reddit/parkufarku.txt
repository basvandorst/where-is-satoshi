I think he's not saying we need to drive them out, I think he's just saying there's no need to actively seek diversity for this area. For example, if there's more men than women that's interested in mechanical engineering, that's fine just leave it be, there's no need to actively try to recruit more women to join mechanical engineering, which I agree with.

Is this an elaborately disguised scam? He asks for BTC donations. Even if it's not, I suggest you don't send btc to a stranger over an unverified claim.
It's quite easy to cash out from BTC to fiat, and fiat to a donation.

Lots of money from Ethereum holders also flowing into BCC. Thats what BTC whales get for manipulating ETH / BTC ratio to keep it down. Keep Ethereum oppressed and BCC will takeover BTC

Its undeniable they have more investing experience. However, most of us who have been in crypto world for a while now know how volatile and illogical crypto price movements can be. I've been trading in alt coins and held on their bleeds so to generalize that I have weaker hands isn't necessarily correct. If phrased correctly, I foolishly have stronger hands than them. Which is something I'm not proud of.

@_date: 2017-11-08 15:04:02
it may also go down because people who jumped on the BTC train to get B2X new coin will jump back off, and will expect others to jump off too. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:54:58
Well here's the thing, analysts are saying that the recent surge from 4k+ to 7k was from new institutional investors and mainstream investors - the guys who haven't experienced the wild ride and drop that cryptos can offer. So once decline starts picking up, and then it starts to scare these guys, the drop will be a drastic one.

holy shit. That BTC price would look attractive, but if BTC keeps dropping then people may panic and swap ships to BCH..in which case is the worst case scenario. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:21:00
I am. Thanks for checking my post history. I never said I wasn't one. What does that have to do with this? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:33:18
people from ALTs joined BTC for the B2x "free coin" logic. Now that its not happening, they are jumping back off.

So many people triggered just because they called it Bitcoin Core. lol

Just because they don't have to return it doesn't mean they won't cash out for other reasons (or for personal profits)

Honestly, I don't know how much influence the Russians had on US elections, but I am keeping an open mind on both possibilities (1, they heavily influenced it or 2. the media is exaggerating / making it up)
Either way, I'm not pro-Trump but I do hate the mainstream media for several reasons, they're very selective in what they talk about, and they have a huge influence in what people think. They favor the interests of the corporations and establishment class than the middle class and your average american. 
Honestly I don't trust any news now. Too jaded I guess. I advise anyone reading this to take "news" with a grain of salt. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:34:26
I'm not saying fake but a lot of crap MSM spews is propaganda and biased. There are things they will never talk about (for example, they will never mention how bad / negative it can be on how american taxpayer money goes to israel)
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:27:47
That's why I specifically said I don't use RT for any Russia-related or US-related news
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:45:05
The term 'fake news' really caught on as a meme thanks to Trump using it constantly.
I also think he uses it because it's alot easier to say &amp; remember &amp; catchier than saying "biased propaganda" which MSM is actually full of. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:12:56
Its not fake news but its just heavily biased propaganda 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:01:54
Lol so butthurt. Im not a fan of any crypto except Eth and some alts but BCH and ETH does this better than BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:05:55
Depends on the subject. For example, I would go to independent (British source) for more neutral approach to internal US stuff, although they can still be too accommodating to US things since they are allies. 
Reuters (another British) is also good. If I wanted a more truthful version of North Korea situation, I would perhaps go to Korea Times (South Korean news outlet). Russia Times is good for anything that ISN'T about Trump or Russia election interference or US-based content or Russia news. 
It's quite easy to spot biases in those country-specific news, you just have to weed them out. US based news like New York Times is a lot more difficult to "pull out the bias" because they seem to cater to a lot of transnational corporations and big money

There is a third point u forgot to mention. It allows us new generation to make money by giving us a valid legit investment option and try to even out the playing field with the older generations. They took all the good investment options (real estate price overpriced) and made all the good profits in the early tech sector days while we got scraps, and we're enslaved to them via student loans. This crypto opportunity finally gives us a chance to break out from their chains.

Aug 1st is when the big decision on Btc will be made - there's no guarantee that Btc price will go up on that date. In fact, it's more likely that Btc price will go down on that date and all the Btc holders will jump ship to Eth because, as far as we know, there is no resolution with the Btc conflict and is looking that way...we're less than 2 months away and things are not looking good. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:41:47
Agreed, but we can agree that what's good for BTC is also good for Eth. BTC doesn't have to die for Eth to thrive.

@_date: 2017-06-14 19:54:04
Eth trader here - we're not trying to kill off bitcoin. In fact, we need bitcoin for us to thrive. Bitcoin has just barely gotten mainstream recognition - if Bitcoin crashes now, the mainstream society will never look at alt currency as a viable thing. 
Eth traders are rooting for Bitcoin to do well, as strange as it may sound because we are indirectly competing but still somehow connected to one another. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:31:57
who is coinbase's competitor that I can sign up with? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:19:18
Ethereum is backed by the corporate world and bankers. They hate bitcoin but can't get rid of it, so they'll do the next best thing - use Bitcoin's competition to topple it. Eth is also more traceable and centralized and easier to control. Hence why there's so much support for Eth for corporations and the Eth Corporate Alliance is proof of that. 
I don't know about you but I'm betting on the bankers and corporate elites. They may not have our best intentions in mind but I'll bet on the winning side, not the total rogue coin advocates. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:41:00

@_date: 2017-06-21 02:49:52
If you wanna flip your BTC for Eth, now is the time to do it while BTC is going strong and Eth is weak. When Eth gets even a little momentum, the ratio becomes much worse because small increases matter a lot in terms of ratio
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:47:43
I think thats a far fetched assumption. If BTC dies, so will Alt coins. Even if he cashes out for Alt coins, his profit would be much less than a successful BTCs
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:30:22
Exactly. They either want to destroy it or reap its profits. Anyone who thinks they want otherwise is being naive. Greed or power is always in the minds of these people and it'll be good for us to remember that.

@_date: 2017-06-14 16:11:42
So you sold something that will boost in price in Aug. 1 when all the bitcoiners flock to Eth and you bought something that will drop in price from now until Aug. 1st.
Sound business decision. The time to this is on Aug. 1st, not now. You've just shot yourself in the foot. I only expect Eth price to catch up more to Btc. until Aug
