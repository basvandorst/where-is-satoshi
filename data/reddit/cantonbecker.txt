Hi there. This is my site which has been around for many years and has a great history of trust and transparency:
Like bitaddress.org, the software/service is free. However if you want a turnkey solution for producing super-safe paper wallets without having to mess around with installing a new operating system and such, I sell an [Ubuntu CD]( ($18 with free shipping) that comes with the software pre-installed. All you do is boot to the CD, print wallets, and you're done.
Regarding the passwords, yes definitely use the BIP38 encryption option. Don't worry about using an especially strong password. Just use a simple password that you are 1,000% sure you'll remember years from now.
It's not a bad idea to print a couple copies of each paper wallet, and store them in different locations. E.g. keep a set with a friend/family member/safety deposit box.
PS: [Here's a guide]( on what kind of paper to use, how to make sure your paper wallets don't get dissolved by water, etc.

Transfer all the coins you want to be able to easily and quickly spend (maybe less than $200 worth?) to your phone using Breadwallet or Mycelium. Or buy a Trezor.
For long-term storage of remaining coins, transfer them to a paper wallet. This is my service:  -- which has step by step instructions for doing this safely.

If you're really committed to EASIEST (without losing security), and if you have (1) a computer with an optical drive, and (2) a printer, then I think my Ubuntu CD with the bitcoinpaperwallet.com software pre-installed is pretty darn easy.
You boot to the CD, print some wallets, transfer funds to the wallets, and that's pretty much it.
If you can find a Mycelium Entropy, that would be even easier and presumably just as secure. (I trust those folks completely.) That's a paper wallet generator on a USB device that plugs directly into your printer. Super clever.

If that were the *only* entropic source, someone could argue that this was concerning. But the mouse movement just supplies *additional* entropy to javascript's RandomSource.getRandomValues(). This function was in fact [designed for cryptographic applications]( and as far as I know, has never been shown to have a weakness.
The mouse movements aren't in fact necessary, in my opinion. But they do provide an additional level of security in the unlikely event that someone discovers a weakness in the javascript function 5 years from now.

I think if I wanted to steal a pizza from a pizza joint, I'd probably just write a bad check instead of mounting a technically difficult double spend attack.
If I'm selling pizzas, I'll accept the possibility of an occasional bad check (or double-spend.)

I'm not quite following you. If 48 cores takes 2 million years to crack 'BobSmith1973', then a 10,000 computer bonnet of 48 core machines (unlikely to find) would still take 200 years.
Here's what I know: there are LOTS of examples of people who have lost their BIP38 passwords and are out of luck. As far as I know there are zero example of people who have had their BIP38 passwords targeted by crackers.
My PSA here is that it's much more important to pick a password you can absolutely remember, than something that seems super-secure.

In the case of a superstar like pointbiz though, you can just google for 'pointbiz 63974F5A' and confirm that his signature is all over the place. You're right that you shouldn't trust the website. But it is okay to trust a bunch of different forums, posts going back to 2011, etc.

Hi there. If they were safely made, then your bitcoins are safe.
The only reason to encrypt them is if you are worried that someone who you don't trust could get access to the paper wallets and steal the funds from them. If you are simply treating them the same as you do cash or jewels -- by keeping them somewhere safe -- then no worries.
If you decide you do eventually want to encrypt the wallets, it's possible without moving your funds. I wrote up instructions here:

Loading up the bitaddress.org live website and saving the HTML file doesn't help you if the bitaddress.org website has been compromised, which is the softest target for would-be hackers. That's why the bitaddress page has a direct link to the github in the footer, and why the ZIP file from github is distributed with a .sig file.
The proper way to run a local copy of bitaddress is to download the source from github, and *verify the PGP signature/hash*.
This is the only way you can be sure that you're getting the unmolested code from Pointbiz (the author of bitaddress.)
    gpg --verify --with-fingerprint bitaddress.org.html.sig bitaddress.org.html
    gpg: Signature made Fri Feb 19 18:27:15 2016 MST using RSA key ID 63974F5A
    gpg: Good signature from "pointbiz &lt;pointbiz [unknown]
    gpg:                 aka "ninja &lt;ninja [full]
    Primary key fingerprint: 527B 5C82 B1F6 B2DB 72A0  ECBF 8749 7B91 6397 4F5A
Of course this is pretty nerdy. However at the very least, advise people to download the source from github. I have a lot more confidence that github won't get hacked as compared with the host for bitaddress.org or the DNS for bitaddress.org.

Hi, bitcoinpaperwallet.com author here. As someone else pointed out in this thread, just treat paper wallets as piggy banks. I recommend making a few in different denominations so that they're easier to spend. Say you want to squirrel away 20BTC. I'd make 5 wallets of: 10, 5, 3, 1, 1. This way when you want to spend something, you can sweep practically any amount from 1-20. 
And there's definitely no problem with subsequently adding more BTC to an existing wallet. 
As for testing, just practice with a throw away wallet. Print a wallet, send a very small amount, sweep it to your hot wallet, throw it away. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:00:25
Yes, you've got it right. Checking the signature with GPG is the most important step.

The biggest concern I have is when laminating a folded design such as [mine]( The folding is great because it protects the wallet from snoopy people and light -- but if you laminate a laser printed paper wallet, the areas where toner is folded against toner can melt/fuse.
I have tips on this, and also how to print on special papers that make inkjet prints waterproof here: 
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:01:06


I always recommend that folks balance "what are the chances I will lose this password?" vs. security. Because when it comes to BIP38, a password like 'Bob1973' is totally sufficient:
1: To be cracked, someone has to take your wallet, get the encrypted key, and start brute forcing it, and 
2: Even a simple password like 'Bob1973' would take a fairly big array of computers at least year to brute force. Bob1973 = 26 bits of entropy. That would take a 48 core 2.7 Ghz machine running 24x7 over 21 days to crack. Make it 'BobSmith1973' and it'll take about 2 million years. It's hard to imagine someone going through that kind of effort unless you've got literally millions of $ on your paper wallet.
*Edit: More math*
@_date: 2016-08-12 22:20:42
Yes, that would be relatively safe. People have even posted their BIP38 encrypted wallets to reddit just to show off how unconcerned they are about having their wallets cracked. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:53:58
Well... you could BIP38 encrypt it. Just don't make the password 'tattoo'.

Myself, I've never had a bad experience with blockchain.info wallets. They sure make it easy to sweep a paper wallet and send the balance to coinbase.

A sufficiently good BIP38 password should still be easily memorable. Something like **ajv857Password** would be more than good enough to keep a whole network of supercomputers busy for years. See my [argument for using very simple BIP38 passwords.](

What I hope is that if chip manufacturing / speeds stabilize, then people with *free* electricity the world over will be incentivized to mine, even if it's only running smallish rigs that would just pay for themselves in 24 months. For example, in the USA many cities (states?) have regulations that prevent individuals from selling excess solar energy generated back to the utility -- meaning they're sitting on some amount of absolutely free electricity that would otherwise go to no use.

I wish someone would ask every pundit who promotes "Blockchain" as something separate from Bitcoin, "So, how is what you're proposing any different from having a distributed MySQL database?"
"Blockchain" without the security provided by an unassailable network of miners is just a database waiting to be hacked or manipulated. Isn't it?
Serious question. I can't figure out any model in which "Blockchain" without miners is anything more than a regular old DB.
@_date: 2016-04-26 02:00:40
Believe it or not, this is my recommendation as well. blockchain.info has had some security lapses in the past, but it's not like you're going to run into a problem just by setting up a wallet, sweeping your key, and then sending the funds somewhere else.
For quick and dirty jobs, blockchain.info is great. That's my $.02, having used it for years with zero problems.

From their FAQ, as I understand it, Opendime is a "paper wallet" that has the following features:
* It generates its own private key when you first plug it in. I believe (?) you choose any old file on your computer as a seed (hash) for the random number generator. Not exactly a military grade RNG solution, but I would hope that it's totally sufficient for securing a couple hundred bucks worth of Bitcoin.
* The private key is never exposed to the computer (mounted) until the physical seal is broken.
Compared to every paper wallet solution I've seen out there -- including [my own]( -- I think it's got some unique attractions. For example, this is one of the first times there's been a paper wallet sold that doesn't require that you trust the manufacturer with the private keys (as you would have to when purchasing a Cascicous coin.)
The only weaknesses I see are:
* Users not understanding that the moment you break the seal, you should only plug the device into a trusted computer since the private key will be immediately available as a plaintext file on the file system
* Someone figuring out how to temporarily bypass the breakable seal thingy so that they can reveal the private key. This would allow them to sell a sealed unit with a loaded balance as "cash" and then sweep it later. Would this be difficult? Does the device have a persistent memory so that it can warn users  if the seal is removed and then somehow replaced?
* Someone manufacturing a look-alike device with a compromised RNG. 
I'm only guessing all this from the FAQ. Hopefully the actual developers will clear up anything I've gotten altogether wrong.

Here's what's *great* about paper wallets, as compared with simply writing down HD seeds. ^(Yeah, that's a poke in the eye to you, Luke-Jr ☺)
First, most paper wallet designs should include both the alphanumeric keys and the QR code representations of those alphanumeric keys. You can use either to recover your wallet. They're identical representations of the same data.
Second, QR codes are quite resilient. In most cases, up to 25% of the QR code can be messed up, and the code will still decode.
On my [own design]( I also include the private alphanum keys *twice*, rotated 180 degrees. This way you've got the private key encoded 3 times on the wallet, helping it to survive through damage.
@_date: 2016-04-28 12:39:27
That screenshot is from just going to blockchain.info and clicking on 'wallet'. I'm not familiar with their beta program. 
Also, I just went to the 'cold storage' function in Mycelium for Android, click on "Get private key from QR Code" and it [prompted me for my password](
So anyway, in conclusion, neither mycelium nor blockchain.info dropped support for BIP38.
However, coinbase disappointingly has dropped support for sweeping paper wallets, which means selling off coins stored in paper wallets using Coinbase requires at least two steps. (First sweep to something like blockchain or mycelium, next send to coinbase.)
@_date: 2016-04-16 16:44:07
I ordered some just to see what they're like. I'll let you know what I think when they're in hand. Honestly, on screen, the design looks very amateurish. If you're putting energy into this project, I recommend you hire a designer just to make them look better, more precious, less silly.
As for the general concept, I share everyone else's concerns about having to trust someone else with the private keys. I suppose it might not matter much for very small balances, but still it's a business model that's never worked before despite many attempts.
Did you consider allowing purchasers to supply their own BIP38 encrypted passwords during the checkout process so that you are released from the responsibility of safely generating and distributing private keys?
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:21:21
Bitaddress.org's code has been trustworthy for longer than just about any other Bitcoin project I know of. The safety of making a paper wallet has more to do with your operating system, the ink and paper you use, etc.
I've got a 6-point FAQ on making safe paper wallets here:
Also, if you have any doubts about the security of your OS, I sell a [live-boot CD]( that has my own paper wallet making software pre-installed. For most computers, you just boot to the CD, print wallets, and disconnect. NB: My software is a fork of bitaddress.org -- it's cryptographic functionality is identical.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:52:27
Read up on "PGP encryption" for a technical explanation. But here's an oversimplified example/metaphor:
Say your private key is a big random string like this:
While keeping it private and secure, you could let people know what every *other* character in your key is, like this: 
This would be your public key. Anyone who has your public key can't guess your private key. If someone sends bitcoin to the public key, ONLY the person who knows the corresponding unobfuscated private key can control those funds.
Again, a gross oversimplification, but the concept is the same. You can derive a public key from the private key, but not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:07:37
Probably shouldn't bother... Stripe just announced they're dropping support for Bitcoin altogether because of slow &amp; expensive confirmations.

Perhaps. But OP's question wasn't about what's simpler, or what's easier, or how many addresses you can store. 
OP's question was about what if what if your printed backup gets damaged.
You said, "I don't recommend paper wallets *because of issues like this*."
So, what are you talking about when you say *issues like this*? A paper wallet is more resilient to physical damage than writing down an HD seed, period. Most paper wallet designs have double (if not triple) redundancy, and additionally benefit from QR codes which are specifically designed to recover from damage. In fact, someone would do well to create a HD seed backup which works and looks exactly like a paper wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-14 13:24:46
Curious. How is printing out your HD seed more resilient to physical damage than printing out a paper wallet?

Regarding BIP38, it's extremely secure. Even a simple password like 'TheOtherHand' would take years and years of massive resources to crack. A number of people have posted their BIP38 encrypted private keys publicly with an invitation for people to crack them.

You should absolutely be concerned about any software that generates keys. Even completely offline sites can still generate compromised keys without having to store them or relay them to the mothership. For example, a wallet could still choose random seeds, but it could reduce the randomness is from 10^256 (astronomical) to 10^32 (computable).
Unless you learn enough about programming and cryptography to validate the wallet service yourself -- which isn't even possible with closed-source hardware like the Trezor or any already compiled software you download -- then it just comes down to trust.
So: who to trust? I promote myself as a trustworthy guy. I'm one of the only people in the space using my actual verifiable identity. I've been running my service since 2013, and it's fairly easy (even for a non-programmer) to confirm that my software is identical to bitaddress.org in all the places that matter. And bitaddress.org (Pointbiz) has been examined and vetted to death, probably more than any one bit of bitcoin software out there.

Hey there,
I've written up a full guide here: 
If you want to make sure you can access the wallet, esp. if it's a BIP38 encrypted wallet (which I recommend, even if protected with a very very simple password), I would do this:
1) Print the encrypted wallet
2) Use the "Validate" tab on my generator to make sure you can successfully decrypt it
3) At that point you should feel safe sending funds to the wallet.

Loads. Whenever there's been an update I've done line by line comparisons. While a lot of people disparage the fact that it's written in HTML/JS, a remarkable thing is that this is literally a *single file* you can open up in any text editor and compare against previous versions, etc. Very different from trusting an open-source binary that was compiled from 100's of different files (e.g. Electrum.)
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:17:12
If your paper wallet was funded prior to Aug 2017, I would use the android app Coinomi to move your funds around. Reason being that in Coinomi, you can create 3 wallets in the same app: BTC, BCH, and Bitcoin Gold. Then you will sweep your wallet *THREE* times -- once for each currency. Then do what you like with them. Coinomi allows you to convert from one to another so, for example, you could convert your bitcoin gold into additional bitcoin, etc.
Then send the BTC to new paper wallets or (DOK? don't know what that is)...

Hi there,
My site gives a pretty good introduction to paper wallets as gifts:
Basically you will be printing out your own paper wallet, and then funding it yourself using your own wallet or exchange service. If you don't use Bitcoin often probably what you would do is buy some bitcoin at coinbase.com and then transfer it directly from your coinbase account to the public key displayed on the wallet you print from my site. The paper wallet design on my site includes instructions on the back for how to check the balance at any point (no need to login).

Good question. There's no API or central repository of addresses. Paper wallet sites (and hardware wallets, etc.) just make up their own addresses by picking a very (VERY) large random number and then running it through some functions. It can be done (and should be done) completely offline. For example, on my service (bitcoinpaperwallet.com) there's an option to generate your own wallet by entering the results of shuffling a deck of playing cards so you don't even have to trust the randomness of your computer.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:15:23
I think it's important to balance security concerns with ease of use (and ultimately, recoverability.) With a BIP38 encrypted wallet from my site, you can stick that wallet in a safety deposit box, and if you die, your family will pretty much be able to figure out what to do with the paper wallet based on the instructions printed on the back. What I've seen over the last 6 years or so is that MANY people lose their coins due to forgotten passwords, using too obscure a security system, etc. On the other hand, I've never seen anyone defrauded after using trusted software (e.g. mine, bitaddress.org, wallets like electrum, core, etc.)

I don't believe so. When mycelium sweeps the paper wallet, it should ONLY be sweeping out the BTC, leaving any other coins behind.
After sweeping, check the public address on blockchair.com which will show you your BTC and BCH balance simultaneously.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:06:43
Here's what I advise on my site, 
Deposit as many times as you like to your paper wallet.
However, "Sweep" it (withdraw) only once, and remove the entire balance to your hot wallet. If you want to move some of those funds back to a paper wallet, send then to a fresh paper wallet.
You *can* send funds back to the same paper wallet, however the cryptographic strength of the private key is lessened once it's been used in a transaction. Right now there's no exploit for that weakness, but in theory if computers get fast enough or someone figures out some new math, re-used paper wallets will be the first to fall.

I'm not too familiar with LN, but I think the idea is that you're not supposed to have funds indefinitely locked inside of lightning channels. Something could happen that causes the funds to get released back to their original "real" bitcoin addresses. Doesn't sound like a good place to store funds for the long term...
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:41:14
Hi there,
I'm the guy who does bitcoinpaperwallet.com
It's always safest for you to download the code from github, turn off your internet, and double-click on the generate-wallet.html file. 
When you want to check your balance, just search for the public key on blockchain.info
Yes, you can keep scanning the same public key at ATMs and adding more balance to the same wallet.
When it's time to sell/use the bitcoin, you will probably load up Mycelium or Breadwallet on your phone, and "sweep" the paper wallet so that the balance is now on your phone's "hot wallet".
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:17:29
This is my design/recommendation...
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:32:40
I think your question is can bitcoinpaperwallet.com (or my CD) generate electrum style (hierarchical deterministic) seed words? Answer is no, it only makes single addresses which you can choose to BIP 38 encrypt or not. It also allows you to supply your own randomness (e.g. shuffle playing cards) if you don't trust computer random number generation.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:18:05
Sounds like you're being plenty secure already. I outline security steps (in order of paranoia) on my site, 
Also, I offer an Ubuntu CD with the paper wallet maker (address generator in your case) pre-installed. Big savings in time and effort: just boot to the CD, make some addresses, and you're done with it.

Depends greatly on whether you're using a laser or inkjet...

Hmm. I'm not sure your logic is right here. OP is transferring funds to paper wallets. I believe that specific scenario (squirreling away BTC on a single address to be held for perhaps several years) is not supported/envisioned with the Lightning Network.

If bitaddress.org implements this code, I'll follow suit. I don't write my own cryptocode -- I just borrow Pointbiz's as it's well trusted by the community.

You might find my generator a little more intuitive. It's definitely designed for individual wallets.

Never saw that thread before. Never heard anything like it either. I wonder which javascript libraries nullc is talking about. AFAIK, nobody has ever claimed that bitaddress.org has generated anything other than reliable keys since it was originally launched. If it had, we'd all be screaming about it.

I wonder what would happen if you were to modify the javascript in the bitaddress code so that no matter what you type in for the decrypt passphrase, the JS would just replace that with '' (blank) during the decryption process. See if it throws an error or what.

Sure, folks will rattle sabres, but I've seen no *significant* parties discussing a pre-75% switch. Did I miss something?
And the notion that the remaining 25% miners would continue to mine pre-XT when it would be entirely against their financial interests doesn't make any sense to me. Miners don't mine for altruistic or philosophical reasons. They mine to earn fungible Bitcoin.

Paper wallet with BIP38 encryption, print out 2 or 3 copies and keep them somewhere safe e.g. with family members or safety deposit boxes.
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:16:32
Hey there, author of  here.
Definitely an excellent idea to test to make sure you can decrypt your BIP38 wallet before adding funds to it.
Using my own software (which hopefully you're running from your local computer having downloaded it from github) you would:
1. Print out your BIP38 paper wallet
2. Click on the validate/decrypt tab, and scan the private key on your paper wallet right back in (or just type it in if you're patient). [Illustration](
3. You'll be prompted for your password. Type it in.
4. The page should now show you the valid private and public keys belonging to your wallet. 
5. Unless you received an error/alert in step 4, then it's safe for you to load up the wallet with funds.
You don't compromise any of your security with this process.
If you're especially concerned about security and not sure how to create a clean OS/install for making paper wallets, I sell a product that makes this a turn-key solution. Just boot to the CD, print wallets, that's it.

Even with the spooky emphasis added to that video, I don't read any sort of threat into what Mike is saying there. As I understand him, he's saying things could get messy if the economic community and the mining community go in different directions. But neither the economic community nor the mining community have any interest in sabotaging Bitcoin altogether, so I don't see that hypothetical coming to pass. In any case, it's definitely not the case that he's *advocating* for a pre-75% switch.
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:41:04
Hi, bitcoinpaperwallet.com guy here. Just an aside: your CD should have arrived sealed with a hologram bearing a unique serial number matching the number described in a PGP-signed email from me -- this should virtually guarantee that it wasn't tampered with en route. Thanks for trusting my system! I put a lot of thought into it.

More fear mongering. Coinbase is not putting any funds at risk by running XT. XT does nothing at all until there is 75% miner consensus, at which point XT becomes the default Bitcoin.

I think the biggest risk of having any significant bitcoin holdings on a phone isn't hacking, but losing the phone or formatting it without remembering (or knowing how) to make a backup. But as long as they have a backup (e.g. paper wallet or recovery passphrase) a phone seems like a fine option.
What I always do is give newbies a paper wallet that I've securely generated. (Makes sense since I'm the  guy.) This way they get the simplicity of a paper wallet they can load from coinbase or whatever, but they get the security of a solidly generated paper wallet.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:55:42
If you use blockchain.info, just be sure to use their "paper wallet backup" service from time to time. 
Then, even if blockchain.info disappears, you still have access to 100% of your funds because you can recover them from your paper wallet backups.
@_date: 2015-06-11 22:36:21
As far as I know, most (all?) paper wallets print out the private key as both a QR code and plain alphanumeric text. (This is the case with mine,  )
I say print it out on waterproof paper (teslin/revlar) using a laser printer and keep it protected from the elements.
Edit: and if you just write down your key by hand, be sure to use a pencil instead of a pen. I was amazed when I went through my great-grandfather's school journals. The ones that were written in pencil looked like they could have been written yesterday. Some of the entries written in pen disappeared entirely...

When it's time to test, make yourself a sample wallet, and make sure you know how to send funds to it, and then "sweep" those funds off with your phone. That's pretty much it!

1. Download the bitcoinpaperwallet.com site from github and run it on a secure offline computer: 
2. Click the 'validate' tab and enter your private key
3. Then go back to the 'front' tab where you can print out the resulting paper wallet, BIP38 encrypt it, whatever you like.
Edit: PS you can test it out with a throw-away private key using the live online version [here](

As the guy behind  I obviously have a bias here :)
*The article is correct in saying that paper wallets are rotten (and dangerous) for trying to spend funds, i.e. using as a true "wallet".*
However, I think this article makes too general a conclusion. In my opinion, paper wallets are still an excellent choice for (1) long-term storage, and (2) offering gifts to introduce people to Bitcoin.
For long-term savings of Bitcoin (5, 10, more years) I'd trust a password-protected paper wallet over a device because:
* I don't like the idea of backing up a device by having a non-password protected seed phrase written down on paper. If someone finds the seed phrase you wrote down to backup your device, you're in big trouble. On the other hand, if someone sneaks a peek at your password-protected paper wallet, they can't do anything with it.
* Your device might not work with any of your computers in the future. Myself, I have a drawer full of devices and storage media that are no longer compatible with modern computers. ADB, SCSI, Data-DAT, Zip drives, gold-plated burnable CDs that decayed after 20 years instead of the promised 100... In fact, this weekend I spent 10 hours trying to build a virtual PC to run old software that required a USB dongle that's no longer functioning in my modern OS.
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:37:01
Note: Since it's an old wallet, if there are funds on it, you'll also have been "airdropped" additional cryptocurrencies (bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, and clams are the ones actually worth something) which are very easy to recover. I wrote up an article on this here:

Can someone compare/contrast this to 37coins.com ? As I understand it, 37coins can work purely with SMS, which is not just an extraordinary achievement, but *necessary* for a Bitcoin SMS option that will work with poor/unbanked who are already using SMS featurephones like [M-Pesa](
I like that Coinkite is digging into SMS somewhat, but if you still need a regular web browser to complete your transaction, then I don't think it's fair to say you can "Send Bitcoin by SMS worldwide". It sounds to me more like "Notify someone of pending Bitcoin transaction via SMS."
In my opinion, sending bitcoin via SMS (and SMS alone) is what will enable Bitcoin's more revolutionary aspects to manifest. It means inviting literally *billions* of unbanked individuals into the global economy.

Heh! True enough -- I've *removed* a few things from the CD:
1. USB/CD hybrid functionality (this is a UCK option, not sure which specific files or packages it removes)
2. Windows-specific files (autorun etc -- another UCK build option)
3. Ubiquity (to speed up boot time,  so the user isn't asked if they want to install ubuntu each time)
The step-by-step process is described here:
@_date: 2014-07-23 22:39:07
You can order my CD for delivery anywhere in the world:
Turn off your Internet modem, reboot with the CD in your drive, and print out all the wallets you like. Use the built-in random generator, or roll dice, shuffle cards, whatever. If you use the random generator, it's (verifiably) identical to bitaddress.org.
Comes with about 5 nice designs to choose from. Only security concern is to make sure you don't use a super smart printer (e.g. one with a hard drive) and power off your Internet connection.

I'm looking at a minor front-side redesign in the very near future (as part of adding support for BIP38 and some other design features.)

I really do appreciate the feedback, thanks.

Hey there,
I've put together a step-by-step guide for following as many security precautions as you can, in order of importance:
@_date: 2014-08-26 01:30:23
BTW this is a common misconception. BIP38 passwords cannot be cracked via hash tables. They take massive amounts of brute force, which makes them enormously more difficult to crack than (for example) brain wallets.
My personal opinion is that a BIP38 password with 40 or 50 bits of entropy is totally fine as it would take enormous computing resources to crack.

As I understand it, the problem will occur 100% of the time when using Safari version 6. However, as long as you use Safari version 6 to import/decrypt the wallet, you may not see the problem at all.
The main complication here is if you use Safari 6 to generate BIP38 wallets, and then try to redeem (decrypt) your wallets using a different browser. Or worse yet, if you upgrade to Safari 7 and then no longer have Safari 6 around so that you can decrypt your wallet.
@_date: 2014-10-28 22:41:07

Hmm... can you accomplish this by popping in your own JPGs using the "Use my own design" option?
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:03:52
Definitely a good idea. Right now I just overprint "BIP38 Format" next to the private key, but this is hidden by the folds.
The entire design however is subject to yet another upcoming edit (something that will make language translations easier as well) so I might hold off on this for the time being.
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:01:53
Good points! Careful with laminating if you're using a laser printer. There's a note on laminating here: 
Regarding the non-rectangular shape, it's not for good looks -- it prevents tampering. With a rectangular shape, even when using tamper-evident sealing tape, it's possible for someone to reveal the private key without disturbing the seals. Not important for small tips I suppose, but I thought I'd mention this since it's not common knowledge that the "butterfly" shape is a carefully considered security feature.
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:34:57
Most wallets will let you type in the alphanumeric key -- but if you'd like to make yourself a regular old paper wallet from that key, I made sure this is possible with my software:
There's an "enter my own key" button which will make a regular old private wallet. You can then even BIP38 encrypt it if you'd like to give it a little more security.
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:08:44
Turnkey solution:
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:22:42
Good idea, I'll do that. But first, do you know of some URLs with good instructions for newbies on how to *compute* hashes of CDs from within Windows / OS X / Linux? For the most part, I try to provide very explicit instructions for any security-related assurances. Instructions would have to be something like, "insert CD, but do NOT reboot yet. instead, calculate the hash by..."
I've done some digging just now, for OS X at least, and I can't find any reasonably simple way to compute the hash of an actual CD. "Reasonably Simple" is important because if it's a complex process, the person probably has enough skills to make their own CD and shouldn't bother with what I'm offering.
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:56:32

Or neither! I'm rather crusty and old (my service has been around for about a year), and I've never been accused of [scamming]( My identity is matter of public record, and I run a successful business selling stickers and boring stuff like that. If I were a scammer, I'd be a very bad, dumb scammer. Or someone going for a REALLY good long-con. :)
*If you trust me*, the tamper-evident delivery of the CD is useful because it prevents a physical "man in the middle" attack, e.g. your roommate opening your mail and replacing the CD with a look-alike. This is important because this CD is aimed especially at users who may not even have enough technical skill to run a SHA/MD5 sum.
*If you don't trust me* then you should poke around to see which established bitcoin crypto people have poked through my code in the past -- for example Gavin Andresen who submitted a security enhancement in May 2013. 
In any case, yes I think it's a great idea to publish some SHA/MD5 sums of the CD, but I figure this makes more sense once some established crypto people have publicly vetted this work. It's not going to be too hard since all you have to do is follow [my instructions to create your own CD]( and then compare it to the CD I'm selling.

Unrelated: Have you considered creating a temporary memory-based filesystem for storing the PNG? This way once the PNG is printed, the memory can be wiped clean, and the PNG will never have hit the hard drive / USB drive. I only mention this because it looks like you're after a seriously cold-cold-freezing-cold wallet solution.
On the other hand, I'm not sure if printer cache/spool issues would invalidate the whole point of storing the PNG in RAM.

My favorite weird (though true) photocopier story is about how a recent Xerox machine has image compression that *changes digits* in some cases:

*I figured this new F.A.Q. might be of interest to some of you, especially since (as far as I know) this is the only way to apply BIP38 to a pre-existing key or key of your own design. In particular, I believe that bitaddress.org will only let you apply BIP38 to brand-new random generated keys.*
If you have a regular paper wallet that displays the unencrypted WIF key, you can duplicate it and print out a new BIP38-protected version of the same wallet in just a few steps:
1. Launch the  generator, preferably using your own copy downloaded from GitHub. You may skip the random mouse movement step since you are not generating any new keys.
2. Click on the 'Validate' tab, and either type in your private key, or scan its QR code. (Firefox works best for camera scanning.) Click the 'validate' button.
3. Click 'Use these details' to print a paper wallet
4. Click the checkbox for 'BIP38 Encrypt?', supply your passphrase, and click 'Turn on BIP38 encryption'.
5. Print the front side of your wallet, flip the page over, print the backside of your wallet, and you're done!
**Important:** Don't discard your old unencrypted paper wallet until you've used the Verify tab to successfully decrypt your new BIP38 encrypted wallet.

Well, the "original" design doesn't use a background image: it's rendered by javascript "canvas" meaning it's vector -- i.e. infinite DPI.

**Important note:** this is not iceburn2003/Jeff Hockema's fault, it's a bug in Safari 6.05 (and possibly other 6.x versions) exposed by the scrypt library used by *virtually every javascript-based BIP38 implementation*, not just this one. Some fixes/workarounds are in the works, but in the meantime just don't use Safari 6.x.
-- recommend you follow the [relevant discussions on github]( and either (1) do a browser check and disallow Safari 6, and/or (2) try out some of the work-arounds being discussed.

Bitcoinpaperwallet.com author here. Sorry for the slow response, had a very busy weekend. :)
As you've probably ascertained by now, my site is a direct fork of bitaddress.org -- and all the code has been modified in such a way to make it fairly easy to compare (AKA "diff") with bitaddress so you can make sure there's no monkeybusiness going on.
Also, I'm very open with my actual real life identity. You can easily locate my phone, email, 20+ years of Internet development history, bitcointalk reputation etc. My own opinion is that when it comes to trust (which is ultimately required when you use someone else's wallet software) anonymity isn't necessarily a good thing.

Thanks for the suggestions. By the way, with a little rotation-fu, you can print 2 wallets per page. E.g. to print 20 wallets on 10 pages, first print 10 backs, then rotate the paper, reinsert, print 10 more backs. Then rotate paper again, print 10 fronts (click generate new key between each print), rotate paper one last time, print 10 more.
Pain in the ass, I know, but honestly the slowest part of this process is the printer operation itself, so this will still go about as quick as your printer can manage.

Yeah, it's complete garbage now. The page currently gives most of its space discussing theft/ponzi/security, and doesn't even *begin* to address "what it is and how it works." It doesn't explain the basic fundamentals -- like how *Bitcoin works by sending coins to unique addresses*.

I'm still a little confused by what I've read here. First I thought it basically worked like OpenDime, where you could transfer the funds off at will. But then it looked almost like the private key could be used to *sign* transactions, but could not actually be used to send the bitcoin elsewhere.
Are bitcoin sent to these essentially locked to the artifact forever, almost like a "burn address"?
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:22:18
Yes, the CD lets you generate new keys and apply BIP38, or even apply BIP38 to old keys (for example if you want to convert an existing paper wallet to BIP38.)

Very little! The only difference is that this CD has the bitcoinpaperwallet.com software pre-installed on the desktop. This means you never need to go online to download anything, and you don't need to run checksums / verify the PGP signature (unless you really want to of course.) It's a completely offline turnkey solution.
If you use burn yourself the regular Ubuntu website CD, you'll still need to download your paper wallet software (e.g. to a thumb drive) and verify its authenticity. Not a big deal, but some people want the convenience of just getting a CD you can use right away.

Seconded. Bitcoinpaperwallet.com author here. I recommend that you treat paper wallets exactly like a "piggy bank". Deposit as often as you like. When you're ready to withdraw, sweep the entire balance and then consider your piggy bank broken. Put the old paper wallet in an envelope labeled "old discarded paper wallets".

I do appreciate that they fixed the problem. And I don't doubt that their support is better than some other companies. I submitted my ticket at 3:45pm mountain time, and got their response -- blowing me off and blaming my own site -- in less than an hour. Fast support, but totally inadequate, since one method of using their invoice generating API was broken systemwide -- not just for me. Meanwhile, my [original ticket]( is still open and hasn't been updated. Ultimately, I'm relieved that no customer data was lost. But my alarm was justifiable since the data was at the time irretrievable via every option available to me (viewing invoices in the browser, exporting raw purchase orders as CSV files from BitPay, etc.)
What I don't appreciate that it took a post to Reddit to actually *receive* the urgent support this issue deserved.

Totally alarming! I'm the guy who found the BIP38 decoding problem endemic to Safari 6.01 + the javascript library that bitaddress uses. (We figured out a work-around for my own generator/decoder.)
Curious: can you try the decode/validate tab using  (bitcoinpaperwallet.com). This has a QR code scanner, and fundamentally uses the same decoder as bitadress.org.
You can also PM me your encrypted key and the password (assuming you've already swept the wallet) and I can do some digging. I'm very interested in making sure BIP38 is reliable when using browser-based encoders.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:30:46
Best way is to load up the generate-wallet.html file and the bitaddress.org HTML file in a text editor that will show you differences between the two. You should see that all my differences are are about interface / graphics and added functionality like QR code scanning. The crypto should appear untouched.
This assumes you trust bitaddress.org.

Regarding 2 wallets per page, I'm unlikely to implement this within software, but there is a trick to do it right now:
1. Print out 30 backsides
2. Rotate paper, print out 30 more backs 
Now you have 30 pages blank on one side, with two backs on each printed side
3. Flip paper, print out 30 fronts
4. Rotate paper, print out 30 more fronts
This gives you a total of 60 wallets on 30 pages with only 3 flips of your paper, but it does requires Advanced 3D Rotation Thinking, a brain activity that will drive you mad but stretch your brain so as to prevent Alzheimers and such.

Coincidentally, I poked around yesterday as well and was absolutely *blown away* by the overall sophistication and quality of work demonstrated at  . It makes blockchain.info look oldschool. Presumably you're talking about stand-alone client software, but to me it makes sense to focus on a solid web app so as to get the greatest possible audience testing and improving the protocol. Fully-formed stand-alone clients can wait.
Is there any Bitcoin-related project that's developed as quickly and as professionally as Counterparty, which only got off the ground 2 months ago?

A BIP38 version of bitcoinpaperwallet.com is in testing right now. Works great, though we uncovered a Safari 6.05 bug in BIP38 codes [as implemented by all javascript-based sites]( We've worked around the bug ourselves , but I want to do a little more testing before we push this feature (and some other really great features like dice rolling, QR code scanning, and converting non-BIP38 to BIP38 wallets.)
New features are coming out soon, but I like to move very carefully and slowly since we're dealing with real money here and bugs can be fairly catastrophic.

The reverse side of paper wallets printed at  have at least minimal instructions included, along with a little balance sheet / register. These wallets also simply *look* precious -- less likely to be discarded.
If you BIP38 encrypt your wallet, you can use the reverse side to note a hint for the password. Use something you're sure your family could guess, e.g. "name of our first pet."

MtGox got "free cloud storage" for their millions of private transactions. Satoshi Dice consumed [upwards of 25%]( of the ENTIRE blockchain, and they never paid people running nodes for their service either.
Meanwhile, Counterparty adds something valuable to the Bitcoin ecosystem: a distributed exchange, the ability to pay derivatives (in BTC no less), the ability to create asset classes, etc.
The blockchain gives all sorts of businesses and entities "free rides". The question today is whether or not it's appropriate for the bitcoin devs to alter the protocol because they don't like a particular service. Myself, I think Counterparty adds something of value without adding significant bloat, so why actively stifle it?
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:56:02
Mainly it's about privacy. The other thing is that Bitcoin is secured by multiple encryption schemes, and re-using addresses theoretically exposes you to liability if one those schemes (ECDSA) is ever "cracked." 
[DannyHamilton]( says it better:


@_date: 2014-03-25 16:24:33


^ This, exactly. It should be obvious from the last few months of MtGox/Vircurex/etc. hijinks that centralized exchanges are the present-time Achilles' Heel of Bitcoin. I'm very unhappy that the bitcoin devs are actively trying to sink Counterparty since (in my opinion) it's the only fair, well-planned, and well-executed distributed exchange implementation to date.
The "bloat" risked by the originally-planned for 80 bytes of OP_RETURN pales in comparison to the bloat caused by gambling, which presumably has much less value to the Bitcoin ecosystem than a fair and effective distributed exchange.

First thanks for the generous tip. I'll merry-make with that :)
I have instructions here for doing two wallets per page, but I'm not sure of any way to get more without cutting your sheets or something like that.
BTW the real deal to look for is anytime you can get "Teslin" paper for cheap. It's inkjet paper that's virtually indestructible and makes your prints *waterproof*. Usually pretty pricey, $1-2 per sheet.

1. Skip the random data gathering, doesn't matter in this case
2. Click the 'validate' tab
3. Scan your paper wallet's private key with your webcam (or type it in if you prefer)
4. Type in your password
Best practice is not to do this online: download the github ZIP, run it local. Firefox is best if you plan to take advantage of the camera scanning function.

Hi, Canton here, author of BitcoinPaperWallet.com which is a reliable fork of bitaddress.org, everyone's favorite and most trustworthy open source Javascript paper wallet generator.
This weekend I had a couple days off for Father's day, so I finally implemented some features I've had on the back-burner for a few months. Here's what's new:
* The background pattern ("guilloche") is algorithmically determined by the first 8 chars of the public key. This way each and every paper wallet looks a little different. I like how this reflects the significance of every public key (your wallet) being unique. Good teaching point when you're giving these away. If you don't like the pattern you get, just hit the "generate new key" button a few times, or roll your own with dice, etc.
* The random noise obfuscation security pattern opposite the private key is now truly random, improving protection against attempts to reveal the private key with lasers/bright lights (AKA "candling").
* By popular demand: BIP38 encrypted wallets now have a different color (blue stripe) so you can tell at a glance which wallets are encrypted and which aren't.
* Also by popular demand: when printing a wallet, you have an *option* to add a denomination that shows on the front, e.g. 1 BTC, 250 mBTC, etc. Nice for gifts. You can also turn off the back side instructions and deposit notes if you prefer to have that space for writing a personal message or password hint.
* Additional languages: Hebrew, Japanese, and Swedish for a total of 13 languages. Also, languages are dynamically rendered in HTML now instead of using huge JPG images, so the github download size will shrink *considerably*.
* Minor changes to graphic design. On the whole, a bit more elegant and currency-like. After all, the more valuable these look, the less likely they are to be thrown away by the person going through your personal affairs when you die...
**You can try out the beta here:**
Thanks in advance for any feedback. Contact me directly if you'd like to submit additional translations.

Hi there,
bitcoinpaperwallet.com author here. If you want to use my generator to do your BIP38, you don't actually need to use the command line tool to SHA-256, because there's a link on the "print front" section for typing in your own dice rolls or card shuffles or passphrase. Also, if you're doing SHA-256, you don't need 99 rolls, it's only 62 times. (99 is when you're doing a base-6 key creation.) Here's how my instructions read:






As for verifying that my BIP38 lines up with other people's BIP38 -- Excellent idea! -- But I wouldn't validate using bitaddress.org because it's essentially the exact same crypto code base as mine. If there were a bug, we'd likely *both* have it! I'd use as different a bit of software as possible, maybe even something in Python. Or at least bit2factor.org.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:36:38
As far as I know, my generator (bitcoinpaperwallet.com) is the *only* service that can accomplish this. You can scan (or type in private key for) an EXISTING paper wallet, then add BIP38 encryption on top of it and print a new wallet without moving your funds.
This is not yet possible with bitaddress.org, etc.
See the FAQ on "**How do I convert a non-encrypted wallet to use BIP38?**" here:

In fact it may only be Safari 6.05 (typical to OS X 10.7.x) -- Safari 6.1 may be fine though we're still narrowing down the matrix. For what it's worth, we haven't done any extensive testing with browsers other than Chrome, IE, Safari, and Firefox.

Agreed about the malicious CD possibility. My solution: strict chain of custody from my computer to yours. Each CD is sealed with a tamper-evident serialized hologram, and before receiving the CD in the mail you receive a PGP signed email from me telling you what serial number to look for on your hologram.
This might be a bit excessive (worrying about the CD being swapped out by the postal delivery person) but hopefully I'm demonstrating that I've got a similar level of paranoia / caution. :)

I haven't tried this for myself, but I believe that on the Ubuntu Live distro, from within firefox, you can save to PDF when printing. This way you could save the PDF to a USB drive and print it another time / another place.

After quickly scanning through each of the slides my overall impression is that you hit on all the most important points in ways that should be understandable by anyone.
In contrast, most primers I see spend too much time/effort trying to explain why cryptography is the secret behind Bitcoin. Unless your audience already has a good notion of what PGP is, discussing crypto will only muddle the waters. So -- kudos to you on keeping it simple.
Very small point: I think you can find a [better background image]( for "frictionless".

You would not believe how much effort it takes to write good instructions for novices. If someone has already gone through the work of describing god-knows-what process you need to go through to SHA-hash a CD inside of who-knows-what /device on a Windows machine, I'd love to borrow them.

The main thing I try to help people sort out is how even a very dull BIP38 password (even something like 'apple2014' -- no kidding!) is sufficient. It's not like brainwallet passphrases, where literally millions upon millions of passphrases are monitored and bruteforced every second of the day. 
The general case in which BIP38 comes into play is if a robber breaks into your house and steals your valuables, including some bitcoin wallets. The thief may well be smart enough to realize that "bitcoin" is valuable, but what are the chances that he can get access to a supercomputer-size network of computers to break even a simple BIP38 phrase like "apple2014"? 
To brute force BIP38, your particular BIP38 key has to be tested against a dictionary one passphrase at a time. (It's not possible to pre-compute a table of hashes like you can with brainwallets.)
Someone on reddit used a 48 core opteron machine (4x12 core 2.7ghz) and was able to test only 36 BIP38 passwords per second. That's FAST for BIP38, which can easily take *several seconds per passphrase* on a typical CPU.
I believe a 32-bit entropy password (about what you get with "apple2014") gives you 2147483647 options, which would take that 48 core machine 690 days to brute force.  A botnet of 1,000 4-core computers would take 8 days, assuming that 100% of each of their 4-core CPUs could be run 24 hours a day (unlikely.)
So this is what I mean by "a weak BIP38 password is just fine" -- unless you have reason to believe someone could (1) physically steal your wallet, and then (2) dedicate a botnet to cracking it. 
Have I got this right? I might be missing something.

Any 3rd party that produces a wallet for you using two-party BIP38 will be perfectly secure, because they don't have access to your private key at any point.
This is the type of process you see demonstrated here:

Odd shape is a bit of a pain to cut out, but it came about after a significant round of tamper-testing. The private keys on folding designs that use regular (rectangular) shapes can be compromised, even without disturbing the tamper-evident tape. Trust me, it's not arbitrary, it's about security.

Very interesting! I wonder if the folks over at bitaddress.org have seen this. 
Myself, with the exception of having jumped on board with crypto.getRandomValues earlier on than bitaddress.org, I never touch the PRNG or any of the deep crypto code. I want my code to be verifiably identical (easy to compare) with bitaddress.org so that there are simply less players to trust and so that I benefit from the scrutiny that's already applied to the bitaddress.org code.

It's not just a prestige thing. (Though it is nice that the stickers make the wallets look valuable, meaning they're less likely to be discarded if you die and family members are going through your possessions.) Non-bling reasons include:
* Reflective foil hologram is intentionally placed over top and bottom edges to protect alphanumeric codes from being "candled" with a bright light source.
* Hologram stickers are tamper-evident and have unique serial numbers, which discourages people in your trusted environment from sneaking a peek at the QR code, replacing the sticker, and sweeping your funds without your knowledge. Theft from shady friends, roommates, even family members is a serious concern.

*"unclear from the OP what wallet generating software is being used"* -- Well, it's a great many different popular open source projects on github. They include bitaddress.org (and every fork of bitaddress.org, probably the litecoin fork, etc.), bit2factor.org, etc.
What they all have in common is that they use the same scrypt javascript library, and what appears to be the case is that the scrypt code exposes a fairly gnarly bug in Safari 6.05 in which when running an identical calculation you sometimes get one answer, sometimes a different one. Sometimes 2+2=4, sometimes 2+2=5.
The silver lining here is that instead of producing completely different wrong addresses (2+2=18, etc.) it seems to produce a single variant wrong address (2+2=5) which you can reliably decrypt if you re-try the calculation enough times.
Had this not been the case, I estimate fully 2.5% of all BIP38 encrypted wallets would be unrecoverable today.

Bitcoinpaperwallet author here -- the caveat about Safari 6.0.5 applied to virtually every javascript based BIP38 implementation. However we made a work-around / patch for bitcoinpaperwallet.com so even 6.0.5 is safe. For some reason bitaddress.org didn't want to patch.
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:56:36
Agreed! Bitcoin can be more 
* Fun
* Tangible
* Secure
All at once, with proper paper wallets. Thanks for the kind words &amp; treasure hunts, @_date: 2014-03-03 22:39:36
Yes I think that's exactly the point. :) I think even with an unlucky preponderance of number ones, your address will ONLY collide with another one after as many wallets have been rolled as there are atoms in the Milky Way. Instead of the Universe. Or something like that.

Hi everyone,
bitcoinpaperwallet.com author here.
Read here to see how the CD works, what it's for, *or for step-by-step instructions on how to make your own customized Ubuntu Live Boot CD for free*:
When I leaked an image of this CD a while back it caused a veritable shitstorm, so I wanted to post a couple of pre-emptive notes about the March 1, 2014 official release of this CD:
1. This isn't just the standard Ubuntu Live CD you can burn yourself. It has been carefully (securely) re-mastered to include the bitcoinpaperwallet.com bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin BIP38 paper wallet generator on the desktop. For most computers, using the CD is literally as easy as insert the CD, reboot, and start printing wallets without ever going online.
2. Use of the Ubuntu trademark and permission to re-sell this modified version of the Live Boot CD was cleared through Canonical's legal department.
3. If you have security concerns, please ask questions here before making negative assumptions and downvoting. Rigid security practices have been implemented to make this product available, from the production of the CD master in an isolated environment, to the actual burning of CD, to the tamper-evident chain of custody practices used to ensure that the CD you receive in the mail has not been replaced with a fake. (And did I mention the $18 includes FREE shipping anywhere in the world? It does.)
4. If you have ethical / open source software concerns, let's discuss. My sincere hope with this product is to make safe paper wallet generation extremely easy. I promise you there's not a huge profit in this type of venture, especially not at this price point. 
In the wake of the MtGox debacle, it's more important than ever to give anyone -- even newbies -- tools for securely working with paper wallets.

Some paper wallets fold up to hide the private key under a seal, and have [instructions on the back]( indicating how to use the wallet and why not to reveal the private key. Great intro to bitcoin, IMO.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:02:49
Works great!
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:58:25
I like all-in-one solutions for sure! On the other hand, the [Ubuntu CD]( I offer is pretty turn-key... Just boot a computer to the CD, plug in any supported printer, and start printing wallets without ever going online. You don't even need to download the software, because it's on the CD.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:47:21
If it works as advertised, then I think it's a step in the right direction for biometrics.
Potentially better than fingerprints and retinal scans because it prevents a thief from simply cutting off your finger or plucking out your eyeball to get access to your data. (Sorry, that was gross.) Instead they have to keep you around (and keep your heart beating) to cause mischief.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:52:34
Can you expand some on the exploit you're imagining? As I understand it, we'd have to find a predictable pattern for the significant amount of mouse wiggling that's required, *and* there would need to be a flaw in the Firefox implementation of window.crypto.getRandomValues() for predictable keys to be generated. (getRandomValues *should* product truly random numbers, regardless of the state of the OS random device.)
Regarding touch friendliness -- did you click inside the text entry box for keyboard events? If so, and you still have the problem, please let me know the OS/browser as I've been trying to keep on top of this. (My site already fixes a touch bug which has rendered bitaddress.org completely unusable.)
@_date: 2014-02-05 04:22:29
I might have been confusing two different methods of using 6-sided dice to produce private keys:
Method 1: Roll 99 times recording sequence using digits 0-5, and use result as a ready-to-use Base-6 encoded private key (the method mentioned on bitaddress.org)
Method 2: Roll 62 times, SHA-256 hash the sequence, and convert to WIF-style base58.
Am I correct that each of these methods provides sufficient entropy? If so, seems like it would be easier on users to promote Method  since it's quicker...
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:14:14
steamzonk isn't a word though and provides (theoretically) 31 bits on its own. In truth less since it's phonetic not totally random. Too subtle, I know. I'll update this to something better. It's at least an improvement on the default phrase at brainwallet.org :) EDIT: Not sure how accurate this is, but [this tool]( adds up 151 bits for my passphrase. Tool might be broke, though.

Or, yes, do BIP-38 encrypt your wallet. But use the software/design at  where you can write down the password (or a really obvious password hint) *underneath the fold* which is protected beneath tamper-evident tape.

**  author here **
I thought everyone could use a shot of good news while MTGox is flaming. And this also seemed like a good time to remind everyone that paper wallets are a better place to store bitcoin than (any) online exchanges...
**The February 10, 2014 release of bitcoinpaperwallet.com includes these brand new features:**
1. BIP38 encrypting and decrypting, as well as the ability to convert non-BIP38 wallets to BIP38. At last!
2. Private key validation and QR code camera scanning
3. Better entropy/seeding for more secure wallet generation, plus a helpful "randomness gathering" visualizer
4. Ability to bypass random number generator altogether by rolling dice, shuffling cards, or using a passphrase ("brain wallet") to generate a paper wallet
Test it out / try it live [here](
*Huge thanks to for his excellent work helping to bring these features to bitcoinpaperwallet.com.*

This should answer most of your questions:
Since my needs fell outside of what's explicitly granted to everyone on this page, I contacted Ubuntu and asked them for permission to do what I'm doing. It took a while, but what they said was, yes, provided that you include a note like this on the CD:


@_date: 2014-03-19 13:59:57
I'm very interested to see if this version is as hard on the CPU for OS X. 
Just recently I went through a dry spell in which I hadn't run bitcoin-qt for about 3 months. The catch-up process took me literally 3 days, because I could only run the client when I didn't need to use my computer for anything else. All 8 CPU cores were burning at 100%, not even leaving enough to track USB mouse movements smoothly. I eventually stumbled on the .conf file directive to limit the number of cores, but I've been wondering why the default behavior of the client is to consume 100% resources during blockchain catch-up, especially since the blockchain has grown so large.
TL/DR: I wish there was a easy GUI preference to limit the number of threads/cores, and that the default was to use less than 100% resources.
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:52:09
**I think a build script is a great idea**, as this would make it even easier for 3rd parties to verify that the CD I'm distributing is exactly the same as the CD you can make yourself [following my published instructions]( What's more, I didn't really like UCK (Ubuntu Customization Kit) which I used to produce this master, and I'd rather not rely on it in the future.
That said, I've never used build scripts, and I doubt I'll have time to remaster this CD in the near future. Is it easy? And if so, are you offering to help? Or are you just here to be meanspirited?
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:55:07
If you want a "turn key" solution, you can just buy this CD, reboot the computer, print out wallets, and be done with it. The only time you'll go online is to order the CD. It arrives verified and tamper-sealed, ready for use.
@_date: 2014-07-15 18:18:43
For any service that doesn't directly let you sweep (or import) BIP38 encrypted keys, you can do this:
1) Download the bitcoinpaperwallet.com [github ZIP]( and open the generate-wallet.html file using Firefox
2) You can skip the seeding step. Click on the "validate/decrypt" tab.
3) Click the button to scan your QR code from your BIP38 wallet, supply the passphrase
4) Click the button to load the key as a wallet
Then you can either A) copy and paste the unencrypted private key into the service/app, or B) print yourself a new unencrypted wallet and scan that, or C) just scan your screen with your phone where the unencrypted wallet front shows.
At some point, BIP38 will be more wide-spread, but in the meantime (as the bitcoinpaperwallet.com guy) I've tried to create some additional tools to make it easier to go back-and-forth with BIP38 so you never have to type in all those godawful characters by hand.

**Hi there, bitcoinpaperwallet.com author here.** A quick note: sorry but I don't actually provide a service in which I will mail you a printed wallet in the mail. That would require entirely too much trust (on your behalf.) For what it's worth, I don't recommend buying pre-printed wallets from anyone, whether they're using my design/service or not.
My site is intended for you to create your own keys and wallets on your own computer, preferably offline using a very secure operating system installation. All I send through the post is (entirely optional) hologram stickers, zip sealing bags, and the Ubuntu Live Boot CD with the bitcoinpaperwallet software installed.
Nevertheless, there's still a lot of trust involved in that you should have some confidence that I haven't installed "backdoors" in the wallet generator such that it produces predictable keys whose balances I could subsequently steal. (Such a trick would work even if your computer was offline.)
What you're doing here -- posting to reddit, or to [bitcointalk.org]( -- is the easiest way to get that confidence by seeing who else out there has audited my code and compared it against the bitaddress.org code from which it was forked.
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:56:56

*That's a pretty slick hack.* And using an offline printer isn't necessarily sufficient to guard against it, because:
1. Write a virus that spreads to vulnerable PCs/Macs
2. Once installed, the virus looks for vulnerable printers connected via USB and writes a slightly modified firmware
3. Firmware works exactly as a regular printer, except when it finds a private key or QR code in the output, at which point the printer transmits the private key *back to the virus* which has been listening to the USB port for signals.
4. Virus transmits the keys back to the mothership using the computer's network connection.
For sure an offline printer is a good idea, but what's more important (and harder to guarantee) is using a computer that's either always offline or guaranteed to be safe from viruses. (Disclaimer / shameless plug: I sell a [live-boot Ubuntu CD]( for exactly this purpose.)
IMO, this is not at all tinfoil hat level paranoia. This type of exploit -- hacking firmware belonging to 'dumb' devices using a virus -- has been found in the wild in much more challenging scenarios. In particular, a 2011 worm which spread over USB sticks to offline PCs in Iran, which [altered the firmware for uranium enrichment systems]( (also offline) so as to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.

Hi. Sorry I don't have an immediate solution, but in a short while (a week?)  will let you do this.
We're currently finalizing an update that will allow you to switch back and forth from BIP38 to unencrypted and print versions of each, whether you generated your keys via the built-in random generator, or whether you supplied your own brain wallet or vanity key.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:58:56
Developer here, thanks for the referral!
OP: The paper wallets from my site are especially intended for gifting to newbies. They look valuable (less likely to be discarded) and they have idiot-proof features, like hiding the private key away from plain view (tamper-resistant) and printing plain-english instructions on the back. With or without BIP-38, your choice.
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:01:42
The samples I demoed in this thread were printed on ordinary inkjet paper. I have very specific recommendations based on your kind of printer here:
In particular, if you're using Inkjet, try to find some "Teslin" 10 mil synthetic waterproof paper. It's expensive, but amazing.
When laminating a paper wallet, the idea is that you have to cut off the laminate to reveal the private key.
For translating to a new language, just modify this and email it back to me:

None of the Ubuntu Live CD distros (firefox, OS contents, etc.) are modified, so there are no changed hashes to sign. Everything should match up.
The generate-wallet.html file on the CD has a corresponding (detached) PGP-signature, just like in the github ZIP.
Do you figure this is sufficient?

More specifically: Is there a chance you used safari when you generated the original paper wallet?
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:23:42
Hmm, I'm intrigued!
There are instructions for creating wallets based on this type of random data in my generator. Go here:
And on the 'print front' tab, click the button to 'supply my own private key'. There's a link there that tells you how to input data based on rolling dice, shuffling cards, or entering in chords.
The thing you want to be careful about is "pick 6 chords that play along with each other" -- because that hugely limits your pool of randomness, compared with (for example) 12-tone music where all possible notes get equal preference. 
If you don't mind your music sounding like Stockhausen -- then you could probably get a sufficient amount of randomness represented in just a few lines of music.
BTW: I own a set of these for my piano explorations. I love them:

This is everything you need to print secure wallets offline. Just pop the CD in, reboot, print wallets using your own printer and choice of paper. Me, I like "teslin" paper. Provided you implicitly trust the codebase, you can be guaranteed that it hasn't been tampered with when it arrives in your mailbox.

Author of bitcoinpaperwallet.com here. Care to explain? You're the first person I've heard to claim this, so you'd better have an explanation unless you're just trolling. BTCPW's RNG is exactly as safe as the RNG at bitaddress.org because it's a verifiable fork of the same codebase.
If you are fundamentally opposed to using PRNG's of any kind, bitcoinpaperwallet.com makes it easier than ever to roll dice, shuffle cards, etc.

US$20 which includes free shipping to anywhere in the world. The CD is tamper-sealed, and you receive a serial number to confirm via PGP-signed email. Since it's a CDR, it's read-only, meaning it's even safer than a thumbdrive (which could be modified by an evil roommate, malware, etc.)
Yes, it's booting to a new OS, but it's relatively painless since this is just a CD you temporarily pop into your computer. Doesn't matter if your computer has viruses -- they'll be sleeping while you print wallets.

Unfortunately, the specialty designs (LTC, Doge, Bitcoin Holiday, Bitcoin Chinese New Year, etc.) are rendered using JPGs (instead of on-the-fly using HTML5/canvas) so most of these enhancements only apply to the dynamic Bitcoin wallet rendering.

As a sponsor for the 18th Financial Cryptography &amp; Data Security Conference, the Bitcoin Foundation had the idea to give away bitcoins to the IFCA attendees. Bitcoin Foundation hired me (BitcoinPaperWallet.com) to design this limited edition commemorative paper wallet for the occasion.
I really enjoyed working on this commission, knowing that this meant the IFCA members would get actual bitcoins to play with (instead of yet another conference branded t-shirt, mug, hat, whatever.)

My recommendation is that you treat it just like you would jewels or cash: make sure they're (1) not out in the open, and (2) easily discovered and spent in the event that you die and your family is going through your belongings.
If you BIP38 encrypt them, be sure your family can guess the password. If you don't, consider using a tamper-evident folding wallet design to discourage friends/family/sneaks from sweeping your bitcoin without you knowing it. (This is why I made bitcoinpaperwallet.com )

@_date: 2014-04-27 15:09:16
Yes, you can double-check to make sure the private key works (which is the same thing as checking to make sure it matches the public key) by typing it into a different piece of software that will compute the public given the private. I'd say use mine (bitcoinpaperwallet.com) except that mine is a fork of bitaddress.org, so if there was a bug in bitaddress.org, it would be present in mine as well.
Instead download a local copy of something like  which will also let you enter a private key to get the corresponding public key.
What's especially important is to make sure you can successfully decrypt your BIP38 keys before transferring funds.

Hmm... Bitcoinpaperwallet.com author here. I'm glad you found a way to get your process to work, but i still find this totally alarming. Also I wasn't able to replicate your problem. Here's what I tried:
1) installed bitaddress v. 2.8.1 from github
2) used the 'paper wallet' tab to make 4 BIP38 encrypted wallets
3) copied each "6P..." private key into the current version of bitcoinpaperwallet's validate/decrypt tab, entered the same BIP38 passphrase. Worked each time.
As long as you're not using an old version of Safari, any BIP38 you create on pretty much *any* version of bitaddress.org, bitcoinpaperwallet.com, bit2factor.org, etc. should decrypt consistently across the board. 
As far as I know, the only time any of us developers have found a BIP38 decrypting mismatch had to do with a deep javascript runtime bug in that one older version of Safari.
As a service to the community, it would be great if you could try to replicate your failure. If you can get the problem to reoccur, please contact me directly as you may have found a very (very!) serious bug that could be jeopardizing the integrity of zillions of loaded paper wallets.

Good point. I'll be making a more extensive help page on brainwallets soon and I'll discuss this.
FWIW I believe that the passphrase I suggested, **1852 Cloud SMASH fuzzy steamzonk** has pretty decent entropy as it mixes dictionary words with non-dictionary content. Not sure if it has 100 bits, but I believe it's close.

I'm unlikely to sell pre-printed sheets. It's a good idea, but the shipping would be nightmarish. (Right now I ship my holograms, stickers, CDs world-wide for free. Imagine the cost of shipping 8x11 paper and trying not to have it get bent in transit from USA to Australia, etc...)
However you can print two wallets per sheet with a little cleverness. See my reply to on this thread.

I'm the author of bitcoinpaperwallet.com -- which I intentionally designed to be easiest generator out there. Under the hood, it's identical to bitaddress.org (it's a "fork") but it just limits the interface to making individual wallets.
If you want super-dead easy *secure* paper wallets, I offer a ready-to-use bootable Ubuntu CD with the wallet software pre-installed:

I do recommend that people go offline (e.g. by powering off the router) before booting and while printing wallets.

Great questions.
1. There's no download of the ISO right now. I'm considering it, though truthfully I don't want to end up offering free tech support to legions of people wanting to checksum and/or use the ISO.
2. It's a CD. I burn these myself in a trusted environment using a burner with a stronger than average laser on the highest quality media I could find (JVC Taiyo Yuden premium stuff) at low speeds. Reason I mention this is that I'm aiming for compatibility even with old dusty computers whose optical drives are no longer in their prime. :)
3. The CD is based on Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS, indeed including Unity. I did not remove the shopping lens / amazon mothership -- mostly because I'm trying to keep my ISO as similar as possible to the distribution to simplify auditing.
4. If 12.04.3 LTS includes any non-FOSS software, then my CD includes it as well since I removed very little software. (I certainly didn't add any non-free software.)

Technically speaking ** No website makes safe paper wallets. ** You can produce safe wallets via HTML/javascript, but they should never be generated using a website. You should download the GitHub source code to your computer, verify the signature, and run the bitcoinpaperwallet.com or bitaddress.org code on your local computer, or better yet off of a live CD.

**Best printing combo** is laserjet + synthetic tear-proof paper e.g. Revlar.
Next best is inkjet + teslin 10mil synthetic paper, which makes your printouts waterproof.
**Storage:** fireproof safe. Careful with waterproof safes: the seal is so tight that even in dry climates, paper documents can get mildewy, moldy, destroyed. A zip-sealing bag is a good idea too.
**BIP38:** Not a bad idea, though it does make it less easy/likely for family to benefit from your wallets if you die and they're going through your safety deposit box for belongings. Great for backups, but I might recommend keeping your 'primary' unencrypted.
**Source:** I'm the bitcoinpaperwallet.com guy. I've done lots of tests, like:

**Bitcoinpaperwallet.com guy here.** Thanks for the feedback! Can you submit a picture of the complete wallet? I wonder if something funny happened with how it was cut or the size it was printed at. The stickers should never touch the printed codes. I've opened dozens of sealed wallets using my design and have never had this happen myself. I don't use a knife or anything -- I just use my fingers and open carefully like you see in the first few seconds of this video:
BTW the reason the private key is printed in triplicate, with the two alphanumeric copies of the key rotated 180 degrees against one another, is to make it so that you'd have to fairly destroy the whole folded portion of the wallet before having an unrecoverable key. You'd have to mess up 30% of the QR code, plus 50% of the top strip, plus the opposite 50% of the bottom strip. There's a lot that went into the design to guard against accidental tearing.

My point wasn't to be random -- in which case you'd just use diceware to pick a set of words and be done with it. My point is that you can come up with a sufficiently clever *non-random* (i.e. memorable to you) passphrase that still has enough entropy to avoid being brute-forced.

Good question! I didn't because I wanted to make keep the ISO verifiably identical to the official distribution (with the exception of the files I added to the Desktop.) Also, some people will want to be able to download printer drivers.
However the wallet generator does detect if your network connection is working, and if so at launch reminds to to unplug your router.

Good question! If you try out the [online version]( you'll see that mouse movements / keystrokes are used to gather enough entropy to create secure wallets -- same as bitaddress.org.
This might be excessive since the version of Firefox installed on the CD supports window.crypto.getRandomValues() but it sure doesn't hurt to wiggle your mouse around.
If you're super-cautious there's an option for skipping the RNG altogether. You can roll dice, or my favorite, [shuffle playing cards](
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:31:41
Myself I don't think of physical bitcoin safety as being regression. It's just about playing to your strengths. If you're someone who's fairly skilled with cryptography, long-term digital media storage, and setting up secure airgapped operating systems, then by all means digital storage is the way to go.
However if you're not skilled in these sorts of things, but you do feel you're smart about keeping valuable documents safe (e.g. passports, savings bonds) then you might be better off doing physical bitcoin storage -- at least until there's a more or less "turnkey" solution for safe digital storage that doesn't require expertise in the underlying security.
Just because bitcoin CAN be safeguarded digitally doesn't mean that it SHOULD be, especially in these wild-west days where there's an excess of hackers and a deficit of off-the-shelf secure digital storage solutions.
Edit: I figure I should identify the fact that I'm the bitcoinpaperwallet.com guy and obviously have a bias. :)

Hi there,
This is specifically supported (and recommended!) on my site 
Completely offline, without making any addresses go "live", you can use your computer's camera to scan your old wallet's barcode and generate a new version of your paper wallet but adding on BIP38. Your coins don't move anywhere. You're just making a duplicate of your old wallet but with encryption hiding the private key from plain sight.
Full instructions are under the heading "How do I convert a non-encrypted wallet to use BIP38?" on this page:
@_date: 2014-08-31 17:43:31
Not sure why someone downvoted your comment... This makes the most sense to me. Put all your BTC on paper wallets in mixed denominations of 1, maybe 2, no more than 5BTC. Keep a hot wallet using blockchain.info or a phone app like Mycelium. only sweep in what you need to spend every couple of months. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:27:53
Maybe difficult to modify is a good thing. How would an attacker go about inserting his own rogue RNG into one of these devices, given physical access to one? Would he have to flash firmware with some special device, or would it be simply replacing some binary file after plugging it into any old computer?
@_date: 2014-02-05 05:20:33

True, but I think you made the opposite point. A better use of your analogy is one where, MtGox IS the browser implementation, and the Bitcoin protocol is equivalent to the HTTP/W3 protocol. And in both cases, yes it is appropriate to blame the "browser" (MtGox/IE) for faulty implementations of the well documented protocol.

I'll take part the blame because I haven't yet found a list of printers properly supported by the Ubuntu LiveCD distro. (Anyone know of one?) Anyway, private message me a detail about your identity so I can find your order and I'll issue you a refund for the CD since you couldn't use it.
@_date: 2014-07-30 05:11:16
1) Get this CD 
2) Turn off your internet, and boot to the CD
3) Print paper wallets.
IMO a strong BIP38 password is not at all necessary. A basic one like "2chickenfeet" will be plenty enough to stop anyone who hasn't invested in a supercomputer network to attack your particular wallet (assuming they get the private key -- which they shouldn't if you keep it in a safe place.)
@_date: 2014-02-05 22:57:49
That's a really neat implementation you have. However that would put me in a position of disabling the wallet generation (or notifying users that the wallet generation is going to be somewhat weak) if users race right to the print front page tab...

Since my own site (bitcoinpaperwallet.com) is a fork of bidaddress.org and uses the identical RNG &amp; entropy collection, I've been triple-inspecting every github update to bitaddress.org for over a year. Here's what I can say with confidence:
* Prior to 2013, people much, much smarter than me did deep investigations into bitaddress.org's code and found no problems. Bitaddress.org was definitely the gold standard for paper wallet generation.
* Since 2013, I've investigated every line of code changed, and found no issues except for one: bitaddress.org has a bug in which BIP38 encryption is broken (fails to decrypt) when using Safari 5.x. We found a workaround and fixed the problem at bitcoinpaperwallet.com, but you still shouldn't use Safari 5.x at bitaddress.org. If you think you might have made BIP38 wallets at bitaddress.org using an old version of Safari, you should move those bitcoins to a new wallet ASAP (using the same version of Safari, the only way this is possible.)
* My site, and then a little later on, bitaddress.org, uses window.crypto.getRandomValues() as the basis for the RNG when available. (Plus some extra entropy, just to be on the safe side.) My site will warn you if your browser does not support this (allegedly) strong crypto library.
FWIW, my favorite way to generate a random wallet when I'm feeling especially paranoid about RNGs is this:
1) Generate a random wallet
2) Copy the public key to my clipboard, manually alter a few letters and numbers, and then use *that* as the source for a so-called "brain wallet". This way even if there's a deterministic (or criminal) flaw in the RNG, you throw a little human variability on top of it.

Agreed, apple2014 is more like a 20 bit password. I used an [inferior online calculator]( 
My thinking though is that 20 bits is still fine for a BIP38 password in most cases. That's not to say that 'AppleNoodleCrazyMonkey4192' isn't a better password. It's just that I think people should be more concerned about their families being unable to recover funds after they die than they should be concerned about having wallets physically stolen by someone with substantial technical skills or technical contacts.

You can run the generator without relying on the PRNG at all:
The generator on the CD comes with step-by-step instructions for rolling dice, shuffling cards, or picking passphrases to make your paper wallets.
What's more, even a total novice can confirm that the keys from your self-supplied random data are true by matching them against the keys generated by bitaddress or bit2factor using the same data.
Easy squeezy, no trust required at all!
Meanwhile, the PRNG is verifiably identical to the one used at bitaddress.org, from which it's forked. This is all open source, no mysteries.

This generator (bitcoinpaperwallet.com) has not only BIP38 decrypting, but a camera QR code scanning function to make it painless.
Other sites/software that do BIP38 decryption: bitaddress.org, bit2factor.org

Regarding checksums, the way to make it easiest on users is to make sure that your entire code lives in a single HTML file. Using jquery/jqueryUI makes this a bit tricky. (BTW glad to hear you're using an off-the-shelf jqueryUI -- it's the filename that threw me off.)

Yes, I believe I saw your secure wallet post when I was setting up [instructions for dice/card]( generation -- recommending 62 die rolls or (my favorite) 31 well shuffled cards.
I think there's been some confusion in the past about die rolls because bitaddress.org actually has instructions for creating a *base-6 Key* with 99 rolls (no SHA-256 involved I think.) But as you point out, brainwalleting 62 die rolls is just as random.

@_date: 2014-01-14 02:30:30


Yes exactly that. The achilles heel in this whole affair is that you must be generating TRULY random keys. If you are using a computer, and there's an even slight "wobble" to the randomness, then the search space collapses considerably and the first person to discover and define the boundaries of the "wobble" can steal the wallets that were generated using that less-than-truly-random source.
This actually happened last year when a [flaw was discovered]( in how the Android OS picked random numbers.

Laser printers give you the most longevity, because they're essentially melting plastic (toner) onto paper. If you use waterproof/tearproof paper, they should be extremely durable.
You can see my recommendations for paper/ink/laminating here:
Now this may go without saying, but just in case it's not obvious to everyone: **do not laminate a thermal printout (e.g. piper printout)**. The entire paper will turn black, because heat is used to mimic the effect of ink.

My recommendation is to remove mention of "wallets" from this primer. A wallet is a complicated bit of software, and it's not actually fundamental to Bitcoin.

I think there's definitely a need for that, and I've actually seen some projects aiming in that direction. "Bitubuntu" or something like that?
Anyway with my own project, here's what you can do:
1. Install vanitygen, and use that to generate your private keys
2. Use my generator, but don't rely on the random key generator. Just paste in your private keys from vanitygen.

Unfortunately, the ISO is CD only, it's not optical-USB hybrid. If your computer can boot to a USB thumb drive (in other words, if it's not a Mac) I recommend:
1. burn the standard [Ubuntu 12.04 CD image]( to your thumb drive
2. boot to the thumb drive
3. download the [github ZIP]( of my generator, unzip it, check the PGP signature.
That's it! The CD is really meant for people who either (a) don't have the skills to work with ISOs and check PGP signatures, or (b) appreciate the added security of using read-only optical media (virus proof!) and never having to go online.
**Edit:** I don't mean to discourage anyone using a Mac from figuring out how to make a bootable USB flash drive. Just be prepared for a little work. Out of the box, your Mac won't let you simply option-boot to USB the way you can to a CD, and the official Ubuntu instructions for making a Live Boot USB for mac simply don't work. YMMV.

As magical as it sounds -- the sets of keys you produce entirely offline -- whether using computer software or a set of dice or casting yarrow sticks or any random process you like -- are perfectly valid without any interaction with the Internet or the blockchain.
The moment that you transfer coins into the public key, then the public key and the balance will be recorded in the blockchain, on the internet, but still, the private key will never been "registered" anywhere. The private key is a way of proving that you are the person who generated the public key,  and it doesn't need to be exercised until the moment you withdraw from the paper wallet -- even years down the road.

Hi, thanks for the kind words/support.
I think you've narrowed down the problem very well. From what you wrote, it sounds like even in a case where the camera QR code scanner fails, if you were to type in the alphanumeric private key, it would succeed. Correct? (Phew! That's very good news.)
It might be that the javascript library we use to read QR codes is buggy. You're right that QR codes are supposed to have error correction and checksums, so any incorrect characters would be the fault of either the QR code generator (bitaddress) or the QR code reader (bitcoinpaperwallet). Probably the latter. I'll try to reproduce the problem myself. If I have any troubles getting the problem to crop up, I'll probably ask you for some more help.
Thanks for digging deeper into this!

Nice one. Here's a standard deviation for you from bitcoinpaperwallet.com . @_date: 2014-07-31 06:00:08
As I understand it, someone would have to dedicate 1000s of hours of cpu time ( a whole cracking network)  to brute force even a very simple BIP38 password. And they would have to have your encrypted key to start with ( unlike brain wallets which can be discovered in the ether.) 
So I'd just recommend a  very simple bip38 to discourage casual theft, eg a roommate looking through your things. Nobody with a supercomputing botnet will be looking through your desk, right?

Huzzah! New to this release, there is a brand new preference that lets you limit the number of cores used. Thank you Bitcoin devs!
FWIW I think the language/interface could be made a little [less geeky]( -- e.g. rename:
"number of script verification threads" to "Number of CPU cores to allocate" 
and instead of choosing a number from minus 16 to 16, with 0 being "use all you like/default" I think this should be a dropdown with options like "default, as many cores as possible, 1/2 of available cores, 1/4 of available cores, 1/8 of available cores".

If you're concerned about printer security, there are a few vectors to worry about. I cover these at:
1. Use the "dumbest" printer you can find. Preferably one with no WiFi connection, definitely one that doesn't have a hard drive that stores print queues.
2. Be aware of the fact that your operating system at least temporarily saves printouts as files to disk. Those files *should* be deleted immediately after printing (I've done traces/tests to confirm this on OS X at least) but it may depend on the operating system. Other OS's may keep print spool files around for a couple days/minutes/hours/reboots. I'm not sure.
3. Because every OS saves files to a spool/cache, even for a moment, you have reason to worry about trojans installed on your computer which monitor your print spool directory for any QR codes or private keys. On OS X for example, all a trojan would have to do is monitor all files created in /private/var/spool/cups/cache/ and scan them for keys. So, be sure you're using a super-clean OS that couldn't conceivably have any viruses/trojans on it.

Hi there,
I've tried to demystify all the ins and outs of safely using paper wallets for long term storage here:
I've listed the security precautions in order of importance.
FWIW: For long term storage I still think a few copies of a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet are the best way to go. Keep one in your home, one in a safety deposit box or with a family member.
Encrypt it with a *very* simple password you will never forget, e.g. 'usualpassword'. BIP38 passwords do not need to be super secure as brute forcing them is incredibly expensive/time-consuming.

Not only that, but you are *forced* to supply enough entropy before you're allowed to create wallets. Well, there's a 'skip' button in case you're not planning on using the generator.
Meanwhile I confirmed your bug on using text entry on android 4.4 -- I'll fix this ASAP. In the meantime you can actually drag your finger on the screen to slowly provide some entropy. Once you feel safe "enough" just hit Skip. IMO the manual entropy gathering is totally overkill for modern browsers. I have reasonable confidence in window.crypto.

Hi, bitcoinpaperwallet.com author here. First of all kudos on making a beautiful visualizer that shows how entropy is being gathered. I have a feeling this may have influenced bitaddress.org, whose next release also includes a nice visualizer to give feedback on collected mouse movements, and which refuses to run unless sufficient entropy has been collected.
However I'm unclear on your basis for claiming to have *"the first site capable of creating perfectly secure offline wallets"*. To substantiate this claim, please (1) describe what's insecure about projects like my own, and (2) show what's uniquely secure about yours.
Here's what I'm like to see addressed with your own project, security-wise:
1) Your site doesn't ever take advantage of window.crypto.getRandomValues(), which is the only W3 standard for strong crypto random number generation. From our discussion on bitcointalk, I interpret you as saying that mouse movements will always be better than getRandomValues(), but that's a pretty tall claim to make. In my opinion, mouse movement (or rolling dice, even better) should be a *backup* for when a bad browser or OS is detected and getRandomValues() can't be trusted.
2) Your site integrates a 228KB compressed jquery-UI build. Since it's customized, I don't think it's reasonable for anyone to audit this code. I'm not saying you're hiding something in there, but since it can't be audited this makes it a huge blooming target for a hacker. If I got access to your development machine, that's definitely where I'd hide a malicious function or two. I recommend you don't customize this build, that way to audit your code all we need to do is confirm the checksums of all the libraries you are relying on (jquery, etc.)

As far as I know, there are no firmware WIFI virus hacks out in the wild yet, so I wouldn't worry about this much at all. That's government espionage level stuff, like the viruses that were used to destroy Iran's totally offline uranium enrichment machines. 
The bigger concern with printers is using huge office printers (especially combination printers/copiers) that have built-in hard drives for queuing print jobs and that store a copy of each document that's been printed. (!)

Isn't there also an alphanumeric representation of the private key?
On my paper wallets ( the private key is represented three times: once as a QR code, and twice as an alphanumeric code (one of those rotated 180 degrees to make it less likely that a fold will wipe out the same letter/number twice.)
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:59:35
Did you choose the option to encrypt with BIP38? This definitely makes your wallet MUCH safer, because then even if an evil roommate or thief steals or makes a copy of your wallet, your coins are still safe. Your BIP38 password could even be something very simple, easy to remember, like "BitcoinPassword".

I'd do this:
1) Using your own secure computer, generate a BIP38-password protected paper wallet
2) Print it out as a PDF and save it to a USB drive
3) Take the USB drive to a place with a public printer and print out your PDF. Even if someone snoops your PDF, they would have to crack your password, and BIP38 is pretty tough to crack.
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:35:31
I'd be careful using a computer that hasn't been updated since 2008, because:
1: Very old versions of Javascript lack the function for producing cryptographically secure random numbers (crypto.getRandomValues)
2: (If it's a mac) [Safari 6.05 had a bug]( that resulted in producing invalid private keys. Firefox &amp; chrome would be okay though.
If your old computer has a CD drive, you might consider the live-boot Ubuntu CD I sell that's preconfigured for making wallets. Just boot from CD, print wallets, that's it. Should be safe to run even on a computer whose hard drive is infested with viruses. :)

Hey there. If you're asking for my opinion regarding the security of the *generator* shared by bitaddress.org and bitcoinpaperwallet.com, I would propose that no bitcoin software has been as thoroughly vetted or tested. I think the randomness of the generator is frankly over-the-top and excessive. For over 4 years, JavaScript has had a built in cryptographic strength random number generator that's been superior to anything available in the host operating systems (e.g. android, which *did* have a bad RNG a few years back.) And on top of the crypto RNG, pointbiz of bitaddress put in that additional "wiggle your mouse" RNG seed feature. Probably totally unnecessary, but still nice to have. And finally, in the case of my own generator at  there's simple instructions for bypassing the RNG and making your own random numbers by picking cards from a shuffled deck. (Very effective, also very quick compared to rolling dice.)

If I understand your question correctly, then the answer is "no". You can type in any passphrase you like and generate a BIP38 wallet that decrypts to the SHA-256 hash of the passphrase. However it sounds like you're talking about two-party / two-factor BIP38 like you'd use at  We did not implement any support for that.

I see.
I gotta say, I'm a bit concerned about the security of a web service like this one:
I trust you, and I trust your source code, but you've made a very soft target in that hackers will try to hack into your website and change the code so that the funds are sent to them instead of the destination wallet. (Or, if they're sneaky, only send 1 out of every 10 transactions to themselves so that it goes undetected for longer.) 
The problem with encouraging users to use a web service like this is that there's no safeguard like you would have downloading the HTML via github, e.g. you PGP signing the code to make sure it hasn't been tampered with.
Any ideas how you might make sure that visitors can be sure they're not visiting a site that's been tampered with?
PS: I think the general idea is very good and important. It's frustratingly difficult to transfer paper wallet funds to some wallet services. 
PPS: You might want to make it clear that BIP38 paper wallets are not supported.

I disagree that a 2MB hardfork can only be achieved by disenfranchising Core. Core has stated *plans* for a hard fork to increase blocksize at some unspecified future date. What puzzles me is why they won't seriously consider doing that hard fork now, and then take all the time they need to carefully test and deploy Segwit. A hard fork now may in fact be much easier than a hard fork in 2018.

This might explain why the default phase on the website is still **correct horse battery staple**. [Almost every day]( funds are sent to this brain wallet (and of course instantly swept away.) 1,200+ deposits so far, totaling 4.3 BTC. It seems ~~irresponsible~~ criminal to have what *looks* like a randomly generated phrase as a default passphrase without any notice that says, "Hey this is an inside joke from a comic. Don't use it."

I also do a significant amount of commerce with Bitcoin, and I got in serious trouble 2 months ago because I didn't anticipate how high the transaction fees could go during busy times:
I had a single transaction that [took 7+ hours to confirm]( because I only paid $0.70. **I didn't realize that I had to pay at least US$4.00 for a speedy confirmation.**
Not everybody is sending super-small transactions that get picked up for 5 cents. In my case, my wallet got filled up with lots of smallish ($20) payments and then I wanted to transfer those funds somewhere else. This isn't an edge case: this is what Bitcoin is supposed to be for.

You can save yourself a couple steps, even.
1) [Launch]( the generator. You can safely skip the entropy collection step because you don't need the RNG :)
2) Click 'Print Front'
3) Click 'Enter my own'
4) Type in your die rolls  -- there's a [help link]( if you need instructions.
5) Click the checkbox for BIP38 and type in your passphrase
6) Print out your wallet. 
That's it!

To me these two statements are head-scratchingly contradictory:
True, when there's a hard fork, some full nodes will be left behind and won't resume validating the blockchain until they upgrade.
But if you share that concern, what makes you presume that EVERYONE will upgrade to Segwit, which will require full nodes to upgrade *as well as every software wallet, every hardware wallet, etc*?

My suspicion is that binaries aren't being rushed out because anyone who runs them would likely get DDOS'd. That's what happened to folks who tried running the XT client. It's even what's happening to Coinbase this morning, presumably because of their support of Classic.
Until Classic reaches its sea change moment, any organization or computing resources identified with Classic run a risk of getting DDOS'd. I think it's a smart move to withhold the Classic binaries until the time is ripe.

What's the scenario in which someone loses money if they don't upgrade after the hardfork? The worst case scenario I see is that someone could be messing around with the old minority chain, but it's not like their balance in the new majority chain would be impacted, right?

A funny thing is that paper wallets do not need to be synchronized with anything at all. The private key on your paper wallet is generated at random, and with such a degree of randomness that there's virtually no chance of a "collision" (picking a private key that's already been used, or will ever be used again.)
As such you can send bitcoins to your paper wallet's public key without your private key having ever touched an online device, much less the blockchain itself.

Playing my own devil's advocate here:
1. You'd want to make sure the signed generate-wallet.html file on the disk is the same as the one on github.
2. You'd want to compare my generate-wallet.html against bitaddress.org's HTML (considered to be trustworthy) -- just to make sure I only fooled around with the design and add-on features, not the crypto code itself.
3. Ideally, you'd want to make sure I didn't pervert the Ubuntu OS random number generator or Firefox binary itself.
 is the really hard one, so until someone posts their own vetting of my CD -- for example by following my [instructions]( to replicate the same CD so as to independently verify the hashes, you're just stuck with trusting me.

For me to transfer the $600 I have sitting in my hot wallet right now, Mycelium tells me my transaction fee will be $11.00 ($13.50 if I want 'priority').
This is a reminder that 50 cents or $1 is a *best case* scenario. When you're an *actual bitcoin merchant* like myself, your transactions will be larger and will cost more money because they will include payments from multiple customers.
And I'm not selling coffee. My orders average about $30 each.
Meanwhile, about 70% of my customers are choosing to pay me with PayPal instead of Bitcoin.
Guess how much it costs to move $600 of my sales from PayPal to my bank?

Okay, so what list *would* convince you that there's a consensus? Imagine you could cherry pick from all the individuals and organizations out there, and get a signed statement from each that they supported the core roadmap. What would that list look like?
I'm quite serious here, not trying to be combative. I think it would be helpful to define what a "signatory consensus" would look like so we can ask for those signatures. In my opinion, signatories should be organizations that have significant skin in the game. They should represent large bodies of users, and have a strong financial interest in the success of Bitcoin as we know it.
For example, I'd like to see Mycelium and Breadwallet express their opinions.  I also think the voice of the major exchanges should count. I'd like to hear from some large merchants that have trailblazed in accepting Bitcoin such as Overstock.com. 
Which organizations would you like to hear from? What would persuade you?

Yes, [it does]( Recommend running a local copy of course. 
Conveniently, the "verify" tab has a QR code scanner so you can scan with your webcam and not have to type in all those digits and give yourself repeated heart attacks when you type in one letter/number wrong. :)
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:10:53
Okay thanks this makes sense. Personally, I'm not at all concerned that Blockchain/bitpay/coinbase could possibly pick the "wrong" chain -- the fork won't happen if there's not obvious agreement throughout the economy.
But I do see how a merchant who simply runs the core software and doesn't rely on any 3rd party service to take payments could end up in trouble if they aren't informed or don't understand the importance of upgrading their wallet. I think this is a small minority of merchants, but it's important nevertheless.

hey there,  author here. If you used a laser printer, be careful when laminating. The heat can fuse / melt the toner in the inner folds and make the private key difficult or impossible to recover.

You can do it all offline. What you'll do is download the HTML source code from GitHub and run the .html file from your local computer.

Nope. They're calculating it perfectly right. Mycelium has been very accurate in these regards. It has to do with the KB size of my transaction as I am a merchant who sells stuff for BTC.
@_date: 2016-03-20 20:29:40
I have this same question. Was very useful for scenarios like load up some BTC from a paper wallet and then sell on the exchange. Now I have to use an intermediary wallet to sweep the balance.
Last time I had to use an intermediary to get my paper wallet balance to Coinbase, I missed out on the opportunity to sell at $500 because it took 8 hours for my transfer to get confirmations. (On that particular day, I would have had to pay a $4 fee to get my transfer to go through quickly.)

Yes, your verification steps are good *except* that bitaddress and bitcoinpaperwallet.com use the same crypto code. So if one site is compromised, both are (unless me or pointbiz are trying to pull a fast one :)
So, for the truly paranoid, after using my site to generate your private key from your sequence of playing cards, you would want to use some completely different bit of software to confirm that the same private key is generated from the same sequence of cards (same SHA256 hash.)
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:35:15
Unfortunately mycelium doesn't tell me the KB for the transaction, and I didn't click the send button because the fee was too high for me to stomach. I'm going to wait until the backlog clears. As for paying $1-2, I'm not willing to risk the anxiety and frustration in case the transaction gets orphaned altogether. Intellectually I know that an orphaned transaction is no big deal, but it still gives me the sweats. I don't like to gamble with my transactions. For me the point of Bitcoin has always been the ability to transfer funds (1) fast, (2) securely, and (3) affordably.

If you want long term paper wallets, first be sure to use a laser printer instead of inkjet. Laser toner is melted plastic -- already fairly waterproof. Ink is incredibly susceptible to moisture, it just takes [a drop]( to ruin a whole wallet.
To make the paper itself waterproof / tear-proof, use **Revlar**  with your laserprinter. 
If you're using an inkjet, check out **Teslin** paper which actually makes your inks water-fast. You can spray your ink prints with **Krylon Preserve It!** as a double-safe measure.
Laminating your wallets is also a super-excellent choice, however take care if you laminate a laser print as the toner can fuse to itself when folded and heated.
I discuss all this and more here:

Hi, I'm the fellow from bitcoinpaperwallet.com (an easy-to-use fork of bitaddress.) Here's what to do:
1. Download the software from github: 
2. Launch the HTML file on your local computer. Turn off your internet connection if you're feeling paranoid.
3. Click the "Validate or Decrypt" tab
4. Type your private key into the box and click the validate button. This won't move your funds, it just verifies that the key is valid, and it shows you the corresponding public key. If it doesn't work, try some letter substitutions, e.g. letter l (lowercase L) instead of 1, letter O (uppercase o) instead of zero, etc. 
My software will also let you print out a backup of your metal key as a new paper wallet (with a QR code this time.)
Any private key that validates should work fine at blockchain.info or whatever. But it's best to fool around with your private key on your own computer disconnected from the internet.

**I believe Bitcoin is peer-to-peer digital money.**
I agree with your analysis that Bitcoin needs to grow by stages, but I'm concerned that Core is prematurely working on more advanced stages -- the groundwork for sidechains and settlement networks -- while the regular old peer-to-peer money stage is being stressed and needs relief in the form of a simple blocksize increase.
I understand the argument that deploying Segwit is effectively a blocksize increase, but it seems like an unnecessarily complicated solution to a fairly simple problem. It's a bit like upgrading to a new car when all you needed was new tires.
Hard forks *are* coming at some point. Nobody disagrees with this assertion, including Core. So why not have one now, when blocksize relief is an obvious necessity and the simplest possible hard fork would solve the problem? This would give Segwit at least two years to mature and be carefully deployed across all layers of software and hardware.

You might be overdoing it with destroying the computer afterwards, unless that makes it fun :)
My site lists all the things you should do, in order of paranoia: 
Most significant things:
Start with a completely clean linux installation. Then download bitcoinpaperwallet.com from github and actually go through the instructions to check the PGP signature on the code.
Take the computer offline and generate your wallets.  My service has instructions for "rolling" your own random numbers using a deck of playing cards. (Much faster than using dice, probably more effective as well.)
Absolutely do use BIP38 encryption, since that means you don't have to worry about people finding your keys, or your printer storing them.
If you're hip to setting up linux or doing the PGP signature checking, you can also just order my CD (under $20 including shipping anywhere) which makes it as easy as boot to CD, print wallets, that's it.

I disagree. A hard fork is absolutely in our future, unless we plan on having 1MB blocks forever, which nobody is advocating. The question is do we wait 1 year, or do we carefully do a hard fork now (in the next 6 months) which is guaranteed to give us the breathing room we need? 
As I understand it, SegWit itself won't prune down blocks without widespread implementation. A hard fork guarantees us 2x capacity, right now. I'm wary of rushing to deploy complicated SegWit code which forces software/hardware changes *across the board* in order to obtain relief from over-full blocks.

When I receive money at PayPal, I pay 3%, so you're right in by the time I see that $600, I've already given them $18. But after that, it's free for me to move the money to my bank. However, that 3% is fixed and easily anticipated: and if you look at [my order form]( you'll see that when people pay with Bitcoin, I've always passed the 3% in savings on to them. I should probably stop doing that since I'm now losing that 3% whether they pay with BTC or PP.
Moreover at present with Bitcoin, transaction fees are really *double* that $11-$13 -- because the fees were paid once (for me to receive the money) and a second time (now to move the money).
My point here is that all of a sudden after selling things with Bitcoin for 3+ years, PayPal has become more appealing both as a buyer and as a merchant -- which is shocking considering how much we all despise PayPal.

I appreciate the very reasonable tone of this letter, and his focus on doing something both *soon* and *simple*.

IMO a dumb printer doesn't totally solve the issue because a more soft vector of attack is the spool files on the operating system itself. Prints don't usually go straight from your browser to the USB cable... they get saved even as temporary (yet grabbable) files -- e.g. on OS X @

Canton from  here.
No, you do not need to do anything. The paper wallets you have now will work fine after the fork.
The only thing to be cautious about is moving funds around (e.g. sweeping paper wallets) during the days immediately before and after the hard fork occurs.

I think that hiding valuables is risky. The likelihood of a cyber-capable burglar making off with your funds must be less than the chances of you dying from a car crash, heart attack, etc. -- and having your funds lost to the mists of time.
What I recommend is *encrypted* seeds (or paper wallets, which is what I help people make at  stored in a manner such that they're obviously valuable so that a family member going through your belongings would recognize that this piece of paper has value.
Make multiple copies. Keep one at home, another in a safety deposit box or with a family member. Use a password that's easy to remember and that your family can guess, e.g. 'where we buried our chickens'.

Hi, author of bitcoinpaperwallet.com here (same crypto code as bitaddress.org) -- if you're feeling paranoid, be sure to check out the link on my generator for "Enter my own key, dice rolls, etc." -- this has instructions for using a deck of cards to "roll" your own keys. Fairly fast, and super-random, possibly even better than using dice.
This way you're not relying on my code for the random number generation at all.

It's a fork from bitaddress.org, so the crypto-code can be easily compared to make sure I'm not doing anything funny behind the scenes. But the wallet generator is [hugely different]( I omitted bitaddress.org features like bulk wallet generation, and instead focused on adding:
* two-sided folding paper wallet design to guard against snooping/tampering. Also, attractive designs for printing wallets in 10+ different languages, plus support for a couple of alt coins (litecoin and dogecoin at the moment.)
* "two way" BIP38, by which I mean you can actually scan a non-BIP38 wallet and convert it to BIP38. No other service offers this right now.
* making paper wallets easier to make and use. step-by-step instructions for generating wallets (including rolling dice, shuffling cards, etc.) and the wallet design itself includes tips for using a paper wallet on the reverse
Easy to see what I mean here:
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:41:08
The code has been written and is [fairly simple and limited in scope]( I think the hesitation to release a client isn't because it's difficult, but because (1) Classic still needs to finalize whether this is a single 2MB fork, or a fork with a progressive increase of some kind, and (2) if a classic client were released today, anyone running it would likely get DDOS'd.
Edit: I just read that small-block proponent Luke Jr. contributed a pull request for Bitcoin Classic that would (in his own words) "[**fire all the miners**]( by changing the proof of work algorithm to sabotage all the existing ASICs. I commend Bitcoin Classic on keeping its actual client executable software out of users hands until the scorched earth rhetoric and disingenuous activity dies down.

I have one vote *against* blockchain.info. It should be fine for this purpose since it allows you to set the miner fee manually when transferring your swept funds to coinbase -- essential if you want to make sure your bitcoin arrives at coinbase fast.
However, when blockchain does the initial sweeping of your paper wallet, you can't specify the miner fee :( so that can delay things somewhat.
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:57:04
AFAIK Coinbase doesn't have a way to import or sweep private keys. (They used to, but not anymore.)
You'll need to sweep or import the key into a hot wallet, and then send it to coinbase.
For example, you could setup a wallet at blockchain.info, sweep the balance, then send it to coinbase.
Here are [step-by-step instructions]( for sweeping into blockchain.info's web wallet.

Here are some security considerations and general bits of advice:
@_date: 2016-06-19 11:46:04
Printing a paper wallet is basically just *writing down a private key that "stores" some bitcoin*. A private key is like a password. It's something that should be kept very very safe because anyone who has your private key can move (spend) the bitcoins associated with that private key.
If you produce a private key (paper wallet) and transfer funds to it, the idea is to keep that paper wallet safe the same was as you would cash and jewels since there's no online backup. This keeps your paper wallet safe from hackers, but it could now get lost, burned in a house fire, eaten by your dog, etc.
Someday when you want to spend or sell your coins, you will "sweep" the balance off of the paper wallet onto a hot wallet (e.g. a trezor or phone app or electrum) so you can use them. Sweeping just means, "transfer the coins away from the address on the paper wallet to an address controlled by my hot wallet."
If your exchange is offering to help you print out a paper wallet, you have to trust that the exchange does a good job making private keys and keeping them safe so that you (and only you) ever have a copy. I don't think this trust can be built unless the exchange allows you to review the source code for their paper-wallet making service. (Unlikely.) 
The other option is to use open source software like mine [bitcoinpaperwallet]( or [bitaddress]( each of which should be operated following as many of these six security cautions as you can mange to follow:
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:05:18
For anyone reading this:
If you are BIP38 encrypting a paper wallet, a "a 20 character random uppercase/lowercase numerical password" is totally overkill. Something like,
is totally sufficient.
This isn't like brain wallets where people can steal your funds by simply scanning trillions of hashed passwords. To steal your password-protected paper wallet funds, someone has to (1) physically obtain your encrypted key, and then (2) burn through HUGE amounts of CPU to crack even a 4-letter password.
You are at much higher risk of forgetting your BIP38 encrypted passphrase than you are of being subject to a brute force cracking attempt that will burn up 16 CPUs for months or years straight.
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:16:18
This is my site:
It's a fork of bitaddress.org that adds some tamper-evidence and physical security features to the bitaddress crypto code.
If you want a crazy-easy way to print wallets offline from a secure operating system, I sell a customized live boot ubuntu CD with the generator pre-installed. It ships worldwide for about $18. For most systems it's as easy as boot from CD, print wallets, and you're done.

cantonbecker here. trusting [bitcoinpaperwallet]( is the pretty much the same thing as trusting bitaddress (my project's crypto code is forked from and identical to bitaddress). I consider pointbiz (bitaddress developer) to be as trustworthy as it gets in our community. Never heard of a single issue/complaint since 2011. As for myself, you can check out my [trust summary on bitcointalk](

Neat! These could be beautiful, esp. if machine etched.
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:08:00
I think paper wallets are the best current way to store bitcoins long term, say 2 years or more.
I don't like trusting long-term storage to actual wallet devices or software since they the software may no longer be supported, or the devices may no longer work after a hard-fork, etc.
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:13:29
Hi there,
blockchain.info does still support importing paper wallets. They just moved it.
Here are [step-by-step instructions]( for sweeping into blockchain.info's web wallet. 
I do wish coinbase would restore the ability to sweep paper wallets. It's a pain in the ass to have to first sweep to a hot wallet and then transfer the coins, especially since that can take a long time if you don't get your fees right.
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:50:23
I'm the fellow who does 
Here's what I recommend:
1. Make a test wallet, I recommend using the BIP38 encryption option, and send $1 to it.
2. Practice sweeping the $1 to your favorite hot wallet (e.g. mycelium.)
3. Once you've confirmed that you successfully sent and retrieved money, destroy the test wallet.
4. Now make your "real" wallet and follow the best security practices you can muster.
5. Send funds to that wallet.
You are correct that you shouldn't transfer funds away from your paper wallets. Only transfer funds *once* -- the day you sweep the entire balance to a hot wallet and stop using that paper wallet altogether.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:15:57
Thanks for the clear explanation/example. I'm still unclear on how -- as a merchant -- I'd be exposed to risk accepting a payment shortly after the fork. If someone sends me a payment, before I ship my product out, I just have to make sure that my transaction is confirmed *according to the correct/majority chain* correct? It's not that someone can send me "old" coins vs. "new" coins. It's a matter of which blockchain I check for confirmations. And after the hardfork, it's reasonable to assume that sources like blockchain.info, bitpay, and coinbase will all be referring to the longest/consensus chain, correct?
Again, correct me if I'm wrong on this. As a merchant who ships out product from Bitcoin sales every week, I'm very curious.
@_date: 2016-06-07 17:59:04
It's possible to print a very secure paper wallet with a lot less technical experience than you've already demonstrated. Nothing to worry about. Or, this is my $18 solution which includes shipping to anywhere in the world:
Here are 6 very basic considerations for making your own paper wallets:
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:40:27
My favorite is Mycelium. I believe you can sweep an encrypted paper wallet (they call it "cold storage") and send it to a new address in one fell swoop.
I agree it's lame that coinbase dropped support for importing paper wallets. Baffling since selling bitcoin off of a cold storage wallet would seem to be a very typical and useful scenario.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:56:47
I don't think dropbox is a safe place to put anything that you're worried about being stolen. Consider [that time]( when Dropbox accidentally left everyone's accounts wide open for 4 hours.
That said, if you *do* want to save Bitcoin on dropbox, a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet should be okay to keep there, provided your password isn't easy to guess. My reasoning here is that some folks have [publicly posted their BIP38 encrypted paper wallets]( for everyone to see. That's how confident you can be in BIP38.
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:09:23
Don't be ridiculous. There's no practical way for buyers and merchants to use BCH (yet).
@_date: 2017-01-20 19:48:53


No, not a concern. bitaddress.org (and my fork of the site,  both rely on Javascript's strong random number generator, which *should* be totally sufficient for generating a series of non-predictable numbers. The mouse-wiggling is just an extra precaution to set the "seed" or starting point for the series of random numbers. There should be no difference in how random the series is whether you generate 10 wallets in a row, or whether you launch the app 10 times and wiggle your mouse 10 times.
@_date: 2016-06-25 21:01:21
Just tried to purchase the same game with bitcoin on your recommendation. Steam [errored out]( trying to get to bitpay. Oh well.
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:16:05
I can't guess whether or not Coinbase *in particular* is going to get hacked or freeze funds, but in general the odds aren't great. I believe something like 33% of online exchanges have been hacked, historically.
If you plan to use your coins from time to time (e.g. move them around, buy stuff, accept new funds) then put them on a hardware wallet.
If you plan to squirrel away your coins for 3+ years as an investment, just put them onto a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet. Make few copies and keep them safe in different locations. My site has more information on how to do this: 
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:11:52
Thanks for the kudos! I disagree that an HD seed would be any easier or safer. These are BIP38 encrypted, which is safer than an unencrypted HD seed. (Encrypted HD seeds are not well supported at this point.) As for easy: These are ridiculously easy to use. Just load up Mycelium on your phone, point it at the QR code, and sweep the balance.
@_date: 2016-06-08 22:28:35
Identical! No difference at all. "Sweeping" is just shorthand for "taking the entire balance off of a paper wallet and moving it to a hot wallet you control."
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:38:09
Hi there, author of  here. Both sites use the same RNG, as my site is a fork of bitaddress and is cryptographically identical. All my site does is simplify the interface and change the output for printing a tri-fold wallet with some tamper-evident features, allow custom designs, allow BIP38 encrypting of previously non-encrypted wallets, that sort of thing.
As far as I know, nobody has discovered any weakness in the RNG despite this code having been run continuously since something like 2011. It's probably the most tested/vetted code in the bitcoin space, *maybe* only second to the bitcoin reference client itself.
The most significant instance of an RNG being compromised that I remember is when a bug was found in the Android OS RNG, and at least one bit of android software was relying on it 100%. Some bitcoin were stolen. However, folks using my site or bitaddress.org on Android would not have been affected because the Javascript RNG was in fact stronger than the one built into the OS.
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:48:01
Yeah that still doesn't smell right to me. Can you double check this particular fact, or math it out in detail? If true, that's a little horrifying.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:09:58


That's a really good point, and it's why you need to choose your wallet (or paper wallet) software very carefully. My site  is forked from the BitAddress site, whose cryptographic code has been scrutinized probably more than any other Bitcoin software since 2011. Be sure to follow the safety instructions on my site no matter what paper wallet generator you use.


Make a paper wallet. Transfer a small amount of BTC to the wallet. Verify the incoming funds by searching for the public address on blockchain.info. Then verify that your private key really does correspond to your public key by using the "Validate" tab on my site. You can do this offline, meaning your private key has never touched the Internet.
@_date: 2016-06-19 11:36:34


(As the guy who made  I obviously recommend safely generated paper wallets as the best way to store bitcoin longterm, e.g. as an investment. Both my site and bitaddress.org (which use the same crypto code) should always be run by downloading the source code from github, and verifying it if you're technically able to. They should not be run directly from the website. They should also only be run on a computer that you are certain is virus free.
Here are 6 succinct tips for safe paper wallet use:
If your intent is not only to keep bitcoins safe but keep them *easily spendable* then a paper wallet is not the right choice. You'll want something like a trezor.

Click 2. Print front

That's nice for you. I'm a merchant. I sell stuff for Bitcoin, ship product. Not just a speculator or spectator. Right now if I want to move about $1,000 of profits to cold storage or an exchange, I'll have to pay a $44 transaction fee. (Or $37 for Mycelium's low-priority recommended fee.)
Still feels busted to me. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:11:11
Don't be ridiculous. If there *were* a way to sell and buy using BCH e.g. using bitpay, it would be perfectly safe for a merchant.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:17:04
I've written up the most important security considerations along with my version of bitaddress.org here:
This site has been around since 2013. Let me know if you have any specific questions after visiting the site.
@_date: 2016-06-30 16:52:10
Hi there,
Your guide advocates loading up bitaddress.org and then turning off the internet connection. This isn't sufficient.
A paper wallet generator should never be run off of a live website, because someday if/when that website is compromised, it will serve up code that gives you predictable (instead of truly random) addresses. Even with your internet connection off, your coins can be swiped at any future date.
Instead, you should download the source HTML from github, **verify the PGP signed source**, and then run it offline by double-clicking on the HTML file.
Here are my top 6 security recommendations for making paper wallets:
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:52:59
See instructions here:
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:11:23
That's right. As a merchant, my wallet is full of smallish Bitcoin transactions. If I want to dump the .25 BTC I have in my hot wallet right now, **I'll need to pay $51 USD in fees for a "normal" transaction, or $38 for "Low priority".** 
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:38:47
This is the best and most succinct criticism I've read about BCH yet. Can anyone reading this provide a good rebuttal? Curious.

Paper wallets, by shuffling a deck of playing cards. 
On my generator you'll see a button "Enter my own key, dice..." and there are instructions there for using a deck of playing cards. Very fast, very effective.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:19:52
Thanks for the recommendation. I remember moving to Mycelium a little while back because its fee calculation was better than the wallet service I was using at the time. I guess now I need to find something even more refined... A shame though. Mycelium has other features I rely on, e.g. easy ability to spend/send from cold storage with BIP38 decryption.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:16:43
First, I recommend using my prettier-than-average paper wallet generator:
Second, instead of encoding the message in the blockchain, where it's hard to recover/read, how about encoding a message in the public key itself?
You can create a "vanity" address instead of relying on the paper wallet generator's built-in random generator.
Creating a vanity address takes a few hours (or days in some cases) but it means instead of having an address like
You can have

Author of bitcoinpaperwallet.com here. This is the best suggestion I've seen. Use bitcoinpaperwallet.com (or bitaddress.org, I think it can accomplish the same trick of rendering your QR code for you) offline. My favorite way to move money from a paper wallet to coinbase is by using mycelium to scan the wallet. Their "spend from cold storage" function is fast and reliable.

I don't think it's crazy, unless you consider crazy *expensive* to be crazy: But I always print my wallets on "Teslin". (I don't have a laser printer, so I have to be very very careful with making sure my inkjet paper wallets are waterproof.)
I list all my information &amp; tips &amp; ideas on my site, 
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:17:10
First, only trust paper wallet services that have a long history of being legitimate, e.g. mine ( or Pointbiz's ( -- both sites use the same crypto code as my site is forked from bitaddress. 
As other folks have said on this thread, it really depends on how virus-free / secure your own computing environment is. 
If you are securing significant amounts of Bitcoin and you don't want to go through the work of making your own clean boot environment, I sell a bootable [Ubuntu CD]( with the bitcoinpaperwallet.com software *pre-installed* -- for under $20 with shipping included anywhere in the world. This means you can just boot to the CD, print wallets, then reboot back to your host OS.

If anyone has questions about  feel free to ask -- I'm the fellow behind this. This is a "fork" of bitaddress.org, meaning it uses the exact same crypto code. The benefit is that it produces a more tamper-evident physical document, and may be generally easier to use and understand by most folks.

Paper wallets are not that scary. I've made a website to try to take all the weirdness/creepiness out of it:
Experiment by sending a very small amount of bitcoin first, then move more. (You can send bitcoin to the same wallet more than once, filling it up like a piggy bank.)
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:42:52
I can't imagine the protocol would ever change. If it did change, it would have a new BIP and wouldn't be the same protocol.
That being said, if possible it's not a bad idea to keep a copy of software you used to generate a BIP38 wallet in case fewer wallets support BIP38 importing some 10 years down the line...
@_date: 2016-11-15 07:14:01
Agreed, the entropy is a pretty awesome solution if you can find one.
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:25:09
This always seems like an odd circular argument to me: Don't use a paper wallet, use a hardware wallet...
... However, you have to make a paper wallet backup of your hardware wallet.
But hardware wallet paper backups don't allow encryption, so you have to keep them *crazy* safe.
Why not just use a paper wallet with BIP38 encryption? Even using your 10 year old impossible to forget password like "monkeybutt" is totally sufficient for securing BIP38...
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:51:33
Each time someone does child-pays-for-parent, doesn't that in fact knock someone else's transaction out of the block -- someone else who also presumably wanted to get their transaction confirmed?
Seems to me that more capacity (being able to fit more transactions in a block) would be a better fix to the problem.
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:54:47
"Paper wallets seem too insubstantial"
Phooey! :)
What could be more substantial than something that is impervious to hacking, bit rot, accidental formatting, technology evolution... As the bitcoinpaperwallet.com guy I'm clearly biased but seriously, if you're talking about long-term storage, just put your coins on a paper wallet (or write down a HD seed to a wallet that you believe will still be around in 5 years) make some copies, keep them safe, and sleep tight.
@_date: 2016-11-06 21:14:45
I'm biased as the guy behind  :) but as for myself I don't trust hardware to store coins for more than 10 years. Reason is not that I think the device will decay, but because I've seen first hand how technology can change so fast in 10 years that some present-day standard (like USB) can become frustratingly difficult to re-use. For example: I'm currently in a situation where I've got a virtual PC running OS 10.5 Server on my mac along with custom code hacks to try to get a 2005-era USB dongle to work so I can recover music I was working on back then. I've also got a box full of storage devices that won't work with any computer I own: e.g. a data DAT that operated over SCSI. Wishing myself luck on that one!
For something like 10 year storage I think a simple encrypted paper wallet works great. Yes, hardware wallets have paper backups but (1) they still require that you have that hardware in the future to work with the backup, and (2) the backups aren't encrypted meaning you have to be super paranoid about where you keep them.
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:02:38
Hi, I'm the fellow who does 
The thing to consider when making your paper wallets is that when you "sweep" them onto a hot wallet for spending, you will be sweeping the *entire* paper wallet.
So if you plan to put 5 BTC away for long-term storage on paper wallets, I recommend you do this as three separate wallets:
1 BTC
2 BTC
2 BTC
This way if you only want to cash out or spend 3 BTC, you don't have to sweep all 5 and then send the balance to a brand new 2 BTC wallet afterwards.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:16:18
... or, just print up 3 copies of your BIP 38 encrypted paper wallet. Keep one, put one in a safety deposit box, keep another with a family member or friend. Because it's BIP38, you don't need to trust the family member/friend.
@_date: 2016-12-16 22:55:14

Sorry, fairly what? Not quite following you.
Regarding confirmed reports of coins being hacked from bitaddress.org (or my own site bitcoinpaperwallet.com) the only thing I've heard of is how a few people accidentally installed a malicious chrome extension that was snooping QR codes and reporting them back to the mothership.

In my case at least, yes. In fact, my business uses BitPay, which transfers my funds to a receiving wallet address. It's when I want to move the funds away from that receiving wallet to somewhere else -- that's when I get dinged with the high fees.

My shower-response: Not necessarily. Mining might simply continue to centralize in places where electricity is already cheap or effectively free -- in other words, where electricity is being generated at a surplus, and private industry is given access to that surplus. (Isn't this already the case for some of the larger Chinese farms?)
There's probably a floor you could estimate to what "very cheap" means for ASICs. I suspect we're already close to that. Once the R&amp;D is complete, the only thing that can be cheapened is the cost to produce the chips in the factory. Since they're already being produced in China at significant scales, I'm not sure they're going to get substantially cheaper.
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:45:45
I don't think that's really true. When funds are sent to a paper wallet, and then swept into Coinbase, that's exactly the same thing as funds being sent to a hot wallet (e.g. the bitcoin client or breadwallet) and then being sent to Coinbase.
Putting bitcoin on a paper wallet doesn't erase the history of where those bitcoin came from. AFAIK The only thing that does that is a coin-mixing/washing service.
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:02:39


That would take up the same amount of space as an envelope with 10 or 20 $1 and $5 bills. Just write "FOR TIPS" on the envelope, and don't use it for anything else. :)
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:02:23
I disagree, because paper wallets can be effectively BIP38 encrypted with a simple passphrase. This way you can make several copies of your paper wallet(s), keep one at home, one in a safety deposit box, another with a family member or friend.
Safeguarding an unencrypted seed is a lot tricker since anyone who  catches a peek of your seed can steal your funds going forever forward.
For anyone who wants to buy some bitcoin and hold for a number of years, I still can't think of any solution more simple or secure than a paper wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:58:24
What I've seen is that while there are people who will *posture* that 1MB is sufficient forever (Luke Jr comes to mind), most developers agree that at some point, a hard fork to increase the block size will be required. Personally, I think this should be done now. This would give complicated software optimizations and off-chain solutions time to mature.
I think the community would be hugely reassured if the core developers would be more clear about this: that a hard forked blocksize increase *is* planned for, and when.
If the core developers really are committed to 1MB forever, that would be discouraging and alarming, as it would mean that offchain solutions would be required not just for purchasing cups of coffee, but for sending paychecks.
@_date: 2016-12-17 05:52:54


I thought that with a hard fork block size increase, most typical wallets wouldn't need to upgrade. So yes, 100% of fully validating nodes would need to upgrade, but wouldn't the represent something like less than 5% of actual Bitcoin users, e.g. everyone running Mycelium, Breadwallet, etc?
Genuinely curious. I might have missed something here.

Hi there, I'm the author of bitcoinpaperwallet.com. It's a free service which is cryptographically identical to bitaddress.org, the site from which it was "forked." My site is only different in its interface and the way the printed wallets look. Let me know if you have any particular questions.
Bitaddress.org has been around since 2011, and my site has been around since 2013. Both sites are extremely "safe" in the sense that their code is well vetted. However with either site, you are at risk if you don't follow the instructions for *safely* producing your paper wallets.
Here's what paper wallets are good for:
1: Giving bitcoin away, introducing family and friends
2: Securely storing bitcoin for many years (long time holding)
For every other use, e.g. day to day spending, receiving, sending, you want to use a software wallet (like Mycelium for android) or a hardware wallet (like the Trezor).

I think that's entirely possible. Right now there are so few merchants using Bitcoin that the network really *ought* to be able to handle a couple thousand coffee purchases per day.
If I'm an investor -- either financing Bitcoin startups or buying Bitcoin directly -- I'm not going to be impressed if the Bitcoin network isn't providing rewards or incentives to the very few Bitcoin merchants we have *today*. Investors will want to see that early adopters are having this incredible positive experience. But I'm not.
What frustrates me is that all the core development efforts (lightning network, and segwit which is a stepping stone for lightning) appear to be aimed at how we can support 100,000 merchants selling coffee. Meanwhile, folks like myself, who are *actually using Bitcoin to sell $10-$40 items* are finding the fees prohibitive, when a simple blocksize increase could have given us at least a year or two of runway in which to enjoy our cheap coffee sales.
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:35:15
**The blocksize limit discussion didn't have to be a big deal.** On the surface, the question is simply "should we increase the blocksize now and implement offchain solutions and optimizations later, or do it the other way around?" Nobody thinks the blocksize is supposed to be 1MB forever, nor does anyone think that the blocksize should increase forever to accommodate every coffee purchase ever made.
Unfortunately, instead of resulting in friendly and smart discussions, this question has quite literally fractured the community. 
My personal opinion is that the community wouldn't have fractured if the argument hadn't been suppressed via over-the-top censorship on r/bitcoin about a year ago. Censorship isn't nearly as bad now, but the damage was done, and now the community is entrenched and feels like it's two worlds apart. A lot of mean things have were said, hundreds of people were kicked off of r/bitcoin altogether, and so now the argument is mean and personal instead of friendly and smart. What a shame!

Short term and small amounts: Mycelium (android) and blockchain.info (web). For long term storage: Paper wallets. I've made a couple copies of each so that if one set is destroyed or lost, I have others. They are BIP38 encrypted with simple passwords that I'll never forget. This way even if an untrustworthy person comes across the wallets, they won't be able to spend them.
This is my site:

That's the DIY version anyway. For $18 (including worldwide shipping) I sell a bootable Ubuntu DVD that has my paper wallet software pre-installed. (It's a fork of bitaddress.org, cryptographically identical.)
Using this, a person with average technical skills can print wallets as easily as (1) power off internet connection (2) boot to the CD (3) print some wallets (4) reboot and turn back on your internet.

I wasn't going to respond to this comment, but I can't get it out of my head. Are you trolling me, or are you serious? I see that you've been involved in Bitcoin for at least 3 years, so you must know that Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen were two of the most trusted and respected developers in Bitcoin *until a year ago, when they released their hard fork proposals and polished implementations,* correct?
What I find absolutely tragic is that their efforts didn't get properly considered and reviewed because of the insane level of censorship on at the time, when their work was dismissed as an "altcoin" and any discussion of their work was absolutely prohibited and resulted in being banned from the forum. As a result, Mike rage quit, and Gavin has been sidelined.
I might be jumping the gun, but -- are you really suggesting that Mike and Gavin "didn't know what they [were] talking about" and that their work on increasing the blocksize was a "joke"? If so, I think this is a terrible shame because *you never got a chance to see their work properly critiqued.* The moderators of this forum made sure of that. Your opinion is based on a very limited sampling of opinions, because the contrary opinions *were not allowed to be expressed.*

I appreciate how you try to break down the root of the issue as being about economic policy, but you're painting things too black and white.
Folks who object to raising the block size right now also admit that it must be increased later on. They just don't want to do it **now**.
And folks who do want the block size increased *right now* do not necessarily believe that every coffee purchase should be stored in the block chain, at least not in the long term. They also believe in solving massive capacity challenges with offchain transactions. They just don't see that as being an issue for at least a couple years.
I see the split in the community as being about timing and planning.
Everyone knows we'll need larger blocks at some point.
Everyone knows we'll also need lightning network or other offchain solutions at some point.
The issue is this: *The network is clearly at full capacity right now*. Which solution should we implement **first**: a block size increase, or significant changes to the protocol and all wallet software?

Hi, author of  here. I'm not sure why a paper wallet would be riskier than a hardware wallet:
1: You can make copies of your paper wallets, keeping one at home, one in a bank, etc.
2: You can encrypt paper wallets with a password, so even if someone does steal one of your copies of your paper wallet, it's worthless to them unless they know your password.
3: Hardware wallets can be stolen or break or stop working. They advise that you write down a password recovery phrase *which is basically an unencrypted paper wallet* that you have to safeguard incredibly carefully. Because if that's stolen, there's no password to keep someone from taking the coins off of it.
In short, for *long term storage* of bitcoin, I believe encrypted paper wallets are the superior solution.
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:29:16
I think we're misunderstanding each other. I advocate for BIP38 encrypted paper wallets. This means you can *literally* post your paper wallet on the web for everyone to see, and unless they know your simple secret passphrase, "UncleBilly48", nobody can steal your funds.
BIP39 is for writing down your seed as a mnemonic of 12 words. If anyone sees those words, they can steal your funds in perpetuity.
My position is that writing down a mnemonic seed that anyone can steal is inferior to a paper wallet which can be BIP38 encrypted. With an encrypted paper wallet, you can make multiple copies and store them in insecure locations without worrying about someone sneaking a peek at the key. It's awesome.
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:20:58


I think it's entirely possible that segwit will increase capacity, but I have doubts that (1) it will be adopted fast, or (2) that wallet software will be updated fast enough to make much of a difference, or that (3) its deployment will go perfectly and not cause add-on problems due to its complexity. Maybe! But maybe not.
What has been known all along is that a 2MB block would have increased capacity by about 2X immediately, which would have given *segwit* and similar software solutions enough runway to make an even bigger difference.
Anyway, my point here wasn't to argue whether we should have done segwit and then increased the blocksize or done it the other way around -- my point is that this didn't have to be a contentious community splitting issue. It's the censorship that made it a big issue.
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:23:49


I think the bar is higher when you've got "bitcoin expert" flair like Luke does. For example, a *hunch* shouldn't be enough for him to say that web-generated paper wallets ARE dangerous, CANNOT be safe, etc. If using Bitaddress.org is as *inherently* unsafe as he says it is, then he should be able to provide at least one example of the *technology* causing a failure. Which, AFAIK, it hasn't, despite being possibly the most popular bit of code used in Bitcoin and used/abused by 100's of altcoins as well.
If Luke doesn't like the attack surface, he should be advising people on how to generate paper wallets *safely* (e.g. download from github and run it off of a clean OS like a bootable CD.) Instead he's advising people to write down hierarchical seeds on paper without any kind of encryption. It's irresponsible.

We can agree that Reddit is not where peer review of code takes place. But Reddit is -- to a significant degree -- where community consensus is formed. Consensus is essential to keep Bitcoin evolving. I hear you loud and clear: you don't think that Mike and Gavin were serious developers, and you thought their code was a joke. I disagree, and we can leave it at that. What I don't hear you doing is making any argument against my main point: that censorship on is what led to the fracturing of the community.
In my opinion, the individuals who made the decision to outright censor the discussion of XT on Reddit as an "altcoin" really screwed up, and I hold them largely responsible for the nasty "us vs. them" division we see in the community today.

Myself I've found zero evidence -- anecdotal or otherwise -- that any of the Javascript bitcoin tools produce flawed seeds / random numbers.
Until about 4 years ago, JS wasn't necessarily great at producing random numbers, so that's where the idea of wiggling your mouse to feed in extra entropy came from. But in (2011?) JS received a strong random number generator, even superior to what you get from the operating system. Since that point, I think the mouse wiggling is unnecessary and overkill. But it engenders confidence, so we leave it in there. :)
As far as I can recall, the *only* instance in Bitcoin history where we know of bad random numbers being generated was in an early version of the Android operating system (not Javascript). Some early Android apps produced predictable random numbers, which resulted in some funds getting stolen.
I've never been shown a single example of bitaddress.org (or bitcoinpaperwallet.com) producing bad seeds, even going back many years.
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:29:26


Myself I wouldn't worry about having bitcoins reside *temporarily* on your phone.
1) Sweep your paper wallet to your phone using mycelium or some other well trusted app.
2) As soon as the balance arrives, transfer from mycelium to your hardware wallet.
The bitcoins will only be "on" your phone for a few minutes, maybe an hour at most. Do it with a small amount at first just to make sure it all works as expected.

This is my site, with a lot of FAQ type information: 
For long term (5+ years) I recommend paper wallets. Yes, paper is flimsy (like cash and stock certificates) but:
1) You can make several copies of your paper wallets. Keep one at home, one in a safety deposit, one with a relative.
2) You can BIP38 encrypt your paper wallets, so it doesn't matter if someone sneaks a peek at them.
For long term storage, I believe this is preferable to hardware solutions since those solutions mandate that you make a paper backup of your key to be safe, and those paper backups are *not* encrypted and require that you safeguard them very carefully. Also, my own experience is that after 10 years, it's a dodgy proposition to assume that the USB device in your hand today will work with any computer you'll own in 10+ years.

Well, the *unusual* part isn't that he thinks paper wallets are dangerous. Lots of people hold that position. The *unusual* part is that he felt so strongly about this issue that abused his position at the bitcoin wiki to forcibly try to rename paper wallets to "[Paper ECDSA private keys]( in a campaign to erase the very notion of paper wallets. It's quite like someone renaming the Wikipedia entry on the "United States Civil War" to "The Battle for Independence". It's plain weird and not at all in the spirit of regular, forthright discussion.

I think you're confusing "simple" with "simplistic". Simple is good.
Here's the simple strategy I like: Allow the network's capacity to grow using the same software and economic policies that have been in place for the past 6 years or so. Don't inflate fees by artificially limiting the network when capacity can be increased easily. This is very much in the spirit of building "a proper network and a currency to serve humanity".
Yes, at some point we'll need off-chain solutions to handle demand, but we're nowhere *near* that point in the exponential growth curve for Bitcoin. Even 2MB blocks would give the network enough runway to online more users at the current rate for at least a couple years, while simultaneously driving fees back down to a penny or two per transaction. That's how you "serve humanity".
Trying to handle capacity problems now by implementing significantly more complicated solutions seems foolish to me. Putting faith in off-chain solutions *before they've even been developed*, doubly-so.

I'm just not persuaded that r/Bitcoin needed to be protected from any discussion of XT or Classic via censorship. If XT really was as bad as you say it was, wouldn't that have emerged as a result of free flowing discussions? 
I'm relieved to see that Bitcoin Unlimited can be discussed openly today. Similarly, I would have trusted the community to responsibly discuss XT a year ago. The heavy handed censorship was a mistake, and the schism it caused is slowing down development more than anyone wants.

Luke has an unusual personal vendetta against paper wallets that's well documented and involves him even attempting to [rewrite history]( so as to obfuscate the *concept* of a paper wallet.
In my opinion, his arguments are pretty much baseless. He doesn't believe that *any* security sensitive activity should happen in a web browser, disregarding the fact that today's JavaScript actually has excellent cryptographic bonafides -- like a random number generator that's generally stronger than whatever the host operating system can offer. More importantly, JS code is *incredibly easy to audit*, unlike all the compiled bitcoin software we use.
Because of its ease of auditing, I suspect that Bitaddress has continuously undergone more vetting than *any* other Bitcoin related software, with the possible exception of the reference Bitcoin client.
Now, the alternative Luke proposes for a "paper wallet" is writing down the backup seed from your preferred hot wallet (e.g. electrum). He never acknowledges that a real paper wallet is superior for long-term cold storage since it allows you to BIP38 encrypt your wallet with a simple and easy to remember passphrase. Compare this to what happens if someone steals or stumbles on your electrum seed: you're sunk.

Yes. Breadwallet for IOS, Mycelium for Android. If you transferred the bitcoin to your paper wallet before August 2017, you also have BCH on the paper wallet (worth $1,500 ea.) so don't throw the wallet away after sweeping your BTC off of it.
@_date: 2015-08-02 16:19:56
As long as your BIP38 password is reasonably secure, then it's extremely safe. Just make sure it's a non-dictionary type password, at least 8 characters long. Something like '185 would be (for modern computers) practically uncrackable. Even a couple of dictionary words like 'DoGcHiCkEn' should be totally fine. Brute-forcing BIP38 passwords is really, really, REALLY hard. It's not at all like brute-forcing brainwallets (which can be compromised instantly.)

This is the thing I find funny about the safety people feel with using hardware: The hardware is only safe if you also write down the (unencrypted!) seed key and keep it very safe. This is basically... a paper wallet. Only it's less secure because you can't protect it with a password like you can with a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet.
I'm not sure why recovering a wallet from a HD seed written on paper would be any less/more terrifying than recovering an address when writing down a single private key as a paper wallet...

Well that depends on whether or not you really expect people who know you to try to steal your money. Someone would have to (1) get a copy of your paper wallet, and then (2) make some really good guesses based on what they know about you.
Unlike brainwallets, BIP38 encrypted paper wallets can't be easily "brute forced" and even a simple password 8 characters in length should be sufficiently protective.
Or if you want to be really paranoid, make your BIP38 password something that's really unusual (but hard to forget) e.g. Emololz1985 -- but do take care: I've never once heard of a hacker gaining access to a BIP38 encrypted wallet, but I've seen dozens and dozens of people lose their passwords.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:08:33
You can use my design here:
Use BIP38 encryption and pick a simple password like "smiths" if you are the smiths family.
Save the paper wallets as PDFs and print them out using a nice color printer at a print shop / Kinkos / Fedex.
Normally you shouldn't print paper wallets on a public printer, but when they are BIP38 encrypted, it's pretty much safe. Just don't lose those passwords.

Yes, you can use Kinkos, IF you are sure to enable the BIP38 encryption option. Pick a very very simple password, impossible to forget. Something like 'sipbackrelax' or 'pop2017'. Once the wallet is printed, you could even write the password on the wallet itself, on the folding panel that's hidden when the wallet is folded up.

Hi, bitcoinpaperwallet.com author here. What I do when I want to check the balance of a paper wallet is I just type (or scan) the PUBLIC address into a service like blockchain.info. There's absolutely no reason to be fooling around with your private key if you're just checking balances. 
When I print out a paper wallet, before I print it out (and while the public address is still on the screen) I copy and paste it to a document where I keep track of my paper wallets, even the ones I give as gifts (so I can see when they've been swept, just out of curiosity.)

My feeling is that single address paper wallets are great for two purposes: Giving/distributing bitcoin to newbies, and long-term storage of bitcoin (e.g. holding for several years.) As you said, very hard to make a mistake.

More or less yes, but many other mechanisms are open source. You can at least verify the signature of the software to make sure it's authorized. For example, my site ( generates public addresses, and you can be sure that the code you're running really is my code because it's PGP-signed. Even if a hacker were to get into my GitHub account, they wouldn't be able to fake my signature.
As far as I can tell, there's no way for me to be sure that the Chrome Ledger Bitcoin App is genuine. Which isn't to say I won't use it -- I am -- but it does make me nervous since I'm in the habit of verifying the chain of trust from end-to-end.

It's not a regular paper wallet -- those either just have a QR code, or a string of letters and numbers, and are sometimes protected by a simple password.
It looks like a mnemonic recovery seed, but 'mazzone' and 'parana' aren't usually in the dictionaries. Strange. The only place I could find those terms was in a [password strength testing library](

BIP38s anti brute force measures are *considerable*. Password scheme that OP suggested should keep him safe until computers are literally millions of times faster, or unless BIP38's encryption scheme turns out to have a flaw, in which case password strength will likely be moot.
Likelihood of forgetting/losing a BIP38 password is much more of a liability.
@_date: 2016-02-08 17:15:29
Seconded. With BIP-38 encryption, you should even feel comfortable printing at the library or a coffee shop or kinkos or whatever. If you're afraid of losing the password, just write it on the back of the paper wallet and keep the paper wallet safe.

NB: You aren't required to use the QR code scanner. For example, if you use the blockchain.info web browser based wallet, you can "Sweep" your old paper by typing in the private key that's on your wallet. (The long alphanumeric private key is identical to the QR code.)
BTW If you are just interested in adding encryption to your paper wallet, you can do this without sweeping it. My software ( allows you to type in your private key, use it to replicate your wallet, and then *add* BIP38 encryption and print a new wallet that's better protected.

Hi there. Paper wallets are a great way to store bitcoin for the very long term, the assumption being you want to keep the bitcoin safe, and then move them back into a "live" wallet at some later date. I'm not sure why other folks advise significantly more complicated and expensive solutions than just saving a private key offline.
I'm not a fan of software or hardware based solutions for long-term offline storage. (I've got a box full of devices and digital media that no longer work because they're 10-20 years old and computers no longer support SCSI/ADB/etc.) 
I've tried to write up the top 6 most important security considerations here:
@_date: 2016-09-01 18:54:47
See my FAQ on [Withdrawing Funds]( Paper wallets should be treated like "piggy banks": You can add funds to them as many times as you like, but when you withdraw the funds, you "smash" the wallet and remove all the funds at once, and then never use the same paper wallet again.

Have you checked out my designs?
There are a bunch of different designs available for Bitcoin in particular. (Also Doge, LiteCoin, and now [Ethereum]( in testing.)
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:19:03
Yes, writing down your keys is perfectly fine. The QR codes are just scannable versions of the exact same keys. If you want to double-check that you wrote down the key right, use the "validate" tab on my generator at  (but use an offline copy of course.)
OR, use the BIP38 encryption option, and then you can even use a shared or public library printer since it doesn't matter if a copy of your (encrypted) private key is saved somewhere.
Note that with BIP38 you do not need to use an especially secure password. Something like 'KFM1089' would be perfectly adequate, or even 'bob1983'.
@_date: 2016-02-26 19:01:10
Hi there, author of  here.
I recommend (securely) printing out some paper wallets, and loading them up with your coins. Make some wallets with varying denominations so that you can sweep varying amounts in the future. (E.g. if you have 10 BTC to store, make a 5 BTC wallet and five 1 BTC wallets.)
If you have a safety deposit box to store them in, store them unencrypted. If you're going to keep them yourself, BIP38 encrypt them, and maybe make copies for a family member or trusted friend to hold on to for you.
I'm still a huge believer in paper wallets for long term cold storage. They insulate you from worries about hardware getting out of date.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:13:39
I think more paper is more secure. Paper isn't subject to technological obsolescence. (The USB port you're relying on today might not be as widespread in 10 years. Just ask my drawer-full of ADB-port dongles, SCSI and ZIP drives, 3.5" floppy disks...)
This is my site, with lots of specific recommendations, including what kind of paper/ink to use:
Regarding your dog not getting you into trouble, what you do is make several copies of your paper wallets, all BIP38 encrypted. Your BIP38 password doesn't need to be fancy. Something simple like 'cab256!' is totally sufficient.
Then keep one set at home, another in a safety deposit box, the thrid with a family member or friend. The BIP38 encryption means you can share it with a reasonable expectation that nobody will steal the funds. The redundancy means that your dog can eat your paper wallet, the bank can get hit by a meteorite, and your mom will STILL have that piece of paper you told her to keep safe for you. :)
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:08:04
Yes, you can. If you want your paper wallets to look different from your BTC wallets you can use my design &amp; variant (a fork of bitaddress.org, same crypto code) here:
(This is just a shortcut to the regular site but with the BCH design pre-loaded.)
And as for all the folks yelling about being able to trust code that runs in a web browser,  **I doubt there is any single application in the Bitcoin universe that has been more thoroughly vetted than bitaddress.org**. Honestly, how many people have compiled their own Bitcoin core client after checking 1,000's of files of raw code themselves? Compare that to how many people have done a "view source" on bitaddress.org and examined the comparably simple JavaScript, which can be audited by examining *a single file*.
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:19:13
My criticism of using trezor for *long term storage* is that the recovery seed isn't encrypted and has to be guarded carefully.
I think a superior long-term solution is multiple BIP-38 encrypted paper wallets. Keep one copy at home, one in a safety deposit box, one with a family member. And BIP-38 passwords don't need to be particularly fancy. "Michael1973" is totally sufficient.
I'm the guy who does  so I *might* be a little biased. :)

Many years ago there was a weakness (predictability) in the android OS random number generator. A few wallets (probably software) ended up unintentionally producing guessable keys.
AFAIK, there's never been a case of bitaddress.org (or my site  based on bitaddress.org) experiencing a hack or flaw.
Well, one exception: there was a flaw in the JS engine for a certain version of Safari (snow leopard OS). It produced paper wallets that could only be decrypted using the same version of Safari. So, a hassle, but no coins necessarily lost.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:38:16
This  is my site and my recommendation:
I like this better for long-term because (1) no worries about technological obsolescence,  (2) you can make several copies and keep them in safe places (with family, bank) and (3) you can BIP38 encrypt with a very simple password to protect them. Hardware wallets generally require that you write down an *unencrypted* seed and keep it safe, which seems very difficult &amp; foolish to me.

Generating a new private key is basically just about picking a very large random number, one that no other device will randomly choose ever again. But computers are bad at making random numbers. They use tricks like "at the moment the random number was requested, note how long the computer has been powered on in nanoseconds and use that as the random number". Many of these schemes have flaws which generate less-than-random results, e.g. skewed slightly in one direction or another. The mouse wiggling idea is that your motions give the computer a truly chaotic source to "seed" the random number choosing.


It's already done!  is a shortcut to the new design.

Yes and no. Technically nobody "knows" your private key after you sweep the funds off of a paper wallet. However, you shouldn't re-use an old paper wallet that's been once-swept because the cryptographic strength of that wallet is somewhat compromised. Future developments in computers/cryptography could render that wallet vulnerable.
So, as I instruct on [my website]( treat paper wallets like piggy banks: deposit funds as many times as you like to a paper wallet, but when you sweep the funds to a hot wallet, you sweep ALL of the funds and then you discontinue using that paper wallet forever.

For long-term storage, absolutely paper wallets with BIP38 encryption.
This is superior to a hardware wallet with the seed written down, because you don't have to guard a BIP38 encrypted wallet as carefully as you would that seed on paper. Also, BIP38 passwords are secure even when they're super super simple, like "f1key2017".
Make 2 or 3 copies of each paper wallet, can keep them in different safe places -- e.g. at home, at work, in a safety deposit box or with a family member.

And then for your one-time pad you use *chlamydiachlamydiachlamydiachlamydiachlamydiachlamydiachlamydiachlamydiachlamydiachlamydiachlamydiachlamydiachlamydia...* and use those letters to shift the letters in your seed backup.

As for worrying about the CD being intercepted and replaced: when you order a CD from me, the following precautions are taken:
1) I send you a PGP-signed confirmation email telling you what serial number will be on your CD
2) The CD is enclosed in a plastic case with a tamper-evident seal with your unique serial number. Would be very very difficult to replace CD without detection.
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:43:33
I see zero benefits. (I'm also the guy who does  so go figure :)
Basic advice: Use proper printer &amp; ink. Make 3 copies of each paper wallet, all of them BIP-38 encrypted with a VERY simple impossible to forget passphrase, e.g. 'UnchallengeableGyp'. Keep one copy, put another in safety deposit box, give a third to family or friend for safekeeping. That's it! 
And yes, you can continually add new funds to a paper wallet. Use paper wallets like you would a piggy bank: add new coin as often as you like, but then "break" the paper wallet when you sweep it and remove all the funds at once.
@_date: 2015-04-26 14:24:59

Part of the confusion here might be that there are a lot of people that for some reason hate the concept of paper wallets and want to discourage everyone from using them. As such, they've been saying that when you write down the seed or backup for a hierarchical deterministic wallet, *that's a "paper wallet"*. I think it's possible that OP is (understandably) mixing up traditional paper wallets (single private/public key pair) with HD wallet backups/seeds.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:46:58


I'm the guy who does  and my position is that if you want to store your bitcoins for 2+ years, use a paper wallet. (Specifically, use BIP38 encrypted paper wallets, and make 3 copies of each. Keep one set at home, another in a safety deposit box if you have one, another with friend or family member.)
I don't like relying on hardware for long-term storage because:
* They ask you to make a paper backup (basically a paper wallet) but it's not BIP38 encrypted, so you have to keep it SUPER safe from prying eyes
* Operating systems and plugs change pretty fast. I suspect you'll have a hard time making use of a Trezor in 10 years.

Actually the answer is Yes. BCH and BTC use the same addressing scheme.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:00:12


Honestly, the one with the bunch of companies. Bitcoin is actually *transacted* by all those companies. The vast, vast, [vast majority]( of *actual Bitcoin users* (investors, day traders, merchants &amp; buyers, persons sending remittances) are using the services and products of all these companies [that the core developers intend to malign 5 days from now]( BitPay alone does something like 200,000 transactions *per month*. Coinbase is onboarding literally *millions* of new users.
Daily, I have to remind myself that Bitcoin extends beyond and Just for a moment, imagine that this *one* forum of discussion goes away. All of a sudden, the debate is pretty darn quiet. I think it would be strange if the miners paid a whole lot of attention to what's happening in this one corner of the Internet.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:35:33
This is my site, with lots of guidance:
Basic advice: Use proper printer &amp; ink. Make 3 copies of each wallet, all of them BIP-38 encrypted with a VERY simple impossible to forget passphrase, e.g. 'olwe1'. Keep one copy, put another in safety deposit box, give a third to family or friend for safekeeping. That's it!
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:14:14
I'm sure everyone wants to save in fees, and if/when segwit is  hugely popular and supported, I'm sure it will roll into bitaddress.org and then I'm sure I'll fold in that code. (My site is just a fork of pointbiz's work.)
For the time being there are just too many unknowns for me to bother digging into it, just to save on fees. Can you BIP38 encrypt segwit addresses using the same scheme? If you did encrypt them is there any wallet out there that could sweep them? What wallets allow sweeping of regular segwit paper wallets anyway? How do I change the interface so that Bitcoin Cash users don't accidentally check the segwit option? Etc. Etc.

Hey there. Totally understandable.
I've tried to make a comprehensive paper wallet instructions &amp; tools site here:
My goal with this site is to explain how paper wallets work, and how to make them safely.

Yesterday I had a single transaction that took 7+ hours to confirm because I only paid $0.70. I didn't realize that I had to pay at least US$4.00 for a speedy confirmation.
Not everybody is sending super-small transactions that get picked up for 5 cents. For example: merchants, whose wallets get filled up with lots of smallish ($20) payments and then want to transfer those funds somewhere else. This isn't an edge case: this is what Bitcoin is supposed to be for.

Generating a valid private key by hand is pretty easy.
Generating the corresponding public address by hand has been discussed before, and is [not at all feasible](
@_date: 2015-11-09 19:15:43
As said, as long as you use BIP38 encryption it's a reasonably good plan.
The risk is that when you take a screenshot or make a PDF and then copy it to your thumbdrive, it's entirely likely that the operating system has saved other copies elsewhere (e.g. printer cache, operating system screenshot cache.) Also if you delete the screenshot, unless you do a "secure delete" it's pretty easy to undelete images.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:07:40
See: 
@_date: 2015-11-02 14:35:34
Yup. You can totally forget about them. Just don't forget where you put them. :)
I'd give a second copy to a family member to keep hold of. Just be sure it's BIP38 encrypted so that if it gets out of their hands, the private key will still be safe.
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:27:43
Remember, I'm a merchant. Had I been selling $1 items instead of $30 items, then it would have still cost me $4 to move $53 quickly.
On the planet where I live, $4 to move $53 sucks.
What I want is a bigger blockchain where there's not such a high premium on Kilobits. I don't want miners to turn up their nose when I want to transfer $1,600 (or $53) for 70 cents.
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:24:59
Not necessarily true. **[Four hours ago]( I placed a 8BTC transfer with a .0014 fee and it still has zero confirmations. Reason is that my transaction is bigger than most (in terms of KB) so miners don't want to pick it up.
Edit: Now more than 6 hours and still zero confirmations. And we're not under DDOS, spam flooding, etc. As an end user, to me this feels like Bitcoin is *already* broken. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:31:25
Not necessarily true. Yesterday my [single transaction]( took over 7 hours to clear. I had paid a .0014 BTC ($0.70) miner fee. Because I'm a merchant who receives lots of smallish ($20) payments, my transaction byte size was unusually large.
To have gotten my transaction processed properly, I would have had to pay at least US$4.00. A shame I didn't, because I completely missed out on the opportunity to sell those 8 Bitcoins at their peak of $500.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:40:31
True, but it's also a fairly typical transaction. I'm a merchant and bitpay sends my wallet lots of smallish amounts ($20 here, $30 there.) When I need to move the funds as a block, it weighs in pretty heavy. I'm not doing anything weird like encoding vanity text into the blockchain... I'm using Bitcoin exactly as it was intended/imagined.
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:29:30
I used blockchain.info's javascript wallet. The reason my transaction was big is that I'm a merchant. About 70 people sent me money in exchange for products. Then I wanted to transfer that money somewhere else.
It gets worse... Imagine if I were selling MP3s for $1.00 each. If I collected $100 and then wanted to (quickly) transfer that $100 somewhere else, that would have required almost $6 in mining fees.
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:31:32


Yeah, but "average" is based on all the satoshi dice crap that's floating out there. I'm an *actual* merchant, and I suspect that for average merchants, my transaction reflects a very typical use case.
In any case, my main lesson is to start using a wallet that figures out the proper fee for me. Making a guess at $.70 (since that had been more than sufficient for years past) was my mistake. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:51:00
My transaction finally cleared after more than 7 hours. 
Reason appears to be that my transaction was larger than normal (came from a wallet with lots of small inputs) so miners were disincentivized to risk filling up their block with my transaction. Blocks are too small. Rather a bummer for me because by the time 7 hours had passed, I no longer wanted to sell my BTC as the price had dropped $50+.
@_date: 2015-11-05 14:30:01
First of all, I love the idea of a time capsule for your kid. If you want to keep an ongoing *journal* to present on his 18th birthday, have a look at one of my projects, 
You might also read my write-up on paper wallet advice re: paper selection, ink, and laminating (esp. re: laminating laser prints)
In any case, if you are storing the wallet in 3 forms that seems plenty durable. The one thing I wouldn't count on much is the USB drive. I highly doubt we'll have USB ports on any devices in 10 years. I'd stick with entirely non-digital mediums.
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:38:28
If you have trouble with coinbase directly, I'd recommend the route of first importing to blockchain.info, then sending to coinbase.
@_date: 2016-05-09 22:13:08
I really like blockchain.info's chrome extension. Been using it for years, never had a single problem. Has a QR code scanner (unlike Electrum for OS X, AFAIK...) However it does seem like a company with as much capital as they have should be doing *something* interesting &amp; progressive...
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:26:36
... and I missed the opportunity to do a little selling. More than 2 hours ago I sent 8BTC to coinbase with a .0014 BTC fee. Still have zero confirmations, presumably because my transaction is bigger than most. (12Kbytes, because it was transferred from a wallet that received a a lot of smallish payments.) With the blocksize limit nearing capacity these days, I suppose this means miners are disincentivized to speedily process my fat transaction.
The blocksize problem is very real to me this morning as I can't get a legitimate transaction through the network in a reasonable amount of time.

my personal preference is to use their google chrome extension/app so that I'm not using the full-blown web browser.

Did you keep a copy of the public addresses? If so you can see if the funds have moved. No need to think or wonder about it. :)

Bitcoinpaperwallet.com owner here. It's absolutely true I've got a conflict of interests and should accordingly be kept in check when it comes to self-promotion on the wiki. However, it's also the case that I've done a great deal of work in this community to provide good education and advice about paper wallets -- including having written the majority of the content on the original paper wallets wiki page. My paper wallet site is a hobby, but promoting bitcoin and making it easier to understand has been my passion for years now.
What aggravated me wasn't so much that my service was being unlinked, but that a single individual was deciding that paper wallets were such a bad idea that people shouldn't even be able to learn about them anymore. That the term "paper wallet" itself should be written out of history. As someone who spends a *lot* of time educating people about paper wallets, I couldn't see why we should intentionally make learning about paper wallets any harder than it needs to be.

Hmm. I'm the guy who runs bitcoinpaperwallet. I don't sell private keys. The entire site/project is 100% free just like bitaddress.org, on which it is based. The only thing I sell is (completely optional) hologram stickers and customized ubuntu CDs. Who told you the site sold single private keys?
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:07:40
Hey there,
Sorry but I'm really not sure what's causing the error you're seeing. It's unlikely that bitcoinpaperwallet.com is generating private keys that can't be imported. (Never heard of this problem.)
However, if you're putting funds on paper wallets for long term storage, I don't recommend that you scan the *private* keys using any device or software. That somewhat defeats the "coldness" of the storage. (If your scanning device or software is compromised, your key can be exploited.)
If you have concerns about the wallets generated by a paper wallet service (like mine) best thing is to generate a couple of practice wallets, transfer very small amounts into them, make sure you can sweep them into a live wallet, BIP38-decrypt them, etc. But when you make the paper wallet you'll really be using for long term storage, don't import the private key into any devices at all. Just store it and trust in the math. :)
@_date: 2015-10-30 21:02:53
Absolutely. However I don't recommend trying to encrypt your wallets (BIP38) using an Rpi. [Doesn't work or takes forever.](
@_date: 2016-05-06 22:33:41
I concur. Or say you're going to store 10 BTC. I'd make paper wallet denominations of:
One 5BTC (main savings which you don't intend to touch for a long time)
Five 1BTC (so you can sweep these one at a time as you need them.)
Be sure to BIP38 encrypt them with a password you can EASILY remember. Does not need to be a hardcore password. Even 'dancinpants123' is fine.
Make a copy of your paper wallets and give them to a family member (or keep in safety deposit box.) Easy!
Use the [right kind of paper and ink](

This doesn't make any sense to me. Or, more specifically, I don't see how this would be an improvement over a group of vetted participants sharing access to a private MySQL database.
What I believe makes "the blockchain" secure is the commitment of overwhelming distributed computing resources. Once you have a private blockchain that's secured by "vetted participants", you're going back to a situation where a hacker can attack your database by compromising just one of the participants. Might as well just use a regular database running over a VPN, right?

For anyone else reading this, the general answer is that when you "import" a paper wallet's private key into your hot wallet, the bitcoins may not have "moved". Your hot wallet may just include balance on your paper wallet.
However, if you "**sweep**" a paper wallet, that actually moves the bitcoins out of the paper wallet an into a different address controlled by your hot wallet.

I would recommend a combination of a phone wallet and a paper wallet.
Put as many BTC on your phone wallet (e.g. myelium, bread wallet) as you think you might want to spend over the next 6 months.
For the remainder of your BTC, put them on paper wallets, say 1 or 2 BTC per paper wallet. Keep them very safe by making copies and keeping them in safe deposit box or  in a separate location.
When you need to re-up your phone wallet, just sweep one of your paper wallets.

Hi there, author of [bitcoinpaperwallet.com]( here (a fork of bitaddress.org).
First of all, if you're using a JavaScript wallet generator, be sure to get the code from GitHub, not from the website itself. If you're feeling extra paranoid, check the PGP signature of the download. (My site has instructions for this.)
General security tips I've tried to break down into 6 short paragraphs here:
@_date: 2015-11-09 23:14:59
If you have any concerns, just save a copy of my site (or a similar site) to disk: 
As long as Javascript and HTML still work, you'll still be able to decode your wallet.
When considering even longer terms (e.g. 10 years+) I think the biggest concern is being able to easily retrieve data from digital mediums. I doubt you'll have any devices around that can still read USB sticks, for example.
Having worked with computers since the 80's, I've got loads of digital mediums from which I will have a really hard time recovering data... 5.25 inch floppies, data DAT...

Myself, I'm giving up on trying to maintain the wiki for paper wallets. So no more drama from me. :) One of the wiki admins correctly pointed out that I have a conflict of interest (as I run bitcoinpaperwallet.com). Further, Luke-Jr said he'd have me banned if I ever linked my site from the wiki.
On the plus side, it looks like Luke-Jr may have given up trying to rename "Paper Wallet" for now -- which was my main concern since this would make it harder for folks to educate themselves about the risks/benefits of paper wallets.
Hopefully, in time, someone else will improve the paper wallets page to let people know how to actually print them, if they so choose. As it stands now, the paper wallets page simply discourages using paper wallets altogether.
Agreed that all the personal attacks on Luke-Jr were totally uncalled for. Unfortunate.

Hi there,
I've written some notes up here:
@_date: 2015-10-30 15:08:18
My opinion is that printers phoning home isn't very likely at all. Here's what I think is a bigger concern regarding printing: Many operating systems store print cache files for quite a while. If a hacker knows where to look, they can recover previously printed documents. See my section on **Destroying Cache Files** at 
BIP38 encrypting your wallet helps a lot because then even if someone recovers a printed file, they need a password to recover the private key. 
Running bitaddress.org (or my fork of bitaddress.org for that matter) off of a Live CD is a really good idea. No cache files to worry about, no chance of viruses or trojans, etc. &lt;Begin Plug&gt;My site will send you a bootable CD with my paper wallet generator pre-installed to anywhere in the world for under $20.&lt;End plug/&gt;

I'm sure all of us are in agreement that a technically correct knowledge base is important, both in the short term and the long run. But the wiki entry for "paper wallets" should actually be those things we call paper wallets. Sure, the page can state that paper wallets aren't truly wallets and that it's a bit of a misnomer. But like it or not, "paper wallet" is the uncontroversial term that's been used at least since 2011 for describing private keys printed on paper. "Paper wallet" makes up chapters in books, online courses, it's used throughout our software "import/export paper wallet" and our websites (blockchain.info, etc.). The purpose of our wiki is to help people learn more about a particular term. The purpose of a wiki is not to enforce the *changing* of a term, especially at a cost of burying information people are actually seeking.

However, distributing an unencrypted passphrase that doesn't require a password in your head to unlock it is quite risky. Better to give your dad a copy in person and make sure it goes in a safe or something.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:50:47
I believe that BIP38 is *extremely* RAM hungry (by design) while rpi's are very light on RAM. I wish I had some exact numbers for you -- but that's almost certainly the issue. Even if you do have enough RAM, BIP38 is (again, by design) extremely computationally expensive. Maybe on the brand new rpi they just released it could be tolerably fast. But on any of the traditional rpi's I'd bet it would take at least 5 minutes per encryption. Maybe 10 or 20. No idea.

**Updates for January 31, 2015:** The  request I've received regarding BitcoinPaperWallet.com has been for a design that's better suited for black and white laser printers. [Here it is, at last!]( Just select "Black and White" from the design dropdown on BitcoinPaperWallet instructions tab.
For the last couple years, the bitcoinpaperwallet.com customized Ubuntu boot CD has been mastered using the 12.04.3 Ubuntu distribution*. The benefit of switching to 14.04 LTS is built-in support for MANY more printers.
^^^\* ^^^Trademark ^^^used ^^^with ^^^permission ^^^of ^^^Canonical ^^^Limited.
Edit/P.S.: Thanks to the community for incredible support over the last 12 months. Also, as of yesterday, all donations to the project have been tallied up and shared with the people who have helped this project most: **Pointbiz** (bitaddress.org), **Artiom Chilaru** (BIP38 and camera QR code scanning) and **Martin Ankerl** (HTML5 Canvas rendering and generative pattern code that makes each wallet look unique.) **Thanks to all these amazing developers.**
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:11:14
$18 with free shipping. Plug 'n' play. Enjoy!
Edit: I realized you said you have no printer. So steps are:
1) Boot from the CD at home
2) Print to PDF files, save them to a thumbdrive.
3) Print PDFs from work printer
With this method, it is *extremely* important that you use BIP38 encryption and choose reasonably good passwords since you must assume that the PDFs you print at work may be saved to network drives, cache files, who knows what. But with a good BIP38 password, it won't matter. And a "good password" in this case doesn't mean a crazy 128 bits of entropy sort of thing -- just something like "MyGreatPassword5128". This is a totally different situation from making brain wallets where insane passwords are required.

What's the deal with exchanges not having functions for sweeping paper wallets? Coinbase used to have one, they removed it. Seems like a very common need. Hold BTC long term on paper wallets, then sweep them into an exchange to sell them...

I don't agree at all. Without Theymos' censorship, it would have been easier for the Bitcoin community to arrive at consensus about whether or not to fork. He stifled the conversation, which forced a stalemate at the expense of fracturing the community.
I think it's silly to compare a fork whose only purpose was to increase the block size with a fork that forced a redistribution of wealth (benefitting some and hurting others).
@_date: 2016-07-30 01:13:48
How do you figure "it has been proven" that a fork (which would have required 75% of the miners to activate) would have been disastrous? Are you saying that *any* fork in the future -- which most would agree is required in the next 18 months -- will be disastrous?
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:20:42
Correct answer: It depends on whether your phone wallet is IMPORTING or SWEEPING your paper wallets. 
1) IMPORTING paper wallet into your hot wallet. This requires no transaction fee. This is simply a process in which you provide your hot wallet with the private key to your paper wallet so that your hot wallet can then spend its funds directly. No need to backup your seed in this case.
2) SWEEPING paper wallet into your hot wallet. This does require a transaction fee, because it means the balance is sent from your paper wallet to a new address on your hot wallet. Your hot wallet will need to provide the fee for the transaction. This is generally the preferred method because it means you can safely dispose of your paper wallet afterwards. You will need to backup your seed in this case.

Hi,  author here.
[Here's a screencap]( from my site's instructions on supplying your own random data. It's quite easy:
1) Launch [the generator]( You can skip the seeding process because you're supplying your own random content.
2) Click **Print Front** and then click **Enter my own key, dice rolls, brain wallet, etc...**
3) Supply your own random data. Coin flips aren't a good technique in my opinion. I prefer the playing card method. It's much faster: 
Mix up a deck of 52 playing cards (shuffle at least 10 times!) and enter at least the top 31 cards in this format: 5S10HAC-... (where 5S = 5 of Spades, 10H = 10 of Hearts, AC = Ace of Clubs, etc.)

A lot of misinformation in these comments. Here's the correct answer:
When you want to spend a paper wallet, you have two options:
1) You can **import** the paper wallet into your hot wallet. This requires no transaction fee. This is simply a process in which you provide your hot wallet with the private key to your paper wallet so that your hot wallet can then spend its funds directly.
2) You can **sweep** your paper wallet. This does require a transaction fee, because it means the balance is sent from your paper wallet to a new address on your hot wallet. Your hot wallet will need to provide the fee for the transaction. This is generally the preferred method because it means you can safely dispose of your paper wallet afterwards.

I wouldn't worry about it unless you have reason to believe your computer might be compromised with trojans.
As for re-using addresses: It is perfectly fine to send coins in many batches to the same paper wallet. Use it like a piggy bank: deposit many times, and then withdraw all at once.

I'm unfamiliar with coinb.in. As for bitaddress.org, I'm unaware of any problems it's ever had with security in its many years of extensive use by the community. There was a problem a couple years ago where a specific version of Safari had a JS bug that was generating wallets that could only be decrypted by using the same version of Safari. That was for sure the most serious problem I've heard of.
The bug you linked to doesn't impact the security of your wallets. It's a (literally) 1 in a million chance that if you provide your own hash (instead of using the random number generator) that the software will lock up and not allow you to produce a corresponding wallet. 
Doesn't impact anything re: wallets you already made, or your ability to produce a secure wallet.

Where I'm coming from is simple: let's support people who want to learn about paper wallets by making sure that when they go to the wiki page for paper wallets, they get information about paper wallets.
I disapprove of how Luke-Jr repurposed the page for paper wallets to promote HD mnemonic backups, and unilaterally decided that from now on, "paper wallets" will be called "Paper ECDSA private keys". This only makes things confusing for people who want to learn more about paper wallets after seeing how blockchain.info, their wallet software, coinbase, etc. all have buttons and instructions for producing "paper wallets".

@_date: 2013-12-09 21:36:18
PS one criticism: in your design you've eliminated some of the repeated/redundant addresses. In the original design, the public and private keys are each displayed **three** times each: once as a QR code, and then twice in alphanumeric, once rotated 180 degrees. The reason for the rotation is so that if the wallet is damaged in a one corner, you are more likely to be able to recover the key from the opposite side.
Edit: also you've removed the dot patterns on the reverse which aren't just there to be garish -- they help guard against candling (shining a bright light through the folds.)
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:24:07
Someone *claimed* this was possible, but that person didn't actually go so far as to recover a private key. Bunches of people (including myself) have tested the BitcoinPaperWallet design with various light sources -- high-intensity LED flashlights, camera flashes, flatbed scanners, lasers -- and while we've been able to expose some muddled areas of the QR code, nobody's actually recovered a private key yet. It would probably require multiple exposures and custom-coded software plus huge amounts of CPU to brute force through the search space that would be defined by the incomplete image recovered. This doesn't concern me because someone who's willing to put forth that much effort would probably just (physically) steal the wallet outright. :) 
FWIW here's a photo gallery of my most (un)successful efforts to extract a private key with a light source:

Use your Bitcoin QT to send the coins away from your Bitcoin QT to your paper wallet's public address.
Confirm that the coins are really "in" your paper wallet (by looking up your public key at blockchain.info.) Once confirmed, you're actually safe to uninstall bitcoin QT etc. Just keep your paper wallet safe.
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:29:54
Sorry but it doesn't sound to me like you could brute-force that private key. Having 12 out of 52 chars of your private key is better than nothing... but with today's computers it's still basically nothing. QR codes are meant to be recoverable with quite a bit of damage (25% in some cases) but you're saying that it's about 83% damaged, and that's not going to be recoverable either.

For long-term personal storage (as opposed to gift-giving and exchange/payment to people who implicitly trust you) there are fewer benefits to using my design. They include:
• it looks more precious than an ordinary printout, so if you die (or hire housecleaners) and someone's going through your stuff, they're less likely to throw it away as trash.
• the tri-folding design and zip-sealing bag improve inkfastness and longevity for long-term storage.

Thanks for trying out the ISO! Too bad about the printer. BTW I recommend since you have an ISO for a live CD, actually burn it to CD -- the reason being that a CD cannot be changed/manipulated by a trojan/virus/etc. Read-only is quite nice.
As for my RNG vs Electrum's, they're really two very different things. Javascript vs. (C++?) I don't have much knowledge of Electrum's sources of entropy, and I in fact suspect these have been much less peer-reviewed than the crypto that is so easily reviewed on bitaddress.org and bitcoinpaperwallet.com.
Bitcoinpaperwallet.com uses window.crypto.getRandomValues() provided you are not using an old/terrible browser like IE (it will warn you if you are.) This is generally considered to be suitable for cryptographic purposes, and in fact obviates the need for mouse wiggling as I understand it.

**A paper wallet is essentially a bitcoin piggy bank**. When you print out a paper wallet, it's like making an empty piggy bank. If you (or someone else) sends bitcoin to the public key on the front of your paper wallet, those coins are "inside" your paper wallet. If you lose the wallet (or if it becomes illegible) your coins are gone forever. You can make as many deposits as you like, and you can check your cumulative balance online by typing your public key into blockchain.info. 
*However, you can only make a single withdrawal*, which is why a paper wallet is more like a piggy bank than a bonafide bank account. When you're ready to withdraw the full balance from your wallet, you unfold the wallet to reveal the private key, and then "import" it using an online wallet like blockchain.info. If you're speculating and you just want to convert the bitcoin to USD or something, most online exchanges (e.g. mtgox) will let you "swipe" your paper wallet right into your market account so you can sell them for USD/euros/etc. Afterwards you should destroy your paper wallet (discard your "broken" piggy bank) because putting additional coins into it at this point would be insecure.

To date, I haven't implemented any encrypted/obfuscated private key schemes (e.g. BIP38) -- not because I don't think they're useful, but because I'm waiting for the dust to settle on the protocol, especially with BIP38. Probably the moment all major wallet software &amp; services allow you to import a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet (e.g. bitcoin QT client, coinbase, blockchain.info) is the moment I'll add this feature.

Exactly so. More to the point, it's just to remove the *temptation* that a trusted person in your environment (co-worker, roommate) might have to remove the stickers, swipe the wallet, and then and replace with their own. The point of all these tamper-evident features isn't to protect against hard-core tampering efforts (or outright theft, which is easier) -- it's to discourage small time thieves from easily swiping a paper wallet temporarily in their possession.

For me, it's not a question of, "can someone with 10 photographs from different angles and some custom-coded software ultimately recover a private key after days of computation", because I'm not claiming iron-clad unbreakable tamper-resistance. What I'm claiming is that the various tamper-evident features in my design will merely *discourage* snooping and theft, especially as a result of leaving your wallet out in the open -- especially if the wallet is a gift or personal transaction, and the recipient doesn't know better about keeping it out of view.
*The real-world analogy is this:* You lock your door and latch your window shut not because it will effectively prevent someone from breaking your window and stealing your stuff. The reason you take these common-sense measures is to discourage *casual* theft,  forcing would-be criminals to behave in a truly criminal manner (by smashing windows or learning to pick the lock on your door.)

Hi btcner. This is good general advice for sure, especially for a random website which is not monitored closely by the bitcoin community. bitcoinpaperwallet.com and bitaddress.org are evaluated quite closely, and all changes are PGP-signed by their respective authors.
General safety tips:
1) Please do NOT run bitcoinpaperwallet.com off of the website for significant amounts -- use the github download instead. (This guards against the web hosting provider being hacked.)
2) If you have specific concerns, review the open source code. My project is a fork of bitaddress.org and the crypto behind it can easily compared. (It's essentially identical, though it does use a stronger random number generator when using a modern enough browser.)

Hi, not for sale but you can probably buy a Pi more or less instantly on ebay (no wait) and the software isn't too hard to setup. Practically plug and play. The hardest part is figuring out how to burn a R. Pi SD card if you've never done it before.

A few people have brought this up, and I don't think it's a tinfoil hat issue. Stuxnet spread far and wide to infiltrate the control software for fairly dumb uranium enrichment equipment behind Iran's military firewalls, so it's conceivably easier to write a virus that reprograms printers so that they transmit any printed QR codes to the mothership.
My intent with this wallet printing service is to give users clear tutorials on what steps to take depending on their level of paranoia (or based on the value of the wallets they intend to produce.) So what are some reasonable steps a fairly paranoid user should take when printing? For example:
**Less paranoid:** Connect directly via USB, turn off your internet connection when printing wallets, and cycle power on printer before going back online.
**Most paranoid:** Dedicate a printer to printing wallets exclusively, never let it go online, connect it directly via USB to your computer, factory-reset your printer from time to time.
**Insanely paranoid:** Don't use a printer. Use a photo-sensitive ink and expose it by pressing it against your screen to burn in the QR code that's been generated by your totally offline javascript.

If the private address contained in your print job (the wallet output) is encrypted with BIP38 why should you worry about the paper wallet print job being shared/stolen/uploaded to the mafia mothership?

If bitcoin crashed (or some would say corrected) to US$100 tomorrow, that means that since January 1st 2013, the currency would still have appreciated a "respectable" 650%. And if the price was $200 12 months from now, that would still be excellent positive movement, having doubled in a year. 
The current state of affairs -- where bitcoin has increased 650% in just **two months** -- is fairly freakish and I would discourage any business from assuming that it's got no way to go but up.

Regarding trusting the merchant and such, my current thinking is that paper wallets are best used as personal bank accounts not for actually making purchases by exchanging the paper wallet between strangers. (That's why this design features a handy 'register' area on the reverse.) In this regard, the tamper-proof aspect is to make sure your roommate doesn't siphon off your coins when you're not looking. (Or to prevent boneheads from accidentally sharing their private key by taking a photograph of their cool new Bitcoinz :)
As for the BTC, I'm not sure but I think bonez656 might have snagged the reward within minutes of posting. This should be an interesting test case on double-spending if a few hundred people try to swipe the wallet. :)

Last night around 12:30am I finally got my Raspberry Pi + BFL Jalapeño to work together. This means I can run 24/7 using just 36 Watts of power. Also, now I can move this noisy (whirring fan) device into any room in the house that's accessible with an ethernet cable. Maybe I'll even put it in the chicken coop so it keeps the chickens warm? In any case, this is a huge jump since last month with my ATI GPU + Mac Pro I was mining at 55x slower speed while using 7x as much electricity.
After yesterday's whopping 28% difficulty increase, 5.5GH/s earns .17BTC/day (approx $20). But at 36 Watts the power consumption is *11 cents per day*, so this should continue to be profitable for some time yet. 
Or this will suddenly be a huge waste of time, money, and electricity if Bitcoin fails altogether...
Special thanks to the [MinePeon]( project which made this process a lot less painful than it could have been.

You're the second person to comment on this possible weakness. So I just now [did a test]( squishing the bill and then shining an extremely bright laser through the now 2 instead of 3 folds. Result? The QR code is still totally obfuscated because of the security pattern printed on the opposite panel. However I could easily read *some* of the characters in the alphanumeric private key. Probably not enough to be a risk but I'll redesign to make sure there's a good security stripe that gets folded over the alphanumeric private key as well.
Thanks for the advice!

Hi, I'm the developer/designer of this service. For sure you should download the ZIP file and run the generator off your local computer after verifying the PGP signature to make sure your download wasn't tampered with. I don't recommend running the wallet generator off of the live website itself.

Why a CD? Because even if your internet connection or computer is crawling with hackers and trojans, you can just boot from this CD and print out secure wallets. 
Why not a USB thumbdrive? Because the CD can't be changed. A little annoying that you have to re-setup your printer each time, but a CD circumvents an exploit in which someone in your trusted environment (friend, roommate, workmate) borrows your Ubuntu USB Live booter and adds a keylogger or something.

I had lots of fun this weekend working on my own design for a two-sided tri-fold tamper-resistant paper Bitcoin wallet. Thanks for any and ALL criticism / comments -- whether it's about the look &amp; feel, functionality, security features, etc.
This video is also a treasure hunt in which I happily invite you to “steal” 0.1 BTC . Finders keepers, so [race on!](
Design features:
* Private key is hidden behind folds, so your wallet content is still safe if left out in the open or photographed.
* Tamper-proof tape indicates when you (or someone else!) has revealed the private key.
* Folding design obfuscates private keys so they’re hidden even when holding wallet up to a bright light.
* Reverse side has basic wallet operation instructions and a register for writing down deposits / balance.
* Private and public keys are replicated (and rotated) in triplicate to maximize chances of recovering keys if paper is damaged / crumpled.
If you'd like to print out a sample [see PDF links here](
@_date: 2013-08-25 18:13:21
This type of tamper resistance only makes sense when you're trying to discourage *casual* or sneaky theft from your wallets -- for example, if you have a dorm roommate you don't necessarily trust. There are definitely ways around having a 3rd sticker on the bag, or to get around the stickers on the wallet itself. It won't stand up to DEFCON. :) But if you can *quickly* and *easily* and *cheaply* make it much more difficult for someone to snoop your paper wallet, why not?

Hi there,  author here. If you use a [sufficiently modern browser]( with bitcoinpaperwallet, an entirely different source of random number generation seed is used, window.crypto.getrandomvalues().

Until then, just be sure to use a nice modern chrome or firefox or safari. Not IE.

Yes, I'm using MinePeon. Didn't require much Linux fiddling. My main challenges were:
1) Learning how to properly format and copy the disk image to the SD card (it's not especially easy on OS X.)
2) Troubleshooting. A USB hub the Pi didn't like that was causing hardware errors, but there's no way to see this from MinePeon. IAC, it turns out I didn't need to use a hub and I could just connect the Jalapeno directly to the Pi.
The only thing that might be easier than MinePeon is using BitMinter's latest beta. This is a java app that runs on your desktop/laptop and is fairly easy to get going with BFL ASIC as long as you're running the beta.

By pure random chance, imagine being so lucky that you roll a ten-sided die 100,000 times and happen to end up with the first 10,000 phone numbers of the New York white pages in alphabetical order. Did you succeed? Nice trick! Now attempt that same trick 100,000 times in a row without fail, and you'll begin to appreciate the realm of luckiness you'd need to have an 'address collision'.
*But this assumes perfect random number generation*. In practice, certain random number generators end up producing [much less than random results]( When a RNG flaw is discovered, the entire address space of that RNG can be snapped up by thieves.

My thinking on using a VM to patch/compile/master an ISO is twofold:
1) If you start off with a VM, instructions can be OS-agnostic from that point on because everyone is using the same OS regardless of their computer hardware.
2) If you're not running your patch on a totally clean OS, there could be a trojan on your computer that constantly scans your filesystem for the filename of the PPF patch or bitcoinpaperwallet.com ZIP or whatever, and replaces it. I'm not talking about tinfoil-hat level paranoia involving modifications to CD-burner behavior or anything gnarly like that. I'm talking about script kiddy level trojans like those that scan for wallet.dat files.
Myself I don't like the idea of a PPF that patches the ISO directly because it would be so hard to audit/scrutinize the patch for backdoors. As I see it, the main point of helping people ("giving them the option") to roll their own ISO is so that they don't have to trust my 650MB binary. Trusting a binary patch would be just as worrisome.
I think any "roll your own" instructions should only involve official binaries (e.g. the Ubuntu live CD distro) combined with easily scrutinized open-source code (e.g. bitcoinpaperwallet.com / bitaddress.org / brainwallet.org HTML). For everything else, I'd just offer a fully-built ISO that's checksummed and peer-reviewed.

Hello everyone, especially **BitcoinPaperWallet.com author here.**
Thanks for using your elfin Christmas magic to work on a pull request. :) I'm definitely interested in implementing BIP38 and I'll look into this pull request as soon as the eggnog wears off.
I suspect there might still be a few issues to work out, in particular revising the front side graphic of all 10+ wallet designs so that they don't have "Wallet Import Format" hard-coded in the JPG itself. Oi! This will have to switch to CSS. Similarly I wonder if I should provide special instructions on BIP38 encrypted wallets since redemption/importing/sweeping will be  much less obvious.

BTW this is probably the best way to run bitaddress.org offline as well, my assumption being that the bitaddress.org github .ZIP is less likely to be compromised than either the bitaddress.org webhost or domain name registrar. Saving bitaddress.org's HTML to disk may saves you a few seconds but IMO isn't as trustworthy as using the ZIP that pointbiz provides on github.

This would be good in an ideal circumstance, but in reality because of shifting with folding and paper density, you wouldn't get a solid black square, you'd probably get a fairly easy to read two-tone QR code.

True! All the security features in this design are just meant to (1) prevent accidental revelation, and (2) deter fairly casual tampering. They don't erect impenetrable firewalls by any means. However one idea I've been toying with is printing different designs of stickers with limited editions so that every month the design changes.

@_date: 2013-12-10 15:58:05
I'll definitely add on a download option, but first I have to sort out a foolproof and easy download verification system for the average purchaser. A webhosted ISO is just such a soft &amp; juicy target for hackers that I should anticipate at some point it would get compromised, and purchasers would have to have some way of verifying their download without becoming PGP/MD5 experts themselves.

I'd like to see the obfuscation pattern (the block of noise left of the private QR code) get random-generated too. Many people have asked for this feature to better secure against "candling" attacks that rely on the consistency (difference patterns) available by having the same obfuscation pattern on every wallet front.

I'd recommend a slight variation on this which is my own fork of bitaddress. My service is essentially identical except (1) it has a slightly improved random number generator, (2) folding design includes tamper-evident features and prevents accidental photocopying, and (3) looks "precious" meaning it's less likely to get tossed in the trash if you die and your survivors are poking through your safety deposit box.
I can see the appeal of additional layers of encryption, etc. but my worry is that the risk of having something go amiss (forgetting passphrases etc.) is greater than the risks you run by simply saving a regular paper wallet in a safety deposit box the way you would jewels or cash.
This is my project:  -- check out the landing page for additional tips on secure generation of paper wallets (no matter what service you use.)

First of all, I love this type of stuff... stenographic encryption and random dot stereograms, etc. I like your concept.
But I'm not sure how this is an improvement over a paper wallet design that [folds and seals shut]( so as to hide the private key altogether. 
Edit: I think this concept could make for a really interesting puzzle/game... something where you collect transparencies and have to find the magic pair that unlock the treasure.

Serial numbers are a fine idea. I've been considering this for a while, balancing it against some other approaches/improvements.
Lamination is great but not everybody has easy access to a laminator. If you've got one, great, use it! My goal with  is to make attractive reasonably secure wallets available to anyone with a printer. The generator is free, and the stickers are totally optional. My effort is merely a *minor* improvement on what was already the generally accepted method of making paper wallets (using bitaddress.org, the excellent code from which bitcoinpaperwallet.com is forked.)
@_date: 2013-09-15 16:36:29
Great idea. I'll make a pitch/plug for my own [paper wallet design]( because (a) these look a little more precious/gift-worthy than other paper wallets, and (b) they're suitable for gifting to novices because the recipient can't accidentally reveal the private key (e.g. by sharing a photo of the neat "bitcoin someone gave me") on account of the folding design.

As I understand it, re-using doesn't reduce security. It reduces privacy / anonymity. Myself I believe in using paper wallets as 'piggy banks' -- see  -- the idea being you should feel free to deposit to it as many times as you like, but when you're ready to use it, "break it open" and transfer all the coins to a live wallet and destroy the paper wallet.

In case you want to see what bitcointalk folks said about this, I asked [the same question]( a few months ago when I was working on [bitcoinpaperwallet.com](

**This.** I've developed my own fork of bitaddress.org which prints wallets that fold and seal shut so as to hide the private key. I wanted to address accidental theft from people *unknowingly* revealing their private keys. 
Consider this believable scenario: Someone gets a bitcoin paper wallet for Christmas and briefly shows it their family. One family member is videotaping the general excitement, and later posts a clip to Facebook, "MY BROTHER HAZ BITCOIN!". Sneaky friend-of-a-friend on Facebook takes a screenshot of the paper wallet and sweeps the wallet. New years tears.
If you don't mind the added layer of encryption, BIP38 hugely reduces this risk, making folded / tamper-evident paper wallets less important.
I hope someone maintains a page on the bitcoin wiki or something that keeps us up to date with which services and wallets that will let you import/sweep a BIP38 key.

I'm a huge fan of BIP38 encrypted private keys, but what would make sense for a BIP38 design is a *non*-folding wallet.

Nobody is making a claim that stickers (mine or those on casascius coins for example) provide some kind of impregnable "security". The point is: *if* we are going to commit bitcoin to physical wallets – be they coins or paper or whatever - what fast, easy, cheap measures can we take to make them as tamper-resistant as possible? You can make an argument that paper wallets are inherently insecure, but for those of us who still want to use paper wallets, there's value in figuring out how to build them so that they don't give up their private keys either accidentally (because the private key is clearly visible) or to fast/easy/casual tampering.

Hi answer is sort of. What you do is ' swipe' your entire wallet to an online wallet (or bitcoin wallet software on your computer) and then spend freely to multiple people. You can also spend postural funds then xfer the remaining balance to a NEW paper wallet if you like.

I think you're misunderstanding me. I'm not saying that we shouldn't let people make their own decision. I really and truly think it's a fantastic idea to publish a how-to guide on rolling your own secure ISOs. I'm not being sarcastic. In fact this is essential knowledge to colate because my generator isn't the only software out there that needs to be run securely: how about vanitygen, bitaddress.org, brainwallet.org, etc?
My comment is that I just don't think it's possible to do this in a **concise** way. Rather, I can easily imagine a whole *website* dedicated to rolling your own Ubuntu ISOs, complete with videos and step-by-step instructions for different operating systems, subsections on getting up and running with virtualization environments, etc.
I'd donate to someone making such a resource. I'd even pay for access. When I was researching this process for myself and trying to bootstrap together halfway broken tools out there like UBK and getting VMWare to recognize my CD burner, I would gladly have paid $100 for a comprehensive guide to what I was trying to do.

 I agree re: cold storage -- but also paper wallets are a great way to give BTC to people who implicitly trust you, e.g. family &amp; friends. This design is fairly idiot-proof in that the recipient keeps the value as long as they don't physically lose the wallet. (No risk of recipient losing coins because they leave it in plain view or share a picture of the pretty wallet on facebook, for example.)

Myself, I do not recommend giving away paper wallets with BIP38 encrypted private keys, because as of yet there are very few major wallets that will import/sweep BIP38. Instructions for "how to redeem this gift" will be much more complicated.
If you give away a wallet with a regular old WIF private key (the kind that starts with a number 5) then it can be imported into virtually any live wallet or service without fuss.

@_date: 2013-12-26 13:54:02
My thinking is to support bip38 in the near-term, and hopefully design the interface in such a way that as new encryption proposals gain acceptance, they can be added as options without confusing or cluttering the interface. For example, a checkbox for "encrypt private key" and a dropdown that lets you select the scheme (bip38 / etc.)
How does that sound?

Sure. A few months ago Gavin Andresen [contributed a patch]( to let the RNG take advantage of window.crypto.getRandomValues() for browsers modern enough to support it.

First of all, I *love* the idea of using hex dice for generating keys. I have 12-sided music dice that help me compose in different keys but that's a different matter entirely.
BTW: If all you're concerned about is the random number generator in bitaddress.org, check out my fork of bitaddress. My generator is identical, **except** that -- if you're using a modern enough browser -- window.crypto.getRandomValues() is used to seed the random addresses. This is (allegedly) suitable for cryptographic applications.
Or, if you still roll your dice, my site lets you type in your own WIF key if you just like the design of the paper wallet and don't want to deal with the generator.

The folding part is especially good for gifts because it more or less "idiot-proofs" the wallet.

I love the idea, and I'm flattered that you used my design/generator! ( -- *Private message me with your mailing address and I'll send you a batch of free hologram stickers* so you can **seal** the next set of wallets you geocache. Why?
1) They'll look more precious/valuable, and
2) The tamper-evident seal prevents against the (albeit unlikely) scenario of someone finding the cache, writing down the private key, then letting someone else find the cache and use the wallet as a place for depositing *new* funds (instead of simply swiping it.) The instructions on the reverse of the wallet do encourage users to add new funds so...

The trick to durable paper wallets is to (1) make duplicates and keep them in separate locations e.g. safety deposit box plus home office in a fireproof safe, and (2) use waterproof tear-proof synthetic paper (like "Teslin"). This is the sort of stuff Navy submarine manuals are printed on. :) Synthetic paper can even improve durability for inkjet-print wallets, though it's always better to use a laser printer since laser toner is basically plastic and won't ever run like ink.

**Hi! I'm "that guy"** -- the person behind  and the Ubuntu Live CD's that I'm offering to ship anywhere in the world for USD$36 or .037 BTC. Selling products derived from open-source software is obviously a sensitive topic and I'm interested to find out what the right price point is.
I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has about the product I'm offering. It's not a scam, it's a legitimate secure offering for people who don't have the time or inclination to become security experts themselves. It might be overpriced -- in which case nobody will buy it and the price will come down. I'm considering offering a much cheaper ISO download, but for my target market (people who don't roll their own Ubuntu on a regular basis) there are very tricky issues regarding validating download signatures and such.
Anyway, "this guy" is me: **Canton Becker**. I'm 40 years old, I'm married, and when I'm lucky my 6 year old son helps lick the envelopes so I can mail hologram stickers all over the world. I live in Santa Fe, New Mexico (USA). I've been an enthusiast and contributor to the Bitcoin community since August 2011.  [My bitcointalk trust page.]( 
My goal is to make saving bitcoins easy and safe, and I supplement my regular income by selling things like custom-designed tamper-evident hologram stickers to safeguard the folding paper wallet generator I give away for free.
I recently designed what I think is a gorgeous (and secure, tamper-proof) paper wallet specifically for giving away bitcoins this holiday season. Like most of what I do, it's free. Have a look!

Hi there, bitcoinpaperwallet.com author here. Very good question. The first thing you can do is run a "diff" between the HTML files for bitaddress.org and bitcoinpaperwallet.com and make sure that the only differences you see between the two are cosmetic/user interface issues.
That narrows down the trust to trusting bitaddress.org, which has a much longer history of being carefully monitored and audited.
The short answer to your question is that there's no substitute for auditing code. Myself I've been thinking about putting up a bounty to have people *carefully* audit my own code. I just can't figure out what the contest/reward would be. Something like planting an easter egg deep in the code such that only a careful auditor would notice it...

**Definitely.** I strongly discourage purchasing paper wallets from people you don't implicitly trust (e.g. close friends &amp; family.) Paper wallets (and Casascius coins) may *look* like currency, but they should never be used *as* currency. The one exception is where you purchase a wallet from someone and then immediately withdraw ("swipe") the entire balance to an online or paper wallet of your own.

At the moment, this design is only available using the [online generator]( linked to this post. 
If you want to use this design for ~~non-tolkien~~ oops non-token amounts, it's a little complicated: Download the generator from [GitHub]( then install these three files into the images directory. Then you can launch the generator locally by appending **?design=hobbit** to the URL, e.g. file:///generate-wallet.html?design=hobbit

"[pointbiz]( made bitaddress.org . I don't know his identity, but I've exchanged a few messages with him and sent him a few [donations]( for his excellent work. 
I'm not a crypto programmer, but I have been paying close attention to the bitaddress.org codebase for the last few months, especially since the constituent javascripts were moved into a grunt build system which made it *look* like 1000's of lines were touched. (They weren't. It was just spacing/tabs for the most part.)
Based primarily on the audits and trust of folks on bitcointalk.org, **I've concluded for myself that bitaddress.org is extremely reliable and honest**, and that security wonks are watching every commit carefully. I've staked my own reputation on this as I'm using bitaddress.org as the crypto code base for my own paper wallet generator, **
I trust it more than I do any C++ / compiled address generator because it's so easy for the Bitcoin community to audit Javascript (and conversely so difficult for a malicious author to hide something like a de-randomizing element.)
The only thing I've found lacking so far is that bitaddress.org has been a little slow to implement window.crypto.getrandomvalues() for seeding randomness, an edit I made to my own random number generator a couple months ago after Gavin Andresen sent me a patch. On the other hand, moving slowly before adopting significant changes to the RNG is probably just prudent.

Hi there,
I made a service exactly for this purpose. Will save you some work as instructions are included in the wallets. Also the design is fairly idiot-proof, in the sense that novice recipients won't be able to accidentally give away the private key.

Curious to know what horror stories you've heard.
I've designed a paper wallet special for the holidays:
It includes family-friendly features like instructions on the wallet itself, and a folding tamper-evident design that lessens the chance that a family member will do something dumb like share a photograph of a private key on facebook.
Plus they're pretty and shiny.

Actually, I'm unconvinced that any additional light blocking material is important. Sure doesn't *hurt* to add some tinfoil, though I would do a ton of research first to make sure the extra blocking material isn't ink-reactive or liable to adhere to the private key over the years (oi!)
Myself I haven't seen a single successful effort to recover a reasonably complete private key by illuminating my folded design with lasers, scanners, camera flashes, etc. [This is the closest I've gotten]( to successfully "candling" this design. I'm interested in putting up a bounty to see if someone else can do better...

The private key is printed 3 times inside the folded area: once as a QR, and twice as alphanumeric. The alphanum keys are rotated and offset from the fold so that the folding area doesn't interfere with the same characters or digits. No way to tell except for a few years from now, but I've done my best to make sure it's robust for recovery.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:36:41
For when someone MUST use a brain wallet, I did some thinking about what a fairly *memorable* passphrase of decent strength might look like. I came up with this:
*Full name of favorite fictional character + some full mailing address* (e.g. childhood address)
**Powdered Toast Man, 9421 Elm Street Apt. 2A, Evanston, IL 60211, USA**
I'd guess these would be fairly impossible to brute force. You'd just have to worry a little bit about social engineering where someone specifically tries to guess your individual passphrase. But myself, I could actually memorize something like this for a few years I bet. It would be great if the brainwallet.org authors could provide a few suggestions like this and actively discourage bad passphrases.
@_date: 2013-09-29 12:29:34
True, I forgot about that! The other thing I liked about using a mono font is in the (incredibly unlikely) case that someone gets a key with a very high proportion of wide characters (M, Q, W) the key won't fall off the edge of the wallet.

**Let's wager!** (Friendly.) I'll send you .1BTC if you can illuminate one of my wallets in such a way that at least one person on this thread can take your illuminated photo and process out the complete private key using whatever software/image processing they like.
1) You have to produce the wallet exactly according to the instructions on the  website (including the hologram stickers -- I'll send you some for free if you don't have any.) 
2) Illuminate the folded wallet however you like and upload a photo
3) Everyone here can do his or her best to recover the key from your photo. (I'd let you recover the key but since you already know the key that wouldn't be fair.)
PS: A camera flash produces many many thousands of lumens, much brighter than any flashlight. It's a much better starting point, especially since it can be triggered by a camera :)

As the developer/designer of the service likely used to produce the wallet with "unique coded tamper resistant Bitcoin holographic tape" mentioned in this ebay listing, I am shaking my head in utter confusion. I can't believe people are selling (or worse yet buying) loaded wallets where the seller announces outright that he will *keep copies of the private key*. And directs newbie buyers to install the standard bitcoin software to setup their own wallet. With a broken URL. And I don't believe the standard bitcoin-qt client actually allows paper wallet swiping without the command line interface. (Still true?) OI. Oi oi oi.

Can anyone else verify this exploit? I'm having a really hard time getting anything close to a readable code off of a properly folded &amp; sealed wallet. You can see my best efforts here:
It's definitely not that I don't have a bright enough speedlight... Maybe it's something about distance from the flash or something? For me, the security obfuscation patterns get in the way of anything close to a recoverable QR code.

The CD is simply the standard 12.04.3 LTS Ubuntu Live CD image, remastered in a super-secure environment with **only** the following changes:
* Removed the Windows files (e.g. autorun.inf)
* Removed the ubiquity package (used for installing Ubuntu on the hard drive)
* Added the latest version of bitcoinpaperwallet.com (including all 10 language translations and the holiday design) to the desktop
* At boot time, the printer config and the wallet generator (Firefox) automatically fire up
That's it! No bitcoin wallet software, etc. This is exclusively for the purpose of printing out paper wallets. Modifications have intentionally been kept to a minimum so that anyone who wants to can easily/quickly compare the checksums of this CD against the Ubuntu distribution to verify nothing's been tampered with.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:50:31
Excellent idea.
But I wonder if it's **possible** to write concise directions on how to:
1) Install a clean Ubuntu on a virtual filesystem, boot to that filesystem, and then *from within the virtual OS*:
2) Download the Ubuntu LiveCD ISO
3) Download and extract the bitcoinpaperwallet.com files from GitHub
4) Verify the signature/integrity of both downloads
5) Remaster/patch the LiveCD ISO so as to include the bitcoinpaperwallet.com files  on the boot user's desktop
6) Burn the remastered LiveCD
Such that the instructions are:
* truly concise (not 20-30 pages)
* sufficiently detailed for someone who has never done any of these 6 steps before
* OS-agnostic, meaning step 1 of the instructions should be expanded for people using OS X, Windows, or Linux, and not presume the availability of specific virtualization software like VMware.
My guess is *no way* can this be done. We could (and perhaps should) write up concise instructions for people who are already fairly expert at Linux and setting up VMs, but that's not really the audience I'm trying to serve. I'm looking after the interests of folks who have more ordinary computer skills -- people who could be taught how to boot to a CD, but who wouldn't have a chance of installing a virtual OS and remastering an ISO.

* Verifying integrity of the vanilla ISO download should be a cinch: it's just a copy paste command line to check the published SHA1
* Verifying the integrity of the github downloads can be a little more involved, but it's not bad. I discuss how to verify my own distro on the README here: 
However I'm not sure that tools for modifying an ISO are necessarily included in Ubuntu. At the very least you might need to install something like UCK.

Depends on the design of the paper wallet. Many paper wallet designs have the private key in full view, which is exceedingly foolish (IMO).
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:44:38
Interestingly, the trust required dips to near-zero with the physical CD because:
* you can run it offline, so no reporting to the mothership
* you can supply your own keys (e.g. using vanitygen or rolling dice, etc.)
However, when using the random address generator, users have to either completely trust the author (in this case me), trust fellow community members (e.g. on bitcointalk.org) or audit the code themselves. 
*If you already trust bitaddress.org*, then auditing is fairly easy, because you can do a "diff" to compare my wallet generator's HTML/Javascript against that belonging to bitaddress.org. What you'll find is that the only changes are to 1) remove features like brain wallets &amp; bulk wallets, 2) change the graphic layout, and 3) add in a more secure random number generator.
*If you don't trust bitaddress.org*, then you're better off rolling dice and minimizing your reliance on anyone else's code, because I'm not sure any Bitcoin-related code is scrutinized as closely as bitaddress.org.

(using bitaddress.org's JS: ) After printing out your wallet, switch to the "Wallet Details" tab and copy/paste the private key. It should reverse-engineer the public key and display it to you.

(thanks for the tip!) -- I could make a glue version, but I think the better option is just to use regular tape instead of tamper-proof tape. What I see as a glue problem is (1) if applied too little, falls apart, (2) applied too much, glue can spread into codes. Plus with inkjet ink you have to be super careful with water-based glues. (3) Someone can slice open glue with a blade and then re-glue without evidence. On the other hand regular tape is almost as good as security tape for this design.

OP: Please address how an encrypted digital wallet is better for:
1) **Inheritance.** If you were to die very unexpectedly from an Aneurysm, will your family (1) know you have Bitcoin, and (2) know how to retrieve it? Paper wallets make this easy. You just keep a copy of your paper wallet in the safety deposit box / safe along with precious jewels and cash.
2) **Longevity.** Have you ever dealt with obsolete data before? I have. Here's a sampling of what I've experienced in the past 29 years (no exaggeration) of dealing with my own data:
* I've had to recover data on obsolete media (5.25 floppy disks) stored in obsolete formats, with limited success
* I've had to recover data on gold-plated CDR's subject to "bitrot" because the manufacturers didn't realize that CDRs would oxidize after as little as 10 years, again with limited success
* I've run around in circles trying to preserve data when interfaces change. I've still got masses of data on 8mm tapes written with SCSI drives and I have no idea how I'll ever recover it. 
When you commit your data to an encrypted thumbdrive, or an encrypted cloud service, or *whatever digital medium*, you are also committing yourself to shepherding that data from medium to medium as the technology evolves. Talk about "human error"! USB will not be around in 10 years. Nor dropbox.
*Specifically, how do you propose to store digital information in way that will be safe and relevant for 20 years without having to migrate your data to more modern media every so often?*
When you commit your data to a piece of paper, you get to rely on 1000's of years of human experience regarding how to keep paper, jewels, cash, etc. safe without being screwed over by technology or hackers.

When I first heard about this patent last night, I figured BitBill had honorable intentions -- for example protecting their own intellectual property for the purposes of soliciting venture capital funding. But after reading their exchange with Mike I'm worried that BitBill's primary goal may be extorting licensing fees instead of bringing novel products to market.
Here's a great (entertaining and informative) radio show on the topic of "patent trolls" and how they use overly broad patents to extort fees from startups: [This American Life: When Patents Attack!](

An offline generator can steal your coins.

I definitely will offer a much cheaper ISO direct download, but I have to do some research and planning first to sort out security concerns. An online ISO is a soft juicy soft target for hackers (as compared with a physical CD) and my general audience isn't so savvy with checking PGP signatures and hashes.
So yes, I will offer a cheap ISO download, but not until I'm certain that I can give purchasers an easy enough way to verify/validate their download.
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:18:18
Not at all a stupid question! What you do is type in the *public* key (the one that's visible without unfolding the wallet) into the search field at blockchain.info. Actually it's usually sufficient just to search for the first 8 or so characters, no need to type in the whole thing or bother with the QR code (which is just the exact same public key encoded as a graphic.)

Hi, I'm the guy behind [BitcoinPaperWallet.com]( AMA. :)
I for one think this is a **great** exploit. As fluffyponyza mentions below, during the design and testing (and redesign and re-redesign) of BitcoinPaperWallet, a number of kind dedicated souls tried all sorts of [non-destructive exploits]( including lasers, high-intensity scanners and flashlights, volatile liquids, etc. But nobody tried a speedlight/flash -- that's genius, especially since it's timed to a camera on the other end! :) Kudos to you for this experiment HeadCRasher.
I would like to know if this exploit actually works with the stickers on though. The stickers serve two purposes: 1) they obfuscate the two alphanumeric printed copies of the private key (private key is printed in triplicate, twice alphanum, 1 QR) and 2) *they keep an obfuscating security pattern nicely pressed up against the QR code to guard against bright-light attacks.*
If it turns out this exploit works reasonably well (e.g. no need to write special software to recover QR code) I'll probably need to consider a new design in which a single large sticker covers the entire QR area and flap seals, not just the edges. But as others point out in this thread, if you want an immediate fix, a bit of aluminum foil will do very nicely. :)
