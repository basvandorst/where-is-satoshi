He's gotten a lot of experience vlogging from his poker days. Doug is usually well informed and able to present information in a clear and entertaining way.

Unfortunately relatives aren't going to read that if they aren't already interested.

Trying to bribe me eh? lol just kidding. Thank you for the tip! It's the first time I have received one on reddit.

Then you must have saw different products then the mugs I use.
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:21:50
Thank you!
They are special mugs that have a temperature sensitive ink. I create the designs and then they are printed on a sublimation/heat transfer paper. The design is then cut out, wrapped around the mug, and heated until the image transfer from the paper to the mug.

Thank you for being awesome.

Hey longtime redditor and hodler here.
A while ago I noticed one of my mugs posted on and the response from the community was amazing, it literally had me smiling for the rest of the day. It also inspired me to design a few more bitcoin mugs and add a bitcoin payment system.
I thought it would be fun to give away a few mugs for Christmas. I think the easiest way to decide the winners is by posting a number from 1 to 200. The two users that post the right number, or nearest to, will receive a mug of their choosing. I will add a few more mugs to the give away if this thread gets tons of responses.
The limits are 1 guess per user and the winners will be chosen on Monday at 12am.
The winners can pick any mug from  it doesn't necessarily have to be a [bitcoin mug](
**To the moderators:** I hope this giveaway is allowed. If there is enough interest I can hold a single mug giveaway for just the mods. Maybe by guessing a letter from A to Z. I'll check back here in a bit to see how things are going.
Edit: Due to the amount of entries the number will be between 1 - 200. The winning numbers will be chosen using a random number generator so this won't affect anyone who has already guessed.

I wish that were the case but the mugs are a little side business/hobby I do while I'm not working. Thank you for the compliments.

Thank you for the tip!
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:16:27
Lol thank you. 
Throw in a guess anyways. Maybe you'll win and can send it to someone as a gift. 
The mugs are available at

The mugs you are talking about have a glossy finish. Mine are matte and you can not see the hidden image until the mug is heated.

ATM's are going to cost you 10% in fees.

It depends on the time of the day.

Hey Stan. I just heard from the other winner that the shipping price was not deducted when using the coupon. I am going to refund you the price of shipping for the first mug. 
Sorry for the confusion and thank you for helping out.
@_date: 2019-12-02 12:13:10
You're right. I knew it sounded off but I was tired and couldn't figure it out.
@_date: 2019-12-02 08:57:56
Sorry, I didn't see this post until now. It must have gotten lost among all the other replies.
I do offer delivery to Argentina and have already had a few Argentinian customers. 
Because the mugs are being sent from America to Argentina I would suggest placing your order by the end of this week to make sure you get them by Christmas.

Hi Everybody (Hi Dr Nick!)
A few days ago I made a post about giving away a few bitcoin related trick mugs. Here is the original thread: 
After 3 days of allowing entries there were about 300 guesses made. I then used an app,   which randomly chooses a winning comment in the thread.
The lucky winner is user/**Stanhopeofficial** with the number 36. The user/**Mahouko** also managed to guess 36 so they win the second mug. I have sent them a coupon code for  that will give them a free mug including shipping.
I had a lot of fun interacting with the community and will definitely be holding more giveaways in the future. If anyone has any suggestions on how to decide on the new winners I’m open to ideas.
If you didn’t win and are still interested in one of the mugs I created a 15% off coupon exclusively for the community. The code is **rBitcoin15** and is entered on the payment page.

Awesome! Yes I have an online shop and am also able to create custom mugs. You can check it out at

I nearly spent two BTC on a computer last November. I'm so happy I decided to hodl instead.

Quick question because you seem to know what you're talking about. If I am using a segwit wallet with a nano ledger, will I still have access to bitcoin gold when it becomes available?
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:30:53
Looks like that model is wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:13:32
Thank you.

You bastard.
