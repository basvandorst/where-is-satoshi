No, quite the opposite actually. There are many more reasons to use *other* exchanges rather than MtGox, especially due to what happened a few days ago, what with their API fuckup.

Up for me.

I've added all the ones posted in the comments. Thanks everyone!

I'll remove them, thanks for the heads up.

Uhh, i'm pretty sure Satoshi is immortal.

Something similar happened to me like 2 days ago, I used my account number instead of merchant ID, and I'm just waiting on the order to be re-executed. Your money should be safe, it's just stuck in the BitInstant queue/system like mine and a lot of other people's. 
You can try posting on the bitcoin.org BitInstant support thread  and if you post your details (order id, etc.) they should be able to re-execute your order and get you on your way.

Great site, maybe include a graph or ask/sell table?
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:54:33
Agreed. I've lost more money than I can tell. Please don't continue betting, unless it's money you don't mind throwing away!
@_date: 2013-05-04 14:49:23
I've lost $600.

What are you, like a bitcoin 8-ba...

Great, this will be my bitcoinity alternative. Could you maybe make all the data fit in one page without having to scroll down?
thanks.
