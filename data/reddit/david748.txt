hey guys I'm still owed btc.  I was hoping Roman was working on payments first and than would get things worked out with the BTC situation.  Hopefully with BTC going up so much it will spur others to start getting involved.

do you have any advice as to best means of reaching roman?  It seems like he had been more responsive in his dealings with you.  I think we all would rather a peaceful transfer of funds as opposed to the lawyer approach ( which is an option).  The thing is to my knowledge he has not made mention of returning any btc as he has with returning funds owed to users.  
It seems like Roman did go through some effort to return funds owed to individuals, so hopefully all is not lost in finding a way to return our BTC.
Also not sure if we want to distinguish between users who had btc stolen via the hack versus those who had btc yet to be returned.  As for myself - I had the latter.  I am assuming those funds lost in the hack cannot be returned.

I'm in same shoes and have btc owed that I cannot withdraw.  I made sure to take screenshots as now it does not show the btc balance on bitfloor.
