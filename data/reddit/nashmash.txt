No I haven't. Is there an answer to this question? Tell me oh mighty one

This appears to be doing what the MT.gox split software does. I cant find the source if anyone could help me but I know it works by splitting wallets on a 40-60% bases. It has been talked about before. Correct me if I'm wrong its just my observation.

How can I prove my holdings? I transferred around 30 btc to my account in February but mtgox doesn't send email confirmations. I have the address I sent it to but the balance on that address(I guess bc it's only a temporary one) is zero on block chain.. Will mtgox try to say I had zero bitcoins? If I had access to my account I would take screen shots but that isn't possible now and I guess this is the case for a lot of people

I believe that too. I'm long run bullish 100%. Its just that with all the China news you would expect the opposite..

What the f*ck!?! This absolutely makes no sense. Mtsh*t better come up with some realistic statement so we can stop reading sh*t like this.
I don't give a fuck what they say just enough with all this speculation. Every person on this reddit thinks they are a psychic or a genius.

So much for it being down voted. Bitcoin community maturity right here! :)

I'm one of those but were is the answer??? We need to put a lot more pressure about this issue!!

Suck a dick. Hope you lose some money so you learn not to laugh at people who do.

My sincere condolences brother. Check out this [post](  here. Maybe, just MAYBE, gox will get acquired and the new owners will figure something out..

If you think bitcoin will still be healthy after a 750000 bitcoin theft on mtgox you must be crazy. 
Good luck to bitcoin but if mtgox does compensate their users (me included) bitcoin will lose a lot of loyal followers/users who will walk away and never look back.
Fuck you mtgox for ruining bitcoin for me. I could say I was one of the people that was totally in love with bitcoin but now it's sad to say that if my coins aren't returned I'm out and I won't look back.
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:14:45
I don't know what all the fuss is about. I understand that cash withdrawals are taking a lot of time. However, I managed to get my coins out of there in under 15 min (3 verifications). I don't think they have any problems with btc withdrawals
I didn't mean to say Mtgox doesn't have an issue. I was just sharing my own experience. I did not withdraw a large sum of bitcoins (around ~20 btc) only. I have no doubt that have a serious problem.. why else would i withdraw my funds...
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:07:47
Nothing is official yet. This number that we saw today could be bullshit. Tomorrow or after is the day of truth.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:17:37
I'm not being sarcastic. This really could be good news. Its hope and if it is true people (including myself) might get our money back.

My bad. I'm just pissed off at the situation
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:05:39
I honestly hope so. The least gox could do is write a fucking statement for crying out loud.   Second to that is reimburse the users. They can't just get away with it.
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:20:22
It says on Gox that it takes 10 business days or more for international wire transfers to get through.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:06:37
The guy has worked hard all his life for them.  I'm sorry for your lose hopefully you will get your coins back

I am truly in love with bitcoin. Ive been into bitcoin since 2012 and have been through multiple crashes and lost a ton of money but that didn't phase me because I believe in its revolutionary concepts. I just don't/can't reinvest in it anymore because I took a big hit and financially wise just dont have the means to do so. I figure this is the case for many other people as well.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:14:06
This is actually good news!! :D

The whole point of becoming solvent again is that they will not need to sell the bitcoins to get JPY but instead they can and would prefer to return us BTCs which seems to be the favorable option for all previous BTC owners. 
Mark wrote that he would return BTC if MtGox comes out of bankruptcy in another subreddit here (will get the link when I have the time). It's the easiest way to deal with the distribution instead of having to sell. All they need to do is come out of bankruptcy so the Japanese court is no longer involved and money can be distributed.
Selling 200,000 btc will mess up the market. Plus most of the btc owners would rather get btc back instead of JPY...
The only thing making us wait now is the coinlab law suite... but if the price gets over 2500 then even their money is covered so I don't see what is stopping them from getting out of bankruptcy then. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:53:32
Is this for real?
Edit: Just looked it up. Its a scam. Apparently they take your money and don't send you the coins. Stay away.
