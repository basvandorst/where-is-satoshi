The part that scares me is that everything except Ether drops... Why not Ether.

I'm retarded and invested my student loans into bitcoin and ethereum, partially at the all-time high. Feeling like shit right now, though I do still believe they'll sling back up.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:52:06
Bitcoin is not a company tho, I agree selling your house to invest in it is stupid but its not the same as gambling. Much lower risk.

Congratulations of finding your moon!
I'm also close to my moon, riding the trans-siberia.
It's kinda sad to see so many early backers drop out, but very endearing that they reached their goal at the same time.

Huh, who would've thought that if you get the creator of BCash to talk about his main competitor he would spend 99% of the time lying to sell his own product.
Nice job picking a guest to talk about Bitcoin CNBC.

Holding does not mean it's not a currency.
If the dollar kept rising in value most people would save up as much as they could as well. When people say 'hodl' they mean don't sell it for fiat currency, not don't buy your life needs...

Can anyone tell me if there's a way to get verified on GDAX without passport or drivers license? 
I uploaded my ID but it wants more, but I can't get a driver's license due to epilepsy and don't want to get a passport due to high costs and shitty bureaucracy taking literally a year to process the request.

I see, my bad. May we HODL for many more years my brother!

Look up lightning network... Bitcoin is far from finished.

I put 90% of my student loan money into a 5 year deposit before I started investing in bitcoin :(

Just like most people here I hope it hits 10k, but I really hate it when people act like bitcoin is some riskfree get rich quick scheme. Just like every investment bitcoin has risks, it could go well but there's also a possibility that it won't and people need to accept that reality.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:14:27
English grammar skills have nothing to do with knowledge about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:00:09
I'm a newcomer so correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it expected that BTC will (temporarily) drop in value because of fork making it a good time to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:08:47
Don't jinx it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:44:04
If existing the longest is the only good thing bitcoin has going for it that's terrible and I'm out... Ethereum smart contract are actually useful and could prove to be vital in the future. BTC Cash and Litecoin are just like bitcoin but better. 
What makes you think bitcoin won't be replaced? Right now you're just making me doubt my investment in bitcoin even more.

1. No it isn't, the law specifically talks about age, not appearance...
2. I don't know laws from all countries but at least in NL, Germany and assumably all EU countries pedophilia has a higher sentence than hebephilia. And even if they didn't, I wasn't talking about the law in point 2, I'm talking about public discussions. 
Tl;dr: jailbait is the informal term used in public discussions, hebelhilia is the informal term used by the government and researchers.

Are you saying you need at least 5 bitcoin to get B2X or are you just making it clear that you'll get an amount of B2X equal to the amount of BTC? Sorry for being dumb.

When I try to make an account on GDAX it's unable to verify my ID card, any tips? It worked fine on coinbase, already tried 6 times.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:19:05
How can you be so confident about that when there are altcoins that are just objectively better on every front and altcoins with extremely interesting features. Right now bitcoin is only so big because it was the first of its kind, if it ever gets surpassed it won't be able to get back its lead.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:59:31
A dip would be nice, I'm looking to buy some more and any dip would recover fast because there's a ton of people waiting for one to buy more. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:52:16
Yeah the login is the same but when I try to log in to GDAX it still tells me verification failed. Maybe becuse I fcked it up before verifying on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:20:45
I discovered btc 2 years ago and was planning on buying some but decided I was 'too late'. Last week I finally rediscovered and got the too late feeling again, but now btc is worth a lot more again. There really doesn't seem to be a 'too late' point on this rollercoaster.

21 BTC on an exchange?!?! I'm shitting my pants over keeping 0.15 in one... 
Ever heard of hardware wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:16:40
Please don't.

Maybe if you're too rich to have money issues, but if I lost such a sum of money my life would be over... 
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:30:58
Thank you very Much!
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:17:05
Wouldn't that be a good time to buy more? (Not sure, am a newcomer myself)
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:49:59
I am currently also looking into bitcoin, and if it's ok I'd like to also piggyback ride on this thread.
Would you personally recommend buying into bitcoin ASAP or would you wait until a new 'dip'? Also which site would you recommend to buy bitcoin on? I have registered a wallet on blockchain.com (is this a good site for it?) and have tried making an account on GDAX, though this failed due to the site not recognizing my ID card.
Any advice or references would be much appreciated!
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:32:01
That's what I'm asking. It seems to me it's only because of the branding and because it was first. If this is true that's a serious issue, it would mean that as people learn more about crypto people will all leave btc.

1. Adults that look like children is called age play, and though it is indeed illegal in some countries it is never classified as childporn. (Because it simply isn't.)
2. When people say 'child porn' they're talking about kids under the age of twelve (pedophilia), ages 12-16(/17/18) are hebephilia and referred to as 'jailbait porn' or 'hebephillic porn'.

As someone that wanted to use bitcoin for small transactions, the ~7$ transaction fees are a lot more than 3%.
Tough I do agree bitcoin is far from dying. I believe the transaction fees are a problem, but there will be a solution in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:26:07
How? Whenever I want to transact I get 6-8 euros fee.

Is there any exchange like that that doesn't require passport/driver's license? I can't get driver's license due to epilepsy and don't need passport because I live in the EU.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:41:20
Thank you :)

I think the reporting worked! I'm not seeing the fake when I google electrum.

Be sure to inform him about the hard fork. You don't have to explain it in detail assuming he's not a tech guy, just make sure he understands the price wil probably temporarily drop and tell him to hodl.

But why? What makes bitcoin better?

If you can't see that raping kids and spreading videos of said act is a lot worse than injecting yourself with a chemical that's bad for your own health, then you need to go talk to a therapist. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:18:25
If you're going to sell it through an exchange I would recommend doing it in small portions, selling it all at once is possible but would probably cause a significant price drop.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:47:12
Coinbase price is based on GDAX. They don't directly decide their price, the people using GDAX do.
