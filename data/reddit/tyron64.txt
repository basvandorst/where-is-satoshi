Yes, there is a real conspiracy to publish anti-Bitcoin propaganda and shill it on social media.
1. 98% of the current energy consumption is subsidized by the 12.5 BTC block reward, and 2% by transaction fees.  The block reward halves every 4 years.  
2. Extrapolating the current energy consumption per transaction is a nonsense extrapolation.  The current energy consumption is more than enough to support millions of transactions per second with scaling solutions (block size increases, sidechains, offchain transactions like Lightning and Bakkt).

Bakkt is an offchain system.  It's described in this fortune article:

I'd much rather see Nick Szabo or Ricardo Spagni on the JRE.

"The halving is already priced-in" was a 2015 meme that turned out to be wrong.  
Accumulators will continue recycling the same old FUD memes to discourage competing buyers from increasing their average entry price:

When the block reward halves in 2020, Bitcoin miners are forced to halve their energy consumption relative to the market cap (assuming transaction fees stay about the same).  
After the 2032 block reward halving, Bitcoin miners will consume less energy per $1 of market cap than gold miners.  
Value is subjective too:

Gold is less valuable than Bitcoin to someone who needs to transfer value across borders in a permissionless and pseudonymous manner.

People who are worth low 7 figures, or low 8 figures have enough money to be paranoid, but not enough to justify paying $100k+ per year for private security.  
Also, you have to trust the hired security not to betray you and rob you.  
Privacy is the best security.

Yes transactions that occur on Bakkt, Coinbase, LocalBitcoins, and Circle's internal ledgers are not written to the Bitcoin blockchain.  Therefore, they're offchain transactions (centralized).
Lightning network is also offchain transactions, but they're decentralized.

Joe's demographic would love Nick Szabo.  His blog is full of classic JRE material:






He was good on the Tim Ferriss podcast too.

Lack of utility?  Can I use BTC to buy some of what you are smoking?
Gambling and drugs are two of the largest markets in the world with a combined $1T+ annual revenue.
Bitcoin's adoption in these two markets has been growing since 2011.  The speculative pump &amp; dumps have been riding on top of this real economic growth.
Riches are in the niches.

T-shirts and Bitcoin aren't substitutes, so it's nonsensical to compare them.  Nobody holds T-shirts for years as a store-of-value.
Gold and Bitcoin are *imperfect* substitutes for storing/transferring value outside the banking system.  They're both used to hedge against inflation, confiscation, estate taxes.
Gold mining and Bitcoin mining are obviously different processes.  However they're both producing goods (tangible and intangible) until 2140 when Bitcoin production hits the 21m cap.  The  largest use-case for both goods is speculative holding.  They're imperfect substitutes for that use-case.  It's logical to compare the energy consumption of their production processes.
Anti-Bitcoin folks hate when it's compared to gold because their flagship FUD narrative (energy consumed per transaction) is much less relevant when evaluating Bitcoin as a store-of-value.
In any case, the current energy consumption is more than enough to support millions of transactions per second when scaling solutions are implemented (block size increases, sidechains, Lightning and other offchain systems like Bakkt)

The rate of inflation decreases every 4 years when the block reward halves.

10x price increase every 4 years wouldn't continue indefinitely.
If Bitcoin goes to $350k and matches gold's market cap, that would probably be maximum market saturation.
When the price reaches its' maximum potential and stops rising, the energy consumption will cut in half every time the block reward halves.
