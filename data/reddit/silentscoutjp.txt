Please also check this pastebin I posted if you are not aware of the potential photo ID leak.  You might want to consider moving your fiat out of your withdrawel account even if you stopped using Mtgox a long time ago.

I called the Japanese desk of the MtGox hotline if anyone is interested
TL;DR it is not run by Gox - you won't get your money back from them.

It's true. Mark just texted me. Asked me for my wallet address and how many coins I had with them. He said the coins would be with me in about 2 weeks as texting everyone will take a while.

I no longer travel to the USA because of biometrics. Why would I bother with this ATM?
And I thought bitcoin equalled anonymity and privacy. Where, for example, in the US constitution does it say all private financial transactions waiver all rights decreed by god?
The rule book for the government is one piece of paper whereas their rules for us fill a small library. 
Fxxk this biometric data collection ATM for now. I can buy a precharged anonymous credit card over the counter anywhere in my country of abode and fund any purchase of anything anywhere, online or in person or by proxy through a third party.
Cheaper, quicker and more private than Western Union to start with. Bitcoin palm scan?! Yeah.... Crypto face palm.
Saddest thing is that our fluoridated brainwashed kids would give a DNA sample if it meant 'anonymous' crypto coins could be had with one click. Rational thinking was lost a long time ago.

You kept your cool... amazing.
But the girl initially really didn't give a shit.
Her laughing about the teriyaki sushi is more like why is this guy who just got ripped off trying to chat me up (though I think you did a great job befriending her eventually).
If she did give a shit she would have quit MtGox.
After all she did seem to think that bitcoins were a bit dodge.
But give her the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps she didn't know much about it all until Karpeles went on TV! Excellent management that man!
We should organize a mass call in with the same script at the same time.
Try and get the whole call center giggling away.
Obviously they are at the rental office in Shibuya.

So another fail in comprehension. Or is it just the FRB and BOJ fear freedom of thought, freedom of finance. 
They also announced it will not be able to be 'traded' at banks or stock exchange.
If it's an 'object' then it can be taxed is their game play.
I say come and take it from us.
Oh and if it's an 'object' then why isn't KARPELES being questioned as to where he stashed our coin.
In fact why does he still have access to the www.

While you're busy making wallpapers someone somewhere is about to announce the DRN. The latest crypto cloin (clone/coin) aka the Dorian.

I think he's fast asleep at 5am...
Yours truly was up at 5am listening to the audio typing franticly and hoping for some clues. I think he most likely leaked the audio himself (listen to how we are getting a tough time of it from the bank) unless he stored it on their servers in which case the hackers may well have all of our photo IDs and other personal info. 
Gox sux even if you didn't have your coin with them as about 500,000 people's IDs appear to be fleased and not a single note to that effect from Gox.

Hitler was a Rothschild and so Jewish by decent. But the term Nazi was just a derogatory term coined by Zionists at the time. When you understand that Hitler was actually nothing more than a piece in the Zionist's chess game things become a bit clearer.
I give this circumstantionly gay black man the thumbs up for doing the right thing. 
Does he do international mail order I wonder.
