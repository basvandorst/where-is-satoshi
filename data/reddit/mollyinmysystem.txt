on my iphone app, when i pulled up the sidebar 0 accounts showed up. no wallets of any sort. i guess you are right saying i should've said coinbase glitched instead of bitcoin itself. I'M SORRY

so my app was glitching not even allowing me to look at me any of the wallets concluding me to thinking i was hacked and reporting it. i was just hoping there was some sort of customer service i could get this over with as i know any info related to the account

hey man where can i get a degree for being a not-little, not-limp dicked internet star. how in god's name does me contacting coinbase infer i think it's specifically a BTC company/distributor. clearly you don't understand the question, neckbeard. did i ask if a bank could restore stolen bitcoins? a bank is my wallet provider, if they're the ones preventing it like previously suggested. i said i thought it was a glitch in the title (the whole point) you autistic little shit. get off the internet forever

sOoO if i can purchase BTC and LTC thru Uphold and just have it go straight to my circle account or something or have an acct on that? i'd just buy BTC and spend it i wasn't really investing in too much but was starting to in LTC. i haven't tried anything yet other than localbitcoins and at tthe time i used a credit card instead of cash so really yeah i havent tried anything so ill definitely check it out. i bought some research chemicals i guess but would coinbase really close my acct over that and how would they even know?

coinbase made me close my account for not sure why. i was investing in Litecoin and want to be able to put more in, while also still putting in more BTC at times goes on. I havent boughten anything illegal or anything of the sort. can someone make some sense out of this for me?
anything helps, thanks
