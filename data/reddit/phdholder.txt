How would life have been different if instead of holding those call options, you had moved them to bitcoins in Feb 2017 instead?

Consider that bit coin only has value when someone is willing to pay for it in "fiat currency"... How many people purchase goods or services purely in bitcoin as opposed to selling it in USD/EUR/any other currency then using those proceeds?
How much is an hour of your time or the car you drive worth in bitcoins without looking at the market rate for that day/week/month?

Currency is backed by the economic productivity of the issuing country (its ability to raise taxes). What is bitcoin backed by?

When you are using bitcoin as a savings vehicle (as opposed to a speculative one), I hope you recognize that the great returns are commensurate with the high risk.
The ONLY value that bitcoin has is that there is demand from people wanting to purchase it. Without that demand, it has no intrinsic value. It doesn't represent a share interest in an asset or is it income generating. It's the greatest pump and dump of our generation, and it's currently in the pump phase. The internet age just means that there is also an unlimited pool of people pumping into the hype... until the bubble bursts.

Cool. Sounds like a cult.
And you're referring to Germany almost a century ago to support your claim? ....
And with the exception of venezuela (which did have its economy go to shits), other countries have devalued their currency on purpose to help with capital inflow and increase exports. It's smart monetary policy in action..
