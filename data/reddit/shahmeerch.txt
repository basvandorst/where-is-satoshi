I thought neo got an A- hmm
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:43:14
Well yea but you need to provide the proof. I mean nothing wrong with purchasing Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:09:56
Congrats, damn!

It’s very reputable only for a select countries not including mine. But supported in the US. Not sure about NYS, but worth looking into.

You would sell them on an exchange like Bitstamp, and the exchange will wire you the money in USD. So banks don’t accept BTC they’ll be getting cash. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:00:07
Why don’t you use an Australian Exchange? Like ACX.io
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:50:33
Oh man that’s a tough one. Upto you really, you can make an argument that you did purchase them that way. I would consult a lawyer, tbh. 
Cause any transaction above 10K gets flagged by the IRS.

Try exmo it’s pretty reliable. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:55:26
Have you looked into Exmo?

I’ve read that Bistamp only accepts Credit Cards from a European Origin or someone located in Europe.  (not sure).

In depends on inputs and outputs so the price can’t be determined by me. But around the range of 3-7$ or so. Depends on where your buying from and other factors. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:48:05
No that’s not quite the case. 
But generally the fees right now are 3-6$ per transaction, and more usually if your sending a larger amount. 
So they (the atm), probably attached a really small fee, (at your expense). This is you don’t get like 1$ from a 5$ purchase. 
But, if you did a $100 purchase then they would attach a nice $6-7 fee and it would reach within the hour.

Bitcoin Cash is an independent chain that operates with transaction history than BTC after the fork.
Also BCASH has different difficulty so I guess more were mined than Bitcoin. Maybe you’ve noticed BCASH is 9K blocks ahead of BTC. So more rewards have been given out. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:54:57
I’d recommend use Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:15:40
Nice. Also if you could have a feature to make multiple portfolios.  That would be unique as Blockfolio doesn’t have that 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:23:39
Check the transaction iD. It’s likely it’s not confirmed yet so doesn’t show in the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:53:24
Well it may go through, mempool has cleared up a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:53:58
Right now the fee is 20x that, so it may take a while. In the bright side, you won’t be able to panic sell your coins lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:13:52
Thanks! Also where do you get the list from? Coinmarketcap? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:47:11
44sat/b, this may take at least another week.  The sender transferred 40k of Bitcoins but didn’t put a 40$ fee lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:54:39
I like the coins vs portfolio section, good way to track both.
A night mode would be nice.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:58:33
130K+ transactions backlogged, depending on fee attached it can take 18-30 hours to clear. If you put 710+ satoshi/byte it will on a Block in the hour.  But I think you haven’t if it’s around 400ish it may take 20 hours۔
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:17:31
Yes it’s extremely backlogged as you can see there about 125K transactions waiting to be confirmed.
Down from 190K yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:20:35
Yes specifically EOS/NEO/ADA
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:55:55
By waiting :p
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:23:03
Best of luck, it’s always risky putting money on exchange they can stop it for no reason. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:53:45
It will take at least 28-35 hours to go through; Network is extremely backlogged. Once BCH difficult readjusts miners will come back. 
You can check the speeds here:

1 Million Dollar BTC would mean a 17T+ Market Cap. I would say earliest we would see this is 2025 maybe by 2030 at latest. However the Crypto Cap will get there for sure. My issue is, that’s a really long time frame in Crypto, and I don’t know if Bitcoin will stay around for that long. I have good feeling it will, but too hard to know. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:25:58
Yes with about 500 or so getting cleared every 10-20 minutes, it may take a bit. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:49:51
Binance for sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:45:53
Kinda but they will gradually go down 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:46:52
Yes. Normally it’s around 2500 transactions a block.  So 2000 new a block expected and 500 from mempool.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:18:14
I’d take initial investment out and hold the rest! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:52:46
30K Volume, isn’t that much especially during times of  volatility. You could sell it between rallies within a day or two. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:16:33
Yea, just look at Cardano, it’s practically 3X in 3 days.  I’m really looking into Ethereum competitors right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:54:33
Well, the largest exchanges have a volume of upwards 1 Billion dollars a day, however that’s on a volatile day. 
First your verify your account if I would say Bitstamp.  And Bitifinex. You would slowly sell your BTC, maybe 100 in a day or couple hundred a day. 
On Bitfinex if your verified I believe you can withdraw USD. 
Or send them to Bitstamp and then withdraw it in USD as a wire transfer. 
You can also sell them on Bithumb if you can get an account, they have the most volume usually and would liquidate easily.
This process would take a few weeks to a month, as it’s so much money. However you can sell them instantly but you’d probably lose like 20-30% market value.
 Of course you would need legal approval getting so much money into any bank will more than likely raise red flags. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:06:05
An exchange called Cobinhood is being developed! 
As of now Bitflyer let’s you buy without fees. But again I think you need to be Japanese / have a Japanese bank account to deposit fiat.

I feel sharing this article might add to the conversation.
[NSA and finding Satoshi]( 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:44:43
I understand but you should read the article their approach is unique. And they have the tools to do so. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:50:01
I checked it out the volume is less than 0.3 BTC.
