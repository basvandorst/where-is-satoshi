I didn't know about ARM...
Can you link to something about that?
Edit: Nvm, "At the moment, it is unclear whether ARM and AMD processors are also affected by Meltdown." - 
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:44:39
No, only some x86_64 CPUs are (IIRC mostly, if not all Intel's), the Nano's Secure Element is not vulnerable.

IIRC a transaction spending the change would not receive the SegWit transaction weight discount.
EDIT: ELI5: I am pretty sure transactions would cost more.

It's still better than linking you Coinbase account.
I don't think you can do better without physically demonstrating your access.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:52:56
That's not how you currently use SegWit.
This is the code I used to generate the output address.
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:35:11
I don't think that's OP's point.
OP is saying that the 2X split would be dirtier that the Cash one was.
I disagree that "Bitcoin Cash therefore has most of the benefits of SegWit", IIRC it does not fix TXID malleability.
IMO a raw block size increase should be reconsidered once SegWit and Lightning come into more common use.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:11:36
Not SegWit, lightning.

Yes, probably wanted it confirmed fast though.

Bitcoin Core - 
Very low levels of trust are needed, and it fully validates all blocks.
It has some risks though -

What is the progress on signature aggregation/Schnorr signatures?
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:51:09
Proof of ownership is impossible with bitcoin.
Addresses can't be definitively linked to ID, esp. with Coinjoin.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:56:34
100% chance of Segwit lock-in achieved!
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:51:02
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:28:16
That's what I'm using.
Also, when will SegWit addresses become default?
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:24:32
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:48:15
I think you should have to sign a challenge with the address private key.
It would work on all wallets.
`bitcoin-cli` for example: 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:29:14
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:55:08
ALL full nodes validate transactions, not just the miner's ones.
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:03:12
IMO you should keep your ₿ off exchanges if you are not actively trading.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:47:01
"Please, however, rest assured that your legacy address will remain functional and entirely compatible with Segwit addresses.
This is correct, SetWit addresses can send to legacy addresses and vice versa.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:04:53
"To note, SegWit is fully backward compatible with the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem, users should notice no differences with SegWit enabled except cheaper fees."
I can confirm this.
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:59:21
It would be annoying for micropayments, I would want it be be equal to a 1/1000 of a USD at the most.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:03:43
I would want signature aggregation and Lightning adopted before any hard fork.
If there was a hard fork I would want it to change more than just the block size.
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:11:39
That's probably a good idea anyway, especially with large sums.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:52:36
Are you telling me you keep your ₿ on Coinbase?
Please don't.
Get a hardware wallet.

You should not use SHA256 to derive a key, read this: 
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:58:23
I agree that is is more than "one guy" but if the "one guy" started signaling and endorsed SegWit many others would follow.
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:25:02
I would recommend you use BIP32 for key derivation.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:57:40
Running a full node, not mining.
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:04:19
With SetWit block size is gone and replaced with block weight.
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:28:22
UASF nodes are only useful to the network if you use it for transactions and to store value.
You can also run an Electrum server along side it and connect to it with your devices.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:21:55
You know that you can run `bitcoind` over TOR, right?

Can someone ELI5 this?
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:32:39
This could be useful for large amounts of Bitcoin.
You can use 2-3 multi-sig, with one key in your full node, one in cold storage, and one at the bank.
Be sure that you can over-power the bank if necessary.
@_date: 2017-07-02 08:14:58
Or just use his OpenPGP key.
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:14:49
It's not much help if you don't use it! Full nodes are very secure (only hardware wallets are better), so don't worry about using it instead of your normal lightweight wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:12:03
That would be bad.
One Satoshi should be equal to 1/1_000 of a (current) USD max.
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:47:15
SegWit replaces the limiting code with a unified "block weight".
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:30:43
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:59:53
What? That should never happen. Something will have had to go horribly wrong if &lt;1_000 sat/USD.

In hash functions the digest length and the security are not the same thing.
For example, in SHA-2 the security is half the digest length.

I don't think anyone has said that UASF Segwit is better than MASF Segwit.

If you don't want to participate in UASF Segwit I would suggest keeping them in the latest core full node for maximum compatibility.

If it can be attacked on the test-net it can be attacked on the main-net.
