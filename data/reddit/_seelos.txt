Perfect examples. This is how I assumed it worked thanks for confirming! So in a nutshell, when you’re trading from crypto to crypto, IRS assumes you first liquidated your initial crypto to USD then used that to purchase the second crypto. The liquidation action is what makes it a taxable event (even though technically you never liquidate).
I guess that makes sense. It sucks the IRS is looking at cryptos as assets instead of currencies :(

So you’re saying if you trade to from crypto to crypto and make a gain you pay tax, but if you trade from crypto to crypto and have a loss you can’t claim it?? That doesn’t sound right.

So what will you be recommending moving forward?

Again, the whole verification process. You don’t have to use it if you don’t trust it. But there’s over 13 million users in over 30 countries who do. I believe It’s the most popular form of purchasing bitcoin.

Question: why don’t you guys purchase with GDAX since it has even less fees and is the same entity as Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:03:47
How do you recommend buying for beginners? GDAX? Coinbase? Gemini?
And what method? Bank transfer? Credit card?
From my research GDAX seems to have the best few prices. 
Thanks for the help

From my understanding, Coinbase and GDAX are the same entity. It is simpler to purchase on the Coinbase app but the fees are higher (as you noted). So just go to GDAX.com and login with your Coinbase credentials and you’ll buy with a lesser fee. If you are a ‘Maker’ you’ll have no fees. I recommend reading up on Maker vs Taker buyer. 
Edit: also, I’m assuming the personal info is to get verified and possibly for tax purposes?
