Yeah, go back to the_d with that nonsense. 
Ajit Pai sites "high volume Bitcoin mining" in his case against net neutrality.

Man I wanted to get some money to get on the train when it was 2k...nothing big, around 3 btc would have been enought...Sometimes I beat myself up about it...Imagine losing 6000

Because of it's high perceived value. I doubt most of the 1 k btc holders have the money or assets to match the value of their coins. This hike its the result of people buying to get rich quick, most new comers don't see Bitcoin as the money of the future.

Yes, I doubt any of the 1k btc holders have the money or assets to match the perceived value, this price hike is not people realizing Bitcoin is the money of the future, but people that see it as a "get rich fast"  scheme, it will probably go down and stabilize for a while.
When and for how much? Your guess is at good as mine.

That's a fan theory 
@_date: 2017-07-11 12:09:22
They are canon, but there is nothing like what they are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:36:04
Yes what they talk about is a fan take on the whole thing, nothing official about it 
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:38:31
All theories, these guys are passing fan theories as canon 
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:33:10
You would be correct the other guy is talking about some fan theory 
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:37:24
You are talking out of your ass again and passing a fan theory as canon. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 12:07:30
No? These guys are pushing fan theories as canon for internet points.
@_date: 2017-07-11 12:06:38
These bunch of guys are passing fan theories as canon. The official reason on why Neo can affect machines when outside the Matrix is because the Machines are connected to the Matrix. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:05:58
I know it does not make sense, but that the "official explanation"
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:41:34
He can affect the machines because they're connected to the Matrix
