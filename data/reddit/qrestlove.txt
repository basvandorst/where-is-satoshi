Study up on logic and crafting a logical argument. Because what you just said....

In what ways besides earning money through financial speculation is current ownership of New York real estate required for the future use of New York real estate, tell me, besides financial speculation, why buy New York real estate now instead of when this future widespread valuation has already happened?  
And if current ownership of New York real estate is required to use New York real estate in this future where mass valuation has happened, how exactly will said mass valuation happen when 80&amp; of all structures in New York have already been built?

Perhaps you can explain exactly why you think Widespread Use does not imply or require Widespread Valuation? How can something like Bitcoin acheive widespread use without being widely valued for that purpose? Or perhaps I'm too much of a simpleton to understand your argument. Duhhhhh....  
Granted, the OP I replied to has essentially retracted his point. But maybe my analogy was so supportive of his argument that it has even supplanted the original!

WRONG! Learn the actual definition of money. Has nothing to do with 'guaranteed future value' or any such nonsense.

He's oversimplifying? Yet, you seem to be on the side of the people who've taken the value of a dollar in the past 100 years from $1.00 to the equivalent of $0.01. Or is that "oversimplified"?
"How much money they create is regulated by central banks" - So in other words, the amount of money that banks can print is regulated....by other banks (also printing money). Funny how the 99% only see that money after everything has already been bought up with "funny money" and they're left holding the bag.
Sometimes, it REALLY is that simple.

Right, because I started my comment with, "This post is stupid" --- Oh wait, that was the asshole I responded to!
Maybe try some of your own medicine before prescribing it to others, Friend.

No, YOU don't understand how fractional reserve banking works. Banks ABSOLUTELY loan out more than they have. Look it up.
From Wikipedia: "fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond the amount of the underlying base money originally created" -- Right there in black and white. Every single resource you could possibly look up will agree with me as well. Seems like you pulled your definition of fractional reserve out of your ass.

No, this comment is stupid and filled with lies and deception.
IF you loan your BTC to your parents, you are only able to loan them the amount you actually have. A Bank, on the other hand, lends out 10X what it has, and simply counts on the fact that not everyone will come calling for their money all at once. If people did that, it would create a "run" on the bank.
Look up the meaning up Fractional Reserve Banking before you spout off more complete nonsense in your pure IGNORANCE. Dumbass.

Let's say I deposit $1000 into a bank.
Then the bank makes a loan for any amount. Let's say they lend out $1000.
Guess what? They just created money out of thin air. Why? Because the lendee now has $1000, while I have a claim on $1000.
So at the end of the day, there's 2 people out in the world who both think they have $1000 - That makes $2000 in bank notes out in the world. But that $2000 in bank notes is only based on $1000 of real money. Hence the money created out of thin air.
The fact that a bank is lending out money that they don't own is what creates the money out of thin air. At the end of the day, that money doesn't exist, and if everyone tried to spend it at once they would figure out that fact in short order. 
A Bank cannot do the same thing with Bitcoin unless they gave you a fake balance. A real bitcoin address with a real balance cannot belong to two people at once -- unlike a bank account balance, as I have just shown.
