C'mon guys, trying to squeeze the last drops out of alts to push Bitcoin a tad bit higher?
@_date: 2019-07-31 04:05:19
I remember posts like this during the great pump and dump of December 2017.  Hope you time it right!
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:36:57
Depends entirely on who his audience is!
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:13:17
Define expensive in relation to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:15:40
Let's wait til a Satoshi is worth $1 and just take over the $ symbol.
@_date: 2019-03-30 05:09:37
It's like posting the cost of something in Bitcoin, it changes rapidly.
@_date: 2019-03-11 22:51:13
Fair enough. I've only read about him calling Bitcoin a pyramid scheme, which isn't correct, but there are many websites, coins, and exchanges operating this way so I understand the confusion.
@_date: 2019-03-11 06:38:58
Incorrect.  He bought in stages
@_date: 2019-03-17 07:29:56
Same with gold. Seems all of our mediums for exchange continuously lose value against the actual things we want or need.
@_date: 2019-03-20 07:16:18
The start of the bull run in 2017 was due to Ethereum and the publicity it got from the Alliance members. Regular people felt that gave Ethereum (and cryptocurrencies) legitimacy.  Everything else followed suit and then it just became FOMO, fake news, manipulation, etc that fueled the quick pump and dump at the end of the year.
The next bull run will require something new and game changing like Ethereum.
@_date: 2019-03-03 17:07:16
It's a joke
@_date: 2019-11-24 21:15:25
Maybe it's sarcasm
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:37:21
In this unregulated market it's most likely the exchanges themselves running bots with "infinite" money since they can remove their orders before ours are executed. They can also wash trade their own orders for free to create fake volume.

He's not an early adopter in technology and that has helped him avoid major losses
@_date: 2019-11-27 07:21:54
What about when you get hit by a car before you've setup any type of contingency plan for your funds? What if someone kidnaps you and tortures you with a drill until you give up your key? What if you don't have enough Bitcoin to buy something and need to borrow some to make a payment? 
People will make lots of mistakes, and all too often.
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:18:09
So you can only sell your crypto and then withdraw in fiat?
Maybe they were too lazy to program the wallets
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:45:40
Basically they take psychological influences and multiply them.  You never know which bad news will cause a crash.  It's up to them.

I'd never keep all my money in physical cash...
@_date: 2019-11-24 06:50:01
The fact that coins can be lost forever will mean that eventually the supply will approach zero. There needs to be a solution for that.
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:32:45
The market is heavily manipulated by rich individuals and the exchanges themselves.  The case of Quadriga is a great example of the danger of this space. The market of Bitcoin is operating like a pyramid scheme, although Bitcoin itself is not. This is what is quite confusing for a lot of people.
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:03:20
From the peak of $233 it was down $85 or $21B for Berkshire.  But they didn't buy at the peak.  In fact they sold 1% at the peak. Likely up about 30-40% overall.

Says the number one exchange for wash trading and fake volume

You are completely ignoring the point of my comment.  He is way up on Apple.  In the tens of billions in paper profit.
Right, he doesn't understand Bitcoin, but the point is he wouldn't take that risk until it has a proven track record.
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:14:28
No, we cannot cut the middle man.  We need someone trustworthy to protect ou mroney and ensure it gets passed on to our dependants when we pas away.  We also need someone to store our money so that we can't just be kidnapped and forced to send our life savings without having to deal with another person, or to even protect from our house (mattress) catching on fire.
The main benefit of Bitcoin is that the power of it's creation is decentralized so that at least in the most fundamental way, it cannot be manipulated. (That doesn't stop the price from being manipulated before widespread adoption.)
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:43:57
What type of classes?
@_date: 2019-11-27 08:57:24
You sound like Donald Trump's 2016 campaign
@_date: 2019-03-11 07:08:54
No man, they started buying around $100.  Only their last buys would have been unprofitable, but they also reduced their position at some point.  Still up billions in paper profit.

Hobbyists aren't going to be the norm if Bitcoin is mass adopted
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:24:55
Lol, that exact scenario actually happened to someone:
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:32:17
How do you know he didn't buy back in from $300 down to $150? 
@_date: 2019-11-05 04:32:38
Your neighbours probably don't keep their money under their mattress
@_date: 2019-11-29 03:09:30
@_date: 2019-11-30 01:57:05
This is definitely the biggest issue that will stop adoption. Even the best of us will make mistakes.
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:06:00
This case ended as it should; it's definitely not the fault of the Bitcoin ATM. However, there is a very simple solution to prevent this moving forward: require Bitcoin ATMs or signage around ATMs to provide warning to the user about scams and the irreversible nature of sending funds via crypto currency.
@_date: 2019-11-27 08:22:46
Could just be exchange wallets.
@_date: 2019-11-27 03:37:09
Situations like these are exactly why we have banks in the first place. To keep funds secure.
@_date: 2019-11-01 01:33:10
That's the 100X leverage
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:42:32
Yeah, that's a separate matter and really due to the lack of understanding of cryptocurrencies by the general public, including police officers.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:17:31
Prices on goods bought buy Bitcoin going way up!
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:23:19
Crypto doesn't replace credit cards.
The only thing crypto will replace is central bank control of the money supply.  And even that isn't a given as we've already seen with large mining corps.
Everything else, banks, lenders, etc will all still be needed.

And usually after a big drop.  It's manipulation.
Real volumes are low.

Bitcoin != Blockchain as an industry
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:52:56
Also had issues with bitfinex' API right around the time of the drop...
@_date: 2019-10-03 16:53:47
If REAL volumes are low it's very easy to manipulate
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:34:45
If you are new and don't realize the exchanges run bots themselves to liquidate short and long positions, you are going to get rekt! 
Don't use margin in this highly manipulated market!
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:37:12
You mean by using mixers or converting to other cryptos? Bitcoin is the opposite of anonymous, it's the ultimate paper trail.
The biggest issue for me is that if I'm my own bank, I'm also my own bank security guard... There is a reason not all of my money is sitting under my mattress.
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:20:41
By the same logic, you can also still buy tulip bulbs:

It might work!

Yeah, I guess my point is that now more than ever people need to become for fiscally responsible.  We are addicted to low interest rates and minimum payments. What happens when the economy reverses...

All of those things would be very easy to come by. 
I'm skeptical that you could figure out how to do mining during the early days, but not this.

To use as a currency and not as a speculative investment (gamble).

Start with your $600 and keep investing any additional amounts your SO can afford each month or quarter. Do this for the rest of your life.
@_date: 2019-12-06 23:18:35
Good call. Just keep buying index funds with that $150 and you'll do better than mutual funds. 10% can go to speculative stuff, including crypto.

While cost of living is definitely high, I still see people choosing to live beyond their means.  Buying the more expensive car on financing, dining out with friends when they shouldn't, allowing balances to remain on credit cards. Lack of financial education and a sense of entitlement with many people today. Social influence is very strong.
@_date: 2019-12-23 20:03:57
Corrupt government's are evil whether they are capitalist, socialist, communist, fascist. We need an agreed upon set of rules for a large society to function. Bitcoin and any monetary system will fail in complete anarchy. Go put your head back in the sand.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:25:26
Short term the market always trades against you. Just be patient. 
Next time, always DCA on both the buy side and sell side.
@_date: 2019-04-25 00:16:43
Awesome, 1-2 more lows incoming before we spring up!
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:20:27
Would you really? Anyone with money that didn't just win it quickly would never be that foolish to put 50% in the most speculative of speculative investments.

@_date: 2018-07-26 15:52:37
Taken alone, sure. But with other metrics in mind, companies like TSLA shouldn't have the same market cap as GM. You need to know the market cap if you are going to compare market value to book value which is very helpful when doing fundamental analysis.

Right.  But with the lack of interest from the mainstream and no new entrants, it's unlikely that these bots would increase their volume unless there a scheme at play
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:15:44
It's most certainly fake. Bitcoin/crypto has nowhere near the buzz it had in December 2017 (back then it was a conversation at every dinner table). I don't know a single person that has been buying except those using bots to automatically trade their existing holdings.
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:40:49
Stocks are on sale. Companies like Apple posted strong earnings and are down 25%.  They actually have hundreds of billions of dollars in cash or equivalents, huge brand recognition, lots of room for growth through expansion to new products. There is real value here, not just market value.

There are a lot of appropriately valued stocks that have now dropped significantly. Apple was just one example.
