The way I read it way back 2009-10 was that one could in essence trade their electricity use plus their computing cycles for a store a value that had been created called bitcoin. I think we have a hard time conceptualizing electricity and computing cycles as a commodity.

I talk to new people about btc everyday, Seems like a q&amp;a is always the most effective method in my experience. I would offer both the gift or btc for winners some people just dont want it.

I have already spoken to the ledger before on a previous call and it was received well. But what I want do drive home is the positive accounting method. So analogies like if companies where to be transparent and have a positive a more "mark to market" accounting then we would easily see the power of bitcoin.

I will be using this analogy from here on out. I see that it could be easier to understand for some.

"so actually it's pretty easy" had me sideways laughing. I think I have said 85%+ of the things in these videos. But in the end I have to say that we need a successful 51% attack on the public then it will be easy.

I am highly opinionated and love btc, I also like to test functions of apps to see that they work well, I found a little bug in lawnmower.io app that they are working on fixing.
