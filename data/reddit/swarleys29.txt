SW is the compromise, if you don't see it you don't want to see the problems that one side is talking about, but SW is an onchain scaling (more than BU) because is the foundation for a proper way increase in capacity for the future in the network, and other improvements, and will relieve the situation that we have right now. BU will not take in consideration the problems that the other side is seeing and will make it worse because exacerbate it... 
So SW is a compromise for the problems with the onchain scaling, in size and capacity increase to a max of 4M, and BU is not making any compromise plus bringing a risk of 2 chains...
@_date: 2017-02-13 11:56:11
SW is a comprimise increasing the blocksize, where is the compromise in BU, for the problems that Core is talking? Only one side is making a compromise and is not BU...

Keep up the good work
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:46:41
I hope that the developers of Core, open there eyes and decide to compromise and put the limit to 2MB and then keep with the roadmap that they design for this year, and without further stalling...

Oki doki, thanks

Because we still don't know how many people will use it, so we can't say how much of an increase will be with the roadmap, with the bump to 2MB we know at the instant of the hard fork is done, exactly the increase for block that we get, and also we gain time to SW and LN to be develop. They are not mutual exclusive. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:54:53
I can only guess, but with what has been happening this last 3-4 years their priority is the security and decentralization of the network,  and they didn't want to increase the size until making a series of fixes, and with another side in the table, already trying to hardfork the network (Bitcoin XT) they compromise and put an increase in size in Segwit, presented months later than Bitcoin XT. 
And even in late 2015 you can read that that was the compromise, because they didn't want to increase the size yet and want to put the fixes for the good of the network. 
All HF that only want to increase size are only thinking in the short term,  "feast today, famine tomorrow".

I still don't see where I lose bitcoins, I could lose monetary value of that bitcoins, but it will be my own wrong doing choosing the wrong side of the fork. Even in the case of the miners, I still don't see them losing bitcoins, they will have the bitcoins that they choose to mine. So anyone accepting bitcoins (with the low monetary value) will be only for his poor decision making, not because it is a contentious HF, because if even if it is a non-contentious HF for the 99% of the economy ecosystem, and 1% decide not to upgrade their node they will only be losing monetary value of the bitcoins, not the bitcoins per se. It's like if you choose to exchange your USD for a currency that it will lose value, you will still having the same quantity of that currency, but their monetary value will be less, but it was your choice no one force you to exchange to that currency or in our case choose the new fork or stay in the old one.
So it is possible that a HF could seem contentious at the beginning but it will be only contentious if they lose, if that side of the chain wins it will be non-contentious at the end.
I will love that that the Bitcoin Core will HF to 2MB (that way will not be seen as contentious), and then they can keep implementing their roadmap, but if they don't do that I think that the way to go is HF with Bitcoin Classic, and they seem to be convincing the economy ecosystem... and I hope that in that case the Core Developers just not to quit, because if they do that they will not better than MH in that regard.

I see that you are shifting the conversation from capacity increase to lose of money, so let's talk about it...
If I don't upgrade I will not lose money I will choose to keep it in the old fork, and maybe this fork will be more valuable for BTC or maybe less valuable I don't know, in either case it will be my choosing so... 
The bitcoins will not disappear in the case of a HF, I will be the owner to the private key of the address where they are locate it, this time in two forks, the one that I'm using and the one that I don't. So no lose of bitcoins in this case. Also a HF is boolean in the case that they will no longer compatible between them, but is not boolean in the case that your telling me, if 75% of the network, services, etc change to the new fork, it will work perfectly with the services in the same fork maybe a little slow at the beginning, but the retarget will arrive, and everything will be smooth again... and the logic says that the remaining 25% will jump ships to the new fork, because the time of confirming blocks will greatly increase for the loss of miners, so until there is the retargeting in the difficulty, it will be a very slow fork and with a lot less utility because the losing of services but again not lose of BTC, money we don't know, because we don't know which fork will be more valuable.
Could you explain to me in which concrete case someone will lose BTC just because there is a HF without making a tx? and making a tx in which concrete cases someone will lose BTC? without the concrete cases with my understanding is that you're trying to FUD me and the community in general.
I'm not oppose to SW, LN or SC, but I really think that we need a direct bump in the block size (and is very possible that we need more in the future), and in this case, I only see one side making compromises, from 20MB to 2MB, the other side has been stalling because deep down you know that SW, LN or SC are not a direct bump but an indirect one, and we don't know when will be ready to deploy, even less how much time will be take to the users to start using the technology to get the benefit of the indirect bump, maybe never...

It will be possible to know how many tx in a block are segwit and how many are presegwit, once Segwit is activated? I mean something like this  but for the info of the kind of tx types in the last blocks differentiating, presegwit, segwit and segwit with schnoor. Maybe with the script versioning?
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:27:50
You want a blocksize increase so we can process more TX, Segwit does that, so there is a compromise from Core, with other on-chain increases in queue depending on Segwit.
BU on the other hand doesn't take in consideration the problems that Core is trying to mitigate, so BU is the one that is not compromising, and trying to make this problems worst for anyone running a node now and in the future. No malleability fix, no linear scaling of sighash operations, no reducing the UTXO growth, etc.
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:33:24
I'm just pointing that one side is giving at least in part what the other want (Core with the increase in blocksize with segwit), but the other side is not making any compromise.

If you use the new kind/format of transactions of Segwit there is no more malleability bug, so it's safer to create the opening transactions of the channels for the LN
@_date: 2016-12-12 10:31:10
In the testnet both CSV and Segwit has been activated

We need more transactions with the same fees than right now, not the same transactions with more fees, that's one of the reason that we need bigger blocks, because ultimately we need the fees to sustain the miners, and the miners when they have the big blocks could choose to no process the the less than the standard transaction fees, so if you didn't put a fee will not get processed or it will get a lot of time to process.
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:06:15
Lets take block 364269 is almost full (910 KB), and have 0.19646494 BTC in fees, after the halving of next year with the same % of transactions with fees and the same % of transactions without fees with a block of approximate 65MB the miners should gain +25 BTC with a full block (12,5 BTC of the block reward + 12,77 BTC in fees). I know that we need a lot more of adoption for having that kind of full blocks, but we should be working for getting that kind of adoption.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:43:10
I'm telling you that they possibly in the future left the transactions without X fee (or less) out of the block, so they will "force" us to pay X fee, and if they do that the best for everyone is bigger blocks, for them for the revenue for us for days like this with a lot of transactions not processing in the normal peace, and not in the slow one because there is more transactions that the ones that can enter in one or two or Z (Z because I already use X) full blocks of 1 MB.

Oki doki, Thanks
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:57:10
If the miners decide to not process any transaction with less than the standard transaction fee you'll put transaction fee either way, with full blocks or with empty ones, so for them is better bigger blocks and for moments like now (with a lot of transactions to process) is better for us, because they will clear it faster having the possibility of putting more transactions in the same block.

If he has lost the keys to the Genesis Block it should sign with more than one address known to be from Satoshi, and before the first block mined by Hal Finney, that could be a good start...
