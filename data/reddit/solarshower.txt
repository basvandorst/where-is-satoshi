That's a truly heartwarming news. I really hope BTC community will be as generous (or even more generous) to SENS in the future. It's on all of us.

Shocking indeed.

This thread has some really good points. I wonder what would it take to reduce the impact futures' manipulations have on BTC price? This guy says  "hodlers would have to act as a single group" which is almost impossible to implement.

It's always a good time to buy. Buy. HODL. support.

Something quite powerful obviously.

Yeah, I also miss the good old days before the Bitcoin futures' launch.

I do hope for scaling technology to catch up soon. Recent confusions and manipulations aside, I think BTC will come out of it a winner. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:17:48
Or maybe HODL and support?

Ready for another day of price suppression? This is getting old.

I guess some people think it's enough to kill the leader. They want to make BTC weak and unattractive investment using as much money it requires. That will be enough for profit-driven buyers to turn away from BTC. I really hope it can be prevented.

This price suppression is getting old. My guess is the price of BTC we see these days does not represent its true value.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:48:13
I'm guessing the price is artificially supressed to fit futures' market needs (the same thing they did to gold prices some years ago). I don't want to be right about this but making bitcoin unattractive investment may be enough in a short term to make people invest in other coins and turn away from BTC. Who knows what the end result is going to be and what they really want to achieve with this. I guess we'll find out soon...

My wild guess would be that price won't move as much as we expect. I suppose these walls will stay with us for a bit.
