That youtuber is everyone who's ever supported segwit on social media. 
I'll admit I kinda buffooned pretty hard talking about private keys like they are part of the transaction data ok. 
But segwit no segwit boils do to me as. 
Segwit: one authentication = as many transactions as you want who cares as long as first signer has enuff coin to cover it 
No segwit =&gt; One authentication one transaction 
I think the former looks realy juicy to off-chain problem solvers who want to charge people money to become their bitcoin credit cards. 
Move that shit to litecoin. Its not even shit really people worked really hard to develop segwit it works. I don't want to hurt people precious feelings but this is money and reality we're talking about. **Bigger blocks were clearly the better answer** is another point that segwit supporters will dance around every chance they get. Also they used Chinaphodia and pie in the sky claims to sell segwit and the plebeians waiting around for their bitcoin to finally become more that $2750 again just swallowed it out of desperation.

This sub is strange, I'm beginning to realize how full of shills it is too now that I actually post in it. I don't know why moving to bigger-blocks before segwit is seen as so horrible. And we got people on here buying 30 raspberry pi's just to run nodes for no reason, every other post is BUY TREZOR but then the guy in a desert putting out 325TH is somehow trying to sell an escrow service? I think this sub is supposed to put out the message that Core Devs= holy Satoshi's guard and anyone who steals thunder from that scene is a called a scammer or fake. 
As for the bets well it's not hard to separate a fool from some money I guess. I wouldn't call the people who held onto btc as stupid they were just in the right place at the right time. If you've got 25 s9's running on solar power in a desert while you grow and sell lettuce then fuk teaching chemistry I'll send a resume to come fix miners and help expand. There are beaches where the desert ends right?

The reusable energy around here is hydroelectric. We get a lot of sun but not year round, rivers abound though never freeze and run all year. There is a new solar company in town whose name I've keep hearing they did power for a local festival so I suppose people are doing it where I'm at. Oh, but we've got a farming climate no need to solar farm.  
edit: I should also add that unless you're in a desert then renewable energy is better spent on taking care of people not mining btc. And growing food is taking care of people so...

Tech and data will get cheaper and it won't cost 20K to run a node tomorrow if we up the block size. That's the only point you've made. Crypto is resilient to gov control, they're not going to come after nodes that are facilitating transactions that are moving money between tax payers. Governments are less scared of crypto than people here think. I think many governments would even embrace crypto, wtf is the advantage of sticking to your Zimbabwe dollar etc? 
Joe blows are running nodes that do nothing anyways lol. People who run nodes **because they want to use them** will continue to do so and no it won't become unaffordable if blocks are bigger. 
edit: Yes, I didn't want to say it but the fact that a million other cyrptos can spring up anytime and become billion dollar marketcaps has probably shown many governments that they can't fight this. Did tribal warlords oppose it when people started paying them in gold? Maybe a little but most of those got beaten by the ones who took the gold. 
This sub is radicalized against Chinese miners by segwit fanboys that don't realize the biggest advantage of segwit adoption would be price increase from perceived updates (gasp) And they are butthurt LTC stole their segwit thunder honestly. Increasing the blocksize is a very straighforward upgrade that should have been implemented smoothly and harmoniously but social media poisoned the debate by allowing devs to become the translators between chinese language miners and english speaking audience and convincing people that Jihan, the man who is more invest in crypto than anyone else in the world probably, is out to make btc worthless china coin unless you let him change the blockchain how he wants. And guess what all your forks and shit still won't kick bitmain off your coin! So unless you want to hunker down and start building more diversified mining infrastructure and a system for running nodes that doesn't depend on a couple techie dudes being virtuous then ETH and LTC will continue eating your lunch daily. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 00:23:00
The goal on the crypto end is to make free btc by making a profit when he sells his miners and keeping the btc he's mined with them. It's very possible. Converting free solar to btc is profitable if you get the money you spent on hardware back, that much is obviously true. If you are a hedge fund yeah buying btc is the best way to go. If you're growing lettuce in the desert with solar then that free electricity is what's driving you to mine. If you're a forex trader you can trade millions of barrels a day from your laptop, you're not looking and the Saudis pumping cheap oil form the desert and go "Jee I wonder why they do that" This guy is making the btc he doesn't need to buy it, but currently he does need to be focused on reselling the hardware. If he's really getting 1000 s9's at $1200 a pop then he should be OK. Look up an S9 on ebay if you don't believe me.  
Stuff like this will replace oil rigs and cornfields people. 
edit: I ment commodities trader not forex, the btc thing had me confused.
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:47:00


but more tx's per block though... yeah ur right not more data per block but more transactions.
 


No that's pretty much exactly what happened? We limited blocks to 1mb to somehow end spam and maybe make nodes sustainable for pi's but really doesn't limited blocks really just encourage spam, and isn't the real factor that will make out beloved pi's useless as btc nodes the fact that btc adoption is growing. 
when btc is the one world currency should I still be able to handle every transaction on the planet with a pi? 
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:44:01
If you think of off chain = less secure like me, then segwit reduces the amount of space a tx. takes in a block by decreasing security.
how segwit increases decentralization is only explained by saying other wise nodes will be 20k. which they won't.

oh duuuuuh just to minimize the difficulty needed to reach the difficulty reset of course its just a casual machiavellian plot, lemme get my reading glasses out..
There will be hashrate signaling BIP 148, and hashrate not signaling BIP 148 **that's it** Idk what you're point on the difficulty is. So you think people are holding back their hash power to keep the difficulty down so that when they do flood the gates with their hash power it will be more effective? Well then if the difficulty isn't as high then aren't evil Jihan's miners more effective too? What bogus, what is your scheme to hold back difficulty that is constantly increasing because the hashrate went up 1,000,000 TH/s today alone?? I was getting 16,000 satoshis a block from a 3.5 TH/s avalon 6 I fixed up and I still get pretty much the same amount. If the CDF is low low then slush pool can find like 2-3 blocks an hour usually its like every 2-3 hours that slushpool gets its hands on a block.

Meh, hodling btc is gambling too. You have to make a plan and follow thru with it no matter what. Buy at X, sell at X+Y, or sell at X-Z; no matter what, if you bought eth at the top then you should have had a specific number where no matter what you'd sell. If your plan is to buy eth every week, then hold and keep buying on your schedule. Only deviate from the plan if its rising so fast you think you can squeeze out a little more lol, NEVER deviate on how low you want to sell. Basically the difference between investing and casino as far as I've figured out is that you make a plan and stick to it when investing don't just go with the flow for a thrill, accept the possible loss before you take the bet. 
Best to buy crypto regularly hold, and also shift things around when you see fit. Things are shitty right now I turned money into btc at 2200 then 19something. I'm waiting to see if everyone is going to puss out and run back to fiat with their lil fortunes or dented wallets, or if people are really trying to take the ability to issue currency away from the man.

What happens to the private keys in a segwit to segwit tx lol. 
Are all private keys not relegated to blocks of nothing but other private keys, I'll go ahead and tell you. Yes, yes they are. 
What about the fact that segwit tx. have more transaction data and cost more? Why does no one use segwit on Litecoin? Is it because of all weirdness of getting half your coin in one block then the authentication (key) of the coin in another block?

We haven't seen plants growing next to miners running, or I guess miners would be on at night? If he really is bullshitting then arguing with the haters would be his only motive. Probably he really is running 25 s9's with solar and is pretty proud, sounds to me like this might be some UCSD solar project that he's plugging his miners into, there's alot of motives for why he wouldn't post pics, if I had s9's on a solar grid I sure as shit wouldn't tell reddit lol. His numbers work out, I just wonder if he really financed all those greenhouses himself or if it isn't just a project he has access too. I hope we see some pics soon, it would be the most exciting thing I've seen on this sub reddit. Def it's better than this fork in the weather :(
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:33:08
Meh I think you're just like me and don't really understand how segwit works, probably not many people do. 
A new block is created that didn't exist before so that we can stuff that block with public address and sig data, and more transaction quantities and timestamps in the old block. How is that "Not moving data around" 
If we are hashing all the data anyway then why not hash them in the most efficient way as one block?
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:07:51
I stand corrected
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:18:14
Sig data isn't moved around its just put on a new block.... hmmmm 
Is this legacy sync mode supposed to help me swallow this pill. It doesn't.  


So I mean you admit that segwit is introducing a whole new attack vector by moving data to a new block (which by the way isn't moving it around) 
Ok so here's where I'll start. Bigger blocks are simple, we've done it before and it will be the update we need hitting the news to make the price go up HODL. 
Segwit is a convoluted idea that might be interesting but has been gobbled up by litecoin so it might be easier to just move there than to press your BIP148 button? Litecoin is great coin

Anyways I joke, when it comes to segwit no one will tell you what is being hashed when and why. I'll say it again, it is a hail mary by devs who are eager to become the new Nakamoto, and it was picked up by crypto hype-bois on twitter to gain followers and look like they know what they are talking about. They'll try to compare it to garages and sheds and trains and all kinds of childish analogues but if you break it down we're just mushing our peas around instead of eating them normally.

YES AND BLOCK WIEGHT IS DERIVED FROM TX SIZE! 
Block weight = (tx size with witness data stripped) * 3 + (tx size)
Why not just have an appetite for more food on a bigger block than move our peas around when we don't want to eat all the food on our plate?  
In a segwit to segwit node transaction the transactions and blocks both increase total data hashed, its just hashed on two blocks instead of one. In a segwit to non segwit transaction we will just agree that some data will be thrown away (i.e. less security because less data hashed)


what? 
@_date: 2017-07-07 03:35:33
Ok you are right, 1mb block size has been enforced by Satoshi from day one and no one has ever wanted to increase it but was then shot down by people fearing spam. I'll concede you all that why not?


Buddy I don't think there is a single person informed on segwit enough to answer any of my questions on this planet. Segwit is a dumb hail marry that is supposed to imitate progress just admit it. It is very confusing, it does not elegantly solve anything. Most people just jump to make sound like the solution to all our scaling problems it's so dumb compared to a simple block increase.

My bad for assuming raw transaction data on the block explorer would be the actual raw transaction data on the blockchain. Golly Jee I shoulda known that endless stream of data it displayed was there for my convenience. 
So my number of 3665 bytes is from the block explorer. What's that sig and pub key doing in your segwit transaction I thought that's what we were throwing away? Where are you getting 103 bytes and why did block explorer get the non-segwit size right and the segwit size wrong?
How is the transaction size on a bock explorer not what's really on the chain?
Why did we gobble this shit up instead of just realizing we should have hard forked to 2mb? Mystertys abound with fuckin segwit I'm looking at the block explorer but it's still not right huh?
Edit: to be clear your calculations match what I pulled **right from block explorer** on the non segwit reaction but on the segwit transaction you're off from block explorer by 29 times?

The girl I'm with is like "awwww they're so cute we should give them a riiideee" so we do and it turns out they're siblings not a couple. The dude was a total good ol' boy told a bunch of stupid dad jokes. Tells me he's a lawyer, gives me his card and I hear his sister go "you're not a lawyer." He gave me a card with so and so and so law firm though. 
Months later I'm still in college there's like 5 of us behind a frat house at a party we weren't invited to, smoking a j. Apparently one of the FIJI's didn't like us coming to their party and smoking weed at the house sooo he called campus police. 3 of us in handcuffs, one stupid stupid tiny half smoked joint in an evidence bag, cops asking us one by one "whose is this" I look him straight in the eye I go "sir I want to call my lawyer I wasn't involved in this situation it's not right that I'm in handcuffs. You have no evidence that's mine." they've got my wallet it's got nothing but id, debit card and my "lawyers" card. I was higher than giraffe pussy. Boom handcuffs gone I'm walking away and the two stoned lawyerless chimpanzees are still hemmed up and I swear to jebus im walking away I hear my buddy go "sir I wanna call my lawyer too"

Ur right bitcoin devs made segwit, but really they were just regular devs because if they were bitcoin devs than segwit would have hit btc first lol. Litecoin activated it first, they stole the hype. Buy the rumor sell the news, Litecoin stole btc's segwit hype and leading up to segwit adoption on ltc, price of that coin skyrocket. Leading up to segwit adoption on btc the price is very shy. 
Was I wrong about DGB? a Nigerian guy on WhatsApp told me that DGB was first to activate segwit, I googled and got mixed results. Looks like they activated it in April? hmmm I've got some DGB just cuz why not? But it's still in my shady-coin investment tier of less that 0.25 btc's worth.

I've been looking at all these dumbass farmers growing thousnds of acres of rice/corn/wheat all this low nutritional stuff that ends up as fuel or feed. And they still end up so broke, there are rich farmers but don't let em fool you they're in debt all the time, their finances are up in the sky half the year lol. So I've been interested in microgreens, LED farming and aquaponics for a minute. My roommate and I tired setting up a aquaponics strawberry growing thing but our catfish froze and died :( I've also been buying defunct miners and fixing em, people put the power supply downwind of the miner or vice versa, turn it on in a room or something and heat up the 6-pin connecters so hot. I know people are toasting PSUs and selling the miners as broke lol. The miners have failsafe switches but I guess people turn it off or don't know what's going on and just keep letting them heat up stupid hot and shutting off and wear em out quick. You can open it up and in two seconds tell if you'll have to get a hashboard or not. Throw a lil duct between your miner and a window, let the fan do it's work. It can run 24/7 365 and never get above 47C.  
Anyways I digressed. But so I was into the farming methods he was talking about, then when he mentioned reselling S9's in his thread I knew immediately yeah that's very possible.

HA but this is exactly what you have described u/pbx1 ! 
People no one can unexplained the benefits of segwit because **other than somehow morphing it into a way to get you to follow someone on twitter or feel compelled to buy a trezor segwit is total horseshit** Now that LTC is already using it, it doesn't even have the benefit of being cutting edge.

Fears confirmed 
yuup just like I said, we'll confirm the time and amount of a transaction right away let the authentication confirm when it will. **THIS IS FUCKED** 
edit: Okay, listen segwit is just as confirmed and secure as bigger blocks but it instantly creates debt in the system, we'll be able to spend money before we should be able to it sounds like reverse escrow. 


This just sounds like the node version of asiic boost that makes mining less profitable. 
 
Edit: Sounds like the best description of segwit I can get is its a shitty version of smart contracts where people just kinda float around iou's but nodes are lighter because we stoped including some redundancies?
We should have just made the blocks bigger.

Extended blocks are in every description of segwit Ive ever seen?? 
Segwit is a way to throw numbers around meaninglessly till the first primate in the chain signs their private key. Compared to just bigger blocks segwit is a dry white dogturd and how we chocked it down so easy idk? Guess people just really like to feel smarter than they are.

Yeah I bet they have no problem accepting money from all over the world. 
The deal is this. Once you send BTC over there you get BCC instantly. However, viabtc will not allow any BTC withdrawals until AFTER Aug 1st. So you can get you BCC, sell if instantly for BTC. Then come Aug 1st I suspect viabtc will say that all customers must be Chinese or some shit or must verify owing a Chinese bank account. I'll wait till an exchange I trust starts crediting BCC b4 I get ma coins on da market. 


Mothership ICO is based in Estonia and the website is in english despite the little disclaimer declaring that US citizens owning the coin is illegal. English is the Linga Franca, google it dude.

I don't think anyone who wants segwit is against BIP 148. People who are for big blocks are against segwit AND BIP 148. We need bigger blocks that's it. Threatening a fork for segwit is dumb and only serves the few devs who get to say they coded the bitcoin infastructure now. Even though segwith was on DIGIBITES first and LITECOIN most recently, so really we're just copying the work of other cryptos. If you don't know that much then you're not well informed on this debate. Shit I watched this same debate unfold on litecoin, in which case I supported segwit much more because fuk the risk LTC needed something to distinguish itself from BTC and I mean look at the 1000% price increase we got from it. If miners find out how to get ahold witness data after just 1 conformation, or just as soon it's found even. They might be able to double spend. Bitcoin started at 10kb blocks and we've made bigger blocks until now it's 1mb. Holy Satoshi-Wright even says that there's no limit to block scalability. 
But too many crypto newbies are influence by this sub to allow a post with with word big blocks in it far up. So lets just keep the debate as Segwit vs. BIP 148 
Can someone who doesn't like the color blue explain to me why they like the color blue? 
edit: And before anyone says I'm here to pump LTC, I piss on LTC. When it comes to the cryptos I own I'm in it to maximize my worth in fiat currency. I mine and run a node so I support btc more than most but I don't think I'm some economic rebel fighting the good fight. I got into crypto for all the pussy. 
edit 2: Also at this point you're helping bitcoin more by actually preforming a transaction daily then mining or running a node. i.e. actually using bitcoin

Your signature from your private key is what authenticates your transaction, if there is no key in a transaction then what is segwit moving to the extended block?
The new private key generated from signing a transaction is the what is kept private. Using a private key is how you initiate a transaction. 
edit: what happens to extended blocks in segwit to segwit tx would would have been the correct way to ask about "What happens to private keys?" 
edit 2: I'll go ahead and answer my own question because segwit people are incapable. These extended blocks will be hashed out and cofirmed AFTER your tx timestamps and amounts, this is the beginning of fiat coin. DO NOT SEPARATE QUANTITIES FROM KEYS

(As I eXpLaiNeDD) You're not keeping the difficulty down just for you. difficulty will be less for everyone. Who duped you into holding back your awesome hashpower?
Guys Bitmain makes all the hashpower you're not going to hash your way to segwit. You can hold a gun to BTC's head and get segwit and segwit 2x is the compromise that will probably be implemented just to stop a real deal fork. 
We're not escaping bitmain until we start out-mining bitmain. Your half-baked plan to hold back the difficulty is so dumb and feeble. Plus Bitmain obviously knows about it considering they whipped 1000000 TH/S out of their asses just to prove a point. I think you got tricked into a taking pepsi enema. No one's "dusting off" any miner with over 1 TH, those things sell. And dusting off your block erupter or using a GPU I mean yeah that will do pretty much nothing.

That's what I'm asking! we've come full circle hahaha based on the fact that someone was saying they bought 5 BCC units earlier it seems the answer is NO.
edit: Obviously just cuz someone bought some doesn't mean ur not credited as well I just assume he would have mentioned it if he got free BCC just by sending BTC. I just need to try it myself with a small amount I guess.

Lol Bitcoin isn't even that anonymous!! The Blockchain is public.
Bitcoin is faaaar less anonymous than cash, it can be transferred easier, but not more anonymously. You can give someone a dollar and only you two could ever know. Bitcoin is not like that, there is a 100 percent chance that every transaction is recorded and as blockchains become more common place blockchain forensics will get better and tumbling will be even harder. Everything's on the blockchain to be figured out later if need be so we're not beating fiat currency or gaining new users by being internet sketch-dollars for much longer people!!!
Let Monero and dash be anon-dollars for the potshop. Bitcoin isn't that anonymous anymore and as more and more people are cashing in through coinbase like we want them too, it will become less so.

Bro I've been shitting on that "I lost 200K get it back for me" guy for a minute. Did you physically go to the bank to wire money?? because that's how its' supposed to be done, if you can't hook coinbase up to your card or to your account directly and you want to wire money you need to follow the basic rules of big money wires, I wired money at a bank once and they called the company I was wiring too and it's all 100% settled in a few days. 
Someone at GDAX is going to have to spend a long time ensuring someone at a bank that they in fact are GDAX and you did in fact mean to send them the money. Keep pestering them don't shitpost here about how people shouldn't use coinbase.

Alphabey busted means less people using btc for physical transactions (sucks but true), plus coinbase sending 100x transaction fees scares people, dumb shit like that is how things go insolvent, big companies are new to working with btc anyways. Plus contentious segwit debate in every corner of the scene.
It's not a good time to be holding btc obviously. Prob a good time to start thinking about making a first buy though. Like I said, we should have all been rising in the tide of BTC until Aug 1st, instead I think we all hope smooth segwit will stop the bloodbath and restart the bull market.

Thanks for the answers. There is a very profitable and efficient type of farming that is really taking off, microgreens. You essentially grow just the "sprouts" of plants, the nutritional density is immense and the whole process from planting to harvesting is 2 weeks about. Microgreens are popular in nutritional smoothies and in those fancy farm to table places. But I think demand will increase, as people start to want better food. Microgreens look like a good way for you to grow more than just lettuce. Sunflower, broccoli, radish all are superb micorgreens. Since you have USDA certification you're golden. 
 
This guy knows his farming and he grows microgreens. 
Also why do you focus so much on sterility? I understand no pesticides but I get the impression from all the stainless steel and the fact that you brought it up that you're going for almost hospital levels of sterilization. Why? Is there a disease vector your plants are ultra-suseptable to out in the desert?

Very interesting, I know this sub hates BCC but I mean hey if I have btc and bcc is worth money I take claim of those BCC asap. There is a chance demand will be zero but if bitmain keeps the chain alive I could easily see BCC being more than ether or dash, I think I heard it was already selling at $500 on viabtc? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:45:22
Litecoin is not useless, it works better than btc. As proven by it's ability to get segwit first. Litecoin transactions are faster, everywhere bitcoin shows up lite coin is there. I bet it will deliver more gains in the coming year than btc as well.


More like a tiny portion of hash power and at this point any forks are just being seen by investors as free coins. Which isn't too bad of an assessment. 
Segwit is the logical progression for BTC and LTC, it lowers the cost of making a transaction in a data sense without sacrificing security. Segwit is ahead of its time in a way in that bitcoin would be fine without it tomorrow; but if we could ever have of massive adoption of crypto by merchants and customers then increasing efficiency of transactions with a system like segwit is needed.


It's 1/2 of its value right now at least get woke. Ltc outpreformed btc when it locked in segwit, I bet ltc can outperform btc when btc locks in segwit as well!!! hahaha 
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:47:39
Yes... I followed it closely and made nice returns following segwit adoption on Liteocin. 
LTC stole your segwit thunder, Jihan played games and even at one point the signal strength was above 75%, he brought it down to the mid 60's just to make people panick sell and he could buy more coins. Lucky me I'm a trader who actually moves crypto daily, I had btc to get more. All this was going on at the same time Coinbase was adding LTC, it was a glorious time and people following the news did great. It was a dick move for Jihan to do that but guys you're dumb if you think your favorite devs aren't pushing segwit so hard because they have their own agenda. Mostly these are big names on the scene who know they are kinda becoming irrelevant as just bitcoin millionaire hodlers and are trying to take some of Jihan's mining swag. Jihna's kinda playing the same games now but this time there's no Charlie Lee to sit down and talk to him in Chinese, just alot of devs screaming horeshit in a foreign language. He might not be so nice this time. Having to compromise with the guy that mines all your coins is shitty and the only bargaining chips devs have are users. So that's what this sub is, segwit's lil brainwashed bitch boy.  
The segwit hype is done, litecoin got the best of it. Me personally I'm am shifting my feet back to BTC somewhat because if these forks really produce duplicate coins I want them. But I'm mitigating with alts such as LTC, DASH and dozens of others. They are all still so cheap. I won't risk loosing fiat value because someone wants to say they  designed bitcoin. I don't think pressing the BIP148 on my [tragmar hardware safe LLC]( makes me a economic freedom fighter. The price of bitcoin is the only thing at steak right now and I want it to go up.

The first blocks were 10kb, then 50 kb and the 1mb limit was introduced to prevent spamming. 
Block scaling can be scaled up to infinite. We should have just scaled it up to 2mb holding hands and smiling with class and let the price moon. The price incentive would have made more miners pop up around the world.... and then we'd be in a place where we won't have to kiss Jihan's bitcoin godfather ring when we want to change something. 
Something not a single Bitmain hating-fork advocate has yet to explain to me is what will stop the miners who are dependent on Bitmain for hardware from just taking over your chain?? Absolutely no response. Fools.
Segwit will supposedly stop miners from spamming the system with tiny tx's to make tx fees go up. How, idk....  
edit: I should also add that it's my belief that if enough legitimate transactions with reasonable fees are occurring the effect of spamming the system will not be worth it at all. You will spend tx. fees sending money to yourself and have no effect on the real market. Also what little btc you sending even if just as a tx fee is stuck for a quite some time if it doesn't go through if you were doing this thousands of times to spam the system that would add up quick.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:24:30
Yeah so I download a BCC wallet and move the private key data there? 
My btc is in a core client I think 0.13.2 so I guess I'll have keys to the bcc on the other chain, I wanna sell the BCC doe. If I send BTC to viabtc would I get credited BTC and BCC? That'd be very convenient.

Until I see a $3000 bitcoin fuck all you segwit people for not accepting that LTC beat you to the punch, and please admit that if we had just accepted the simpler solution of bigger blocks bitcoin might already have been $5000.

@_date: 2017-07-23 06:25:16
Yes, and I assume that he is trying to find Pdt. 
he using Pdt = MdtV + MVdt
Mdt = 0.96 is from btc inflation rate of 4% or something, (12.5 times blocks per year)/total btc in circ. 
MVdt is zero, because look at the two graphs above the equation, they are flipped over the x-axis. First graph is M, second graph is Vdt, they are flipped over x-axis but both are positive, so it will be like [10 x (1/10)] they approach a constant and can be taken from LHS. 
It is bullshit still!! He is taking data from inflation of btc then  as Mdt in the first part, then using velocity vs. currency base of USD for the second part. 
I've had some of the fears about segwit that he has in this paper and megaphoned them too. This sub turned me full segwit though. The fear of missing sig data in is bogus, it is still there just less people read it I guess.

A new block is created just to move data into it so that more data can be stuffed into the older block. idk how this will make anything more efficient, I don't think it will. 
Earlier blocks had less transaction data than new blocks. We only set up 1Mb limit to stop miners from trying to hike up the price of a tx and now we are eating our lunch for it. 
Seems like we should just let economic take its course and let blocks on btc be as big as they need to be?
edit: I should also add I don't think its necessarily possible for miners to hike up tx. fees unless the volumn of the mempool is super low. I don't think segwit will stop spamming either. It seems to me like people just want to change bitcoin because they know they're becoming irrelevant as bitcoin hodlers.

I'm understanding more about segwit and how transactions work. I kinda acted like a dick to goad people into responding with real answers instead of the classic  just bip148' it and know everything will be faster and cheaper. You can't expect me to just jump into the most heady technical segwit papers right away, and all the simpler explanations made no sense. Seeing that fist segwit tx on ltc got my motors running. 
I still maintain that just adopting bigger blocks would have been better for the price and community. Angstly trolling this sub for answers and trying to organize my crypto portfolio into a position where I'm ready for possible forks has been making me an insomniac for the past couple days. I'm gonna take a break and get back to reading tomorrow afternoon maybe sunday. 
u/Mathematician22 u/stupidx and u/lukejr all gave good answers to my questions but I won't concede that I'm on team BIP148 just yet there are some some others that are actually informed. The rest of you have no idea wtf segwit is or how it works and the phony certainty and simplified explanations around this issue has turned more fiat into hats and trezors than to btc.   
Anyways I appreciate your help and sources. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 09:41:03
No believe it or not if you compare a transaction with segwit to one without it you do gain insight. I think most observers will agree that considering the first segwit transaction I'm looking at is bigger and more expensive than a regular tx.... looks like I was pressing all those buttons on my trezors for nothing!!
Bigger blocks would have been easier. It's not hard fork if all the miners agree.

Woooooaaaah isn't backwards compatible segwit exactly what Litecoin's got going on or am I totally wrong?
Didn't Charlie Lee kiss Jihan's ring to get segwit on litecoin or something?

I go to deposits and withdrawls and watch the numbers infront of USD and BTC go up in value.
edit: In all seriousness I'll manage my holdings daily, the coins that are up like over 25% for the day I sell some and re-invest the btc into the coins that are down 10-20%

How many segwit supporters does it take to tell me how it makes a tx. smaller?  lol
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:44:48
YES, we want to keep stuff ON THE CHAIN fuck a CREDIT COIN!!!
edit 157: Because the blockchain is bitcoin and it needs to be stronk. 
Let smaller coins have the off chain capabilities don't be mad they beat you to the punch. Emulating them is redundant.
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:38:00
Private keys are part of the wallet ok but what happens to the extended block with authentication from the private key? 
Is it just ignored?
edit: Or do we just stop needing to use our private keys to authenticate. Just move numbers around at first and then handling authentication later is what segwit sounds like to me...
edit 2: I'll admit I fucked up bad, I should have been asking what are private keys doing

The biggest mining pools (in hashrate) consist of 5 Chinese dudes with warehouses full of running miners. They say otherwise sometimes but it'a s lie. All of whom buy from Bitmain, so yeah Jihan has a lot of control over these miners. 
The feelings of this sub is we can only escape Jihan by taking risks, making the coin worth less and them still forking to a chain he can mine with his miners if he wanted. 
The pool that is a bunch of westerners with a a miner or two each is Slushpool. And even the few bigger users there dominate most of the pool's hashrate.

Maybe I'm wrong it clearly says "size" 3665 
Is it in different units maybe? Where is 103 bytes coming from? This is the first segwit transaction on Liteocoin it should be easy for people to see I guess. 
You're number on size matched mine exactly on my other post of the non segwit tx??
Man we might have been had on this segwit stuff fella's. The jig is up no more easy crypto money guys we bought these devs' bullshit and they fucked us.

If you're seriously buying 1000 s9 and currently own 100 s9's then don't post it. People will still hate and prob some would try to doxx you. r/bitcoin is more about being techie fanboys and monitoring the price of btc then about making money  or disrupting the existing order fuck em'. This sub exists to hustle trezors, shit on coinbase and pump the followers of a couple bitcoin twitter personalities. Your posts are great compared to most of what's on here. Personally I'm inclined to believe you mostly because I've thought about solar mining since I got into bitcoin because obviously it makes sense, the price of hardware is daunting but yes you can resell the hardware for a profit, in fact there's more short term profit in resale than by mining frankly. I've never considered solar greenhouses though I'm in Arkansas we can grow outdoors too easy. But everyone's looking at that sunshine beating down on the desert as wasted energy making food from that is the way of the future. 
So you gain photosynthetic efficiency by converting Solar -&gt; LED + Air conditioning? Do the LED's really beat the sun? Could you just let some sunshine through and use solar for AC. I suppose since LED's can emit the perfect spectrum of light for what it's growing then the sunshine has plenty or spare light to cover to volts? And you draw water from deep underground? And there's enough spare power to mine btc, it makes sense to me. I just graduated with a B.S. in Chemistry and Math if you're hiring let me know I'll apply.

read it and weep boys, segwit is horseshit prove me wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-07 09:29:25


And the segwit tx has 3665 
Is a bigger number next to the word size in tx data mean the tx is smaller? I just assumed I'm not a hacker block stream dev yet?
Where did you get your size calculation from pls?
@_date: 2017-07-07 09:05:45
Half and half
Segwit's never been explained in any other way that I've seen other than lets lop off part of a block and make it a new block. Then fit more tx.'s per block! What is the unnecessary part of a transaction we're removing, where's it going? 
@_date: 2017-07-04 23:19:28
I'm doing pretty good
@_date: 2017-07-07 03:46:11
So more data, more hashrate, two blocks? 
Sounds like a really long reach around to the simple solution of bigger blocks.

@_date: 2017-07-16 03:18:53


Oh they will but for now they'll all be closed or taking no new members. New darkweb markets will use BTC less altcoins more. Another big one has changed to no new members at least. Probably dark web sales are the majority of physical good bitcoin transactions, computer parts and precious metals behind that. Idk though I don't use tor.

Good explanation "something about enabling layer 2" let me just start buying up moar btc on that note. holy shit, maybe no one knows how this segwit thing works?
edit: making blocks bigger will always solve the problem to infinity if you don't mind me saying that. I'd hate to go this route, but satoshi said it too...

So the bitcoin Illuminati and I have decided that u/cryptohoney got to the front page off the hardwork of other users. 
I've been made the captain of this post and the related thread. You can direct your questions regarding mining btc to me.

So the casino credited BTC to your account b4 the transaction was confirmed? 
Are you sure? Sounds like these people shouldn't be in the bitcoin casino business I guess.

Product rule is only way to start this, but all these functions are multivariable and we are given graphs as initial values so... 
diffyQ time? Maybe product rule then apply initial values? Prob just craig is wrong.

Strange how my block explorer shows it as larger 2/3 of your sources show the segwit tx as bigger. But I'm the troll. 
Please stop your dumb segwit fetish. Compared to upping blocksize segwit is the most convoluted shit... and even the devs admit we're just hopin things'll be faster if only one guys has to sign for a bunch and f other transactions that happened before he signed. And that one guys is going to be Blockstream.
It's not my fault you didn't ask the right question and just bought into a bunch of half truths and lies. Go flick ur bip148 button on and off dude. You're out of your league on this one.

@_date: 2017-07-07 00:48:52
so we'll secure less of a tx. to fit more onto one block who's size is arbitrarily decided in the first place pretty much. Sounds like an increase in value to me!!!

Because there are more people who want to mine SHA-256 currencies than there are people who want to spend 1k+ on the newest s9, especially if they've never mined before and don't want to start with a 1.5K machine. So they buy an s7 or s5 or something.
You're basically asking why anyone would buy a used Ford Ranger when they could just wait for the new F-150 to come out. Some people just want to buy truck right now. 
edit: 1.5K is from $1,300 S9 + $150 power supply, there are cheap power supplies but an s9 for $1300 is like right from bitmain price.

Oh yes you can certainly make money by keeping ur eyes a zero hedge pump. Just be ready for the hit piece article they've been brewing up since before they even wrote the pump article crbp cough cough.. 
That's stocks though with Crypto though zero-hedge usually isn't on the bleeding edge of what's new, I read this article actually you should never not read I guess. They put out good reading.

I'll give $25 of BTC to someone who can prove all of my claims wrong no problem, it would honestly be my pleasure to learn that much for $25, crypto has done me well if someone will teach me more good for them. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:00:58
No one here can explain segwit to you because compared to just making blocks bigger it is tremendously convoluted and does not really fix any of the non-problems it claims btc has.
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:45:33
Ehhh we might see $1500. I wouldn't recommend buying over $100 worth of btc right now. 
Things should have been heading UP towards August 1st then retracted after the news. The fact that price is going down isn't good at all. If a BIP 148 chain splits off expect exchanges like coinbase to shut down as prices drop to below $1000.

So I just use my private key to confirm one tx. and all the tx's down the line from there are just instantly confimed. Got it. 
Welp guys listen we'll have enough crypto to get a little rope when this all over. 
I think that the segwit experiment will work in moving money around in a new way but it reduces the value of a private key and it's adoption has been shitty for bitcoin. We're copying litecoin now. Segwit is the equivalent of a small child spreading out their greens because they don't wanna eat. We should have made blocks bigger instead we took two months off to insist upon a shitty solution to a non-problem (evil miners who are going nowhere, supposed covert asiic boost that god knows how it's actually effect btc users but segwit will save them from it, and fixing transaction malleability by just sining abuncha transactions at once)

And he also said the 1mb limit could be scaled up infinitely (who cares ok), and we also didn't do that because we thought it would lead to spam, and people have been saying that was stupid since 2015. I just didn't know the opposition to doing so would lead to segwit which is so muddy and pedantic. And only recently has it become possible that we'll have two or three shit coins instead of my beloved bitcoin master coin.

So you didn't do a double spend. That would mean you spent the same btc twice.
If you have btc stuck in limbo, which really only happens if your sending from Core. Then you delete your tx. data that you're signaling with -zapwallettxes. This will get your old tx. out of the men pool the fastest because you will stop sending that date out. But when you resend the reaction do not send to the same address, send to yourself. This is much safer and ensures that you won't double send. You send the exact same amount your own address and this time you include a fee for the evil miners.  
You canceled a transaction by double sending, you didn't double spend.

Right now their time would be better spent running from crypto with whatever money they have left lolol.

We should mine all over the world yes, or just keep it all to the Antartic; it's nice, cold, dry all the solar we could want. We don't because mining isn't profitable and home miners should just stop. 
The CCP is not going to centralize BTC calm down. I've been to China, I was drinking fake Jake Daniels having cigs thrown at me by Chinese business men as is custom, it was legit as fuuq. 
You're way too scared of the CCP, what're they going to do? Shut down bitmain, isn't that what you want or something?  You think the CCP is going to demand changes to the bitcoin protocol. Ehhhh, you think Chinese gov. even knows where to start with blocksize debate? I think they just want to make sure Chinese are paying their taxes and not messing up the CCP's plans for the CNY/USD. Plus lets hypothetically move all this hashpower to USA, the FBI or IRS would be so much more likely to kick down the doors than the CCP. Cha Boi dj-T is the POTUS. We're a political shit-theater compared to the Chinese. Mining should be more geographically decentralized yeah. I wish that more mining was in the US or whatever 'Murica. But the fact that most of the hashpower is in China isn't keeping me up at night, I do that all on my own. 
Back to the issue of centralization. The fact that most hashpower is centralized to China does not really bind bitcoin to the CCP in my opinion. The politics-of-bitcoin is dividing across the line between miners and software developers. It so happens that China is a good place to mine because you can buy power from a power plant, in bulk, with cash and at a discount. Especially out west where they built big power plants for cities that never developed. The line between miners and devs is the Chinese border and so we boil it down to evil Communis Chinese will seize your bitcoin. SEIze the MEANS of MINING!!! Naaa it has nothing to do with Chinese politics or CCP. It's just miners vs. software devs. Miners have spent millions on hardware and have alot too loose if BTC hiccups, they'd rather just double the blocksize on BTC allowing the software and merchants to start using LTC if they want segwit so bad, they make the asiics for that too :/  Devs have spent millions on innovating, bringing btc to merchants and making code for offchain transactions, things like that. They have alot to loose if btc becomes too congested or if tx. fees get too high for a cup of coffee, or even worse... people start using the "scam coins." Imagine that. coins with segwit and whose inventors have names with faces. As long as we're using asiics then there will be mining conglomerates and miners motives will be the same regardless their Chinese or Jamaican. If there was only one guy in antartica mining all alone, if people were running nodes everywhere and using btc everywhere then btc would be plenty decentralized. But we'd still have to talk to the antartic miner if we wanted to change the rules. Or put up solar panels and start our own huge mining operations but we can't because we don't have pics.

Ur thought experiment is a more like a fever dream idk what picture you're trying to paint. So no segwit immediately makes btc corporate and centralized?
 Please.... if apple said they'd be accepting btc and releasing a new hardware wallet/miner/node called ibit. All of you would piss your pants giddy with joy.
This is exactly "I have bitcoin on my trezor under the bed so I'm an economic freedom fighter" mentality that is so dumb.

Dude I'm about to eat shit on this sub for saying this. But it looks to me like he was "in on it" so to speak. There might have been more than one person working on Satoshi and they prob didn't known each other irl. He convinced Gavin Adresen, and it was apparently due to his ability to sign PGP messages? So I'm guessing Craig might have had some contact with Gavin as satoshi. What is in my opinion the only way to prove you're satoshi (move his coins), might have been made impossible by the people (or only one of them) who was working as Satoshi.
Idk really what Craig Wright does other than he claims to be Satoshi and that I guess he supports BU or something because that's the only other reason this sub would hate him soo much. But the fact that Gavin who worked with satoshi though he wasn't lying for a bit. Then idk I gotta kinda put my tinfoil hat on and see if I can't make a theory. Who satoshi is doesn't really matter outside of he could dump his coins and kill the price so fuck it!!

Because people do dumb shit get their tx. stuck in the mempool all the time and immediately blame the program their using. And even though its a mycelium tx. to Gemini. They blame coinbase. 
edit: if there's an advanced user button that you can use to fuck shit up, lots of people will click it and do just that. Also I think it's a little harder to let everyone set a unique tx. fee if they don't have the blockchain themselves, which is why on core its so easy to slide the tx. to however fast you want money to move.

Not all miners are full nodes. The benefit of running a full node is not really obvious, just doing it to do it there is no benefit. If you are solo mining you've gotta run a full node, if you're in a pool then your pool is running a node or two somewhere. Old core clients run full nodes, my core client updates the blockchain everytime I plug it in but idk if it shares data. But if you just buy a raspberry pi don't confirm any or even preform any tx; just share and receive tx data well then I guess you're facilitating segwit info getting around but are you really "voting" for anything? 
U shld use ur pi's to mine some cpu alt coin instead. That's be way better for the crypto space.

This is like saying you have a right to put whatever sign you want on your lawn and watch whatever news station you want but don't really need to vote to show your opinion. Unless you're mining big-blocks and confirming segwit transactions ur just on the sidelines pretty much. I mine BIP 148 and I hope that there is no fork, I have a feeling they'll be a compromise and ant pool will start signaling BIP 148. 
You do show some support running a node in that you're distributing the ledger but hashrate is going to be the only meaningful variable. Because if we're going to postulate that moar nodes = stronger coin then I mean eth has more nodes than btc so...

yeah asiics will hold decentralization of btc mining back as long as bitmain are the only people making them in any real quantity. The community is tangled up in software problems that can't be resolved because of the hardware dynamics. Having most of mining go on in China doesn't centralize the whole system. As long as the blockchain is public and anyone with btc can changing it then it's pretty decentralized. You'll have to work with miners to change the rules, unless you want go to china and pay people to build your own assiics. If Goldman Sacs is really thinking about btc and Fidelity is really mining crypto then they should go to china and project paperclip a bunch of asiic people.

Its a bloomberg piece on crypto it's late to the party lol. 
I've been telling people to stop HODLING and be smart for a while now. I have 91 cryptos in my spread and I don't use an API so getting ready for August 1st took me like 36 hours lol. Still lost $1500 in value yesterday but I've been selling off BTC profits since I started everything could go to 0 I'd still be ahead I guess.... if I cashed out fast enough haha.
You might have been smart to sell everything off last night, but you should have been prepared and been closer to btc and fiat. I've been waiting for btc to really test support at $2000 for a while; closest I've seen is $2200. I'm already buying back btc in small increments every couple of days, aiming for $2200 when I do. Crypto is going to take over equities by the time I'm old; we might even could use crypto ledgers to trade stocks and sell movies it's got room to grow. Everything else is bulky, hard to trade, leaves huge space for middle men, and insecure. 
edit: I'll also add besides the scaling debate the other reason for the selloff was the fact that territory on the fringes of bittrex and beyond (ICO world) was rife with scams. Look at Dubaicoin, there's literally two of them and I'm 99% one is just hoping people send them money, but idk maybe both have hardworking developers and funding.

So what do you support OP? A hard fork where you have segwit on your chain and the chinese miners don't mine on your chain and don't have segwit? In what scenario is that happening?
So then the Chinese miner adopt segwit? Which they did on litecoin. So do you just not want Chinese miners on your chain or what? Seems to me like Chinese miners have spent millions on the crypto infrastructure and probably have more invested in bitcoin working efficiently than anyone. 
I followed segwit adoption on Litecoin and I'm pretty sure most of the hard fork split 75% consensus (different % on btc) was total manipulation. Segwit was going to get adopted everyone new it but anyone with a social media outlet or influence wanted to throw the price around with fake conflict, Jihan and Charlie Lee both. For some reason the block size debate turns into "we gotta hard fork the chinese miners off the blockchain!" Why? It's not going to happen, Bitmain is not a boogyman. 
....and while we're at it coinbase has made buying crypto so easy for me it's stupid I use it with no problem at all. Also I don't see the appeal of a trezor, I store my keys offline all the time and I think tremors are kinda dumb.

If you sold ur bitcoin a couple weeks ago then bought them back on this recent dip you would have made money, that's obviously true, also you'd move btc around adding to the volume and making healthy tx fees for the network. What's with this bitcoin hold forever fetish, it makes btc look like a ponzi scheme I'm sick of it. 
People you need to understand that in the world of investing the mofo who's telling you to hold is buying and selling all the time and just bought in so now you should hold too. If your investment goes up in value lock in some of your profits while they're in your face, just ask yourself "Is this the new lowest price ever for bitcoin" The answer is almost always no. If you need fiat and have bitcoin it makes a lot of sense to sell ur btc and buy it back later.

You did not mistakenly send Litecoin to your bitcoin address, you sent litecoin to the wrong litecoin address, which if the tx has a confirmation then your litecoin is gone. I thought you were claiming your LTC transaction got put on the BTC blockchain for a sec.  
Your LTC is gone unless you find the owner of the wallet you sent it to. Sorry about that don't brood over it.
