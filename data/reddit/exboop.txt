Reddit Gold is a donation. The ads are not. Gold is not their primary source of revenue, even if they actually end up getting most of their money from it.
In other words, I'll gladly accept donations in any shape or form but I'd like my paycheck to be in dollars.

Advertisers are the customers, not us. Reddit Gold is just designed to give people who donate an extra something special.
In any case, I don't think they expect regular users to be buying adspace. I'm pretty sure businesses don't usually pay anything with bitcoins.
