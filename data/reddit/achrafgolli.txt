What will happen when the markets open!?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:38:49
They should learn how to appreciate this.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:50:21
Forever 
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:49:09
And they dropped it after? Why ?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:18:55
Aim for 16k now 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:03:16
15k tonight ? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:29:44
I hate it, because they advertise their stuff by getting people from investing to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:40:02
The hole post is one sentence ��
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:00:51
I only see one coin.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:29:17
So you moved back to a legacy wallet? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:17:58
I mean 16k �� 15k is reached
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:54:08
Send me that money. And you will have a complete new one
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:00:31
When are you selling your BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:55:00
Don’t cash out! That’s why we use bitcoin! To avoid the government! Ask to pay your rent using bitcoin. And pay as much possible your expenses using it.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:21:02
Fiat = trash ! Fiat is the bubble that last hundred of years ! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:41:27
Yes and? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:08:55
15k tonight ?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:37:29
They will soon adapt! And start using BTC as a selling price.
Like 1 lambo with 25 BTC no matter what’s the FIAT value of it.
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:04:32
 The community is trying its best with LN, don’t you think so?
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:01:33
Which wallet are you using?
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:27:48
How much will it cost if you put 50/byte?
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:45:23
Are you talking about BTC or other coins?
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:36:49
Please this is fake
Don’t even visit the website 
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:47:01
Please! Every one knows that’s me! Because I said it!
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:57:33
Can anyone confirm or decline this? ��
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:33:57
Risky ? You mean Scam? Haha
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:09:06
It’s coming back guys! Let’s hope for the 16k!
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:48:51
I would say less ETH
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:10:55
I only know HODLing! What’s the other one?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:28:39
You mean pumped though?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:26:30
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:17:31
Yes! Ok basic rule of investing:
If people buy the prices increase.
And most of the people heard about XRP today and they want to invest. So it will go high I think.
It’s not too late. 
And people who already had XRP are not selling they are HODLing! So it won’t go down I believe 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:20:25
So are you short selling?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:06:25
RemindMe! After 3 months
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:42:44
That actually proves that Bitcoin is more than a currency or a paiement system like they say!
It’s a technology that evolves!
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:36:21
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:32:30
Yeah buy more HODLCORN, I agree with that
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:41:11
RemindMe! After 3 Months
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:22:21
The issue is people are buying this! They have more shitcoins than bitcoin in general 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:13:51
Too late now
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:37:45
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:05:54
Actually not 
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:00:38
Use Segwit! It’s already low using SegWit!
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:23:55
Tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:12:49
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:45:45
People are selling bitcoin to buy other coins! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:22:40
I heard about that, I would like to know the answer 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:05:06
Smart! Don’t sell! Buy more when it’s down 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:28:50
That should be scary for you! Check why it has been compromised maybe you have a malware in your computer or your phone.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:13:31
Use SegWit wallet it will reduce transaction fees by 70% ( on average)
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:03:08
Do you know what is selling when we talk about trading?  You don’t have to own bitcoin you can sell bitcoin in a trading platform like Etoro. And if the price go down you gain money. So if you sell 400$ dollars worth pf bitcoin and the price of bitcoin goes to 1 dollars you will earn 399$ dollars.
So if your prediction is correct you become a millionaire. Thank me later ( or not �� )
But what I noticed is that you are new to trading and to the market so don’t try to influence others please!
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:20:12
XD HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:50:39
I don’t understand them xD
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:33:46
Why! Convince me!
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:04:54
RemindMe! 1 Year
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:18:45
You went short on your positions then? �� you are selling btc? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:53:18
We can’t make bitcoin fees equal to zero or close to it. Because miners won’t work for that! Unless if they are able to multiply the number of transactions per second.!
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:03:29
What are the popular free wallets that you know?
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:47:39
Blockchain / Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:27:19
Coinbase using paypal or your bank account 
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:58:40
But what’s their source of revenue then?
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:24:29
Hodl them ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:51:32
Forcing noobs to the rules! Everyone will become a HODLER finally 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:55:09
Why don’t you use greenadress? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:25:20
Few weeks I say 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:30:39
The issue is people are not cashing out this time! They are buying other coins!
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:26:27
I don’t see any maths errors, I don’t know about the other information though 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:25:45
Q1 2018
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:25:25
Binance and Coinbase, If you need further help please message me
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:10:12
When people start buying bitcoin and bitcoin owners stop freaking out and selling!
If bitcoin owners keep HODLing and people buy Bitcoin the price will increase!
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:39:11
No, HODLing prevents it from going down only. Buy makes it go up 
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:12:49
70% of the people don’t know about bitcoin m, so I don’t believe that we reached the public phase yet or at least the peak of this phase.
( only investors heard about it, we still want more people to use it not just to invest in it. That’s the public phase!) 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:03:27
There’s no correlation between the difficulty and the price of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:01:34
So you are just scaring investors. And you don’t have any experience? You just want to pretend that you will predict the market but you don’t have any bitcoins invested?
Even if you still think your predictions ( which is not yours btw; it’s been here every year)  is correct. Then go to a trading website and sell bitcoin and you will become rich!!
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:07:03
Why Oax?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:54:22
That’s a good story, however lightning transactions should be implemented in order to hope that. ASAP
I invested a significant amount of my money on Bitcoin but I also believe the only solution is Lightning Network. 
Otherwise we will lose.
I’m HODLing for now though ��
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:21:05
I would like to know that as well
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:31:47
No, and please use google!!!
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:46:36
I don’t why are people using Bitcoin if the plan to pay taxes and this BS?
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:33:24
Yes you will have to pay the fees again.
Unless you want to hodl your coins for a longtime don’t use paper wallet just send it directly to the exchange site. I can recommend you one if you don’t have something in mind.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:18:33
I hope it goes down. However, it’s very unlikely ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:00:51
You missed the one that says
HODL your BTC for now!
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:31:53
Double digits?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:29:32
HOLD! Don’t Panics the price is low because of the taxes and people are cashing out because the need money ( new year and Christmas)
The first quarter of 2018 the price will rise again! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:33:11
Buy a hardware wallet, that’s the best way!
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:28:01
HODLer !? ��
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:05:23
Ok so if I got it right; miners will get the same reward for transactions as now or more because they will have more transactions in only one block? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:29:50
It will take you 10383829 year to mine a block 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:27:07
Don’t panic, transactions take hours or even more these days.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:15:33
XRP/ ADA / XLM
One of them will go to the moon for sure
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:52:28
Check private Sellers
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:13:36
I assume that he means best time to buy
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:51:25
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:58:38
It’s not about how much they can buy.
They can’t buy bitcoin because there are no exchanges that accepts African currencies ( except for South Africa)
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:22:38
The issue is that most of people in Africa can’t buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:30:32
What are you talking about ?
