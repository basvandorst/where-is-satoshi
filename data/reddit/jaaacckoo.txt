Thank you very much for the quick and knowledgable response :) this explains a lot more than I first understood and leaves me with more questions to be able to begin my own research! :D

would you not say that taking so many when they cant handle the load is irresponsible ?

I am indeed the author and I’m so glad you commented man, I find your opinion really insightful and I’m sure others will too! “Power” is that golden word that controls so much in this world. And as far as cheap/renewable energy sources I completely agree, it’s something I’ve always believed to be of utmost importance, I just want to thankyou for taking the time to read this too man :)

I’d just like to add a question sorry, in your opinion then would you say it’s fair to think that if we were to meet other life forms or raise our population to such a size that we could spread through the known universe we would just eventually still break down into smaller bands of people that see eye to eye with us and stay away from people that don’t? It’s kind of sad to think there will always be people who want to destroy the happiness of others because they have power and greed as a priority. I’m a firm believer in knowledge is true power, we should be working together to visit the furthest reaches of space discovering wonders not hating eachother over stupid insignificant  things that will not matter once we die

Again a really insightful reply man, 
I agree with how binary it is, but I will always hold hope that it could change with time. 
Yeah the space thing is a lot easier to imagine than the holding hands kumbyah version,  i think “the expanse” the tv show does a very good job of recreating what I imagine it to end up like if you’ve seen that show
