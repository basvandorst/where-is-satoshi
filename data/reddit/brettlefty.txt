Reliablefiles.com eh? Sounds totally legit and reliable...

The question is whether anyone else’s boat was done late as a result of OP’s bribe. And honestly, probably not. Deadlines are deadlines and you’d need a good excuse to miss one. The analogies in these comments are all terrible.
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:13:24
It’s not on the menu.
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:22:34
Good point
@_date: 2018-05-29 17:35:23
Doesn’t BTC do their work for them? Now they just need to compromise BTC instead of rolling out an (their) entire card system to the world.
*edit* and then encourage adoption maybe. This is good for Bitcoin!

Reddit has unfiltered high resolution vote data. I wonder if they’re charting this stuff?
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:14:13
He’s talking about the mechanic, not the briber.
@_date: 2014-09-14 01:57:05
Do you think bitcoin value will continue to drop indefinitely? I'd assume it has to rebound at some point, as there aren't any real competitors with a meaningful edge.
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:25:43
So your entire premise is that he didn’t store his private key somewhere the police were able to access?

Ah cool, so someone can independently verify that you are in fact picking the right winners per the algorithm?
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:21:57
Agreed. This post didn’t exactly age well, did it lol. Although in the greater scheme of things it still probably really wasn’t a bad time to buy 9 days ago.
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:40:06
Isn’t he saying demand is growing and supply is falling? These factors aren’t exactly reliant upon past performance. Demand might not continue growing, but this seems unlikely. Supply most certainly will continue to dwindle.
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:36:18
Maybe so!
@_date: 2018-06-09 01:09:09
Up or down*
@_date: 2018-06-02 04:51:38
I understand that, but I gotta say I don’t understand your comment. I thought we were talking about whether the price would ever go higher?
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:55:42
Did you sell it?
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:05:34
good idea
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:03:01
Not as shit as Fox though right?
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:53:23
Is that from the ATH?
@_date: 2018-06-21 07:50:59
Yeah sounds fine to me.

For faster transactions
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:32:23
Pretty sure he screenshotted the proof. You could even look for yourself if you were so inclined. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:57:50
Here’s my [random lottery algorithm]( which is totally the one used by my lottery site. No, there isn’t any way for you to know I didn’t just link some random algo, but trust me this is the algorithm we’re using.
^ that’s why people are giving you shit here
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:02:34
Lol you think I’m a BRD shill? Christ...
If you aren’t a programmer, either spend some time learning or accept that sometimes you’ll have to take someone else’s word for it when they say something is wrong with the code. 
And this is pretty fucking basic stuff, as far as I can see, you could inspect the code yourself in the browser and verify these findings.
Since we’re on the topic of shills, why are you so adamant about this?
@_date: 2018-06-02 00:14:54
How is that any different than if someone was trying to use BTC for a bus fare and they had to wait 4 hours? They would miss their bus, and eventually the payment would go through, not unlike the CC processor eventually coming online.

Put it on an exchange and set a stop loss.

What’s the answer then? I refuse to watch YouTube videos out of principle.

Today Venezuela, tomorrow some other country. Fractional reserve banking is a ticking time bomb.

Man I’ve watched quite a bit of Fox and quite a bit of CNN, and while they are both shit it really seems to me like Fox is way worse. Not necessarily in what they are actually saying, but in how they deliver the message. Fox is loaded with emotional manipulation, literally telling you how you should feel about stuff. CNN does the same thing for sure, but goddamn have you ever watched Hannity, or worse yet the Ingraham Report? It’s pure propaganda.
CNN pretty much bashes Trump nonstop, which can get tiresome, but having watched the two side by side, the difference is palpable.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:22:59
Yeah I think so.
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:37:47
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:23:04
At least CNN would commission an article though. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 00:22:58
Inspect the code for yourself... Isn’t that the logical next step here?
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:29:25
How can one verify you are actually using the presented algorithm?
@_date: 2018-06-02 04:54:23
Agreed. Blockchain and (especially decentralized) cryptocurrencies in general are superior, and much of the value added comes from efficiencies in the development process.
Once a reliable and decentralized altcoin with fast transaction speeds comes to market, bitcoin might have some competition with regard to use and adoption, at least.
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:34:48
When was the previous peak of crypto hype? And are you saying there will never be more hype than there was last December? If so, why?
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:41:07
hey guy don’t make him watch a video
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:07:32
That’s almost a dozen and a half!
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:05:34
Don’t you think it’s possible for EOS to increase in value to even a fraction of the extent to which ETH did? I’m not saying it will end up at $1000, but couldn’t it eventually find support around $40 or something? That would seem like a decent investment.
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:36:22
While Wall Street can profit even if BTC stays flat, they stand to make way more if it pumps and there is some renewed interest from the public. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 21:37:01
I insist on attacking? Fucks sake dude re-read the thread you’re the one getting bent out of shape here. 
To answer your question, no I don’t care. Do you fam. 
*edit* to be clear, this is where things went from cordial to panties in a bunch: 
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:33:16
Yeah, also not a fan of BRD, but ad hominem is ad hominem nonetheless. The guy posted proof, after all. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 06:02:18
Searched it. There have been multiple peaks and corrections, and there will likely be more. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:02:16
Are they already disclosing their other holdings?
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:29:44
Good point, I was thinking about that when I commented as well. With BTC at least you know it’s in progress. The one drawback I could see is that you wouldn’t really know. You’d tie up your money thinking it would clear quickly only to end up finding out that you were going to have to wait. So there are benefits and drawbacks to both. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:12:55
I don’t, but it doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation to me. I don’t know how these wealthy investors are managing their portfolios though - are we assuming they’re staking or something? Or are they actually trading? If stop limits are in play, I find it hard to imagine what the actual risk is here, aside from BTC running up while these altcoins don’t.
It’s funny, I subbed here because is obviously just a place to shill BCH. Is this sub the BTC equivalent, or can one expect honest discussion here?
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:06:56
Ah well that’s not quite as bad then. Still woulda been better to return them any time before the last pump lol, but better than the alternative.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:07:35
Any thoughts on CoolWallet? It’s also shaped like a card, and unless it was doctored I’ve seen a video of it actually being used.
Pretty sure you can buy one on Amazon too. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:31:11
They sure as hell didn’t cover the lost profits. Which isn’t to say everyone would have held, but some of them would have.

Hasn't it been hovering around 8k for a few days now?
@_date: 2018-07-23 07:55:56
Explain the model plz?
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:58:24
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:21:18
Eh, shit happens. I could say I lost $300 or whatever the value is now, or I could say I lost $1200 or whatever it was that it peaked at, but in reality I just lost the $100 that I initially bought in with and then almost immediately forgot about like an idiot lol...
Thanks for checking my post though. I wasn't sure if maybe this sub isn't very active or my question was just a dubious one. It appears I have far too little information to ever really hope to recover the bitcoin.
I do happen to have the "receiving account" from the ZipZap transaction, which is just a random number and is most likely long since shut down by now. Ah well :/
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:10:48
Yeah, I believe that was them. Their new site appears to be some kind of complete scam. Call it, and it will offer you television, phone service, a cell phone, and a bunch of other stuff. Wasn't able to get a human. I emailed them though - wish me luck!
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:08:19
Ya, I think that's what I did. Used the MoneyPak or whatever with ZipZap to add it to some kind of wallet site, which I can no longer find.
Damn, I really should have saved like... everything
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:10:45

Most likely these two strings I have are my login and pass, and then there's the pin. Which sites might have used pins around 2013?
@_date: 2015-10-24 05:30:47
No I definitely bought and paid for it, and I believe it was activated from the store even - I didn't have to go home and enter a code or anything.
I signed up an account on some site, printed out a voucher with a barcode for CVS to scan, and I believe the idea was that I could go back to the site and get my info. (public and private key I guess?)
Sadly, I definitely didn't save the actual info for the bitcoin itself. Ah well, I am going to try to reach out to ZipZap and see if I have any luckj.
