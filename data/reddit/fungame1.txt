There was a time I had a VPS.  I registered it with fake credentials, via tor, paying with bitcoin.  
It was at Microthosting.com

Blocks propagating for shit.  Special bridge nodes needed.  Old nodes can't properly validate and won't be serving blocks to newer clients, coins held as anyone can spend opening up attack vectors, technical debt to kludge the whole thing as a soft fork...
Yeah, real fucking brilliant.  Super "safe".
This garbage is ridiculous.  No wonder it's got such opposition.  Everyone wants to call the idiots over at attackers and bitcoin terrorists and we have clowns like you on the other side spending every hour of the day pushing this half-baked garbage onto morons who don't know any better.

Feelings? I have none thanks to modern medicine, you old used up nobody.  I wonder what Christmas dinner is like at the old Frogolocalypse house, his fat children with poor hygiene fighting with Mrs. Frogolocalypse about how they don't want to be there. How they don't want hear their physically abusive and mentally deficient dad ranting and raving about the latest shit on motherjones that he bought hook line a sinker. 
What a vision to behold.

Yeah, right.  The perfectionist who touts creating a prep school that fraudulently advertised american accreditation and never graduated a single student/class all while "blowing 300g's on fast cars and women."   The guy's got drive and dedication, I'll give him that, but he's a hack.
