And yet here we are, 7 years in with blockchain.info wallets losing coins on a daily basis, other wallets providing incorrect fees on a daily basis, and other wallets generating private keys with poor entropy.  But each time a loss is incurred, it's never bitcoin's fault, always the user for picking a poor wallet.  Well, like I said, you can blame wallets until you are blue in the face, but new users will blame bitcoin.  As they should.

Broken wallet or broken currency?  Because a new comer to bitcoin isn't going to say "oh gee I picked the wrong wallet".  No, they are going to blame bitcoin, as they should, because their transaction didn't confirm.  It doesn't matter whose fault it technically is, all that matters is their perception of who is at fault.  To them it will be bitcoin.

Oh I wasn't referring to that, and I am aware of that.  However, how many times have people sent away thousands and even hundreds of thousands of dollars to miners (accidentally) as transaction fees?  How many times have people copy and pasted the wrong address and sent money to a black hole?  How many people lost money cause they fat fingered a password while creating their wallets?
Yes it has address checking unlike eth (lolol) but there's plenty of ways to lose money with a typo still.

Everyone who doesn't want every transaction they send or receive to be permanently recorded into an immutable public ledger for starters.  People who don't want to risk losing their life savings to a typo.  People who don't want to wait 10 minutes for a transaction to complete.  People who don't want to use bitcoin because its association with crime.  People who don't want to lose money to a sea of scammers who prey on bitcoiners.  People who understand bitcoin offers no advantage to traditional payment methods.  People who realize credit cards are cheaper, offer cash back, and fraud protection, none of which bitcoin offers.
So pretty much 99% of the world.

So what are you saying, bitcoin is going to be used to store checksums and that's the killer app?
