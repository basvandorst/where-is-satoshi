Looks like they did a ninja edit, the title stated "insolvency" when i posted.
You're right, they aren't trying to speak for MtGox.

Coinbase confirms insolvency of MtGox?
Edit: Coinbase appears to have removed "insolvency" from the title.

**Edit: I probably misinterpreted gavins tweet. See his post [here]( as well as comments below.**
Original post:
If anyone knows who Satoshi is, it's Gavin.


Gavin has been very protective of Nakomotos identity in the past. Somehow i find it hard to believe he would suddenly let it slip to a reporter and not think it would be published... 
I'm not one for conspiracy theories but either Gavin is incompetent or this was entirely intentional.

I'm really baffled at how much support we give this man. The popular opinion seems to be that he's a victim of some sort. 
I spent some time reading through documents related to his case and the evidence is really overwhelmingly against him. He broke several laws.  I do agree that drug laws need a complete overhaul, but that doesn't negate from the fact that he broke them. He knew the consequences if he were to get caught and he went through with it anyway.
It's not clear whether or not his actions resulted in murder, but his intent was clearly there. This is all documented in his journal which was confiscated during the arrest. 
Various family members have reached out to talk about the character of Ross. He's an adult, and presumably intelligent enough to run the SR. Is he really not capable of fooling his family? He's a grown man, he had a life of his own.
I'm genuinely curious about this. 
I feel like i must be missing something obvious. Does anyone care to explain it to me?

Coinbase is giving away 1$ if you let them post on your facebook.
