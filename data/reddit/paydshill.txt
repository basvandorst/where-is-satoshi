What can we do to help prevent this? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:25:45
Is there a site to do this? Or do you think the exchange built something offline?

Watch it.

Unfortunately with that thought process, you are in the minority now (at least in this subreddit). Look at the rest of the comments in this thread. It's sad.

For what it is worth, you can continue that. My grandfather was in the Army, which allowed my dad to use USAA even though he's non-military, which allowed me to use USAA even though I am non-military, which allows my fiance to use USAA... and one day our kids.

There is a premium in GBTC due to the ease of use and ability to access it. As BTC becomes more mainstream and easier for the everyday investor to access, that premium will dissipate... along with the returns.

It is comparing past growth/movements in Bitcoin after stages of stability/corrections/side ways action. 
It's more for fun, but you can compare our current move after side ways action/ stability stage (June- Mid July) to past movements after a stability stage. 
For example, if our current move has similar activity/growth to Mar 2017, you can expect Bitcoin to hit a price of $89,421 within 2 months.
If our current move has similar activity/growth to the May 2012 move, you can expect Bitcoin to be at $7,300 within 2 more months. etc. 
Again, just for fun.

Most likely has a SDRP (self directed retirement plan) at any of the large brokerages you've heard of (etrade, scottrade, etc). You can just buy GBTC for your SDRPs like you buy stock in cash brokerage account. Scottrade/etrade can set these up for you.

r/bitcoin thinks they are the true vision of bitcoin. r/btc thinks they are the true vision of bitcoin. The great thing about bitcoin, is you get to decide what you think bitcoin is.

His comment was changed. Not sure why it doesn't show as such. But that is why my comment is highly up voted, yet makes zero sense now.

This is a pretty good one. Short and to the point: 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:11:52
This is good for bitcoin. So it is allowed.

It now supports on device pin and passphrase entry. This can help prevent against key logger malware. If you have a ledger nano S it does the same thing.

Very cypherpunk/bitcoin of you.

Probably because it is likely a scam. I know Adam Back seems to be a big supporter of it, and has claimed to see it in action... but co-owner of both bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org believes it is a scam:

Bitcoin was built to be a trustless system and a system that as satoshi said could help us "gain a new territory of freedom" from governments by using something like p2p bitcoin. 
If you think as bitcoin users we need to trust and depend on the US government then I'm sorry to say, you don't get it. 
Arguing with someone who thinks we should use government intervention to protect bitcoin is as worthy a conversation as someone who thinks bitcoin is tulips. They just haven't passed that stage yet. We can agree to disagree.. for now, and I wish you the best of luck in your journey. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:34:01
No one said cypherpunks are majority owners. You are misunderstanding some of the foundational reasons bitcoin was created. If you think using a US Federal Government Agency should be used to protect bitcoin then you either fail to understand the fundamental reasons it was created and/or the project has failed.

Just a thought, not necessarily disagreeing with you...
What happens if the government makes it illegal to accept bitcoin or for banks to transact with any companies who use bitcoin? 
How would we work around that? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 03:02:58
Good news. Billionaire investing his own skin in the game. As well as high net worth individuals and/or institutional investors being invested. 
"Bubble" isn't necessarily a negative term depending how you look at it... especially if you are an early adopter like most here. 
Tech in general went though a "bubble" in early 2000's. Look how companies who survived that bubble, or companies created in the industry after that bubble have done. (NFLX, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB, AMZN, etc). 
Sometimes bubbles are created in part by an excess or irrational exuberance of lesser quality product riding a new wave. Bubbles rid us of the junk (maybe some ICOs), and allow the real quality (blockchain assets with true value, like Bitcoin) to succeed much further than before.

Do you think Bitcoin is currently undervalued? If so, then start buying. You might get that opportunity to buy again at $4k, you might not. So the best strategy might be to implement some sort of dollar cost averaging. 
You can consider buying now a "hedging cost" for not missing out on any further gains. If it does start dropping you can start dollar cost averaging on the way down. If it doesn't start dropping at least you are involved to some degree. 
You can base the allotments of each buy on how confident you are on the current price. Not confident this price is sustainable and $4k will come? Then only do 10% of your planned investment now. Reanalyze accordingly for each buy.

Your thought process is likely exactly where Charlie Lee's thought process is. I think a lot of users here forget that. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:33:28
He is joking, saying 17 days off from his prediction, not the original OP. He said 5k in 5 years on August 13th, 2012. Meaning by August 13th, 2017.

You can use exchanges just like you would for equities in a stock brokerage. Cryptocurreny exchanges are different entities (non that I know of do both stocks on the NYSE and Bitcoin). 
Depends where you live, but in the USA Coinbase seems to one of the largest. Beware, their customer service times have been horrendous as of late. I have never had an issue, so I have not needed to use it. Being a new account, verification might take longer. To be fair, interest has grown so much industry wide, most exchanges are probably like that. 
Itbit.com is who I used first, and never had an issue. 
Might be worth opening up an account at both and going with whoever gets you verified the quickest.

There are other trust companies that will perform SDRPs for more alternative investments (BTC included). If it is worth it would depend how much you are wanting to buy. Start up fees are sometimes around $1,000, and much smaller yearly fees. It would allow you to buy actual bitcoin (as well as many other alternative investments) and they would insure you keep the tax benefits.

China Gov. shot themselves in the foot. By temporarily (I assume) banning exchanges from operating until they can have more regulation and control over it... they pushed users to become comfortable and normalized in using methods they can't control (OTC, p2p, messaging apps, etc).
When exchanges come back with regulation and more gov. control. What will users who don't want their government to have a hand in their money do now? They've already been using it and familiarizing themselves with it.

Sorry didn't mean to do anything wrong.
At what point will that twitter account not be considered unsubstantiated?

Not sure if this is the case, but please consider not leaving any significant amount of crypto holdings in an exchange (Coinbase).
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:23:40
For some reason the link you sent me will not show historical, it only shows the current unconfirmed at this very moment. Not sure why. But yes the historical chart helps. Also seems to say we don't actually have that many unconfirmed transactions compared to the past. Thank you again. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:49:35
I might of answered my own question, looks like this will work for seeing historical comparison? 
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:30:20
Thank you. Is there a way to chart out unconfirmed transactions? I see 14400 something unconfirmed, but no way to know if that is a lot or a little... seems like a lot though.
