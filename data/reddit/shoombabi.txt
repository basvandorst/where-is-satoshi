Now I'm not about to imply that past actions predict future behaviors, but I imagine there are quite a few people here who survived on the 80%+ drop from 1200 to 200 a few years ago, only to hold between 200 - 400, and then watch as it soared to almost 20,000.
Point being, for YEARS it seemed like the 1200 folks were in a bad spot...until they weren't. 
If you cant handle the volatility of the market, you shouldn't be in the market.  If you can handle it, then what's the point in trying to shittalk the thing you hope pulls through for you? Either make a positive contribution so that it gains the value you think it deserves, pull out because you no longer have faith, or hold onto it because you think it'll truly grow to where you need it to. 
You're looking on your investment with whatever the opposite of rose-colored glasses are.  Step back and look objectively, and if $50 is really making you rage this hard, I wish you the best of luck in figuring out what the actual stressors in your life are, because there's something else behind the scenes.

Thanks for the clarification on that.  What feature about the forking would indicate which coin should be the legitimate successor? Does it have to do with the amendments to the how the blockchain is manipulated (if that even makes sense?) or is it more of an investors-decide thing?

Someone *please* correct me if I'm incorrect, as I'm new to BTC myself, but my understanding of this particular fork is that Coinbase will be handling it similarly to the way a stock splits; generate 2x as many coins (in this case 1:1 for each bitstream), but likely with half the valuation on each.
