Another wave for Bitcoin, it crossed $8,000 on all exchanges! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:36:27
Let's have an even better next week!
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:06:27
it has quite a strong support level at $1500, looks like it's here to stay :O

Tesla roadster looks awesome, too bad it's not gonna be available till 2020 :(
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:28:11
Looks like there's a strong resistance at $8000, keeps dumping after getting close to $8k ( Once it will penetrate that $8k sell wall it can easily go to $9k.

@_date: 2017-11-18 08:59:59

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:09:22
Looks like it's gonna go above $8000 again, hopefully stays above this time!

There are plenty of exchanges with high limits, you just need to verify your account. I prefer Kraken &amp; Bitstamp.

at least it has autopilot :D so you don't crash when ur looking at charts lol
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:37:25
i think everyone hopes Bitcoin will be $500k, but in case it's not... it's still gonna be fun :D
