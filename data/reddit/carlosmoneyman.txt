If the price gets pumped again.
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:34:51
Lmao what?
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:13:53
Please educate me. Otherwise I might be thinking that youre talking total bs.
@_date: 2018-08-17 07:20:15
Did you make a 4th account to troll?
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:02:48
And why is this a bad strategy?
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:17:14
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:32:31
Lmao this is like item duplication
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:03:51
Worst over? Based on what?

You never know where the price is going actually. You can only make predictions. Its always better to buy low then to buy high right?
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:23:53
Down 40%... but tethered
@_date: 2019-03-03 21:18:25
Would be easier to write without the eyes
@_date: 2019-03-03 21:17:14
This is the one
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:35:10
Increase in value.
@_date: 2019-03-31 15:43:13
Buy more pls
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:34:20
That is the way we all do.
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:18:58
Feel the dip, smell the dip, buy the dip.
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:31:54
We "gon' be alrittteeee" when there are fundemental investors stepping in. For now its just dreaming...
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:31:32
But what about the fundemental aspects and the technology behind it all? I think the hodl takes as long untill its an mainstream used currency.
@_date: 2019-06-02 20:02:22
@_date: 2019-02-26 11:52:33
"all in"
@_date: 2019-06-05 08:21:42
Seriously what does that stand do?
@_date: 2019-02-27 18:59:59
This isnt going to end well
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:05:31
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:21:40
Please dont if youre only looking for "profit" within weeks.
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:16:03
You will cry
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:18:21
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:58:13
Pump dump?
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:57:54
Don't cry when it will be dumped pls.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:00:51
@_date: 2018-12-10 05:51:46
But is it realistic?
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:06:11
Aaaand its red again
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:22:22
Isnt there a scenario that we will swing around $2.5k-4.5k for around 2 years?
