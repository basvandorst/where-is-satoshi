Bitcoin is not going to be truly useful as a transactional currency due to price fluctuations until we are much higher on the S curve than we are now, but that's fine because it has many other uses until it reaches that point. Honestly the currency aspect of it was pushed in the media because that's what people can understand most easily but it will be one of the later use cases which is causing a lot of confusion at the moment, but that's fine because any exposure good or bad increases awareness.  In the mean time bitcoin don't give a fuck and will keep honeybadgering on as usual.

I think bitcoin has some of the largest potential in africa where more people have access to a cell phone than a bank account.  Especially with the huge number of countries each with their own currency, a unified global currency should be hugely appealing and would open up their entire continent for transactions without exchange fees.  M-PESA integration seems to be the most promising avenue for this that I can tell.

I disagree.  First, Bitcoin still isn't ready for mainstream adoption by the masses and merchants, ease of use and security are prohhibitive for mass adoption and not enough merchant interfaces are in place at this point to spur consumer demand.  
Instead, this has cleared out the major player in the market who happened to be incompetent and offshore.  SecondMarket is trying to eat their lunch with the announcement of a major US exchange in NY for institutional investors.  This is going to allow the US to make the move to be the main player in the Bitcoin space.  Wall street isn't dumb, they know this is the fault of an incompetent organization (or individual) and that there is real money to be made in the Bitcoin space and they are going to want a piece of that action but they have been waiting on the sidelines for regulations and competent domestic exchanges to be sorted out.  
Consumer confidence will come once they see that Wall St. is in on the game and they can actually dabble in it with their 401k's, that will give it legitimacy.  Then they will realize that it isn't going anywhere and is actually useful for day to day purchases especially when travelling internationally, sending business payments, etc.  
Day to day merchant adoption at starbucks etc. will be the last phase once the UI and security is dead simple for the average idiot.  It goes like this;
Tech geeks / Libertarians --&gt; Wall St. --&gt; Large international businesses / businessmen --&gt; Smaller consumer merchants --&gt; Global adoption.

I admit it would be difficult if they ban exchanges.

Whoever knows the private key for the address where the bitcoins are stored can move the coins.  The feds currently have those keys.  They will arrange a private sale and transfer the coins to the new owner once they have received the proceeds from the sale.

Agreed on the hassle and risk.  It is not easy to understand, acquire and secure as a generic user.  Its not for mom or grandma by any means.  However it does give me the freedom to spend my money how I see fit without having to ask for anyone else's approval and that alone gives it huge value for me and many others.  I doubt you could name another payment method other than cash or gold that can do that and transacting globally with either of those has obvious limitations.

Bitcoin was the first mover and has a well established network effect and several hundred million dollars of infrastructure as well as thousands of the top programmers, entrepeneurs and VCs backing it and building platforms on top of it. Any improvement on bitcoin that an altcoin offers can be integrated into the bitcoin protocol since it is open source so any altcoin would have a very hard time surpassing bitcoin as the dominant crypto.  I think there is still a need for alternates like litecoin for scrypt mining, etc. though.

@_date: 2014-01-21 20:18:44
Great questions.  Let me give it a shot (any more knowledgeable bitcoiners out there feel free to correct me)


Bitcoin was created by someone who goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.  He wished to remain anonymous for various reasons but I think the main one is that he wants his work to stand and be judged on it's own merits.  [His original whitepaper]( outlines how the protocol works, and while it may be a bit too complicated for the average person to understand, bitcoin is entirely open source, viewable and auditable by anyone.  Hundreds of the leading experts in computer science, cryptography and security have reviewed it and have verified that it is not malicious in any way and works as described in the paper.  In addition, the best hackers on the planet have also tried to break it as they currently have a $10 billion financial incentive to do so but have been unsuccessful.  
Bitcoin is not currently "accepted" by the banking system, bitcoin operates outside of the control of the banking system by going around it.  Bitcoin is distributed and decentralized in the same way that filesharing programs like bittorrent are meaning that it doesn't need the permission of banks to operate in the same way that bittorrent doesn't need the permission of the MPAA or RIAA to operate.  Governments would literally have to shut down the internet for the entire planet in order to stop Bitcoin transactions from occurring.  Banks will most likely offer products and services that use bitcoin as a platform but ultimately bitcoin does not require the permission of the banks to exist.  


This is one of the great things about bitcoin, it is the worlds first truly global means of exchange with no third party intermediary.  I can choose who I want to conduct business with anywhere on the planet and there is no bank, government or transaction service like paypal or western union that has the ability to block the payment, flag it as suspicious or charge excessive fees for the ability to transfer the value.  
At its core Bitcoin is a protocol, a set of rules that are followed that allow any two parties to conduct business in a trustless manner.  Party A doesn't have to trust Party B and there is no central Party C that can get in the way of A and B.  The internet operates on a similar set of rules outlining how data is sent from point A to point B and as long as everyone agrees on these rules it allows your e-mail, file, picture, etc. to get to its intended recipient.


Bitcoin's value is set strictly by the laws of supply and demand.  As long as there are more buyers than sellers the price will rise, more sellers than buyers it will fall.  There are several exchanges each with a slightly different value due each having their own group of buyers and sellers but they stay relatively close to each other due to arbitrage.  A good site to track the value over several exchanges is [bitcoinity]( or [the genesis block](  The value of Bitcoins is actually simpler to understand than for example the US dollar (which can be printed endlessly) because there is a hard cap on the number of bitcoins that will ever exist at 21 million and they are [issued at a predictable rate]( until they reach that hard cap around or slightly before the year 2140 as defined by the protocol.  No one can arbitrarily decide to issue more bitcoins because there has to be agreement between all nodes processing bitcoin transactions in order to make a change to the protocol.  The nodes would never agree to issuing more than the hard cap on the number of bitcoins because doing so would break trust in the system and cause them to lose their vested financial interest in Bitcoin.  
Bitcoins are also infinitely divisible so the hard limit on the total supply cap does not pose any issue with bitcoins ability to swell and absorb monetary value.  The hard limit on supply cap combined with infinite divisibility and the laws of supply and demand dictating price is the reason many have given a potential future valuation of bitcoin in the 6-7 figure range as it is all determined and governed by mathematics.    
I enjoyed answering your questions, let me know if you have any more or need further clarification.

[There is already a working implementation]( (his demo videos are on the right side of the wiki) but what really inspires me about OT is [the talk Chris gave at BTC miami]( where he mentions zero server trust and how OT can replace all current exchanges (Gox, Coinbase, Stamp, etc.) as well as Silk Road, etc. and allows for extremely flexible smart contracts.  
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:51:28
I am speaking with a friend of mine who owns a brewery about accepting at this brewpub.  Here is the email I sent him this morning;
"If your current POS system uses [SoftTouch]( then [BitPay]( can fully integrate with them so you don't need multiple terminals.  [Here is a video]( of the BitPay integration with a retail business.  
If you don't currently use SoftTouch in your POS then a stand alone solution like [Coinkite]( would probably be preferable.  [Here's a video]( on the operation, etc.  
Just thought I would share the research I have done up to this point."  
If anyone else has suggestions that I can propose I would be happy to pass them on.  
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:04:05
Ask away.  
I would start by creating a free wallet on blockchain.info and downloading their mobile app.  Enable 2FA (2 factor authentication) 
If you are in the US buy bitcoins with coinbase.com (my preferred method) or localbitcoins.com and pay in cash if you dont want them tied to your identity.  
Send the coins you buy to your blockchain wallet.  Start with a small amount ($100 or less), you can keep this on your blockchain wallet for daily spending.  
If you decide to invest any more into bitcoin you will want to get what is known as a cold storage wallet (this is a bit more technical to create but it will keep your coins safer and you can think of it as your savings account.  Would be happy to help with this when you are ready).  
Don't waste your time trying to get free bitcoins from giveaway sites.  Feel free to offer products or services in exchange for bitcoins though as a method of payment.  
Let me know if you have any more questions, and welcome!

Both are currencies but the dollar does not really have potential to appreciate as an asset.  Bitcoin's limited total supply (as opposed to the dollar) allows for appreciation in a similar manner to how gold's limited supply makes it behave more like a commodity.

FORTUNE -- Last December, I wrote that Fortress Investment Group was preparing to launch a fund that would buy and hold Bitcoin. I also wrote that while details were scarce," there was "some relationship to a new Bitcoin-related fund raised by Pantera Capital, a San Francisco-based hedge fund whose clients are known to include several Fortress executives."
Here is what I now know: Fortress has invested directly in Pantera Bitcoin Partners, the limited liability company overseeing Pantera's Bitcoin fund. Moreover, all future purchases of Bitcoin or other crytpocurrencies by Fortress and its principals will be made via Pantera. In other words, there will not be a Fortress-branded fund. It remains unclear if my initial report was accurate and things changed, or if I was off track from the beginning.
One of the bread crumbs I apparently misread involved Steve Waterhouse, whose LinkedIn profile at the time listed him as both a managing director with Fortress and partner on an unnamed Bitcoin fund. Waterhouse has now formally left Fortress, to become a partner with Pantera.
In addition to Fortress, Pantera has received investments from venture capital firms Benchmark and Ribbit Captial. Those three firms also recently partnered to invest $20 million into Bitcoin "vault" company Xapo, which happens to hold Pantera Bitcoin Fund's assets (Pantera also made a small co-investment on that deal, which had not been previously disclosed).
No word yet on how much any of the three funds have invested in Pantera, or how much Bitcoin they already have committed to the underlying hedge fund (which is open-ended). In fact, all we really know about the hedge fund is that it's more focused on long-term appreciation than active "trading," and that it had $147 million in gross asset value as of last December 4 (according to a regulatory filing). A source familiar with the fund said that at least some of the $147 million came from Fortress.
RELATED: Is Bitcoin Silicon Valley's new version of real estate?
"About a year ago I put all of my professional intentions into Bitcoin, and came across these three firms and saw that we had similar visions," explains Pantera CEO Dan Morehead, who originally launched the firm to manage global macro hedge funds (something it no longer does for outside investors). "Now they are shareholders."
Ribbit Capital founder Micky Malka adds that the involvement of Pantera and Fortress gives Bitcoin some Wall Street credibility, which could help the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. "For Bitcoin to become stored value, it needs to be trusted by hundreds of millions of people, not just hundreds of thousands of people. It's still very high risk, but this is a step toward that goal."

Chris has some really amazing and inspiring ideas.  He called out the problems with having to trust Gox with your coins well in advance and they are actively working on the solution using voting pools.

You can get an account on bitstamp.net I believe, wire them the money, trade for coins on the exchange, send her the coins, she sells them on coinbase.com for direct deposit the US account.

Do you happen to have any pull with POS manufacturers?

Hey NBY, I have seen this as well.  I was trying to explain to my brother just yesterday the consumer advantage and having a bit of a hard time, mainly because I admit it doesn't have the stability it needs at the moment for people to feel comfortable that their money isn't going to be changing in value drastically from one day to the next.  And I dont expect that to happen for at least the next few years.  Right now I think it is most attractive as a commodity and it is going to need to take a percentage of several financial/remittance/markets before it has the market cap to truly have stability.  Once that happens it should be much more attractive as a transactional currency and also it will have many more intuitive user interfaces that have been developed.  Would love to elaborate but I'm on my phone and need to put my daughter to bed.

Besides the fact that it got cut off early I think it was a good video. I think you present bitcoin how I would.  That is to say you have a fundamental understanding if what bitcoin means for the world and how it all works but when attempting to explain it to an audience who is not will versed it is hard to know how to attack the problem of communicating the magnitude of the potential blockchain in a way they can understand, especially in front of a group of people in a short timeframe.  That said, I think you did a great job but your delivery could use a little polish to be a bit more clear and linear in your explanation of the benefits for individuals and society as a whole.  Glad we have you in the community Bruce, you're doing a great job.

New, more secure exchanges come online and old, less secure exchanges die off.  Anyone with any amount of coins on btc-e either knows the risk they are taking and choosing to use their service anyway or the are just oblivious.  Its a gradual evolution towards rock solid security practices.  Bitcoin should be around for a long long time and if not its replacement will implement the solutions that work.  Eventually you won't have to trust third party servers with your private keys.

Even if I was of the mindset to hoard my coins (which I am) if starbucks started accepting them I would still use it every single time I purchased from them (and would go out of my way to do so), I would just also replenish my spent coins from coinbase at the time of purchase.  Sure it is a bit more effort for me but the net effect is the same for my savings and bitcoin merchant acceptance is promoted which ultimately has a positive effect on the market price.  Win-Win.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:57:01

We need to do a better job of explaining the advantages bitcoin offers to them from a business perspective such as the savings vs credit cards and zero risk of chargebacks.

@_date: 2013-12-09 21:42:56
Hey Matt,
Glad you're having fun   :)  
I thought I would briefly list a few ways how Bitcoin offers several advantages over regular currency.  There are reasons why gold was used for wealth storage and exchange for thousands of years, because it does a pretty good job meeting all the properties that make a good form of money, ease of transport, durable, divisible, hard to counterfeit and easy to store.  Bitcoin also holds all of these properties as well but improves upon several of them namely divisibility, impossible to counterfeit, ease of transport and storage.
Some examples;
* There is no central issuing authority with Bitcoin and there is a hard cap on the total number of bitcoins that will ever exist at 21 million (no FED to corrupt and continuously print dollars until they are worthless)
* It's nearly instantaneous value transfer to anyone on the planet at any time for nearly zero fees (I can send a million dollars from the US to my business partner in China at 3am on a Sunday as easily as I can pay for a latte at my neighborhood coffee shop).
* There is no third party to take fees from your transaction or delay it via wire transfer, etc. or intercept it under the pretext of fraudulent transfer, etc. It is like digital cash that you can do with as you please.
* It is pseudonymous, if you want to remain anonymous in your transactions it can be done with minimal effort via mixing services or by purchasing coins with cash in person.
Bitcoin is still in the very early stages of global adoption and needs to increase in value dramatically in order to reach stability by expanding its market cap. During that rise there will be speculators, big news events regarding adoption, regulation, etc. which will cause big price swings until the market is large enough to absorb the fluctuations and remain relatively stable. At that point it will be much easier to accept it as a transactional currency without using third party services such as bitpay.com to convert immediately into your preferred currency but currently it is used more like Gold 2.0 for secure wealth storage and transfer.
I have only briefly touched on bitcoins potential here, let me know if you have any questions.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:51:12
I would also be interested in details, perhaps as a separate post?

I was gifted stock &amp; bond certificates as a kid as a form of investment for my future.  Also a pain to cash out which is incentive to keep them and let them mature, this is essentially the same thing.

It's 20 bucks (BTC amount adjusts with exchange rate, 0.0343 as of this post), that's not out of line for what in my opinion is a pretty sweet t-shirt.  Buy $20 worth from coinbase and pay with bitcoin.

Difficulty is automatically adjusted to keep the creation rate at approximately 25 coins every 10 minutes.  The reason it increased is that coins were being generated too quickly.

It sounds like you are describing cold storage wallets which is the most secure way to store your BTC.  You can send funds to the cold storage wallet but can't spend them unless your import the full amount to a less secure online wallet or desktop client.

It doesn't seem they could institute any sorry of coin taint in that case, I mean those would be the most tainted coins out there.  Also I think it's funny they would probably have a stabilizing effect on the market and cause a lot of built up buy pressure trying to get through those walls.

The only people who have lost money investing in bitcoin are the ones who sold.  Everyone who has held longer than 7 months has made incredible returns (and probably has no intention of selling at this point).

With those specs you would probably never ever mine a block unless you got unbelievably insanely lucky.  There is a reason people join pools and it's so they have any chance of a payout since they are sharing the profit by sharing the work.  The only thing your boss is going to do is increase his electrical bills for running that thing and cooling the office.  
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:31:32
We would see a rather large influx of new users though and we are still capped at 7 transactions/second currently.

I did my first cash transaction the other day at a coffee shop, wasn't too worried about robbery (although I would be if we were dealing with larger dollar amounts) but the buyer seemed surprised and disappointed when the price I quoted him wasn't the same as when he first contacted me.  He had assumed he had locked in that price even though he had never given me anything and the price had risen since he had contacted me.  I was operating on a floating scale 8% above bitstamp at the time you hand me the cash and said so in my email to him because I still dont see how escrow could work for a cash sale.  Am I missing something?   
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:27:14
Replace the bitcoin you spend at the time of purchase using coinbase.  Net effect, you have the same amount of coins and you have helped promote bitcoin usage and acceptance.  Increased merchant acceptance will lead to increased market value in the long run so it is actually beneficial for you to make purchases in bitcoin instead of fiat.

I too madea significant purchase right at the park of the previous bubble but holding has worked out very well for me so far.  I honestly don't see bitcoin dropping back below that previous peak of $250, at least not from this news.

If you go from BTC to USD on an exchange like bitstamp or gox there are no tax obligations as long as you don't withdrawal the USD to your bank account.   At least this is my understanding but I'm fairly certain it is correct.

Every address has a matching key.  Whoever has the key essentially owns the coins because they can move them from the address.  Having an offline wallet makes it impossible to obtain the key  maliciously (if created correctly) but if you were to share the key with someone they could move your coins (their coins now)
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:34:11
If I was to post an offer for a cash sale and accept escrow but then the price drops before we are able to meet for payment, wouldn't the seller just back out?  Also if the price rises, why would I go through with the order?  I am just wondering how escrow could work for cash transactions.

You know what hunger leads to?  Crime, not self reflection.  What people fighting addition need is counselling and a support structure to allow them to feel like they actually have a chance to stand on their own and their whole world isn't about to turn to shit which is what leads a lot of them down the path of addiction in the first place.  No amount of shaming and depravation is going to make them feel like all of a sudden their life has meaning and is worth fighting for.   If we were face to face I would either walk away in disgust or publicly shame you for making such an ignorant and soulless comment.
