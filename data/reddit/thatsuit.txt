You can send bitcoin to people via email with coinbase, then it prompts them to sign up and claim them. If they don't you get them back. I sent my buddy $20 for pizza two years ago. He claimed them, but never cashed them out. I reminded him recently that his pizza money has grown to over $800. =)

I hardly watch the price, I'm going long!

So you're telling me bitcoin is just like the housing market? Nowhere to go but up?

Did you save enough money to essentially retire or do you still work?

So it says you can't receive payments with the app, but could you receive a refund from a store with it? Could the store cancel/reverse the transaction?

Hmm, thanks for the response. I would think I would want to open my channel with some large node on the network, like the one from the Eclair Wallet developers, so I could pay as many different people as possible without the trouble of trying to get up a new channel for every vendor I buy from. I think we still have a bit to go for more simplification of usability. But, this has tons of potential.

Interesting. Thanks for the response. Just trying to think about how things would work if I was trying to use this out in the real world. I would guess stores might also be ok with refunding in cash though too.

Sure it's reasonable compared to banking and wire transfers. Other cryptos are less though. I really don't care, but I'm using it as an investment and store of value and not for daily transactions. But if I wanted to send money quickly I don't want to pay $15. So hopefully this goes down with segwit and when there's less tx spam.

I sent 0.09 BTC with a 0.00047915 BTC ($3 fee) yesterday. Confirmation took like 12 hours, but I was in no rush. I think even that is high, but I just moved it into a segwit wallet now.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:43:57
That was the default recommended amount in the wallet I was using. I switched it from high to low priority to get the $3 fee instead.

You can import your paper wallet and send the balance to GDAX and the leftover amount to a new paper wallet. You don't need to send it to a new wallet first, it's just a question of how you do it. Import means you don't use a new wallet first, sweep means you do.
Check out these posts:
Here's why you can't partially spend from a paper wallet and must use the whole balance:

You should never buy bitcoin for short term gains because you're gambling. The only thing we know is that long term the price has always gone back up to higher highs and "large" corrections are normal. 
Buy a hardware wallet, put all your coins on that. Log out and check back in a year.

I haven't seen that kind of hope since Dogecoin! Don't worry, all Doges' go to the big moon farm in the sky, honest.
