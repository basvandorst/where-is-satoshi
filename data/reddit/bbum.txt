Re-reading the FAQ.   (1) is sorta-kinda clear, but (2) not so much.
Thanks for the reminder.

OK, so, the viability of the BTC currency is tied to the transaction fees rising, as necessary, to ensure the cryptographic validity of the transactions, regardless of the volume of transactions through the system.
While the BTC currency is limited to NN million units, the protocol for transaction allows said units to be sub-divided significantly (8 times?  With N more subdivisions through a protocol change?) thereby seemingly increasing the load on the "mining" -- really, validation -- pool to verify any given transaction?
So, really, the question is more one of conjecture:   As the pool of BTC grows and the # the number of transactions potentially increases exponentially (both due to popularity &amp; valuation forced sub-division of BTC), then how will the currency remain viable in what is seemingly a potentially beyond a Moore's law kind of curve of available CPU power?

This isn't really specific to mining.    Or, maybe, it is because mining is really all about validating transactions of existing coins?
It is more a question of understanding how the currency will manage the seemingly exponential increase in computational load necessary to securely validate all transactions in a timely fashion?
(Does that even make sense?)

The difference between gambling is that the house rules are known in Vegas...
The question is what the Chinese do next.
Attempt to shutdown BTC? Crash. (See prior virtual currency for reference).
Ignore it? Rise.
Fund?  Rocket.
Open currency markets for trading with less oversight?  Likely crash, maybe not. 
New large businesses accept BTC?  Adds stability long term and short term valuation.
