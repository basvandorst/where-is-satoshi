Florida. We have a data center and multiple tenants in our building so it varies on a few factors, but between .06 and .069 . This is about 60% of the total consumption in the building. So I have a meeting with the VP of the energy company in a few weeks to try to negotiate something even better. It helps that they rent space in our CoLo

haha, sorry for potato quality, tried to do it quickly as we have an air mover set up and I didn't want to waste any of the cold air (not sure if it even matters)

haha, i promise it's only like this on internal stuff (namely BTC). the client side would prob fall under cable porn (from what I've seen) I haven't been in many of the cages.

He owns the building(s) / data centers. I'm the controller. We pay for power, depending on the other tenants it fluctuates all in between .06 and .066

We just ordered 10 s9s, so with all of the additional parts, import, etc that was about 20,500. Yes, I'd imagine we're going to continue until there is profit left. No one is really sure how halving will effect the entire ecosystem, except to use the last halving as a measuring stick.

Thanks - adding them to the 300 s7s we have. will slowly start cycling those out (eventually)

They use a pool. I believe they average around 1200 something, Tera hash maybe??? This is with all 3 racks going full strength.

yeah, we do just this, we've sold off all the old s5's -- not sure what the place will be on the s7s because 1. they're still profitable and 2. the s9's are still limited. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:33:16
First batch of s9 came in today. Have 5 in each location arrived. And 15 more between batch 2 and 3.

hah yeah - it's funny how lackadaisical they are with the machines here compared to the actual servers/etc. But when some of your clients are hospitals, banks, and government agencies I guess you have to be on point. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:03:08
hard to tell here, but there are 100 s7s total. (maybe 98 in this shot) and the same at each of the other two open spaces we have. wish i got into it back when they did :(

that's not entirely true. There are times when SARs are documented and/or if teller has a suspicion they are able to ask certain questions. Even if it's just withdrawing a large sum of cash from your own account, but certainly more likely when trying to cash a check.
but for the most part, it's none of their business. it's terrible now. you can't even deposit cash into someone else's bank account w/o producing ID. Some banks (i.e. chase) you can't even DEPOSIT cash into someone's account -- must be a check. seems silly to me.
