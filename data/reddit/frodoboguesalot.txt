Out of curiosity, how does someone with no stake or strong opinions on Bitcoin find themselves on the main Bitcoin subreddit?

For some reason reading the words 'apparently literally' right after each other does not sound right.

His legacy is his the inheritence he's chosen to pass along to his kids. You know, how legacies typically work

There's a lot of people with the scary mindset that BTC is too powerful for a crash to occur. I'm preparing for the crash.
People probably felt the same way about the economy back in 07/08 before everything crashed.

A lot of our parents should already know the golden rule: Only invest what you are willing to lose.
Your dad might be at a point where it's not worth risking any of the money that he's worked hard for, especially if they're in a pension situation. If your dad has some disposable income, why the heck not.
For my Dad, this is all too similar to the bubble that popped in 2008. It was very real for a lot of our parents... some of them haven't recovered.
The way I pose it to my friends - "You spend $100 on useless items most weekends anyways. Might as well invest into something so that you can't spend that money on useless items."

Spreading misinformation is probably more damaging then lying at the moment.
I think you're hitting the nail on the head with people lying to themselves. This is a really good point.

I think there is an addictive tendency that needs to get addressed before you invest too much into Crypto currencies. Otherwise you'll just invest every last cent and if things tank, then you're most likely out all of that unless you sell before things dip too heavily.
Like others have said, invest what you are willing to lose. If you are comfortable losing your pension for the risk of a bit of money - then go for it. 
Also, remember that the gains that made people millionaires with Bitcoin are a lot harder to come around with the value being so high currently.

That's a really good point, great thinking!

2 years ago people would be freaking at someone spending their bitcoin, nice to see people ramp up normal use!

Listen to yourself. You sound more paranoid than he was making you out to be.
Sad.
