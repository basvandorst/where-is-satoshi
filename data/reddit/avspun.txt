Best to contact the developer to see how the private key is stored. If they were reckless, they may have stored it plain text on a property list file, which can be accessed pretty easily. Otherwise if it's stored via NSUserDefaults, you could offer the developer the $200 to send you a test flight version of the app that'll print out the NSUserDefaults on screen. 
Could you provide the crash log? May be something simple that's causing the crash.

Is the 15% accounted for exclusively via Chinese based exchange trading volume, via CNY pairings or global users? It would be good to receive clarification to see if it incorporates Chinese users trading on exchanges outside of China. (You'd would think that this inclusion would yield a higher percentage than 15%). Though without a CNY pairing on any exchange, the volume would surely decrease to a position where it no longer (finally) affects the btc price.

"A broader clampdown will likely include blocking mainland access to websites of foreign bitcoin exchanges such as Coinbase in the U.S. and Bitfinex in Hong Kong, say people familiar with the matter." 
Wonder who is the source is that is 'Familiar with the matter'?
It'll be interesting to see if this unverified document turns out to be legit after all &gt;

Actually scrap that, they would need to fix the crash before being able to output anything. So my approach would be to see if they'd update the source code for a fee, or at least enquire as to how the key is stored. If it's no longer under active development, offer to buy the source code from them and pay a developer to fix the crash / extract data.
