You can use mine for one jump, for the low low cost of 3.141 BTC

I thought it was going to roll itself up and snort a line

How often do you take a dump?

Don't marry her.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:48
I lost .008 because I have them sent to my trezor wallet, and outside addresses require .01 payout threshold. I don't think there is an option to control the amount pre-payout threshold.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:07:40
The people with pending payouts that didn't reach the .01 BTC threshold lost their money. That had nothing to do with controlling your keys.

I'm not ever a violent person, but everything about his face enrages a violence inside me that I didn't even know I had.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:30:09
I've been using Winminer since the hack. Much better system, also many payout options and low threshold.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:31:00
But the people who lost their funds by keeping them in their nicehash wallets will definitely learn a lesson. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:40:30
I won't use them again unless they significantly lessen their payout threshold. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:17:52
an s7 would be profitable on slushpool at the current value of BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:27:29
That's how it's been for me on Coinbase with $100-300 weekly buys, maybe it's different on large amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:52:28
I'd be buying like a madman wanting an early retirement.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:10:01
I'm not going to lie, I bought coin years back to buy stuff off of darknet markets. Of course now that that is all in my past, I think about all those whole coins I wasted.

Every time I read decent by itself, I hear Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:09:24
Definitely can't get on Facebook without seeing at least one of his ads.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:21:17
I'd trade my testicles, I don't need any kids to share that money with. Plus it'll probably free up that area from sweat during the summer time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:45:36
I transferred last night at 8PM, the funds were in my trezor when i woke up at 5AM
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:59:39
I'll settle for being a bitcoinaire
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:26:13
Stock photography for crypto would be great
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:54:29
You could try mining a different crypto and converting to BTC. But you're better off using GPUs for that.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:03:24
You can mine alts and convert to btc using nicehash
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:27:32
If support falls, it could dip. But, you'll be okay in the long run
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:50:24
I can't remember the layout exactly, but they label your front camera as camera 1 and back camera as camera 2
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:59:07
Coinbase should release a statement pre fork, like they did for s2x
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:52:25
These dips already happen a day or two before payday
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:36:36
And how is this post any better?
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:25:51
I've had 6/7 day waits, and it stayed with the original purchase price
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:05:05
I came to say exactly this
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:54:37
you might have better luck using this [link](
if your on a pc, it'll send your associated phone number an sms message with a link to do an upload, and you can use your phone's camera settings to take the picture as opposed to their weird format.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:48:10
Genesis mining does what it says it'll do. But you are better off spending the amount of the contract on actual BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:22:25
You are essentially getting paid to view ads, they aren't actually mining. You can mine alts with your cell phone using the minergate app, tho.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:40:36
i've seen knockoffs on DHGate, but they seem to be somewhere in between the s7 and s9, tho.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:14:30
weird how it's supposedly pro-BCH, I definitely see the exact opposite here.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:43:52
Or you could read a few posts before posting
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:41:20
have you tried switching from front cam to back cam, i had the same problem and didn't see the option to switch cams at first.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:52:17
I was thinking of doing the same, right before the fork. It'll guarantee LTC price drop and btc rise for everyone else.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:10:38
S7s for $550 on DHGate, not sure how reliable the sellers are, but some have high ratings
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:35:03
Hopefully a year from now your outlook will be the polar opposite. "I'm so glad I got in when I did."
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:35:58
Don't listen to these assholes, you'll have $900.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:55:07
Sold at 7100, bought at 5600, sold at 6600... Hoping to buy back around 5200 or 7000 depending how it goes from here
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:27:12
in 20 years, you'll only need 1 bitcoin to be a bitcoinaire
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:03:37
Serious man, if you confuse K's for X's, that is.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:00:21
If your mining btc, s3... But if your using nicehash with your GPU mining alts and converting to BTC, you'll probably earn more than an s3 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:22:39
I hate that show, but any publicity is good.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:26:00
Coinbase buying is back up
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:43:08
Definitely after
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:30:47
It'll dip, but that dip could be lower than where it's at now
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:25:46
I'm currently in the year 2112. Although we can communicate electronically with the past, we still can not physically bring ourselves outside of our present and current time. 
We have come to warn you to HODL your BTC and LTC, and to not keep your funds on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:26:54
Yes, at 10090, missed the cheap buys
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:46:23
I'm thinking 88-8900
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:32:51
I'll sell you .01 BTC for it
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:52:50
Edit your post and make me look dumb

The first time I used a card, I had to wait... After that first wait it was instant from there on... But my limit per card is still low 150/week
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:05:21
It tells you upon purchasing that it'll take 7 days. Also, they have instant options when using credit or debit cards.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:32:01
So many grammatical errors.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:34:09
Crap, where do I get a Bitcoin account?
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:24:14
Buy limit is 200 per week per card, but if you link your bank account it's 2000 per week at first. But that option takes 5 to 7 days to show up in your account
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:10:04
Wait, so you killed John Lennon?
