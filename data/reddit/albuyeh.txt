It was like 7 or 8 years ago. How have I not 'learned my lesson'

Oh wow this is fantastic!

I severely underestimated how big they were as a company and thought $20 would be a big deal to them. Looking back I probably should have offered more.. at least $25 :)

Kris responded in the thread and I even [asked him for his PP]( but he never responded back.

MtGox also had 2FA and Yubikey. Look where that got them.

I've always enjoyed their sense of humor, even when they [shafted me](

I was thinking they would do my project for me. But I have no hard feelings over it.

How long will it be before he gets all 128k?

You may actually lose money or bring nothing to the mining pool. CPU mining only provides around 20Mhash/s AT BEST. With 20Mhash/s you get around ฿0.04 ($0.67)

I have installed ATI Catalyst but I did not see an option for "Cypress" and my GPU still does not show up in poclbm :(
@_date: 2011-06-14 16:40:44
.... Github does have the executable. Go to the main page of [GUI Miner]( [Here]( is the direct link to the download on GitHub
@_date: 2011-05-18 02:08:29
I installed the whole [software suite]( and the OpenCL Driver was included. Still nothing.
@_date: 2011-05-17 23:14:58
What is the Mhash/s on your build? You said you had the same GPU as me, right?
@_date: 2011-06-08 17:07:01


That is why I am asking
@_date: 2011-06-13 04:54:25
So if you are the one who found the block you still receive the same amount of BTC?
@_date: 2011-06-08 16:38:49
But wouldn't he lose his unprocessed transaction of 5BTC?
@_date: 2011-06-13 04:30:01
I wonder what would have happened if you bought bitcoins or withdrew the money
@_date: 2011-06-15 13:30:46
Regardless, you will only make like 0.05BTC per day.

I went on it earlier today and yesterday and I was getting proxy errors. Last time SilkRoad was down the price of bitcoin dropped (not as drastic, but it still went down).
@_date: 2011-05-18 01:01:47
I got 11.5
I cannot find the download to the opencl driver

1) I need a new hobby while I am on summer vacation
2) Using a PC with a 5870 that I already had + free electricity courtesy of my school = $$$. If BTC continues to climb then I will be in it for the long haul but as for now it is just nice to have extra income
3) 375 @ 900Mhz

Archive the file (zip or rar) and password protect it and store it somewhere you will always have access to.
You will still receive the payouts even if the client is off. The best way to check if you have received it is to check the blockexplorer for your walletID

I am fairly new to Bitcoin. Lets say I move my wallet.dat to a different location (and put it in a .rar file for example). What will happen the next time I receive Bitcoins.. will it recreate my wallet file?
@_date: 2013-02-15 01:37:53
I am definitely in!
