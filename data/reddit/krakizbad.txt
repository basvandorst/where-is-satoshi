Agreed. I did some decent trading in college with Yahoo finance.

More like rich parents bought him BTC and he said he mined them to...sound cool? Someone that was savvy enough to mine btc at that age wouldn't need to pay another kid to build a website. WTF kind of world do we live in and why wasn't it cool to be a nerd when I was a kid?

I think it's because it's an argument you would use against your mom to support btc. "What can you actually get with Bitcoin?" And then you can casually say something grown up like sheets. Total opposite of the drugs and tech she might expect you to say.

Could be more depending on what state you're in.

Cold storage reduces the supply of available coins so it pushes the price up. Just like diamonds have value because most are locked away from the market.

An unregulated currency that allows you to transfer large sums of money anonymously.  That is attractive to criminals.

No, it's not the same thing. You are talking about the ability to survive in that instance. In this instance I'm talking about the appeal of high margin, low risk returns. I don't care if it attracts criminals. It is a new market with a huge potential profit legally and illegally. If you just ignore the fact it is extremely attractive to criminals and thus believe these crazy thoughts you may brag on a forum full of people ready to steal your $30k equipment. 
Bitcoin community is fucking obnoxious.

Reddit links don't provide google juice do they? I thought it just brought traffic. I'm no seo though.

Fuck Paypal.

Much prefer a long screw.

So will there be an increase in transaction fees at that point? 
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:23:30
Not if you're trying to shelter millions from taxes.

I would like to buy. I just emailed you from add. I don't have any coins in wallet at moment but will do whatever. Can you ship to Missouri? I'll pay for shipping of course.

Yes, there are criminals everywhere. Chill out dude. I support bitcoins. I also have a degree in finance. Trust me, there are aspects of bitcoins that make it more attractive to work with than cash if you are paying illegal activities.

This guy gets it.
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:42:37
I don't understand why coinbase never gets luv either. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:41:29
I guess that's the wrong terminology.  Maybe I mean who's going to hash the blockchain?
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:14:45
Sounds like a happy ending.

Avalon would be the only truly legit company followed by a tentative BFL?

Or someone that's married...

The ability to send wealth with little trouble is exactly why they like it. Try taking 100k in cash to Mexico vs sending 1,000 bitcoins. 
Now lets talk black market. I can't buy something online using $ without disclosing personal info to a 3rd party processor. With bitcoin I can. Anonymous transactions are very valuable to criminals. 
I'm not saying "don't use bitcoins because they attract criminals." I'm saying "use common sense because a lot of the things that honest bitcoin users like about bitcoin are extremely attractive to criminals."

Finally some legitimacy in the ASIC world.

Chat room trading.

This is probably what happened. The bitcoin community naturally attracts criminals.
