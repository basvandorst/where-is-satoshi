Exactly , let them play there game, and all u need to do is HODL,
but i must tell, if you are HODLing on a Tether exchange, better HODL them on your own wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:41:05
none of us "sardines" ..
Whales - market makers playing there game.....
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:37:46
Then.. look at the price 6 months ago! and find it was 1860$ ~
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:18:29
They are a few ppl market makers, they simply want it down now, i suspect its margin exchanges playing there own game to make profit of margin calls.
they will bring everything up again once there mission accomplished .
consider it a test for how long you can HODL.
simply allow them play there game, and stand still and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:45:33
iam here since so long, i dont like how we became after all man..
i was here in 2011. look good around .
why did the price go too high in 2017 ?
is it because of the better bitcoin we have now that we improved way too much than 2016?
and that Tether scam thing.. 
i wish we back to good old days when we was searching for ways to improve the technology and making it the fiat replacement, now all what u looking for is how much its in fiat, and forgot about the tech behind it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:02:42

@_date: 2017-12-17 10:08:32

where is the audits that says where the money of usdts coming from, could be mafia / laundering money . 
could be just fake numbers to pump the price then sell on legit exchanges then show u the $ in bank account. Show me the audits of 2016 till now i will agree with u ;D

i Sold 90 btc ... &gt;&lt;!
feel sad i didnt sell at 650~.. but i think its better to short now.. than regret it later... i advice all who has fears and panic.. to just sell and wait when all settle down and auction done. then buy later, it would be win in my theory.
good luck for all.

@_date: 2017-08-17 00:22:55
First of all, i want say bitcoin changed my life for the best.
i have been in bitcoin since it was 15$, and i know HODL long term Is the Best .
But, lets think a lil wicked :
How would Govs damage Bitcoin,?
i would say, let them buy buy buy and get the price very high and let alot of ppl see how bitcoin is going up so fast that u dont wanna miss the train of ur life.
lot of ppl will buy.
govs will pay small fraction compared to it..
and then keep selling suddenly, get alot of ppl burnt and that will be also on the news.
but i see that might just slows it down..
bitcoin is here to stay...untill supercomputers &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:47:35
But i see it as a group pump/dump its managed by someone i would suspect its the exchanges them self ;D,
wait untill one exchange comes out with a drama that will fk everything up.. just like gemini atm..
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:56:41
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:50:47
Just PS iam not trying to make fud or spread fear..
just take care this isnot normal !
if u are going to day trade  or cant HODL long term then at least dont sleep the next 3 days :D
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:50:13
oh well i called it first :/
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:42:07
I wonder how does it feels for who bought at 4170 ..and the same for the one who sold there !
Congrates to the ones who made profit, and better luck next time for who lost.,.. u never a loser with Bitcoin for the long term
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:53:13
Thank you , in fact i did with reasonable profit.
and iam waiting for the next dip i will let that one out. iam satisfied with the gains.good luck for all waiting 4800~

@_date: 2017-08-14 23:49:49
You Called it Right my friend :D
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:51:07
well, not only that :D
the whole order books on almost all exchanges behave the same time, moving orders up or down and wash trading between that moves. its easy to see it. if wasnot for the washtrading bot it would be dead ----------------- 
no one can deny the manipulation , unless you are benefiting of it.
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:12:41
Exactly, and Get Ready they will delete this Thread :D..
they dont like to talk about tether here.
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:20:44
now back to the stage they are laughing at u :/
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:17:35
Yes i agree! its all in the hands of market makers!
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:19:15
Tether / bitfinex gone. would bring back the faith 
but that should take some time.

Thank you Tether, pomb it
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:45:56
Agreed it doesnt matter where did that money come from, or if they issue tethers and buy crypto then sell then deposit the money in bank then say its there :D..
no problem if the money in the accounts is drug money or whatever .
keep the pumping machine going plz :D
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:05:37
well done, u win a toy lambo like the rest

Iam so disappointed with bitfinex! Market Manipulations at its best.
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:04:42
i would sell it and wait for the great dumb and double them and give it back to u ;) and have my profit hehe
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:37:58
if u feel the selling was normal/nature then yea its time to sell more to come..
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:34:20
and btw its not only happening in bitfinex, its happening with almost all exchanges.. but its head is bitfinex, bitstamp and gdax also got the same but on a lil smarter way, they add many random numbers in order books and move it just the same way u saw it with bitfinex today. you can see it more clearly if you use site like : 
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:30:58
its the pump before the bigger dump :D
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:58:19
that was happening all the time,, but today they aggressively shown their face..
spoofing/wash trading.. pushing the price with fake volume untill the pigs get in then they get slaughtered
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:36:45
There were to many shorts. If the price would fall one more time the exchanges would be probably insolvent.
they had to liquidate some ppl margins as they were short, then they will dump it after getting there money =D The house still always wins
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:48:12
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:23:37

no offense but..Good luck Trading, i bought some here, and will buy more at 6k!

@_date: 2018-03-31 17:32:31
yes the volume is too low when they stop the bots...that to show you the reall volume vs the bot volume, 
still they are not smart enough to make it look more normal . it starts usually at 2am GMT and 10am gmt .
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:07:54
ppl closing there shorts. and others geting margin called !

working now..
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:41:36
 i Agree!
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:41:09
Totally agrees. the purpose of the charts drawing bleh bleh.. is takeing the money from your hand if ur not holding for deer life. and to liqudate all margin traders short/longs both gets liqudated in same hour u will have both partys margin called. that swings are upnormal and created in purpose , i beleive its the exchanges all together playing it super dirty . Bitfinex is no1 and then all usdt margin exchanges . that bot works like a maniac placing buy/sell orders and moving the price easy. lots of wash trades. bitcoin is not like it was used to be or supposed to be. price is totally f*k3d .20% of ppl are good wining but the majority are losing.

sorry to disappoint you , the game is to liquidate margins Shorts/Longs are getting rekt. so it's better to think who is winning out of this shit after all?

even worse, more of ppl went into hype in a bull run now they meet the bear market its going to be crazy times ahead.
and to clarify for some ppl who see the current spike to 3200 after the low 2970.. these are exchanges eating shorts..
more simple, ppl short all there money that bitcoin will keep going down, exchanges wont wanna lose for u. so they drive price up high to close all that shorts and take ur money , then they drive it back down as fast.
the house always win.

Buying was just in the one huge 1H Candle, why did it stop now then? and back to the old volume..!
they made an insane 1hr Volume in all exchanges, liquidated big players. now back to the regular volume.
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:55:13
Iam not sure if that already exist but we should think more focused on how to make it as simple to send / receive for non bitcoin Friends/ppl...
how can we do it?
Waiting your ideas
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:23:39
Super.."formalize a protocol where one wallet sends an SMS that is actually processed by the receiving wallet asking it to SMS back an address for you to send the BTC too."
so i give my vote with you , we need something like that..
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:51:15
Thats good! but what is your suggestions of making it more simple... Regarding that almost all mobiles got internet nowdays.
i want an android wallet that can send and receive bitcoins to/from any mobile numbers. Coinapult.com sounds good as a start but i think it needs more like an app on mobile. 
and if it can rely on blockchain and internet + sms only.
each wallet is like the electurm on my desktop...!
instead of sending to btc address send to mobile numbers.
