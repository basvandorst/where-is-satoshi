Block height means how high (in number) the blocks have reached. There are other meanings for the word height, besides a measure of vertical length. Which may have been your point but you didn't clarify that.

Well, to be clear, I'm saying... Bitcoin... the "concept" is great... and it was a great alpha. Now we need to move on to the beta stages and unfortunately, Bitcoin isn't in the beta plans.
I know a number of altcoin devs and I have seen many, interesting evolutions of blockchain tech that attempt to correct Bitcoin's shortcomings. One will eventually make it to the top.

You must be new here (Earth)... Whale has been used in numerous things, even pre-digital/internet-age. And waaaay before Reddit.
A whale is a deep pocketed player in poker.
A whale is someone that buys their way through a video game's levels.
A whale is someone that makes a big splash in stocks.

I only support bitcoin, so people will hear about cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin's future is limited, there are too many flaws in it. Like anonymity... what a joke that is.
Blockchain technology on the other hand, is potentially here to stay, for a while (at least in digital years) and there are many other schemas of altcoins that are much better implemented than bitcoin.
So, bitcoin, is a gateway to the future, but not the roadway.

I'm curious, how does the unbanked get out of their bitcoin to pay rent, car mortgage, util bills... without a bank, which is the KYC requirement for every BTC to fiat exchange.

Sure, I've heard the tales of bots trading on MACD... but I can't imagine someone being that lazy to depend on MACD for bot trading cryptos.
There are so many better indicators that aren't lagged as badly as MACD.

Hoarding is a MASSIVE problem and exacerbates the issue of volatility.

How about skepticism from those that know how markets are manipulated, how important the SEC is to stock... and the fact there is no such thing in bitcoin, creates a large risk of price failure.

Has to deal with the industrial revolution and start of the consumerist economy.
ie, basically the govts (all of them) are so far behind on current tech, there's no way they'd make it past the learning curve to learn bitcoin. And then they lose control of their populace. It's hard to keep people broke and destitute if they have easier access to a means of wealth movement.

Months of chaos if transformers blow en masse. At some point, current (limited) supply of transformers will be used up and then we have to wait for the production element... which will be hindered by no power, because re: transformers.
So, literally, the first transformers would have to go to supply grid power to the production plants to make more transformers.

That's what I've been saying for a while, three types of news when it comes to a market, no news, good news and bad news. And Bitcoin isn't even twitching on 'good news', bound to go down on bad news... that leaves the only type of news to hope for, which is no news.

It's hard to fund an uprising with no money.
A broke populace is a quiet one... they are held subservient to the almighty dollar (or whichever local currency) and can't ever take the briefest moment off from work to even meet in collusion to rise up against the govt because then they would be homeless when they come up short in pay. 
I mean, most people have to work 2-3 jobs just to make living wage, 12-14 hr days... when are you going to meet to form an anti-government group?
Rich people aren't anti-government, because it's the govt that made them rich.
It's a rather perfect system.

You don't know how Bitcoin works...
the million dollars would be worth more on the short term, because there is no way to liquidate that much without depressing the market.
IN fact... investing that million dollars over the time it would take you to safely cash out one million bitcoin, you'd probably have more with good ole USD.

But otherwise... 
1) Why can you not believe chip level? That's where all bitcoin has been at, it would have been more remarkable to bring this to commodity computing, as a baked OS with all the goodies in..., then give it away, GPL and provide support and customization at a price. 
2) Not really a cool business, instantly reeks of taking advantage of people
3) Only a few people in this world? PUHLEEZE, talk about false narrative. Like everyone going ape over Ahmed, when there are literally 1000's of more deserving young innovators. There are inventors with at least this level of innovation in nearly every community in the country. 
4) I wonder how this will develop, is honestly the line that flipped the switch to shill for me. 100% like a hype line.
