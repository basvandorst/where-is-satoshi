Dude you can't win this battle. These people love hating Trump more than they love living. The whole point of the US is that the president shouldn't have influence, yet here are all the liberals talking about him non-stop. Freedom is what made America the most powerful nation on earth not the leader of the country.

The thing is the other alts are going to run into the same problems as Bitcoin when they get to the same size.

With this logic can you explain to me how ethereum is not a scam aswell? Enforcing the rules by smart contracts is impossible in the physical world.

Maybe it's a halfway religion sort of thing. They actively lie to themselves as it is more beneficial than the alternative.
Having Buterin, the nerdiest of nerds, who relate to those who find crypto interesting might have been a huge factor in ethereum being as big as it is.
It's actually a little hilarious.
