I'm with you on this one - what's ironic is that this is a term used by people who are most likely themselves subject to their own definition.  As you point out, there is no reason more traditional words can't be used like 'hurt', 'upset', or 'shamed' unless of course there's an insecurity being compensated for.

Housing, feeding, and educating tens of millions of people doesn't happen overnight. You've got to think about the people they're trying to turn into skilled workers. Workers that can compete in a global marketplace. Anyone over 20 when the revolution happened has pretty limited potential given they don't even have a high school level education. To develop the caliber of worker who can design a microprocessor or build a crypto-exchange will take at least a generation or two.
Until then, the only thing they have to offer developed countries are their resources which is exactly what they've been doing. Mainly oil, but also steel, aluminum, fish, copper, fertilizers, etc have provided the money they need to lift the population up. Some people try to paint these social programs as irresponsible, but the idea has always been to use them to jump start the economy.

The Venezuelan constitution says that Maduro is a murdering dictator? Are you dyslexic?


No I don't. The US has been attempting regime change since 2002, and has a history of doing this in other Latin American countries going back to the 70s at least.


For the record, the opposition represents less than a third of the country. It's basically the wealthiest people throwing a tantrum because they'd prefer the surplus wealth of the country go to them instead of everyone.

Venezuela is still using oil exports as a crutch to jump start social and economic development and therefor is much more vulnerable to economic sanctions. Don't forget that Chavez took power specifically to bring millions of people out of poverty and educate them so that one day Venezuela can have a robust and self-reliant economy. That was the reason he nationalized the oil industry, to use the country's natural resources to develop the country rather than to further enrich the oligarchs. Now the US is trying to pull out the rug before the process is complete so they remain beholden to imperialist countries.

I've only mentioned him once. I think you might be confused as to who you're responding to.
But anyway, "authorizing foreign military missions within the country" (article 187) is not the same thing as "the power to authorize an invasion". Even if it were, they'd still only have the power to permit an invasion, not to order one.
And regardless, it's super disingenuous to pretend that the Constituent Assembly wrote that article so that it could be used to destroy the very government they had just ushered into existence, and that the result would be the complete opposite of everything that they stood for. The National Assembly in it's current form is nothing more than a foreign coup attempt by legal means.

As someone concerned about our current paradigm of infinite growth on a finite planet, I welcome research and experimentation with negative interest economics. Charles Eisenstein discusses the basic idea in [chapter 12]( of his book 'Sacred Economics'.  Also pretty interesting is the [Freicoin]( project which implements a [demurrage](
@_date: 2015-11-01 21:58:12
Again, I'm not an expert, but my understanding is that demurrage and inflation are complementary aspects of the same underlying cost. So say you have both in effect and decide to get rid of demurrage: the inflation would then increase by an amount corresponding to what had previously been absorbed by the demurrage. Likewise, you could continue to increase the demurrage until no more inflation exists.
It's a matter of choosing to pay as much of the cost as possible with demurrage (negative interest) since it's effects are marginally better than dealing with the inflation.
@_date: 2015-11-01 21:27:52


Not an expert but I'm not sure this is entirely true - savers just have to invest their money to counteract the negative interest. If you want your money to retain it's value over time then you have to put it to work.  The 'store of value' aspect of money has never been free, today we end up paying that price in the form of inflation.
From the demurrage wikipedia page:


So basically negative interest economics just means that we acknowledge the cost of treating money as non-perishable up front which has advantages to the alternative of inflation.

Hmm, crypto-js is embedded in the repo as a submodule so you probably need to tell git to get it.  Sorry, I don't use git submodules regularly and I'm not sure how to automate fresh checkouts.  Ideally all third party code would be pulled in by something savvy to dependency chain attacks.
Try this:  
    git submodule init src/crypto-js

I've considered doing something like this myself but it's not clear to me whether there's enough money in helping local businesses accept bitcoin.  Right now most small businesses aren't clamoring for it so you've probably got a lot of door-to-door selling to do.  For the amount these business would probably be willing to pay I'm not sure this would be profitable unless you did really high volume.

For js developers interested in BIP38 functionality in a more general form I recently migrated some of this work done for *bitaddress.org* into a fork of *bitcoinjs-lib* [here](  Thanks to bitcointalk users scintill and Zeilap for the original implementation and casascius for putting up the bounties!

Bitcoin isn't static, but as with any technology the more it's used the more reluctance there is to change it.  Each update to bitcoin is risky and each time a change is proposed the utility gained must be weighted against the likelihood of a mess.  Those with stake in bitcoin have something to protect, and you'll meet with resistance each and every time a new feature is added.  We've already seen this most recently with the BIP 16/17 debate.
Even if you could put everything you wanted into bitcoin, would you really want to?  There seems to be a mentality that there's always a 'best' of something, a silver bullet, one coin to rule them all.  In the end you're left with just one tool which can never fulfill every use case.  Instead, I'd advocate for a multitude of cryptocurrencies, each with it's own strengths and weaknesses complimentary to existing chains, and all able to work together.
This is also why I don't think we have to worry about a serial adoption process, where as better coins appear people clamor to ditch the current one.  Instead, the complimentary nature means that existing coins remain valuable despite new coins coming on the scene.

Great thought - I think your sentiment is shared by many of us excited about the society-altering potential of technologies like bitcoin.  If the blockchain is able to achieve distributed consensus on the matter of spending authority, as it does with bitcoin, then it's surely robust enough to handle other schemes like a system of appreciation, voting, smart property, etc.
On the non-technical side the real challenge for a system of appreciation is getting people to want to "give away" their money for something they're not forced to buy.  The thing is you want appreciation to be cheap to give yet carry real value for the recipient.  True appreciation is free to give, "minted" out of thin air each time someone does something that pleases us, but it also doesn't carry any value other than maybe making the recipient feel warm and fuzzy.  So we try to fix this by making appreciation redeemable for bitcoins but this now means appreciation can no longer be created for free, placing a limit on the amount of appreciation one can give based on the the bitcoins they have to draw from.  You see the paradox.
One example of creative thinking bitcoin technology is the *Freicoin* project.  They've built a currency just like bitcoin but with a 5% demurrage which has all sorts of socioeconomic benefits that I half understand.  I'd recommend checking out the [Freicoin project site](

I was looking at some work done by Intel, UW, and UMass researchers which they call the NFC-WISP (*Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform*).  They're using a microcontroller from the MSP430 family and one version [incorporates an e-ink display]( which could be great for a hardware wallet.  [Some other folks]( have shown that ECC signing is viable on a UHF-WISP (the predecessor to the NFC version) though they didn't try it with the *secp256k1* curve.
They plan to open source the project soon - as a fellow researcher they'd probably give you early access.

Almost.  There are two transactions but they deposit to and withdraw from a 2-of-2 multisignature address which is actually what provides the guarantee you're asking about.  Here's my understanding of how it works:
1) Payer sends coins to a multi-signature address which requires both the payer and payee to agree in order to touch the funds.  This is TX1.
2) A new transaction (TX2) is then agreed upon by both parties (but not broadcast) with the purpose of distributing the funds secured in step 1.  At first this transaction sends all the coins back to the payer since they haven't made any micropayments to the payee yet.  This transaction is given a 'locktime' which means it doesn't go into effect until a later date.
At this point the payer has made a deposit in such a way that neither party can touch the coins without both agreeing to it.  The payer is also guaranteed back any unspent coins without the payee having to explicitly issue a refund (when TX2 reaches it's locktime).
3) Micropayments are then made when the payer revises TX2 to reflect the new payment, resigns it, and gives it to the payee.  The payee then adds an output sending the remainder (their portion) to themselves and verifies all signatures.
So back to your question - the reason the payee can be assured the coins haven't been double-spent is because the funds were locked up by TX1 in step 1.  This transaction *does* hit the blockchain in order to transfer the coins to the special multi-signature address in the first place.  Because both parties must agree to spend from this address we know the coins will be there later, and the payee can count on TX2 being redeemable without actually broadcasting it.

Just tried to clone a fresh copy of the fork and I think I know the problem.  Crypto-js 3.x contains some significant changes so I opted to upgrade to the 2.x branch.  Problem is, I don't think I had the submodule configured correctly (they're tricky!) and it was pulling the 3.x code instead of the 2.x on *git submodule init/update*.
Just committed a small change that should fix this but you'll need to re-init/update your submodule.

BIP38 is specifically designed to encrypt Bitcoin private keys and itself is not applicable to encryption of more general data.  Under the covers though, BIP38 uses cryptography that could be used for securing something like a normal text file in a manner more resilient to brute force attacks.
The encryption used by BIP38 is one of the most standard and widely used methods of encrypting data - AES - but BIP38 keys are harder to brute force because your password is first run through what's called a 'key derivation function' - in this case 'scrypt'.  Scrypt is resource hungry be design so that if someone does attempt to guess your password they'll need to run this expensive function on each guess, thereby making the process slow and costly.  What sets scrypt apart from most other key derivation functions is that it not only needs lots of CPU time but also lots of memory.  This means that CPUs would have to become much faster *and* memory much cheaper for a brute force attack to be viable.
So in short, you can't password-encrypt a text file using BIP38 but you could do so with scrypt+AES to get the same advantages.

It's being used to facilitate bitcoinj's newest feature - micropayment channels.  Since a naive bitcoin micropayment implementation would spam the blockchain, bitcoinj circumvents this by first locking up some bitcoins from the payer in such a way that signatures are required from both payer and payee in order to spend.  Then, as micropayments are made, the transaction determining how much the payee gets is renegotiated continuously and without being broadcast.  It's because the coins are first secured using 2-of-2 signatures that the payee knows they cannot be double-spent despite never including the revised version of the transaction in a block.
@_date: 2013-06-14 19:12:08
Bitcoin itself won't be doing much for our environmental situation.  In fact, since it's based on electricity hungry mining you could argue the opposite.  Also, one of bitcoin's biggest strengths is doing business over large distances and doesn't really encourage local spending per se.
I do think that *cryptocurrencies* in general could enable some of the things you're referring to.  Now that money is just software we can make the rules whatever we want them to be.  I for one would love to see an altchain that focuses on repairing our disconnect with nature.

I'm with you on this one.  When it comes to simple cryptocurrencies like bitcoin I can see how an identity system needlessly encroaches on privacy.  That said, as a developer I also see a lot of promise for other applications - things like voting which really do need a way to make sure people are who they say they are.
I think the negative sentiment in here is understandable but let's not hinder progress entirely due to one particular fear.

Blockchain *consensus* doesn't necessarily imply 'majority rule' semantics.  With voting the consensus is simply everyone agreeing on the final vote count.  Whether majority is used to decide the outcome of the voting process is up to you.  A voting blockchain would let everyone agree on the global list of valid votes, just like it lets bitcoin users agree which coins are valid and spendable.

I think the best route is to store your 'savings' in an address locked by n-of-m keys.  Print out a bunch of keys and scatter them - in your attic, at your best friends, in a safety deposit box, etc.  For the thief to take your money they'd have to compromise more than one.  The trick is picking good values for 'n' and 'm' to make sure that it's hard work for the thief to get all necessary keys, but also robust in case some of the keys are stolen, destroyed, or lost.
You might even have a special wallet service that stores a copy of one of these keys.  Unlike regular wallets which are always available, this one would require advanced notice, say 24 hours or even a month, before the wallet is retrievable.  This makes it difficult for the thief because they'd have to babysit you while waiting for the release of the key they'd need to take your money.  Not a bad idea actually... let me know if you're interested in collaborating.
