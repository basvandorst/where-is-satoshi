The system we have now is incredibly fucked. Say you get stabbed and the ambulance takes you to the nearest hospital. Oh sorry, your insurance doesn't cover it. Now you owe us $40,000. Tough luck bud.

It is, but these wild periods of instability make it difficult to use BTC as a currency, sadly.

Their faults for not examining the chart. The moon growth speed is almost always followed by correction.

How is there no demand? By federal law, banks cannot operate with Marijuana businesses. How these guys are getting away with it, I'm not sure, but I doubt it'll last with Sessions as AG.
BTC, on the other hand, could prove to be incredibly useful for a service like this, especially if backed by BitPay, Circle, or something of the sorts behind the scenes.
Edit: And even if delivery services don't need it, dispensaries or growers could still find BTC useful.

Apparently you can add money to your USD balance now, wait for it to arrive, and then buy bitcoin instantly at that price. I'm still miffed, but I guess it will have to do.

At that point it'd be cheaper just to buy BTC on Coinbase, with the lowest purchase price on LBTC being $822. I know that Coinbase is getting all buddy buddy with the IRS, but that's not an issue for me. I'd like to just have a seamless way to buy BTC from my bank account, honestly.

So you can buy BTC instantly, but can't take it out of your account until the transfer clears? I'll have to check it out; thanks!

Ulbricht should have a retrial, but not a pardon.

I sold a lot yesterday, but I'm holding what I have left. You're making the right choice in the long run.

All places the government should have less involvement except possibly prisons, which should never be private.
However, I believe it was absolutely necessary for internet telecom companies to be scheduled as common carriers by the FTC and forced to uphold Net Neutrality. The alternative was fucked.
