your not forced to - just don't allow that option on - but when we introduce withdrawals don't complain when you need to create new keys, jeez! - its hard to please everyone!

Happy to deal with complaints :) - We are simply developing an application which is utilising functionality provided by Bitstamp - i.e their api.  I don't think its fishy at all.  Bitstamp are clearly confident in the security of their api and whether its withdrawal, buy, sell or cancel its all through the same  api. We're just trying to provide a feature that we are confident most people want.  You have a choice  to use it or not.  If you want it , its now available.  You also have an option to not set the withdrawal option.  we will make this more clear to users so to avoid confusion.  thanks for pointing it out to us

the only reason is because we are working to introduce the feature to send bit coin to a bit coin address,  this option is required for this.  if we advise users to set this option now then when we release the feature it will automatically be available to existing users,  otherwise they will need to generate new keys.  You'd probably complain later if you had regenerate your keys.  theres no middle ground for us here

Its part of bitstamps api that you can send bit coin to another party .  its not a feature used in the app but at some point it was being considered

It sure is - go and have a look on the store,  try the app if you like.

Good idea - I'll consider that too - maybe just add them to the same app
