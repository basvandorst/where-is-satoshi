upvoted because you made me zoom all the way in just to be sure it was what I thought it was.

Hello there, I think you dropped this "/s".

I personally would not leave or use my coins in a third party system during such a transition, especially if I do not understand how they are supposed to protect them during that time.
Bitcoin is/was supposed to be a trustless system. Adding trust to the mix is going to yield strange, unexpected and likely bad results.

So they seize your coins but will let you gamble over which of the two can come out on top? Fair enough, I guess.

Interesting. How are they going to accomplish that?

Careful, since you could be spending both coins at the same time. This is because B2X deliberately chose not to implement replay protection. Best thing to do will be to hold your coins and wait for the dust to settle.

AFAIK, because GPU mining is memory intensive, and there is little economic incentive to simply add more memory to a GPU as it would be cost prohibitive to do so.

So you bash on libertarians and then promptly refuse to debate with one. Wow.

Because it fits his narrative.

There's even bigger retracements in Bitcoin history. It's only a crash for those who bought at the top.

You eventually have to pay network fees, such as when closing a LN channel.

You mean that LN is taking the brunt of the small transactions? Is there a place where this can be seen/measured?

I personally do not want moon. I want to be able to control my own wealth.

That last sentence is what most people fail to see and I couldn't agree more with.
I wish other countries would have the liberties that most American people take for granted and even worse, are willing to sacrifice based on emotional decision-making (The worst kind IMO).
