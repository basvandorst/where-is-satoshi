I'm holding firm. This weekend will be spectacular for Bitcoin cash.

I lost $25,000 due to that over the past 3 days, simply because I couldn't buy or sell when I wanted to. I attempted to sell a bunch of BCH at $2,200 with a market order, because it was dropping too fast for me to set a limit price. once I placed the order, 10 minutes passed and it filled at $1,502. Good job you fucking asshole thieves! "best price possible" What a joke

Use the money and gamble at the casino. Just make sure they comp you a free roast beef meal, when you lose your ass.

It is the right time to invest in crypto currency, but not Bitcoin. People are hypnotized into believing it will reach hundreds of thousands of dollars, but the only thing driving that is speculation. Bitcoin cash, or any of the other altcoins have much better technology. Do not waste $8,000 on a single coin. Buy 8 Bitcoin cash tokens, and triple your money, then if you'd like purchase a Bitcoin with $16,000 extra in your pocket.

Haha, you'll never have that. The fact the you're buying a Bitcoin in the hopes that it'll afford you that someday is sad.

It's fake bull shit. By the time two weeks rolls around, Bitcoin will be trading at under $1,000. CME will have to rename it to "Bitcoin Cash Futures Division".

Sell, Sell, Sell!!!

I respect your foresight for getting in back then. I have a cancelled Coinbase order for Bitcoin from 2013 when it was 1,000. It dropped to nothing that year. I should have dumped 100k into it. I remember in 2009 my friend was mining Bitcoin in his studio apartment. Tons of missed opportunity. I truly believe it doesn't matter what people are vested in. Most of it will be much, much more valuable than it is today.

I was fortunate enough to purchase 217 BCH @ $289, and then sell them for $2,714, last night. I would feel like an absolute fool, if I was this guy who bought 1 BTC for $7,546 last week. Not a snow ball's chance in hell it ever reaches those levels, again.
