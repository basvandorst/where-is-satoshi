Hey mate. Sorry that you didnt get a reply. Your card and money are both safe. As we mention on the site "We aim to process orders once a week." "Delivery of the physical card takes 2-3 business days for European residents and 1-2 weeks for other countries, though this may vary depending on the number of orders and the local post services."
I will look for your email and respond back with the details. Thanks for your patience.

The slack channel is open for anyone to join. Not sure what you mean with the Google form. It has been an automated link for nearly a year:

I think you are missing the point here by a long shot. I dont mean to over step your comment or dismiss it. The point is that regular people are looking for ways to overcome regulations and are hearing about projects like bitnation who offer such a service. From my personal experience the average Joe has no idea what bitcoins are - and the ones that do just keep talking about its fiat value or "ah thats that online money thing, isnt it", let along the services that the blockchain have made possible or even better the name of such a service. I mean even in conferences i have a hard time finding highly informed people, and that is in a bitcoin based conference.

The platform has already been launched. Last we heard they were considering using other blockchains.

I believe that given the platform is targeted to US traders as well as Wall Street the language issue should not be an issue.

Overstock uses the same style on their website:

Do you reckon that is the case? I read even the FBI had advised people to pay it. If they didnt go through with what they said, it would be all over and they wouldnt make any money. Can you link me to where you read this?

Thanks for sharing the link.

Each bitcoin transaction has a unique Transaction ID which would verify the payment. Im going to look into it, if they do not have a method of verifying i would be very concerned. Then how can people pay them and if dont hold their end of the deal, then noone would be willing to pay them.

haha just wanted to be succinct. Cheers mate. Yeh its very stupid on their behalf. It was stolen from the NSA as well. I cant believe the best they can do is to tell people to pay it. In their view i guess $300-$600 is not worth their time.

Yeh youre right, someone could claim the txID beforehand. It would make sense if they generated a new BTC address for each attack. I really need to look into this more. Thanks mate.

“The ransomware is that good,” said Joseph Bonavolonta, the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s CYBER and Counterintelligence Program in its Boston office.  “To be honest, we often advise people just to pay the ransom.”
