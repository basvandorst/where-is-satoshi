I’ve stopped using the historical data api and started storing tick data from the web socket on my own for processing. My data matches 1-to-1 with TradingView but still not the GDAX api (it used to).  So assuming we can trust the data from the websocket, TradingView is the correct data.

The OHLC data is not TOO inaccurate.... although there is an occasional wrong number. There is no trend for higher or lower.
I'm mostly concerned about the volume data... it's usually at least half, if not less, of the actual volume.

Isn't the weak point in Tor the exit nodes? Don't the people who run exit nodes take a risk in allowing any traffic through their host? Couldn't governments start cracking down on exit nodes for aiding criminal activities (if such activities were to occur)?

Once they create their own word for it so that it doesn't bastardize the French language, that's how you know we've won.

Hopefully. I don't mind paying taxes on gains, but I have no idea how I would be able to even calculate what's due unless I got some sort of tax form sent to me.

Are you trying to deposit via BTC address on GDAX? Like actually making a blockchain transaction? GDAX should show your Coinbase wallet balance and allow you to deposit immediately.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:03:37
Does Coinbase send 1099-B's? Or some equivalent?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:40:44
Not really. Price is still determined by other exchanges and is quickly adjusted within seconds of GDAX coming back up.

You're not using Bitcoin though, you're using Visa.

I was receiving the SMS codes fine last night. As of right now I created a new wallet with Google authenticator instead.

I'm not a lawyer but I believe it depends on how long you've had them.
If less than a year then it's like you just made an additional $8000 from your regular income and should be taxed at your income tax rate.
If &gt; 1 year it's a long term capital gain and taxed from 15%-23%, depending on your income tax bracket.
If you're really worried I would talk to a accountant or tax lawyer, not reddit.

I've been looking into ways to tell the market's being manipulated so that I can differentiate an actual upswing in the market, from a trader artificially raising the asking price to dump off their earnings at the highest rate they can. This helped a little... but I feel like there's way more tricks up peoples sleeves. Especially those with lots of money to throw around.

Go to: 
Then just select "Dwolla" for the "Pay from" field. Enter in your Mtgox acct # and ammount, then it will bring you to the Dwolla page where you can complete your transaction. All over the computer.

Did you buy it earlier when they were out of coins and said 'if you check this box you understand the coins will be purchased on friday at the fair market value'? Or did you buy just now that they seem to have coins again?
If you bought just now, you'll get them in a few days at the price that you bought them at right now.

You pay taxes for the realized gains. If you reinvest the $10,000 and realize a loss, you can offset that.

If they're accepting bitcoin they should quote the price in BTC, and optionally USD. But I guess we should take what we can get.

I've been scared since ~$250... That's why I sold my initial investment back at $300.
I'm all for bitcoin and I know it's continuing to be more valuable, but this kind of exponential growth can't be good. It happened before and we all saw how that ended.

I actually enlightened a group of new friends at a party the other day and they seemed interested (or at least they didn't laugh me out of town)
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:41:24
They live in a country where it's easy to transfer to/from MtGox... or they don't know any better.

I'm around the same as you buddy. Just started a wait for my Dwolla transfer too, didn't realize that would take so long...

There's short term gains and long term gains. Short term gains are treated as income and taxed at your income tax rate. Long term are taxed at 15%.

[Just took this now.]( Requested it a little earlier this morning, after my previous attempt was denied (after 15,000 people before me that time....) Oh and here's the kicker, they won't let me withdraw my BTC until I'm verified.
Edit: I should note that I sent their AML team a follow-up email saying that I reuploaded my ID, and I am now verified :D
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:46:43
I also used it today for Dwolla -&gt; mtgox (to get around verification) and it worked within 5 mins. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:08:48
Once your bank account is verified on Dwolla, you then have to transfer money from your bank account into Dwolla, which will take 3-4 days to clear. Then once that money is in your Dwolla balance, you can do step 2, and it will immediately deduct from your Dwolla balance and you'll see it on mtgox within 5 or so minutes.
I'm still pretty new to this too so I'm not sure if this is the best way, but it's what I did earlier.
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:57:49
Yeah, I would currently be 'locked out' but luckily I backed up my wallet last night.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:28:48
My original plan was Dwolla -&gt; Mtgox as it's the cheapest, but you need a verified account to do that. So I had to use bitinstant as a middle-man. Dwolla -&gt; bitinstant -&gt; Mtgox.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:58:22
It just shows in the top right of the home page.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:53:27
I'm waiting for mtgox to verify me.... 5000 to go...
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:18:56
I've only had my Dwolla account for a couple weeks. That was a pretty easy setup though, just had to verify my bank account via 2 small deposits, and then wait about 4 days for the transfer to go through. MtGox won't accept Dwolla without a verified account though, and I fucked up the first verification attempt, so now I'm trying again and I'm like 28,000 in the queue... so I just did bitinstant with dwolla
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:18:10
There was some option on bitinstant to do Dwolla -&gt; mtgox. I did that and it only took about 5 mins. They take something like 2% though.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:53:38
You shouldn't worry in the sense that you're in any kind of trouble. Coinbase has some method of determining 'high risk' transactions, to protect themselves. They will likely just cancel your order.

Everytime I mention dollar cost averaging it gets shot down by people claiming economists have time and time again proved that it isn't a good strategy. But I like it too.

I was actually thinking of stopping by there sometime since your shop comes up on Yelp if you search for 'bitcoin'. I don't think I'll be available during those hours tomorrow though :/
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:59:41
One/two people sell a large amount in a short period of time. This triggers a few bears to panic and sell as well. Also triggers trading bots to sell. All this selling fucks mtGox's platform in the ass, so general panic + the uncertainty of knowing if your trades will actually go through creates vicious cycle until people take a fucking chill pill and the price stabilizes again.
@_date: 2013-06-13 04:02:43
Bitcoin "price" is determined by what it is selling for on an exchange. The price could very well be different on different exchanges. For this reason, you will need to pick an exchange, and hope they have public APIs with live ticker data. MtGox does.
