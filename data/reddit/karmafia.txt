Good job IBM staffers. You jumped on that nice and quick.

We need a "make it rain" app for strip clubs. Now someone smart and industrious, go do it.

Wrong. The price is an indication of what people are willing to pay to buy in or out of the Bitcoin network from FIAT or other crypto currencies. It does not impact the capacity for the network to move greater or less volumes.

They work the price out based on what the market is offering for BTC generally speaking. I'm not sure precisely how each exchange calculates their listed price but I'm sure they monitor each other's listings in addition to other indicators. You may very well see the prices fluctuate slightly between exchanges but these usually self correct when some individuals take advantage of the prices differential to make a margin on arbitrage between exchanges. Also, it's in the interest of exchanges to reduce the likelihood of being caught by arbitrage by coming to a quick consensus on the price.

If we had $20 million in Bitcoin we could transfer it back and forth between each other's wallets all day long without any problem. Yes this would increase the volume of transfers on the network but it's not going to impact the price nor will the price impact our ability to make the transactions happen. I don't know where you're getting this idea of the price effecting the ability of the network to only transfer up to some capped amount on a given day. It's simply not true.

Again I don't know why price effects things, 'inside' the network or not. If I had $50 million in BitCoin and you were willing to exchange it for USD, gold, platinum or even chickens, I would simply transfer the Bitcoin to your newly created wallet and you would hand over the equivalent in whatever you were willing to exchange. Now you're in the network and if the price falls, sucks to be you, but it never hindered or curtailed our little financial arrangement.

They're trying to roil up some crypto currency programming talent from overseas to hire, potentially to feed the development of a rival blockchain technology but also because these new hires would make highly viable consultants in other areas due to IBM having many clients in the financial industry. It's a nice way to attract young talent that has the potential to become interested in 'serious' finance (as I would imagine IBM sees it). Also, I'd say IBM figures programmers from outside the US are more malleable to their corporate culture rather than hire from those influenced by the silicon valley mainstream who still sees them as dinosaurs.

And Bitcoin to be the innovation sandbox for the wider financial industry?

Some companies are great at putting out soundbites that hit a chord with their key growth demographic. Apple are insanely great at it.
