for example this: 
It begins with "Cryptocurrencies, sometimes called virtual currencies, digital money/cash, or tokens." But I read somewhere else that tokens and coins are different things. So, when I'm reading about tokens, I get confused.
And then the next question arises, where to go next from here.
By "economics," I meant everything. That's again not specific, I know, but that's exactly what I am not going for - I am going for broad in the cryptocurrency world.
There's a reason there are courses and books exist. They not only teach you basics first but also have this convenient button called "Next" to read the next recommended "chapter."

Every article? Wikipedia, Investopedia, etc.
I am simply a noob. And while articles are great, I think a step-by-step course is a much better way to learn for me.

But how can anyone with black money in physical cash buy bitcoin?

Government allowed the notes in few places like hospitals and such. And still, some of these places are not accepting, breaking real havoc.

It does nothing for bitcoin, I suppose.
People with white money will get their notes replaced with smaller currency notes through banks.
People with black money can't do that. And I don't know how they can turn all that physical cash into bitcoins.

Can't. They made the announcement at midnight. Right after that, the notes lost all their value instantly, except in places like hospitals, airports, etc.
