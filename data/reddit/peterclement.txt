Totally agree! I just joined the reddit and was trying to tip but didn't get it to work... I have about $0.04 (0.12000mBTC) in Changetip and want to tip forward. Let me try again with "all" the bitcoin I have...

Thank you so much. I got it to work but it seems that Changetip is having problem processing tips.
I will use the tip to fund my tipping forward.

50 bits Apologies for the relatively small amount- aiming to tip more people!
@_date: 2014-11-11 09:01:09
I will try to tip forward all I received.
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:00:59
Our efforts definitely not wasted. I will continue to tip every Tuesday!

A mother was giving instructions to her three children as she sent them into Sunday school, "And, why is it necessary to be quiet in church?" Her son quickly responded, "Because people are sleeping!"

I am new here. This is the most interesting reddit around! Just received $0.04 tip from fellow redditors. 
Trying out my first tipping following the changetip instruction. $0.01 ?

Excellent! I do tip everything I received back to the community.
@_date: 2015-05-02 04:17:54
Ha... I guess they are using outdated method. Glad the protective mechanism is working!

It seems the cart is moving backward... Is it only me?
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:09:38
I am not greedy- Maybe a nice house with 10 BTC...
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:18:32
It was $400+ a few months ago... This is just small fluctuation in price...
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:27:17
Yes I know. My heart and eyes are also on the chart!! Higher the expectation, bigger the disappointment!
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:52:14
Happy Birthday bitcoin! It is older than my daughter!

Thanks for the post. Are we expecting an Android version of the game being launch soon?
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:00:15
Thanks for introducing the App. Unfortunately I am using an iPhone. Are you planning an iOS version? I will definitely try it in future.

Thanks. Looking forward to using your iOS App!
