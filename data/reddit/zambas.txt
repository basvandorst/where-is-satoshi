okay people need to stop this bs. Portuguese here...
First of all this is not new, and it was all over the news back in Dec 2017. ~~The IRS~~ AT does not tax any capital gains on cryptocurrency except if trading is your **profession**. There is no legal way to tax outside that one condition simply because of the absence of regulations. Expect that to change sooner rather than latter as EU directives come into play.
There's also no legal way to tax income in the form of crypto, so if the company agrees to pay a portion of the salary in bitcoin it has to make a separate contract agreement outside the legal contractual taxable income.
This is a loophole, not a legalized thing.

Understand gold, silver and fiat. Once you're done with it you'll be able to spread the message.
Bitcoin is a unconfiscatable store of value not a get-rich-quick scheme so, ignore all who play that way.

Some banks block their clients from buying Bitcoin.
That's the point of Bitcoin: permissionless, trustless, borderless, censorship-resistant transactions on a distributed ledger.
Try the ATM option. People don't realize that Coinbase can't be trusted and they can (just like the banks) shut you out and lock your account.

It's a bit hard to have a precise price in a given date due to volatility. Best thing to do is find a decent portfolio tracker and manually input a buying price.

Deflation in currencies with no cap is bad. Does not apply to Bitcoin. Get it?
