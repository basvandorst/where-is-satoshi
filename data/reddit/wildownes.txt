Had you used chase bank they don't accept cash deposits from anyone but the actual account holders now.  (Making your transaction completely impossible but protecting you from reversal risk)  Just found this out  a couple weeks ago.  Teller said most banks will be following suit soon.    When the teller told me "its for your protection.... i thought how.... but now perhaps I see"

Here is where the hearings are webcasting from:   
I couldn't find the second part of todays in the archive but it should be there.    This youtube link has both of todays:
I'm sure there is a reddit about the first hearing already.  I just wanted to post speculative about 2nd day of hearing that happen in a few hours.

A thumbs up from Stanford Professor of Economics under oath.... I see so many quotes coming from her on the news this week its gonna be crazy
@_date: 2014-01-29 11:08:05
Yeah, I love what he's doing by releasing for pay digitally.  I was so happy to hear how well he did with the first one.   Was so risky to try with torrents and everything out there but he did it and made over a million dollars in 2 weeks from it.
If you haven't read this post from him its really interesting... and COOL that he just up and gave $250k to charity 
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:44:23
This is of interest to me as well.
Curious to hear a potential solution.   I think block time as a peg would be key.
Perhaps x amount of time after a block is created.    Allowing enough time for the block to be posted.... then say 1 hour after the posted time... This is assuming the blockchain does in fact have timestamps
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:18:38
Yes, i'm sure out of context we have all said something that made us the creator of bitcoin.    Well at least this guy is getting a free lunch right now on the press.

perhaps titling the post: *who has contributed to bitcoin the most* was misleading as i think we can all agree that the person(people) that created bitcoin would be the obvious winner.   I am more interested in finding out about the people that have not even hit my radar yet.
@_date: 2014-01-29 12:15:44
cool link!
I haven't heard anything about her yet.  IMHO I've yet to see someone that I believe has done proper research that doesn't give it the thumbs up after they understand it.   Hopefully she's done her homework.

ya.... i talked to her for a bit to make sure i understood because I only just recently stopped putting cash in my land lords account to pay rent.... I asked her clearly... so I cannot pay rent that way anymore.   She said not here.... and likely other banks will follow suit in the future

Yeah no prob.   was speculative "I see so many quotes coming from her"
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:24:24
if science was like the blockchain….. then pluto is a planet because it was named before the science protocol was changed. all "planets" found after "block" 2005 shall be correctly identified as minor-planets.
If we can't all agree on this protocol change the solar system will be forked and the value of all the planets will be compromised.

Thats exactly what i thought... doubling down....
And then... they say at the end of that: "Moreover, it encourages all to be respectful of the privacy and rights of the individuals involved."
But ultimately i agree with them... free speech/free market is best... she can say what she wants.... and the employees of that magazine can reap the rewards of going with a cover story that went from "unmasked" to "unlikely" with the power of only offering a free lunch.

I know they got to make money to keep going but won't the news be weighted to bitcoin positive news now considering they make money off bitcoin doing well?
