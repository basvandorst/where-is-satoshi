The intent of this bill is to provide clarification not to say that bitcoin exchanges can only be run by wealthy people. That was FinCEN, 2 years ago. You can't have been living under a rock that long... I'm just going to stop emphasizing the old news crap because you don't seem to be getting it. 
So here's another angle. I don't see why you're so fixated about California when there's other states, countries, trade conglomerates, planets maybe, with money services licenses that are $1000+ that you could be up in arms against. 
Yes things cost more in California ($5000), get over it, we're rich over here, people that live in section 8 housing should not be dicking around with bitcoin exchanges, I guess that is maybe discriminatory and unfair but at least it's ethical(like I don't invest in Microsoft with EBT). Then it becomes a case of, who cares, you're probably doing it wrong, and you'll end up in jail for other bad business practices before bitcoin is even mentioned in court. I could keep on ranting(I'll admit I kept getting offended but then I forgot about how extremely low-cost things, food, rent, taxes, were in other states and COL is just COL), but long story short, Californian's aren't unwealthy (relativity must be accounted) and let's get back to talking about other states etc mentioned earlier.

Guidance is powerful even if it's not law. You need licenses in all other states that require money transmission licenses if you want your exchange to run in states other than California. Some states don't require it so like it's free to run a bitcoin ATM in New Mexico. So like if you're licensed in California but not Florida, well you can't have any customers in Florida.

I already told you, we went over this, this is nothing new. If you are transmitting money on such a scale that a state level government will go after you (talking about lower limit $10k perhaps (I don't know why you would ball this low for a business)), then you already sought license(s) for being an exchange.


I just wanted to include that to make sure we are talking about the same thing.

If it is not money transmission then this bill does not apply to that business! Is that so hard of a concept to understand? If your startup is being wrongfully judged against the older Money Transmissions Act, you have the right to defend yourself in a court of law.

Dude I never supported the war in Iraq. I supported the war on terror. You can have religion without terror I know, this is a debate itself. To accuse Saddam on terror is another debate but I believe it prevent more than you think however that is immeasurable more that he's dead so I don't mention him or the past anymore... If the war in Iraq is defined as war on terror I could still debate that way I guess. In the original statement I said al quaeda, Isis, Boko haram which is more the issue when dealing with terrorism. It's just hard to figure out what you're asking. Best I could do is restate my original positions.

It doesn't matter who engineered what problem or how. We inherited this problem as citizens of this world and it is moral duty to solve it by all means. To think that non-aggressive solutions exist for groups with extreme ideologies as ISIS is just disingenuous to the civilians whose death toll is not stopping (on its own).
We cannot scrub the errors of our past and pretend as if there is never a problem. I wish we could but that is not how things work on the world stage.
