That's a very solid opinion based on assumptions. I do prefer the other subreddit because there are LESS violent reactions like the one you are making right now.
Either or, that doesn't really deny the fact about which coin has the superior tech. 
Have a good day r/Bitcoin.

Really?, the stupidly high fees are not profitable for ANY business in this planet, the fact that bitcoin has a really high value doesn't really make it a good currency. At all.

This is why you use localbitcoin and not shitbase

I don't represent any subreddit. I just prefer good technology, and BCH is.

Good luck moving your BTC to BCH when the price explodes, may take a day for the transaction to complete when all hell breaks loose.
Im not wishing bad upon anyone. And I don't represent any subreddit. I just prefer good technology, and BCH is.

Could you elaborate on the satoshi/byte thing?
@_date: 2017-02-19 01:45:44
Oh. Ok, makes sense that people want to process the ones that will get them more money
Thank you for the explanation!

I made a deposit using coinbase more than 4 hours and still nothing. It never takes this much.

In other words, if I keep my coins on the same address and I touch nothing then i lose nothing.
How long will the chain take to completely die in order for me to safe at transferring funds?

How do I get to understand it?
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:07:54
I see. Ok, so, as I ask the other guy, is BCT technically superior to BCH?, will we be in better hands (fees, transaction time, etc) if we stick to BTC instead of BCH in 10 years from now?

Thank you for the information, really appreciated.

Is that the one happening in November?, how bad things could go and why?
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:39:51
You welcome :)

I do consider that big chinese exchanges closing business just around the corner may be a big deal
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:49:02
Given the safety of bitcoin, how come it could be not safe to transfer high amounts directly to your wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:01:13
"Ideally"? I mean.. maybe my question is, is BTC technically superior than BCH?, will be better for those of us who have bitcoin to hodl to BTC instead of BCH in say.. 10 years?
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:53:28
Serious question: if that is the case, why do the BCH investors defend that BCH follows the original vision of this Satoshi guy? like, honestly, that doesn't sound to me like an "anyone can do that" ideology. Specially if he is the creator of bitcoin to begin with.
Edit: I mean, am not the smartest guy around, but that last part sounds like "it just has more value", whereas the BCH people defend the potential of BCH in technical levels in the long term. Am I wrong in this one?
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:47:20
If you get an answer, let me know :)
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:45:58
I don't think he has a long list of reasons to close accounts when requested to do so
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:21:27
Selling more will get it lower. I don't honestly get the downvotes. 
People shouldn't be scared of a safe risk.
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:32:56
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:23:31
And its down again, and it wont stop till the 1st. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:50:50
POCKING INTENSIFIES.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:24:24
A little volatility can't count as "recovering", this will continue until the 1st for sure
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:58:52
If we all sell we accomplish a greater good for those of us who want more. I just can't see the next time we will have a chance like this on this particular price range. Is now or never.
