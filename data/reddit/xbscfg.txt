I think its going to be opposite: benefits &amp; wealth gotten by Bitcoin usage in CIS should overweigh Russian totalitarism.

This problem itself isn't enough. If it would give me opportunity to watch videos offline, then I would pay for that, everytime I watch, because its solving the problem of tipping &amp; playing videos whenever I want.
Also if I'd have offline search, then I could build download queue for videos when I'm out of internet coverage.

yes I did, still didn't found any reasons to use that, because I prefer solving all problems with APIs. Maybe I'll need to grow up a little bit in order to afford such stuff.

This is support ticket I opened at LocalBitcoins. I'm using their service for the second year already, and I keep rising the same question about their internal logistics. Previously they said that they can't change rules of their service for everybody and they offered me (user) to contact traders in order to ask to change their payment windows (because their service is global) - but why payment window is so big anyway? Do you, most people in U.S. benefit from such huge window? Can you explain how? I'm really curious. Because huge windows are pain in the ass for Russian payments (because our fiat payments within Russia are quick, irreversible and takes few seconds)
Can we discuss payment windows? What in your opinion is appropriate payment window?
When traders sell Bitcoin, system-wide default payment window at LocalBitcoins is 90 minutes. When I sell Bitcoins using traders, holy shit their window is 360 minutes in the most cases!
This means that they give more credit to traders, while dismiss users, because customers must face such huge payment windows and if trader aren't at the computer for the moment, I must wait up to 8 hours for my funds to be released. For 2 years of using their service I've met so many **irresponsibility** from the traders (web-site shows that they are online, my funds are get frozen, and I have to wait from 6 to 8 hours for them to be released), that I would better freeze trader's funds for 360 minutes, and make user's funds subject to payment window of 90 minutes.

When you sell btc, your bitcoins automatically need to be in escrow to open a contract to be able to message anyone. Payment window defines how long contract is valid if seller don't appear. If seller appears, he can prolong contract anyway (until dispute) by pressing blue button to confirm his readiness to make a payment.

you're wrong. I told you about specific lag, and don't see any reason for payment windows have to be so big.
Basically new users without knowledge of payment windows will be forced to wait 8 hours until trader wakes up. And yes, trader is happy, because he won't lose the deal. But he might lose the customer, because for customer frozen funds is like lost funds.
Customer is unhappy, because he's getting shitty long time of waiting. If trader isn't appears within 90 minutes, he doesn't deserves to have this deal anyway. And I'm not making those 90 minutes argument out of thin air, because that's payment window for the opposite trade direction: when you buy bitcoins for fiat from traders, universal payment window is 90 minutes in all 100% cases.
Who even came up with idea to make traders to be able set payment windows over 90 minutes?! Is that was a joke from developers?


There's the same debate might be about selling outdated milk. Its not about the freedom, its about etiquette. If you bought milk and its spoiled, who're responsible if grocery sold you this milk for a regular price even without warning you while marketing this milk as regular fresh milk. Btw even in most smallest and poorest regions of Russia, groceries are responsible for selling fresh stuff and warning if its not fresh. I could even ask for refund even if I started drinking milk. I'm not talking about any refunds with LocalBitcoins, but I'm not rich enough to pay developers to create my LocalBitcoins, and their web-site is the only place where Russians like me can buy Bitcoins.

We've translated this, because Larin is somewhat popular in Russia, but before this recent video he never spoke about any Bitcoin-related topics, many people in his comments found out about Bitcoin and related technologies for the first time

I always believed, that improving existing stuff is better than creating new. Need for exit appears only when you have too much problems.
But right now in Russian BTC ecosystem there's too much things should happen, so LB is just smallest piece of the whole picture.

I think dude who created AdBlock MUST implement Bitcoin into its extension, so that you could top up balance of the extension &amp; pay 1 cent for each video. Then AdBlock would redistribute the income by authorizing YouTube channel creators.
But he won't do that, because U.S. jurisdiction will put him in jail for it.

This could be solved by simple Chrome extension
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:23:02
Limited thinking. Just create browser extension, block YT ads / no need to recreate whole platform. Screw Google. Drink Kvass.
Make top up system, let user to top up his balance for $1, then use this $1 for 100 videos

"pay as you go" the best model ever!

If you're not offering solution for content creators to earn, then you're just a cheater, because someone has to pay for that.
True mindset of shoplifter or somebody who never pays for the food. Why earn if you can steal.

Just create Google Chrome extension which will block ads on YouTube and **simultaneously collect Bitcoin micropayments**, then let YouTube channel owners log in and get paid.
