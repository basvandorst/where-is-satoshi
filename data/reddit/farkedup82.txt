sweet kind hearted soul goes straight to insulting. How about anything but this charity? a resume for a charity would include accounting like say 90% of all funds donated actually make it to a good cause. Most charities out there are nothing but fronts to fund the douchebag in charges lifestyle. In this case the 1 bitcoin would literally go up in smoke. (pot smoke).

bitcoin will never be fast enough to replace something like visa. The community has the same issues linux has. You will have fighting factions and arrogant know it alls. If people could even agree on the PURPOSE that would be a start but the problem with BTC is exactly the same as the problem with Linux. It cannot be everything to all people. Any attempt at that means it'll be nothing to everybody. We can't even get people to adopt segwit and now they're wanting lightning? good luck!
Could crypto replace visa? Yep sure could just won't be bitcoin. bitcoin is something different. I believe in crypto. I just don't have faith in bitcoin. I like seeing BTC at a lower % of the overall market cap.

only thing? uhhh nope. Try decades of RTFM packed shitty communities. Linux and its dozen various strains will never be a real option. I've been a big fan of linux servers since redhat 6.2. I've tried so many times to switch. Its not there and it won't get there.

From the descriptions I have no doubt that you are trying to do something good. The problem being you need to know when to just STFU. It doesn't matter if you get slighted or you feel that somebody wrongs you in some way. The product you are selling is YOU. I'm just a random internet troll that somehow ended up in instead of one with boobs. Same with the other guy.

Chromebooks are proving people can do most things without windows. Especially when they use a chromebook to rdp into a windows machine.

They believe they were the actual bitcoin and this thing you call bitcoin is an imposter to the throne. 
The present bitcoin is actually a joke. It can't handle transactions and this rather crappy community has failed to even get segwit rolled out properly. I don't even want to talk about lightning when previous improvements have completely failed.

did you decide to delete the reply to me where you showed that you are a Dbag? I really hope you don't get picked. OP I have his reply saved if you're considering this terrible person.

I have been corresponding with a very kind Nigerian prince that could really benefit from your charity. They have 1200 bitcoins locked up and they cannot get to it without paying 1 bitcoin to his lawyers to retrieve it for him. This prince feeds millions annually with these funds and without it his people will starve to death. Please have charity and help this nigerian prince.

considering the size of the chinese mining operations there's a good chance it was in fact made in china or at minimum the transaction was handled in china.

Its not presently. Insider trading is something only outsiders oppose.

thats because they live in a box behind the bank. You know a bank teller can't afford housing.

bitcoin will never be a reasonable transaction system so they need to give up on even targeting that. Hand it over to LTC and move onto more hedge fund type characteristics.

How did you not know that bitpay is completely useless at this point?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:13
This answer... it being available doesn't mean it will be used at all. The exchanges have been terrible at bringing support and that is pretty much the only place it matters. Places like bitpay are the real driving force behind what technology is actually going to be used. Person to person transactions are NOTHING in the big picture.

it does. There are these $1 pizzas in the frozen food section that often go on sale for like $.7. I should probably put the pizza in quotes. It's "pizza".
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:59:56
8 pieces per pizza so they must have been digiorno or more expensive ones for cost to be $2 a pizza.

and then you buy a ton of games and bitcoin skyrockets. Every time i buy something on newegg using BTC is jumps up like crazy.

mine are soft and squishy. I bailed out on all but a ton of alts I said I wouldn't touch for at least a year. managed to buy back in at under half what I sold at though. Was that being a pansie for bailing or smart for thinking this was coming?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:46:04
I'm seeking to invest in the best technology. Bitcoin will never be best in anything other than market cap and even that hopefully changes this year.

The concept of true believers is stupid. Everybody is in it for the money.
