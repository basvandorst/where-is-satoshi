I'd bet on the dip this time. Even if the crypto market recover Bitcoin is the oldest paradigm and everyone experienced its shortcomings: expensive, slow, insecure, not as anonymous as you might think.

I use internet since 1995 and yes, I don't believe in technological advancement, I just hope it gets better. I was merely pointing out some obvious bitcoin issues. They might be fixed one day but so far the community is at war over those issues. It kind of sucks.

Imagine the fee and time it would take to complete a transaction if everyone on Earth used bitcoin for everything.
-I'd like a burger, pls.
-That will be 0.0001 picoSatoshi
-I see that you only paid a fee of 500, 000$, the average time for that transaction will be approximately a few hundred aeons.
-Can I have my burger now ?
-No. We've been scammed by double spenders lately, please proceed to the waiting room.
-But there is skeletons in there...

I made one transaction (with recommanded fee) today and it took around 8-9 hours to get the first confirmation. So I wouldn't worry right now.

You should be used to it, bro'. We're talking about btc.

Whoops sorry I sold everything at 1270 for 30% bonus.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:48:59
Sell. So the worries ill be gone and you can move foward.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:05:17
But people said the same thing about bitcoin years ago: pump and dump, ponzi, etc... Can you be a little bit more creative, pls ?
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:01:48
Because hodlers don't want you to do so.

Dang man, I already regret what I've done. I'm literally shacking from FOMO induced stress. No seriously get your head out of your butt cheeks, haha.
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:26:04
Ah yes, the moon cultists and their silly faith. Another bitcoin problem along with the scalability.
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:12:13
DUDE WEED!!
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:18:14

My interest rate from 2009 to 2018 has been between 3% and 7%, if you store your USD in your mattress, yes, you won't get much.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:16:10
Why waste 3 billions to take over Bitcoin when you can use the blockchain data  to track, locate and arrest criminals?
