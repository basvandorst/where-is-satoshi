There is some nice volume on LocalBitcoins too
@_date: 2016-11-08 19:43:12
That's still unclear but yeah NGC
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:46:23
Yes maybe they updated the stats today
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:15:31
But they help accept Bitcoins though!

Most Indian exchanges don't make their volumes public. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:27:59
It's not just them, because of great demand all major exchanges are trading pretty much in the same range.
Re LBC - I mentioned lbc because he asked about what users are doing with their cash. Otherwise most traders do it via bank transfers on major exchanges.

That's ₹5000000000!

News regarding the use of NGC is not yet confirmed so really hard to say

Airports will still accept these notes for a few days so exchange them for whatever you want asap.
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:00:32
There are mainly 3-4 nicely funded exchanges and prices are almost the same at all these places.

Negative coverage. Bitcoin compared to hawala. Says is being used for black money purposes. What they don't understand is that all the places that they showed in India where they can buy Bitcoin, KYC is strictly followed and there is no way that those old notes would be accepted as none of the exchanges accept cash. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 20:51:10
Nope there are none.
