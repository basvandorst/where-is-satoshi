When you argue that identities are illusory, the whole purpose of that argument is to diminish their value. Your identity is the lens and relative scope through which you view the world and make comparisons. Nationalism is not a blind adherence to orthodoxy, in fact Nationalists are often arguing for radical changes to orthodoxy in order to preserve their people and their nation. Nationalism is first and foremost the recognition that one's group is primarily ethically responsible to their own, and that their decisions are to be based around what is best for the in group. It is not blindly following orthodoxy at all.
I don't need to support the holocaust or the common narrative on the native people's to be Nationalistic. All I need to support in order to be a Nationalist is the concept that the Nation I belong to was an expression of my people, and as a result is primarily ethically responsible for my people. All other peoples are secondary, and can be tolerated when possible and not tolerated when necessary.
The argument that cultures ought to be attenuated to survive harmoniously with one another is on the face of it true, however it is devoid of context. The only cultures who are currently being denied legitimacy in their home countries at the moment are white cultures. When you argue that Nationalism is not necessary you belittle the active efforts to delegitimize the claim White people have to their homelands. This kind of dispossession is not occurring in any other nation at the moment, and were it occurring elsewhere, I would say that a Nationalist movement would be exactly what that group should pursue. Any people who is actively being sequestered in their own country and being denied their identity, has every right in the world to be Nationalistic in an effort to preserve their people.

I apologize, I totally forgot about this thread. 
So there's basically three basic arguments you make against Nationalism. The first of which I call the "muh illusion" argument, which is pretty popular among center-left big brain internet atheists. More or less the crux of your argument is that because there is no fixed or static self that the entirety of self is illusory and inherently valueless. This is a terrible argument for quite a few reasons. Firstly there are many things which are relied upon which are fluid in nature that would not be discarded in this fashion. The entirety of economics is more or less constantly in flux, the United States Dollar for example is constantly changing in value against different relative scales. Anyone who saw this change and then immediately discarded the USD as illegitimate because it does not hold a static value would be regarded as a fool. This is no different with identity. Yes, there have been gradual cultural changes of western European ethnicities over the last 5-600 years, but there has been a consistent overarching and distinctly western European set of values and set of social behavior/organization. To what degree individuals correspond to those values and social behaviors will vary person to person, but not quite as much as many who like to delegitimize White culture would like you to believe. For example, Irish and English do have differing values, but they lie upon the same overarching structure. Irish individuals tend to be Catholic where as English tend to be Anglican, however they are both North-Western Europeans who share the overarching Christian mythology and Christian moral lens which follows it. They both have similar language origins and share much of the same history. They have similar occupational and work standards. They have similar general expectations of trust as well as very similar legal processes. When one contrasts this against the comparison between an English person and say a Nigerian, the difference between the Englishman and the Irishman are near irrelevant. 
The second argument you made was taking the admittedly hyperbolic statement I had made, declaring it illegitimate and then not even pretending to argue against it. You basically start by saying that countries which become too insular will stagnate and be evolved around. This is about as nonsensical as it can get when you are talking about Nationalism, especially when it comes to White countries. White countries are by no means under any threat of becoming so insular that the world evolves around them. Firstly, as a population, White people continue to decline and age. There are very few White countries in which the founding populations will not become an ethnic minority within the next 50 years without a significant change in birth patterns and severe restrictions on immigration. The world is not adapting around white countries, as the only countries who even pretend to compete against white countries for technological innovations are in East Asia, who are in no shortage of Nationalism.
You then precede to make the same tired arguments about the aboriginal/indigenous populations that have been tried over and over again. Firstly, none of these populations were the peace-loving cartoons that you romanticize them to be. These tribes were in constant war over hunting/settling territory, and were often incredibly barbaric when they were on the winning side of a battle against another tribe. The Aztec for example would regularly engage of ritual murder of competing smaller tribes when their land was overtaken, and would then acquire their women as property to be bred by their soldiers. 
Yes, you are correct there was a massive depopulation as a result of both warring efforts as well as massive disease epidemics among these people who were exposed to new germs they had no resistance to. This however works against your argument that nationalism is unnecessary. Whites are not the only people to have engaged in conflict and ethnic based conquest. Islam was more or less founded as a religion of conquest, and has remained so to this day. It is only because of the recognition of the necessity to preserve European identity that Islam has not yet overtaken Europe, as it has certainly been trying even prior to the fall of Constantinople. I see no reason why Whites should not recognize their own interests and their moral responsibility to their people over outsiders when faced with such a real threat to their institutions and homelands. Perhaps if the Native peoples were able to form effective states and were able to be more successful in fighting to retain sovereignty over their land, their cultures which you feign to admire so much would still be effectively preserved.

You seem to also believe that this rational valuation is culture is an end rather than a means. You say things like "it is the culture and practices that are of value to begin with that ought to be embraced and protected", without any appreciation for the necessary relative scope of understood value. I don't value cultural practices of my people solely because of their utility, and I don't discard them simply because I don't find them useful. Obviously ones that become too cumbersome to be sustainable don't tend to be well preserved, but the cultural practices that I value I value because they are a relative expression of my culture. I have no connection to the religious practices of ethnic Polynesians, and no matter how much utility one could argue some of their rituals would provide, any practicing of these cultural ceremonies by someone without a true blood connection to them would be artificial at best, and more than likely a context-less cargo-cult. The cultural practices that I wish to preserve are ones that are not just beneficial, but are ones with profound meaning for my people. Just as I do not expect a Bengali to so quickly discard their cultural practices because western consumerism may provide a more convenient option, it is unreasonable to expect White people to so quickly part with their cultural institutions because it inconveniences people who they have next to no ethical responsibility for. 
And before you go down the road saying "Well what does this have to do with White people, I just said Nationalism", it has everything to do with White people. The only people whose nationalism and ethnic identity acceptable to dismiss as illegitimate are White peoples. Oh, yeah you also said some nonsense about America being a Christian nation being a lie, but I don't really particularly care to argue with someone who is historically illiterate about the foundational dogmas present at the onset of the United States. Whether the United States is a Christian Theocracy has no bearing on the United States, which was 90+% White until the 1950s and 90+% Christian was a White and Christian Nation (hint: it was). Also, I do not believe that White people are superior to all other ethnicities, and you don't need to do so to be a Nationalist. 
How do I defend Trump's argument that the removal of Confederate statues is an assault on culture? That one is very simple. There is no fundamental difference between the ideological positions expressed between Robert E. Lee and Thomas Jefferson. If you attack the character of this historical general who many in the south still very much so identify with, you are attacking their culture, plain and simple. If you don't believe that Thomas Jefferson was a White Nationalist and a racist, read Notes on the State of Virginia, and his contributions to the Federalist Papers. He is quite clear on his intentions and expressions, and while you may not understand this, if you attack and delegitimize Robert E Lee on those moral grounds, you are more or less delegitimizing Thomas Jefferson as well who was ideologically almost identical. You are attacking the mythology which culturally unites many Americans and with which White Americans are taught to identify with. 
Your final argument that everyone is interchangeable is sophomoric and ridiculous. It's just plain and simple tactical nihilism. You make a comparison to the mass of a person being irrelevant to celestial motion as if that proves that on a personal level distinctions in character and behavior are irrelevant. There are no two people on earth who are interchangeable. This is not for some haughty reason like a ethereal soul, but because the mechanisms which make the mind and the social status and function of different peoples are so incredibly complex that there are no two people who have identical sets of experience, identical sets of behavior, and identical sets of skills. You say that Socrates and Einstein are in essence unimportant because the capital T "Truth" they brought to the world could have been discovered by others eventually. This is an absolute non-starter. While you may act as if you believe this to be true, this is an unintelligible way to look at the world. If everything under the sun has been done before, and it's just a matter of time before it all dissolves, then what does it matter to you if naturally aggregate based on ethnicity and tribe? This also assumes that just because there are these sets of ideas which theoretically exist independent of individuals that the interpersonal distinctions which can be made, and then by aggregate the population distinctions are irrelevant. It supposes that every single person is just as likely as the other to stumble into greatness as if by accident. This is easily disproven by both a cursory understanding of how intelligence works, and a basic understanding of human biodiversity. The races more or less were separated geographically for thousands of years. Exposed to different environmental challenges, it is natural to expect divergence in selection pressures which leads to divergence which is biologically observable. Even when one controls for IQ, people of similar IQ of different racial backgrounds tend to respond differently when exposed to different stress/stimuli. These differences in social response and behavior form the basis for social collectives. The Nation is an expression of the people who belong to it, and is almost always a coherent and more or less homogeneous system. That you think this can be discarded and then with magic we will all suddenly reddit and shopping mall our way to the future "Global identity" is honestly laughable. The way we maintain a harmonious collection of distinct cultures and practices the world over, is by allowing them their own separate homelands where they do not have to compete against invading or outside cultures for moral and political sovereignty.

That is not how facts work. A fact is an individual piece of evidence. When you claim that because Identity is not static that is is inherently illusory, that is an assertion and a judgment, not a fact. 


That is also not true. It is a position that can easily be argued and supported with historical evidence, and it serves the benefit of anchoring people in a frame of reference for who their ancestors were and what they believed. It gives people an understanding of tradition and the backbone of the country their ancestors built. 


Find me the "lie" in the argument that we have no moral responsibility to the untold millions of illegals who are taking advantage of our system without having allegiance to it. Find me the "lie" when one argues that there is in fact a serious problem with the very high correlation radical islam and terrorism. They commit a very out-sized portion of the terrorism in both the United States and Europe, and we have next to no moral obligation to import them. When Christians criticize birth control and abortion, they are criticizing the degeneration of morality around sexual behavior. Many women today do engage in irresponsible sexual behavior for which there are **societal** consequences, not just personal. They are making the argument that if we restrict access to these tools they can use to put off the consequences of their irresponsible sexual behavior, then there will be less of it. **That argument however, is not one that is relevant to Nationalism.** 


Are you implying I'm some advocate for late-stage global capitalism? Whether you wish to recognize it or not, you are in competition with other groups for resources. We have yet to reach this meme of post-scarcity, and we never will. The specific luxuries that are afforded to you are afforded to you **because someone else does not have them**, and if they were afforded to someone else rather than you, **you would not have them.**


More deserving? You don't seem to understand that this country was **created by us and for us and our children.** Just as I would be first and foremost a guest were I to move to Japan, a Japanese person is in kind first and foremost a guest within the United States. Just because you seem to have bought into the lie of the proposition nation doesn't make it reality. All groups inherently are in conflict with others for resources, just because there is currently a temporary state of splendor and excess, does not mean that you are not in conflict. Also, as far as your nobody is denying white Christians their identity, have you been paying attention to the media circus surrounding the posters being placed up saying "It's okay to be white"? Are you telling me there is not a culture of "White guilt" in the west? If so you are blatantly lying. 


Have you noticed that Nationalists don't generally want to engage in these pointless wars in the Middle East? Donald Trump campaigned on getting out of these wars because they benefited next to nobody. We have a responsibility to provide for the building of stable nations, we do not have a responsibility to import their people who have no allegiance to our country. 


Are you going to make an argument? Find me a progressive nation that is doing well with discarding their home population. Are England and France better now that major portions of their metropolitan areas are almost weekly getting terrorized by immigrants who are openly hostile to their people? Is the United States better for having populations like Blacks and Hispanics who combined commit almost 70% of the murder in this country year after year?
Also your argument that we "are all fucking humans" is great moral signaling and all, but the fact of the matter is that genetics have a very large influence on peoples behavior patterns, and that these behavior patterns in turn have **societal** consequences worth considering. 


Great, we'll all hold hands and sing Kumbayah, while Whites are continuing to be dispossessed and becoming minorities in their home countries. Everyone can serve a common good? This notion of common good you have is nonsense that is only afforded to you by the temporary excess of resources in comparison to the first world population. 


English people, having formed the state and culture of England over hundreds of years have no claim to their homeland? Would you argue that for Bangladesh? Would you argue that for Korea? Would you argue that for Nigeria? No. You wouldn't because that argument is flat out bullshit. Instead of asserting it is "wrong" for the French to have sovereignty over France, how about making an argument. Is it wrong for me to say that you have no sovereignty over your place of residence and that it doesn't belong to any race or creed or cultural group? Your house doesn't belong to you and we can just relocate a family of refugees into your living-room?

This post WW2 mythology you were sold of America as a proposition nation is not and has not ever been true. Americans are not unique in being a nation formed of no people. Just as there is no amount of time I could spend in Somalia and magically become a Somali, there is no amount of time they can spend here and become American. No matter what civic status recognition they acquire, they will be fundamentally different from me, just as I am fundamentally different from Koreans who are fundamentally different from Benghali's. This is the way of the world.

You present a couple of common arguments, and I don't want you to think I'm just ignoring them. I'll respond to this a little later in the day when I have time to sit down at my computer instead of doing this off the top of my head from my phone.

I haven't asserted the superiority of any race. There are however slight racial differences in aggregate behavior patterns which are worth considering on a political planning scale. Uncategorical/intrinsic superiority is an unarguable position as far as I'm concerned. Thank you for the concern trolling there bucko.

Some people deserve the ability to self-determinate and others do not because reasons? Are you actually going to present an argument or evidence for your belief structure anywhere or are you just going to assume everyone else is going to nod and agree?

I don't think you understand Nationalism. It actually has next to nothing to do with a sort of self-aggrandizing 'I'm better than you because of an accident of birth'. Nationalism is the idea that the Nation and Culture are the expression of a collective people who find their strength in being unified in their interests, values, and shared experiences. If you believe that there is no value to Nationalism, you essentially believe that there is no value to providing for future generations. A unified group identity and the want to feel like one has made a contribution to their people is a serious driver for people to make positive contributions to the world they live in. 
I understand the motivation behind the virtue-signalling that "Nationalism is bad man, because it doesn't pretend everyone is interchangeable" but when you say things like no sane person would support it, you sound both incredibly politically ignorant, and like a cafe-liberal not worth taking seriously.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:41:22
Nationalism is not insisting your nation can never be questioned and never be in the wrong. Nationalism is about identifying strongly with a group of people who form a nation. Nationalists are people who believe in preserving and promoting unity among the nation, unity usually based in a common lineage, inherited/taught values/mythology, and the expectation of a unified culture. You need to read a book or two kimo sabe.

I really don't have personal prejudices against individuals. I'm not going to jump through hoops to try and prove how virtuous I am, but I genuinely do my best to treat every individual I meet as a new person and go from there. With this being said, the discourse around race in the popular zeitgeist is completely insane. It is ignorant of history, completely denies biology, and is almost unusable if you want accurate economic models. 
I don't think you have to be some evil cartoon character Nazi to also not lie about things like human biodiversity. When we do this we are forfeiting that territory to people who genuinely do hold hateful views. That's my shpeal. You can disagree if you wish, but for anyone who does I'd recommend reading "A Troublesome Inheritance" by Nicholas Wade, "The 10,000 year explosion" by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending and "The Bell Curve" by Charles Murray. Even if you find yourself disagreeing with them, it will expose you to arguments that are cognizant of modern genetics and studies into human evolutionary biology.

One of the key aspects of Nationalism is it recognizes the contribution of ones ancestry, and compels people to provide for their Propriety in kind. If you do not recognize yourself as belonging to a group, you will likely also not recognize your responsibilities to that group. This is actually a whole  sub-field of ethics, dealing with the problems of propriety and providing the best sorts of motivation for ethical contribution. It turns out that having a strong sense of communal belonging and a strong sense of unification is a pretty good way to foster that. 
You believe that questioning bad practices is inherently bad for unity? Is it suddenly un-Nationalistic of me to believe that America has no business trying to be the global moral police? Is it un-Nationalistic of me to believe that we are in many of the problems we are in economically because we expected non-Western people to adopt Western institutions and behavior patterns, and that we are likely fooling ourselves if we think they will now? You have no argument. There are plenty of ways one can be constructively critical of ones nation precisely because they want a stronger unified collective to remain a part of.

I think that the process of making America less than 90% White over the last 60 years was one that was relatively peaceful and done via laws and incentive structures, and I see no reason why that process could not be reversed relatively peacefully with laws and incentive structures. Obviously no set of policies will be perfect for everyone, but the white people who were displaced and dispossessed by the system we have created are as far as I'm concerned the primary responsibility of this country. Secondarily to them obviously comes those who are the descendants of slavery. They had no choice in their ancestors arrival in this land and are the responsibility of our people. What I think would be ideal is either some sort of balkanization, or some sort of repatriation with support as outlined in Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia. 
There are no ideal situations, and I'm conflicted over the exact logistics, because for those of the black community who are genuinely capable of being white presenting and integrating into white society smoothly. This is a much smaller percentage of people than would be ideal, but it doesn't seem right to me to deny them the comforts afforded among Europeans. This is really what were talking about when we talk about integration/desegregation. It is about creating a positive right to live amongst whites and as a result enjoy the luxuries that are afforded by that. 
Whether you want to acknowledge these issues or not is your personal choice. The time will come when these comforts we have been afforded for so long will be overwhelmed by the large numbers of people who will take their fruit without fully understanding how they were created.

This country was not founded upon the "melting pot". It explicitly states in the first sentence of pre-amble of the Constitution. 
"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
Who is the "Posterity" they speak of? Posterity sounds a lot like their lineage, which surprisingly doesn't seem to include the "wretched refuse" of the rest of the world as is so commonly referenced in the American mythology. 
Surely they allowed for some kind of immigration right? Of course, as outlined in the Naturalization acts of 1790, it was open to "Free White Men of Good Character". This was more or less the only demographic group allowed to permanently naturalize as a citizen of the United States until the Hart-Celler Act of 1965. Even the Hart-Celler act was sold to the at that point ~90% White America, as being one that would not fundamentally alter the racial character and demographics of this country. It turns out they lied.
