Isn't one of the strengths of bitcoin that it can't have insiders?

Are we sure that Bitcoin is not controlled or manipulated by someone? I am not sure. How much can mt.gox or others control the value of bitcoin? I fear they can control alot.

Thank you very much for the clarification. In that website an ad appears (at least over here) that shows a rig that produces 60GHash/s for a price of 2500 USD. If that isn't fake or if we can get such numbers with nvidia tesla like GPU's doesn't it make this one of the best investments at the current price?

Actually there is no middle class left. There are rich people and poor people. Booming economy made the rich super rich, the poor super poor. Middle class was driven to either ends. After the global crisis salaries etc. went down and did not rise with the booming economy. For instance and engineer now gets 1/2-1/3 of the starting salary he used to get before.

I think they legally may not be able to do that. If I were you I would contact some lawyers etc. and ask what you can do. What they are doing can be agains anti trust laws etc.

Is it the same with stock exchange too? If I am going to sell lots of a stock and tell someone does he become an insider and is this illegal?

At some countries 3-4 USD per day is a significant income I guess.

I know that you guys will downvote me to oblivion but whatever. I would expect the supposedly open minded people here at least give constructive critcism on Ripple or whatever new system comes, instead of this attitude. And you guys hate it when regular people do this to Bitcoin.

It is a butterfly labs ad. At this point I am confused. Aren't ASICs batch produced IC's. If they are behind thats quite fishy. You cannot produce like just 10 ASICs, you need to produce alot.

Thanks, with its default setting it shows close to 4 bitcoins per 24H (3.9326 BTC exactly) and thats alot of money. Or am I reading something wrong? With such numbers one can buy a new computer every day or so and generate bitcoins exponentially. Are there people doing this? (Edit: Now comments of other fellows reveal that these numbers are not correct. I wonder why? Are the default values in this website not typical of a good GPU?)

I am not sure how people use bots in MtGox, but as you know now most of stock exchange trading is done by computers, they buy and sell in fractions of a second, and there are other computers that are designed to hunt them. They learn how a particular bot acts and benefits by exploiting their behaviour. So what you are suggesting can probably be done.
