Question: How to use this audio file ?
1/ Download the file (link below)
2/ Create a new TXT file.
4/ Listen the audio file and precisely timestamp  the 12 words of your secret seed. (minutes/seconds)
[29:36]( LAZY
[3:25]( ATTACK
[38:44]( PIZZA
[17:23]( ENDORSE
BEFORE: LAZY ATTACK PIZZA ENDORSE ...
AFTER: [29:36]( [3:25]( [38:44]( [17:23]( ...
OK! So, now your 12 words have 12 timestamps. 1 timestamp per word. No one can guess that these timestamps are related to the audio file.
Keep the audio file safely in multiple clouds, USB, CD, Google drive and so on. Keep the TXT file in a different cloud,
DO NOT PUT THEM IN THE SAME CLOUD.
