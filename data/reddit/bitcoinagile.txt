It is not 1990s – scraping or aggregating is not actual anymore. Streaming BIG DATA and Analyzing it in real-time is what actual nowadays. Re-posting fresh/hot/trending content also is fine, it won’t be a news unless it is shared
From legal point of view it is fine to frame-in entire page with ads - news provider still benefits if user clicks on their ads.  Bitcoin Agile is free-of-ads portal, providing bitcoin communities with the streaming  up-to-the-minute bitcoin news links from twitter covering 20k+ blogs/news portals for FREE
