If you knew it was going back to 4K after that huge spike it would be silly not to cash in for profit.  Then buy more when price went back down.

American Cancer Society.  
When my girlfriend was 15 her mother died from breast cancer.  Currently have an uncle with terminal stomach cancer.  
Unfortunately, most people know how brutal cancer can be.   
This is a pretty amazing thing you are doing.

The first transaction was converted to USD.   He has $9000 plus the same amount of bitcoin.  How is the $9000 not a realized gain?

I give up.

So you're going to take all 50% and use it exclusively for a house?  Gonna put all $500k in that basket?

TIL that having $500 means you're rich.

During the huge price surge I was at the local library.  I overheard some guy wheelin and dealin on his phone trying to talk some guy into bitcoin investing.  Said it was for sure going up 500% this year.  
I wanted to throat punch him.
