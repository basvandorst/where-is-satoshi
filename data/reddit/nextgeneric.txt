Way to completely disregard OP's concern and dodge the point -- something very common amongst some people here! It's actually easy getting onto the internet. Libraries, internet cafes, wifi hotspots. Hell, I went to get froyo last night and they had iPads for customers to use.
That doesn't change the fact that for the ordinary Joe, no matter what your biased mindset is, that's it's difficult to acquire bitcoin. Not everyone lives near a bitcoin ATM.
The sooner you and the others start recognizing there *are* issues with bitcoin and its acquisition, the sooner we'll solve them. Right now, the denial and overall holier-than-thou attitude does nothing to forward our progress.

The only people who are scared are those who have a vested interest in bitcoin. Which is why this subreddit it mostly "happy-happy-joy-joy", with most things of negative nature getting down voted to hell.
Any true believer in decentralized digital currency would support anything that comes that provides improvements over bitcoin, if such a thing exists.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:51:32
Anyone with a level business sense would purchase in USD and hold the BTC, knowing it would appreciate in value. You're just trying to justify spending it, at this point.
Sorry, but I don't see the practicality. But I respect everyone's right to do as they please.
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:32:46
Seems like some of those just submit news links in general which isn't blog spam, really.

I'm curious as to why you would disclose your wealth to the Internet. ~~That is all.~~
Also, why on earth are you keeping $1+ m of bitcoin on BlockChain.info!? That is so incredibly risky.

Because the people who downvoted it don't care. It's that easy. This subreddit is mostly about bitcoin discussion and important news, but it looks like you're looking for free publicity.

Of course they aren't actual journalism. Doesn't it strike anyone as a little odd that CoinDesk operates an office and writers around the world and doesn't seem to run a single ad?
They've got a huge investor behind them just waiting to sell the site off or plaster it with ads. That investor also has ties with BitPay.
Did you think they were going to be all fluffy and nice and accepting of all comments? I don't. 
There's also a different between criticism and comments who don't like what was published because it wasn't positive.

Honestly, if I was driving behind you and I saw this, it would make me think it was more of a scam than anything else. If it's a good currency, it will spread because of its utility, not because some guy "advertised" it on his car.
You're trying too hard. And I don't understand why you placed the EFF logo on it... you're making it seem like they've created/endorsed the "ad".

Square Market added bitcoin. In other words, it's only available on the Square Market site and the sellers using the point-of-sale system will not be able to accept bitcoin (yet, anyway)
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:43:29
Probably not. Most of the world doesn't even know what's going on here. It's just well known in the cryptocurrency community, which in the grand scheme of things, is small.

Like I've said right along, it doesn't matter to them. Bitcoin users are such a small group in comparison to their total shopper base that it wouldn't even make it worth their time.

Also, I don't think you're in any position to declare what "we" are or aren't in this community, since you've been signed up for a short amount of time. If you truly did, you'd realize "we" are culmination of people with all sorts of opinions on bitcoin.

Well, the theory works out, only problem is that Mt.Gox doesn't really allow USD withdrawals (well, they do but it takes a long time).
You can do it even cheaper just by buying at Bitstamp, for example, and moving them. That's where Coinbase gets a lot of their Bitcoins from.

The issue is that this subreddit is *very* pro-bitcoin.
I remember the day when this subreddit was mostly really good discussion - where not many people worried about the price.
Since the value soared, things have changed. Many people are here because they think bitcoin is a way to get rich. I see the conversations every day... "some day my one bitcoin will make me a millionaire."
May I suggest I find some good discussion takes place there, albeit the community is very small (which in my eyes is good).
Unfortunately, we've come to a point where the lot of people who swarm this subreddit have a vested interest in bitcoin. They care not for the technology, but for the potential of making a lot of money. As such, in response to your question, bitcoin for them is the answer to everything.
Not pointing my finger at everyone here, of course.

Many people here have an emotional and financial investment in bitcoin and are unwilling to see any altcoin become superior, thus making their investment worth less.
My comments are sometimes unpopular here, but there's a lot of delusional people roaming these parts. I've noticed the influx since the April 2013, when the price started getting high. Many just see bitcoin as an opportunity to make money and are awfully cocky about where the price will go.

Fear is your worst enemy in finance.
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:56:06
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:32:11
Yeah, because we're going to trust some random Internet stranger with money.
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:14:42
I agree. Saving money with fiat is good. That not only benefits you, but the bank as they can loan it out to spur business creation.
Saving bitcoins is another story altogether. No banks, so no loans, and thus, removed from the supply. I don't spend my BTC for fear the value might be even higher (see the $1 million pizza).
The opinion may be unpopular in this distortion field of a subreddit, but I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.
@_date: 2014-04-21 21:26:27
I get it's a joke and all but that paper money you're making fun of is currently making the financial world turn.

I'm glad you got some answers before the community down votes you for asking a legitimate question (something about self-interest and wanting to believe that bitcoin is the end-all and be-all of currency)

First you start by having a decent subreddit with technical discussion.
Then the people like you start coming in and try to turn this whole thing into a mega-corp operation. Because really, at the end of the day, all you care about is making money.
I'm willing to bet you don't give a rat's ass about how bitcoin can change money exchange as we know it based on the wording of your post.

Not really. [Take a look at this]( Maybe $10,000 is enough to buy a good miner now, but in a matter of months it won't be generating as much.

I don't know terribly much about the exchange biz, but I'm pretty sure they rely on a userbase to achieve volume. So -- get more users, and thus, a higher volume. After all, the concept of an exchange is to allow users to buy/sell from *eachother* and not from the exchange.
If it were the exchange that was selling coins, you'd be looking at something like Coinbase -- and they get a lot of their BTC from Bitstamp, I do believe.

Currencies stay stable, they don't fluctuate the way bitcoin does. I HOPE bitcoin does get to that level in the future. For now, it's only a store of value, and a very volatile one, at that.
Thanks for not losing your cool. I think it's healthy to have a debate. My biggest problem with the sub is that some people here are so bullish that any deviation from all of that "to the moon" bullcrap is met with furious anger and denial.

Dealing with customs *in* Canada is a matter of convenience, really. Get it out of the way before you go. You make it sound as if we're screening every flight out of Canadian airports as opposed to flights headed to the US.

It's prison, not the Four Seasons.

It was sort of an open question. Personally, I'm not interested.

Also, younger people tend to be more tech savvy.

What? Currencies are inherently stable. Anything else is just a store of value. Bitcoin *may* one day be a currency, but with volatility the likes of what we're seeing lately, it most certainly is not.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:11:20
I honestly feel like I'm in a subreddit with 6th graders.
Two weeks ago: Yeah, China! They are leading the movement!
Today: Screw, China! We never needed them!

TLDR; Bullshit artist.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:17:16
I make it a point to not preach about bitcoin. It's not appealing. I only speak about it if asked for my opinions or if that is the topic of conversation.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:21:34
You can't expect a new technology and implementation of the idea to be stable from day one, do you?

Only put in money you're willing to lose. I would advise you to not go this route.

Savings account? Bitcoin is volatile, and who's to say it won't tank in the future? Whoop, there goes your savings account.
Maybe an investment fund, but certainly not a savings account.
It's not guaranteed to go up.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:21:07
Pretty neat. What kind of cake was/is it?
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:29:21
I'm not particularly worried.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:03:49
I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I'm just wondering why the amount of subscribers in this subreddit is important in any way? Are you using it as a metric for overall interest in bitcoin? If so, it's a pretty poor idea.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:39:59
Gross overdramatization.

You wrote a completely false title. And the news is days old.

How does one prevent him/herself from getting screwed by this person?
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:48:08
I never, ever said it was easy. 
I'm not a troll, I frequent this sub along with daily and am a bitcoin holder.
I'm merely making a point that mining in itself isn't considered "work". You just need the capital to get in the game. How you acquire it can either be very hard or very simple. This seems logical.


I didn't know I needed to be on a beach.


I'm a business owner and bitcoin enthusiast/day trader. But I'm okay with your opinion. :)
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:46:32
I believe BTC-e lets you do this, but I have no experience with their service.

Just an FYI.. I'm working with Olaf on getting some answers about the countless support issues many of you all have had &amp; will be posted on my [website]( in the coming days, hopefully.

I don't think anyone should have to buy anything they don't need. Not even to promote bitcoin. 
I've always said that if it's the next-gen solution, it will catch on without these crusades. You're reminding me of the folks that come to my door and ask if I believe in Jesus.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:15:25
I haven't personally had any issues, but I've read some complaints. From what I understand, their website shows a picture of a nice-looking building to give the illusion that's where they operate from, but in actuality I've read somewhere that is only where their mail gets delivered.
They operate from an apartment. As long as you follow what they say (write account name and email on the check, don't go above their limits, etc) you should be fine.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:42:39
Hmm.. maybe [coinkite](

You're totally missing the point. Savings accounts are mostly secure. In the US, your money is insured up to x amount.

I've heard it used this way many times.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:04:17
I think it's more like "accepting Bitcoin tips". As far as I'm aware, you're not getting their record in exchange for bitcoin. Unless it's free, or something.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:11:29


Computer did the work.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:43:06
As I'm aware, they operate out of an apartment. So I highly doubt they have anyone taking phone calls. Which is BS.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:59:08
Write it off and don't fall into another trap. Not much else you can do. The whole $350 for a PS4 should have been a warning sign in the first place. They just came out and are $400 in-store.
@_date: 2013-10-25 14:16:23
Why are you people trying to force Bitcoin down peoples' throats through celeb endorsement? It's so desperate. Just let it happen.

There's a few of these now, I think.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:54:41
They've been pretty good to me, just lower volume than the big guys.

They released a new bitcoin trading software at [btxtrader.com](

Yeah that website isn't legit.... washingtonpost**s.org**. Their real website is washingtonpost.com. Also this website is hosted at namecheap to Rajesh Korrapati so I'm calling bullshit.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:39:49


You must be joking. So you mean to say the labor-intensive part isn't actually the mining? Gee, I suppose I just made my point. The miner does the mining. A rich kid who's inherited his wealth could buy an expensive miner and make bitcoins without it being "labor-intensive" in any sense of the words.
Typical drivel.


If by that you mean you guys already do that well enough with your obscene delusion.

No. People cash out because they don't want to lose the money they put in.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:38:25


This statement strikes me as odd. Currencies *should* be able to be used under *any* conditions, internet or no internet. With the U.S. Dollar, perhaps I can't give my safari guide my AMEX, but I can hand him
Here's my answer, though. I believe there will be services that allow bitcoin transactions to happen via a 56Kbps connection over a phone line (aka dialing-up). Think FAX or how some CC terminals operate.
Edit; also paper wallet, but you'd have to trust the hell out of the person.

I've have a good experience with CampBX. They're small, but based in the USA.
I do dislike their interface, though. Rather dated. Coinbase's interface is lovely.

She didn't recommend using Bitcoin. Rather, getting familiarized with it and the concept of it.

If I'm trading bitcoins, how do I report this on taxes? Only after I've cashed out? I'm planning to sell high and scoop more up, but I don't know how I should report this.
FWIW, I do keep a log of my transactions, which has been 2, to date.

You know, you raise a good point. I thought about this after I posted the comment. I realized most transactions on Bitcoin *are* cash based. So yeah, I suppose Bitcoin could work.
I retract my original statement!

OP said a number. 900. That is the present all-time high (or thereabouts). Totally irrelevant.
