This is why projects like ICX, Aion, and others will be king as they understand that each company wants to create their own currency.

Its not about whats ideal for the market but how companies act. They want to control how their consumers use their money, its why gift-cards, reward cards and balance cards exist. I agree that there will be a main currency but just like people that use coffee cards and gas cards now, people will pick certain companies they use their currency to get rewards and such.

Ya, but FUD is reality in how the markets work.
We are buying and selling an asset that has yet to convince people of its long term viability. A "stock" that does not have a company with a profit or a building that could be sold to recoup losses. A commodity that can not be held in the real world to provide stabilty to its investors. The FUD is real and it is why the pennystock sharks pump and dump through this entire market, in plain view.

Beyond the speculative gambling, why is Bitcoin worth as some have said more than $5000?
How will Bitcoin(those innovating), convince my technology blind friends to use Bitcoin over their credit card, debit card or any myriad of other options to transfer capital?
Or any advice to columnists or writers who speak on Bitcoin with a level-headed mindset?

Investor confidence....... Tether, Bitfinex, Brock Pierce, failed ICO's, ponzi scheme's, broken tech, lack of regulation....etc, fix the problems and people will trust it again. When even crazy fomo investors don't have confidence you should be aware of where the price is going.

I think the market will turn upside down when we find out more about the cftc subpoena of Tether in addition to how other governments will react and cooperate with regulation and charges towards Bitfinex.

But the fact that no one is usining it to purchase or sell anything is exactly why it has the potential and is a bubble. Until something backs it up to maintain value, it is just a speculative commodity. I feel that bitcoin will fall once another alt-coin currency rises to fills its intended use. Whether one chosen by the community to be implemented or one chosen by the Fed and other banks. Etherium seems like the choice though it could easily be tossed aside for something else.

Nah, not unless the governments of multiple countries are coordinating action. The ilk that run Bitfinex have set up their fiefdom to deflect government power, by being outside it. People have provided enough proof to shake investors out of the market but the draw of gambling is still strong that stop people from really exiting Bitfinex. 
I think this cloud is going to be 2018.

Because people had a use for those technologies, the majority of people purchasing and owning Bitcoin are not using it to purchase or sell things but as a speculative part of their portfolio or they are using it to get their money out of a country.  There is a very real potential that Bitcoin implodes again in value as the money rushes to anther lucrative market that they can take advantage of.  Will it go away no, but could it shoot back down to 1000...ya it could. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:27:57
At some point once the music has stopped they have to serve a purpose or at the very least a repository of value like gold(which only a few will serve this).
Edit: apologies not trying to rain on the parade but this period will not last forever many of the coins that do not reach their ideal usefulness, being that they achieve the goal the creators planned for it will be forgotton. It certainly wont be tommorow but in the future many will lose their value.
