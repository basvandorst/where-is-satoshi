Until they realize that LN is just a patch on top of outdated technology and that Nano is cheaper (free) and faster (&lt;10s) to use.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:27:13
Almost free isn't free. Aside from that, setting up channels sounds like such a headache. What's going to make people want to deal with all that when they can just use something else that has those features inherently?

It's not a prediction, it's just comparing GoT to what's already happening to BTC

Unless LN makes transfers both free and instant (it won't), it's already an inferior redundancy of Nano.

 It's so fucked up that this got downvoted. Pay your fucking taxes, people. The IRS is what took down Al Capone. They've taken notice of crypto now and will not hesitate to take you and millions of others down too. Nobody agrees with everything the government spends money on, but they, or essentially the taxpayers before you, have been providing you with protection and an infrastructure to build your life around and you need to do your part. Taxes are the reason you have roads to get you to work, why your neighborhood hasn't been stormed by guerrillas with assault rifles, why you have an education and access to safe water, just do your fucking part and don't leave your part of the baggage on me and don't risk your whole investment and your freedom just to save yourself a fraction of what you've made.
Also if you are in the lowest income bracket you don't have to pay capital gains so just go ahead and report it.

I made a spread sheet to compare the return on investing in an S9 vs. just spending that money on bitcoin and spending the electricity costs on more bitcoin each month. The difference in profitability depends a lot on different factors such as how quickly the mining income decreases as a result of increasing difficulty, and how much the price of btc goes up or down. What I concluded was that in most scenarios, your best bet is to buy a miner, run it for a few months, then sell it to someone else. The problem, though, is that shipping takes 1-2 months after you've spent your money, which means you're missing out on returns during that time. Plus they're sold out of S9s right now and you'd probably have to pay 50% more to get a used one on ebay or something.

Whenever you're ready to transfer, move your coins to gdax first and transfer from there. Gdax is owned by the same people as coinbase so the transfer to gdax will be free and instant, and then gdax covers the cost of the transfer fee to any other wallet. I was made aware of this the day after I transfered my coins from gdax to coinbase to my wallet and wasted about $2.50.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:39:01
I based that on the maximum 21 million coins for a conservative estimate.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:06:07
I looked a little further into it and uh... as far a generating an address from a private key... I might as well change my major to cryptography or whatever relevant field if I'm going to spend that much time learning enough to figure out what they're talking about. I'm seeing people say that generating the public key is easier, and I could safely type that into an internet connected computer and get the address from there, but I'm not finding a good explanation on how public keys are generated. I'll look again and maybe post a question about it in the morning.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:45:02
Some people, myself included, just have to try for themselves and learn the hard way. You look at the chart and think "if I had just sold then and bought it back then, I'd be up X%!" and you don't realize how different things are in the moment vs. hindsight. I tried and lost, tried to win it back and lost more. Told myself I wasn't gonna do it again but did it again anyway and lost even more. Thankfully I came to my senses and took my coins off the exchange and haven't touched them since then. I'm pretty sure I got it 100% out of my system. Just the thought of trying again brings back the pain of losing. I didn't lose as much as some, I'm still way up in terms of return percentage. It could have had more but I don't and that's that. It bothers me less every day and I just tell myself that, being who I am, that's just what I had to do to learn the lesson for myself.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:16:11
Yeah I was looking into that. Doing it by hand would be a bit much but I might be able to write a program to do it if I spend some time trying to figure it out. I don't know a thing about cryptography but I have a little programming experience and I'm alright with numbers. I'll share with the sub if I can pull it off.

That's exactly what the market manipulators want you to do. Just hodl. The more the price dips, the more likely it is to start going back up. If it was a good idea to hodl after a $400 decline, it's an even better idea to keep hodling after a $800 decline. Cryptocurrency went from being a negligible fraction of the world's currency to being .25% of the world's currency in less than a year and we're just getting started.

His initial skepticism is completely reasonable, but he's clearly at least somewhat interested in getting in the game. We want more people to buy. That means encouraging newcomers.

I've said before that the only type of crypto that will ever go truly mainstream is something like usdt that doesn't fluctuate in value. It's just not very much fun because there's no reason to invest in it. Normal people aren't going to want their bank accounts wildly changing in value constantly, it's just not practical. I think normal cryptos will still have their place though, or at least I hope so because I have a big investment in them.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:52:27
I figured that if BTC increased in value enough to keep your hardware profitable, then it would increase enough that you'd be better off just buying BTC. I went ahead and did the math though and it was actually closer than I thought it would be, but still more profitable than mining. In fact the S9 actually comes out as more profitable in the long run UNLESS you consider the fact that you could invest the $135 per month electricity cost into BTC each month. That adds up a lot.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:45:27

Hey, good point. According to this page:
The reward, in btc, has gone down almost 25% in the last month. They don't go further back than 30 days so it's hard to tell if that's consistent, but if it is, I would only make .3 btc in a year and .31 in 2 years. At the current price, I would need .45 btc to make back my money, and that would never happen.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:42:49
Well just don't assume that you've figured out the secret until you can consistently make profits for a long time. The price has been fluctuating around a fixed point for the last week which is when day trading is the easiest, but the pattern will change. If you have a habit of selling when it goes up, you won't be holding anything when it spikes again. If you always buy when the price goes down, eventually you'll be all in for the next big decline.
I'm just telling you what I wish I would have listened to weeks ago. If you're like me, you're going to keep trying anyway and there's nothing anybody can say to stop you, so best of luck, I mean it.

On October 25th, every wallet with bitcoin in it will be credited with an equal amount of BTG. If your coins are on an exchange or with some institution such as coinbase when this happens, you will be at the mercy of that company as far as how and when you are able to access those new coins. Many people are advising that you put your coins in a private wallet like Electrum before that happens.

@_date: 2017-10-30 02:42:58
So would that ever be possible with bitcoin? Is the system malleable enough to make a change like that or would that have to be accomplished with a new coin? Isn't that the intended purpose of some of these forks and altcoins? I worry that, eventually, if bitcoin isn't able to make that happen, then some other altcoin will be able to and will dominate the market. I suspect that one day Visa is going to implement a crypto payment system and distribute it to all the retailers. If it's not able to make that system compatible with bitcoin, it's going to choose some other altcoin(s) and bitcoin is going to be left behind.

There are so many other things that could happen that would cause you to lose your coins that, while extremely unlikely, are still way more likely than someone colliding with your address. Such as you and every instance of your private key being hit by separate meteors at the same time, or more realistically, someone holding your entire family hostage for your keys. Plus, those were just the odds of one single address being generated twice. If that many addresses were generated, almost all of them would have 0 coins so it wouldn't matter. There's just no reason to worry about. You're better off worrying about dieing in a car accident on the way to your next door neighbor's house.

Fuck off :p

I was so close to buying more at 4150 last night, dammit. This shit drives me insane. I should just be happy that the coins I own now are worth more, but I'm just thinking of what I could have had. I want it to go up and down at the same time.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:45:09
That's nice that you're trying to help, but without offering any reasoning or giving us proof that you have any more knowledge than the average redditor, your words are meaningless and you're not helping anyone.

"Please dip, please dip so I can buy low, please ddddomg it's crashing! It's crashing sell sell sell wtfwtfwtf!"

I see, so btc is better for storing value while others are better for spending quickly. Is it inherently impossible to have the best of both worlds in one coin? At least as far as anyone has figured out so far? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:29:50
Oh is this Sorry I thought I was still on @_date: 2017-10-24 01:27:23
Neat, now how do I get rid of this shitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:51:52
I probably would have sold if this sub hadn't guilt tripped me into hodling. Instead I diversified this morning with LTC and made a quick 50%. I feel like an investing genius, but really I'm just manipulatable and lucky. Good enough for me.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:26:47
Because then you only get your new coins when/if the exchange gets around to giving you access to them.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:14:01
Yeah dude, make a new wallet asap. Bitcoins don't just move themselves. Maybe there's some other explanation, but why risk it just to save one transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:36:07
An upward curve on a logarithmic graph? How often to stocks do that? That seems tough to pull off.
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:08:17
Cool, I'm in engineering statistics right now and I thought that would be the case, so I was wondering why OP thought it was so rare. I guess they're new to whatever they're doing
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:01:01
Ah, I should really start checking those things
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:02:03
About a month ago I suggested to a friend that he invest in btc. He laughed at me. Btc is now up 14% from that point. He'd probably laugh again if I told him it's not too late.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:58:24
Either buy now or gamble and wait for a dip. It might dip tomorrow or it might never go below $6000 again. Nobody knows what's going to happen. If it's still on an overall upward trend then you're more likely to lose by waiting.

Wouldn't that be stupid? If their clients own a total of $1bil in bitcoin and the price doubles while the company isn't holding anything, where do they get that extra billion to cover withdraws? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:05:15
**Lightning Network:**
pay fee and wait for confirmation
pay fee to close channel
wait for confirmation
Why put up with even the slightest inconvenience if you don't have to? Or more importantly, how do you convince other people who have no loyalty to bitcoin to put up with it when there's zero benefit to doing so? I'm sorry man, I was 100% for Bitcoin at one point too and I would feel offended when I saw anyone suggest any other coin, but the world moves on. Nokia was the largest mobile vendor for 14 years. Yahoo was the most visited website in the world for a decade. MySpace was the largest social networking site in the world for 3 years. The world moves on.
Go on nanowallet.io and set up a wallet and send me an address. I'll send you a tiny bit of Nano so you can try it yourself.

You don't need that much precision, .0000000143BTC would be fine. And there are other units you can use to move the decimal. You could use nanobitcoins and call it 14.3nBTC.
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:36:59
Fuck, really? I just moved my coins from gdax to coinbase and spent almost $2.50 to send them to my wallet. Live and learn I guess. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:22:46
Yes, even stuffing $10 at a time under your mattress is worth it.

I've never seen a mathematical analysis on this sub. It's only hunches, guesses, and hindsight.

Well, right now there isn't a whole lot I can buy directly with Bitcoin. I can't pay any of my bills with it. I would have to turn it into cash first to use it anyway, but with a BTC card it would minimize my use of fiat in a way because my money would be kept as Bitcoins for as long as possible, I.E. until the moment that I actually spend it.
I see your point though, just playing devil's advocate. Honestly though, I'm not really anti-fiat. I just see BTC as an investment opportunity right now.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:06:43
Go to school and/or get started on a career if you haven't already. No matter what happens to bitcoin, you will win in the long run if you do that. Keep saving but don't bet your entire future on one thing. "Anything is possible" also means that very bad things are possible. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:12:57
That's when you buy the dip

I figured, this was directed mostly to the noobs from a noob.

I made some money doing that a few weeks ago, then I lost way more than I made. I wish I had listened to everyone who said not to, but I'm just the type of person who has to see for himself and learn the hard way. Oh well. I finally took my coins off the exchange and have been able to keep my hands of them so far. Just keep your earnings in perspective. You made $25 in a weak, but how many hours did you spend day trading? If you spent more than an hour a day then you'd have been better off working a minimum wage job.
Whatever you do, good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:54:01
It depends if you're taking the investing route or the gambling route. I tried day trading for a bit and lost every time. Most people do. You're competing with expensive bots who can analyse patterns and place orders way quicker than you, and people who have a lot more experience, education, and resources for research than you do. If you're like me and don't know what you're doing, your best bet is to hodl.
