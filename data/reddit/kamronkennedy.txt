That was a really interesting and well put together video. Gladly tipped :)
@_date: 2015-06-15 12:43:52
True, but i feel with proper and moral arbitrage it could provide a bit of liquidity. Just would have to get into forex trading a bit i guess to have it done right.
@_date: 2015-06-06 20:46:32
What about "at home cloud solution"?
What i mean is a dev board with a web UI prepared for the user to interact with the crypto daemon, kinda like how someone would use/interact with an antminer.
@_date: 2015-06-07 00:03:24
What do you mean? A tiny fraction will ever be able to afford one? 
@_date: 2015-06-15 12:44:33
Thats a good idea! Maybe donate a license or two to some ambitious individuals even to get it going?
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:09:22
....now just to actually read about it.....
Let alone use it :/
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:14:57
"less confusing"??
So, say an enthusiast wants to begin to learn how addresses work on the blockchain, and how they fit into the design of a "wallet" yet aren't able to designate which addresses are getting what sent to them.....gah....I'll stop bitching and simply switch wallet apps now.
Thanks for the info! I appreciate it
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:14:21
I mean, you're right. I feel like this is needed to show the power of bitcoin. There has got to be some services that can be offered online that would prove more profitable to the seller, and cheaper to the consumer at the same time, utilizing bitcoin.
Web hosting, or even manual labor maybe? I'm just brainstorming a couple that I think *could* be that market middle ground.
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:12:01
Oh nice! That was super quick!
I'm guessing that was my exact issue as the website is displaying properly now :)
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:59:09
I agree. That's not impossible though.

Wow, I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks a ton for the advice and answering to my extremely late reply lol
@_date: 2014-07-21 15:21:33
I feel like this applies to much more than just bitcoin, or just crypto in that matter. This is true for all form's of currency, and is the problem of being a "have" in a world of "have not's"

I used to sell things on Amazon/eBay, and were at such low prices, I had to accommodate their fee's in my price more seriously as opposed to items worth a couple hundred dollars where a couple dollar fee really isn't as substantial in comparison with the profit margin.
If I wouldn't of had to worry about those fee's, I could have sold them a bit cheaper, and at the same time, make more money per item.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:15:03
Amen! Lol, now, what shall I do? I am great with data analytics and programming.....but could use a good point in the right direction to begin any kind of tracking
Relatively new to bitcoin, and the one thing I haven't grasped yet, is how to identify a wallet/addresses owner.
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:11:35
That sounds pretty convenient. Going to check that out
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:21:56
True that. I filed a bug report. Thanks

If you don't mind me asking, what was the lesson you learned? How does PayPal catch on if you are doing moneypaks?

For one difference, SYS is it's own crypto, with everything built right in :: OpenBazaar is third party to the stakeholders in each exchange
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:33:08
Didn't this have a thread going from a while ago?
What happened to that thread? I imagine there would have been some valuable info there by now
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:11:48
How would I go about doing that?
@_date: 2014-10-09 14:21:07
True that. I am very much for this. I personally am fascinated by the idea/concept. I even would like to try it for myself. Although, considering how bad their site it, I'm curious to see how it all plays out.
So I'm with it, and support the idea, but am admitting at this point it's proven to be nothing more than the idea so far.
@_date: 2014-10-19 22:15:36
That is still less than 100 addresses though
[This one's about 1500 ](
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:41:31
Yep, that's enough for us, as well as instructions of course of how to compile/install
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:06:55
shitty :/
I used it prlly 3 or 4 times, then had no need to after, I guess I completely overlooked how short lived it was
@_date: 2014-05-05 20:57:53
I've been using them for about a month and a half now with no issues what so ever, and have been pleased with the support from the guy behind the email address. He keeps alot of procedures manual for security reasons, like changing your payout address. Which I feel shows that he is in early stages of a start up company. Also, they sell out of Gh's frequently, which, if they were a ponzi scheme like some have said, why would they turn you away from depositing money?
People will say that a big reason for skepticism is that he does not release pictures of his operation. Cryptsy won't either I recently found out, for the same reasons regarding their "suppliers" and a confidentiality agreement.
@_date: 2014-08-29 13:28:20
Why not just use Google Voice?
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:50:21
It's no problem, IDK if you are the developer of it or not, but this was posted to reddit some time ago, but now is no where to be found?
I'm guessing it has to do with the accuracy of it, which is why it is not found anymore.
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:23:17
Tis a dissapointing approach :(
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:28:44
Gotta be careful when doing your orders though, else you get caught up in spreads and it ends up being pretty expensive mistakes.
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:58:18
What is this?
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:28:00
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:28:17
Very good point, and really glad I read this. Going around begging companies and businesses to accept bitcoin is what encourages the perception of a ponzi scheme. What bitcoin has to offer, cannot be done with other currencies that exist, plain and simple.
@_date: 2014-07-23 02:26:08
I guess I don't understand how any existing currency system does that, or **could** for that matter. As long as there is someone willing to be careless with their money (in whatever form/currency) there will be someone willing to take it. Currency was not established to coddle it's users or protect their assets, but simply to transfer value. You are essentially saying that we either need to rid the population of people who are willing to trick people out of their wealth, or rid the population of people who are willing to be careless, or both.

PB Mining started out just selling the miners for profit on ebay, and had been doing that since 2012.
Changing his business model to this, he is still profiting the same on each machine, as if he sold them, AND I'm sure he is keeping a small percentage of all that is mined, creating some residual income for himself along with everyone else making money as well. Think about it for more than 60 seconds.
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:34:46
He did just start his website in January, so I'll give you that, that the site is very basic. From what I gathered from him, he is very reliant on his developer, so he is not making his own site.
On his contact page, he lists his ebay id, check that out. He has a great sellers rating, and has been in the business of selling mining equipment since 2012

Ether is looking for java developers. I interviewed with them, and everything looked great as far as the opportunity, unfortunately they would like to ask their qualified candidate to focus exclusively on ether, which I'm not willing to do so we parted ways (the lead dev and I after a few interviews and some back and forth discussions)
Check them out! Is pretty exciting times for sure
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:50:33
I think it's the thread sending that exact message to you. You're the one who came purely to hate on daft punk.

Yes, is definitely noticeable, my wallet takes about 5 minutes to load up the transactions and I'm on a Note 3 with Wifi. Takes much longer when not on WiFi.
Granted, most pools pay the same way, but the bigger pools will split up the payments to multiple transactions. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:02:58
Hard to tell without a UI :)
But, as of now, simply that SYS is closer to being released and available for use. I'm sure there is more that others more educated than I can explain, but I also find it hard to compare products where neither are exactly ready for heavy consumer use yet. I'm also not as familiar with the back end of OpenBazaar enough to really explain a well prepared comparison.
@_date: 2014-11-07 08:13:02
The timing simply is not right. Not right now. 
He's not a being that can be called upon, but simply shows up, and when he shows up, there is no stopping the rally. There will be a rise in anticipation, a rise in anxiousness, and of course a rise in value. Then he will show, and when he does, tips will truly poor everywhere, it will boost the morale and his contagious enthusiasm will ensue.
Patience, belief and generosity. The guy has a set path to the moon, sadly that path did not cross your post :(
Purely speaking from experience of having seen him reveal himself on multiple occasions. He is a spirit of this community, not a tip bot.

@_date: 2014-11-11 06:01:20
I'm actually not sure, I have yet to try to import anything. 
I could create addresses elsewhere and import them I bet (even though I haven't tried the import yet) but I feel I shouldn't have to. A feature of bitcoin wallets is to **create addresses**. Having to do the latter would be a "hack" IMO

This guy had return on his money
Good words found on bitcoinewz and bitcoin talk
I bought 15Gh at about 0.11 BTC, deposit went smooth, and have been in communication with them daily as they were actually sold out of Gh.
Also, if you look through their eBay history, they have been selling mining equipment since 2012, then all of a sudden, changed their approach and started selling mining contracts on eBay in January of this year. They are new to cloud mining, yes, but I think they will be here for a while. Also, check this out on Amazon. It costs $700 roughly, and is 180GH (on the low standard end, without overclock) 180 * 0.0075 = 1.35 BTC * $570 (low rate right now) = $769.50
I bet they are getting the machines much cheaper than that on some place like aliexpress, but still, $69.50 profit per machine right away and I'm sure he will be keeping a small percentage of all mining, which at this rate will be some good residual income on 5 year contracts.
This is no scam.

Most important thing about bitcoin as a financial system (IMO) you don't need to trust bitcoin.
Every time I've heard of someone losing their coin, it was from their own mistake, or from them being fooled. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:28:30
I swear I rmbr seeing the same headline near the end of 2013, regarding it going mainstream in 2014 :/
Lol, In 2016, when everyone is already using bitcoin to escape the banks evil clutches, will we see, **Bitcoin going mainstream 2017**
Microsoft accepts it, Dell accepts it, and indirectly we have Amazon, Wal Mart, Target.....This is mainstream guys. Shit like this is purely about hyping it up or keeping n00bs intrigued.

If you have no experience whatsoever in programming, start with python until you get the gist of programming. It's very simple syntax, you can get a [free IDE here]( and it's a well known language so online support is only a search away. It'll help you get that "systematic thought process" habitually formed into your brain, which is what is necessary for programming.
Once you are thinking sequentially, and can envision the flow of a program in your head, move on to C++. That is what bitcoin was originally written in. 
Also, don't hold yourself to one language. They all have different strengths, and there is no single right answer that can solve every problem. A good programmer can hop into any language, get acquainted, and get to work; bad programmers, or inexperienced programmers, are the ones telling you to study [a single language] because they were able to find a job doing it and haven't needed anything else, so they disregard all other languages. 
Also, you'll find what you want to specialize in once things have "clicked" for you, and you have been working a while. It's like the age old question "What do you want to be when you grow up", don't stress it or try too hard on a single language, pay more attention to what's going on behind the scenes of your code, and you will be as versatile as Java ;) [without the ball and chain of course...cuz youre human....not code]

I share the same sentiment, but I feel this is what it should be:
"Re-imagine business transactions with **a** blockchain"
Yes, lowercase. A blockchain is a fairly novel concept (tying hashes together such that the data is immutable without changing the entire blockchain). Combining this concept with a peer-to-peer network is what truly makes what people refer to as "The Blockchain" (generally referring to bitcoin, or whatever cryptocurrency is being discussed in context).
There theoretically can be an unlimited number of blockchains in existence, each handling their own sets of data. Just like there are millions of databases in the world, there will be millions of blockchains in the world. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 00:38:37

@_date: 2015-04-02 21:29:11
No not at all! :) I thought it was supposed to be an encouraging message lol, if that wasn't the case then I guess I took it the wrong way. Seems it worked out regardless though :)

@_date: 2015-11-27 21:28:17
I really do appreciate you taking the time to point that out here. I'm going to go against my previous judgement and will try to reach out in these places. At this point I still need reviews more so than advertising.
@_date: 2015-11-18 23:40:04
Correct, this is true. Was I "over the top" some how?
@_date: 2015-11-27 20:51:01
Think so? The reason I felt that way is because I'm trying to target people who are interested in bitcoin but don't know enough about it yet.
I figured the people who are trafficking bitcoin related websites are either researching on their own, and not choosing to learn from a book, or are already aware of bitcoin and would not be a suitable audience for my book.
@_date: 2015-11-19 16:14:18
Technically I can't distribute the book outside of Amazon, but I will PM you what I can do :)
@_date: 2015-11-19 16:24:06
Is that a necessary thing for beginners though? I'm do touch on cryptography for a page or two, but I don't want to dive too deep into it and confuse the reader. I've already gotten some feedback that I put too much info in there regarding mining and cryptography in general.
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:30:50
Thank you! :D
If you'd be willing, you should shoot me a PM to your book, would love to take a look
@_date: 2015-11-18 22:15:31
Wow....I had to pick my jaw up off the floor there lol
I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to read and respond with the detail that you did. This is the first peice of quality feedback I've had on the book, and man...I cannot thank you enough for it :D
I think you are right, I do need to add some edge to that intro to make it more grabbing. Maybe not so much throughout the rest of the book, as I do want to try and remain unbiased on alot of subjects, but the intro is not the same kind of medium I feel. So yes, I think you are right about that. The title too, maybe you are right about that as well. If I were to change it, now would be the time before I start making paperback copies :)
10/10 is not bad for my first piece of feedback!
Thanks again
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:03:39
I only use http for the web UI, POST requests only for the api and the pages themselves have no power even if you can get past the pw protection to the UI.
I just use the binaries that are created from the make command.
Again, if I can easily replace ubuntu and my configurations with Peerbox and ARch, I'd really like to for the sake of the device and it's users.


I'm not sure why this would be **necessary**. I can see obviously why it would have it's benefits, but is it really necessary? If people want ultimate security, places your coins on a device like mine and unplug it, throw it in a safe, or take it a step further and store coins under a priv key that's only been printed on paper and only exists under your lock and key.


Again, I understand the benefits of a firewall, but I don't beleive anything fancy is needed here since all ports are shut down aside from 8080 for the web application to be served local IPs only.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:07:10
I answered a similar question in more detail here in this thread:
But, Yes. Uninstalled ssh all together, and the tomcat server has been configured to only allow communication from IP's within the LAN default gateway range. All further suggestions are welcome.
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:47:20
Of course! Cheers :D
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:34:05
Okay np, but yea do be sure to check out the white paper, we're not replacing the functionality of any other hardware peice out there. In fact, it would be a pleasure as the developer to one day build out an interface with other devices.
I've been looking into using multibit, but i havent gotten anything conclusive yet. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 14:50:02
Smaller than a deck of cards, yes. Running linux.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:50:41
I mean, if someone's computer is "hacked" and compromised, and they lose their coins people don't start going after the bitcoin foundation for not accounting for it in their QT. We've all seen it happen, but I've never seen someone try to blame the foundation or any other wallet provider without the community letting them know of their unfortunate lack of wisdom (idk a better way to explain getting trolled lol).
What type of environment are you preparing for with peerbox? I'm only preparing for a controlled LAN environment (much like someones own desktop computer/mobile their using to read this)
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:51:17
There is definitely still a safety measure, any web accessed components of the device are password protected. And yes, it is a complete ubuntu machine, so everything is accessible.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:35:46
You don't feel like that's a bit over-engineered? and what I mean by that, is do people go through all this to install a basic QT on their local desktop to hold their coins?
While I understand the need for security for servers that are open to the public, this device is hardly different than that type of scenario of the user holding coins on their own computer (except this device/computer has no "head").
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:58:23

@_date: 2015-03-31 17:09:20
Just looked into Peerbox, I'd really appreciate your critcism :D harsh or not lol, would be valuable never the less.
Am I understanding correctly that I could actually be using Arch and your extension and ditch ubuntu all together?
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:55:52
Of course :) You can buy the devices right now at:
Just scroll down and you will see the bitcoin payment option. We do plan to accept coins that have a liquid market and could sustain our business (pay for parts), but there is alot of coins that could benefit from having a dedicated device, but the markets couldn't sustain us always dumping. For now, it's just bitcoin, and our suppliers accept bitcoin so no needing to dump that :)
In the future, we *may* built in multi wallet functionality. But, it would have it's own dedicated product name and version. Right now yea it's a 1 crypto per device product.

I feel there are hundreds of folks trying to get into Bitcoin for the *get rich quick* factor and end up making costly mistakes in one way or another. This is simply an general introduction to the space aimed towards these folks to ideally steer them in the right direction.

Very true, that's a pretty good bet that they've heard of bitcoin but not yet fully dove in. There's more demographics inside of the age range not covered here, but generally this would be a good start I feel.

A locally installed apache tomcat server. Aside from the P2P comm for the daemon, there is no other network activity that will come from this device (that speaks with the 'outside' world).
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:04:37
Not trying to disect your comment, but just trying to keep my response organized :) (good questions)


Yes you're right. The set up and configuration of the device is no small task on it's own though. Then the web UI offers a degree of convenience without breaching any security concerns that we can account for. The benefit of this device is having a dedicated machine for someone to stake and/or hold their coins, while offering a convenient interface for you to use to receive/send coins or do any financial balancing you need to.
* Did you implement any hardening for underlying OS?
Yes. Uninstalled ssh all together, and the tomcat server has been configured to only allow communication from IP's within the LAN default gateway range. All further suggestions are welcome.
* Are the coin daemons properly isolated and sanboxed?
"isolated and sandboxed"? What exactly do you mean by this? A sandbox could be considered an environment where mistakes will not impact overall function of the existing system you're building on, which wouldn't really be ideal for a deployed product. Something being isolated could be considered deployed to a controlled environment (like a hardened OS) so yes I believe I've accomplished this as well.
* Do you compile binaries of the coin daemons on your own, if so can you guarantee quality of binaries.
Yes, I use git to clone the repo provided by the coin devs and "make" them myself when preparing the img for a coin. Verifying checksums of the repo packages would be how the process is verified to not have been a victim of a MITM.
* How is your Web UI implemented and how does it communicate with coin daemons?
It's a java web application kept modular enough to work with the standard json-rpc interface of cryptocurrencies (which has remained intact for the most part from coin to coin, some offering more functionality, some offering less, some offering the same buy with different naming conv's). It's deployed to a tomcat7 server installed to the ubuntu OS. 
* Do you offer auto-detection of device IP or user has to figure it out on his own?
Yes the device by default will get it's own IP address from the DHCP settings of your hardwired router. To configure the IP address or any other network configurations, you would have to plug the device into a monitor and use the terminal. This is something we will build into future versions, but for this version instructions would be provided online.
* Is communication between device and Web UI secured, if so how?
The web UI is served from the device itself, and hosted right on the device. The device is configured to only communicate with devices on the LAN (aside from the daemons P2P comm) and is even then password secured by a password the user has to set on the initial set up of the device.

The web UI comes right from the device

We'll see how it goes for sure

Awesome, good. I hadnt seen any yet so wanted to be atleast one warning out there.
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:07:48
Well, we've tested our own system with incorrect addresses but correct zip codes, and the card wasn't accepted.
We will be modifying as needed and making changes, we will always be learning :)

You da real MVP.
@_date: 2015-11-11 20:01:31
That's not a bad idea, would need to work my way into them somehow, possibly through like minded students who already are aware of bitcoin and hope to educate others
@_date: 2015-11-18 18:28:53
You rock :) I appreciate it!
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:06:24
It was a thought but we're honestly still discussing github and OS'ing my software. A concern is someone else using our work to jump right to the same point we are right now. Any ideas?
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:49:54
Couple weeks now, we've talked to our account reps and they didn't tell us to not do it, just warned us about chargebacks which is why you have to provide the name/address that's on your card and agree to the TOS
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:56:58
If someone stole your card, AND knows your billing address, then that's not our problem, but the customers, and we'll fight to prove it.
This is why we collect all the info we do, because transactions that happen with stolen CC's, typically only need the CC number and maybe CVC, for this, you need much more

Your username holds up ;)

Hivemind or something similar could definitely disrupt society and is amazing in theory, but I share the sentiments that it has a low chance of success. Plus, how is this in the layman's hands in terms of us being able to do something? Users piling up on something like hivemind won't make it a success.
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:23:42
So, continue to spread adoption essentially?
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:59:48
Shit happens. You can never stop corruption 100% but there could be laws put in place to regulate political finances better, or tax money as well.
Governments will eventually move to cryptocurrencies, imo. Not bitcoin, but their own applications and systems.

To be fair, a question that remains is: "What can we do?"
Even developers, what can we do?
Places have been denied donations and already turned to bitcoin. Dark Net Markets have become damn near franchise opportunities since Silk Road (dime a dozen). Business models that otherwise couldn't prosper, already are thanks to crypto/bitcoin.
So, what more is there to do? What are the next steps? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:09:31
I mean....but Bitcoin already is looked at to provide a certain amount of social justice through verification of transactions/wealth. For instance: Imagine if we could just look at the blockchain to see exactly how much money was given to your least favorite politician by E. corp? (figurative)
IMO, this is where altcoins fit into the picture, to serve more needs such as anonymity and lower barriers.
I still feel like this article is more of a detailed, lengthy complaint then it is any kind of actual substance or relevant solution exploration (which is what I was expecting). We all know Bitcoin could be doing bigger and better things, but it's not. Mainly because of the players in the game who actually matter, not us who are actually effected.
