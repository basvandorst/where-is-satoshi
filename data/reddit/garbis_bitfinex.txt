Hey, 
I am really sorry for not getting back to you. I have created a special thread on our subreddit yesterday as there are some other users experiencing delays.
Would you mind posting the ticket number in here? On a good note, many of the withdrawals have been received already and the list I created is being shrieked every day.

I am not ignoring you, and please understand that from my end there's nothing I can do to speed it up. I am really sorry about the whole situation, I know for how long you've been waiting and the amount involved. As the matter is now with Citibank and not with us, we have to wait for our finance processor to conclude their investigation.

Hey, sorry about my delayed reply. My colleagues have asked for the form from Crypto Capital Corp, they handle our FIAT finance. I will reply to your ticket directly as soon as I receive it. 
On another note, I have informed our legal department of the delay and I will also include any details I get in an email. 
Thank you

Thanks for the update, I'm sorry it's still not resolved. I will follow-up with the finance team and see if I can get an update for you. Last time I replied to your email they were waiting for the bank to complete the transfer.

I haven't heard anything, and unfortunately I can't give you an ETA, as I am not aware of what is going on with the bank or your transfer. What I do know is that my colleagues are sending follow-up emails every day. As you can appreciate, the matter is now with Citibank and we have no control over it. 
Again, I am really sorry for this inconvenience, and you should know that as long as we can do something to help you, we will.

They're internal emails and cc-ing you would represent a breach, apologies for that. I know your case very well and I am monitoring it daily too, as part of my community management task.

Sorry about the delay in my reply, I haven't yet been given an update on your transfer, as in what is the status. My colleague from the finance team assured me that they are pushing every day to have the funds returned. It's a really unpleasant situation for us too as it was not expected, nor wanted. 
I have your ticket details pinned in my tasks list and I monitor it every day, it's been like this since our first contact.
