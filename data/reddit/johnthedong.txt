Just to add on this, I've been running a pruned blockchain (that actually relays blocks with the newest version) in a Scaleway server lately. It takes a few days to catch up with the blocks, and rendering it pretty much useless due to the lag, but once it catches up it actually runs with capacity for other services. (lightweight chat bots etc). I've set the cap for the blockchain at 30GB's. 
It actually takes some time to figure out how to compile it on Scaelway, but here's how I did it.
Git clone the newest bitcoind, and run the following:
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
./configure --disable-wallet
make install

Welp, which offer again? I've been really back on my stuff lately, and the forum going down doesn't really help much with it.....

Holy crap. Theymos, any estimates on this? I think I do have the updated backups on my NAS back in my country though, but I'll need some time to stream this over.

Ah, I see. Hopefully I'll get my stuff in order soon (was planning for next week but the forums are down atm) and start considering long-term stuff like this. Thanks again for the offer!

Oh God, the DNS isn't stolen or anything - stop spreading FUD. It's due to Sirius changing registrars and forgetting to point the new registrar here. -_-;

And I wanted to clear my escrow backlog last night too...

Yeah, I can confirm that. I think Stefan has the server admin rights but I might be wrong though. I do not have server access.

PS: Damn, I was planning to release the escrows just now &gt;.&lt;
