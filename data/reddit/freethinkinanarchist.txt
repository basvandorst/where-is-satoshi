I think you're off by orders of magnitudes. Crypto's market cap is 163 billion. Gold is 7.8 trillion.

Adding to what said, buying alt coins as a hedge is kinda useless since they're so highly correlated to bitcoin. When bitcoin falls, they fall harder; when bitcoin rises, they rise slower. There's really no reason to diversify into heavily correlated assets (unlike in the stock market, where diversification is king, since most stocks aren't this heavily correlated).
I only buy alt coins in my overnight millionaire fund. Whenever I have a hundred or something dollars left, I buy shitcoins and hope they mooon so I can be a millionaire overnight. I don't see them as investments, as much as lottery tickets.

This is a very nuanced area, and I can't do it justice in a single comment, but there's a lot of resources out there that give fact-based counter-points to Stefan's arguments. But I'll just address a few points:
Regarding third world immigration:
Lots of third-world immigrants end up being very successful in the USA. By ancestry, [Indian Americans are one of the richest ethnic groups in the US, and they tend to be highly educated too]( with Lebanese and Sri Lankan Americans not far behind. Just because an immigrant's home country is in a bad shape, it doesn't mean there is something fundamentally wrong with the immigrant himself. China was dirt poor in the 20th century, but it's a behemoth now. India is poor right now, but it's rapidly urbanizing. Just taking a screenshot of a country at a single point in time, and then generalizing that about all immigrants from that country doesn't do their population justice. Obviously, we need to rigorously vet immigrants; but issuing a blanket statement that all third-world immigrants are bad is not a fair statement.
Regarding Black IQs:
It's also not fair to say blacks are genetically less intelligent by using current IQ scores/SAT tests. Yes, it is an indisputable fact that blacks score less than Whites/Asians/Indians; but there are a lot of nutritional (both pre and post-natal) and cultural issues that can be the reason behind these lower scores, as historically Blacks have tended to have less access to proper nutrition and to a nurturing family environment. It's not right to just use these scores to say they're genetically inferior.
As I said, Stefan is a very intelligent person and there is some merit to what he is saying. But I disagree with the scope behind his conclusions, and I find that his conclusions are the equivalent of using a blowtorch to get rid of a bedbug problem. There are real social implications to what he advocates, and there will be real people who will be drastically affected by these policies, were they to be implemented by his ideal government.

I mean, just because you're in a green because you're an early adopter, doesn't mean everyone is. Real people lost a lot of money when they bought in at $15k+. I believe BTC will rebound back up so I'm not really worried, but it's not easy to stomach that much of a loss for so long for many.

I don't think it's a matter of just not knowing how to open an account to short. You can't short bitcoin properly since the markets that allow shorting are cash-settled. It allows for very easily manipulations since there's no actual deliverables. Here's a quick tweet on the subject:
Don't get me wrong, I'm pro-BTC obv (why else would I be here). But let's not pretend the competition are just pure idiots. It's fine to disagree.

The only things I disagree with is the world peace thing and making us more empathetic. It brings all the worlds' nations closer since bitcoin is literally a borderless currency. The dude in Chile/China/India/Argentina/Mexico/etc. buying my coin believes in the tech just as much as me.

This is false. In a deflationary currency, employees will experience pay cuts that are kept in pace with deflation. It's the equivalent to employers giving pay raises to keep pace with inflation. If the employer does not cut your pay in accordance with deflation rate, it's equivalent to you gaining a raise. In other words, that won't be the default.

There's actually several that immediately spring into my mind. I used to follow him way back before the Europe migrant crisis, and after he voiced a few opinions that bordered on white supremacism, I stopped following him. But here's a couple:

There are a lot more examples, even entire videos focused on matters like these.
Stefan is obviously an intelligent person, but it's hard to stay receptive to someone who thinks you're genetically less intelligent and are predisposed to failure.
As a disclaimer: This comment is not meant as a rebuttal of Stefan's points, but just a way to elucidate why I stopped following him. There's a lot of others who disagree with Stefan and use facts and proper scientific research to back up their arguments. If you want counter-points, there's a lot of resources out there; but this comment is my own opinion.

Yeah, that's a fair point, but that doesn't really aid the community. The idea is not only to reward companies that accept BTC, but also to convert others to the cause. If companies like MSFT see that accepting BTC is profitable, it is more likely for more mainstream companies to do the same. That's the only real way to win.
It shouldn't be a crime to disagree. Rather than punish, we should use the opportunity to show them why they're wrong and convert them over.

I really want to watch and enjoy his content, but a lot of Stefan's videos border on White Supremacism/ethnonationalism. I mean, that's his right and prerogative to believe in anything he wants and I'm not trying to take away anything from him.
He has some very interesting ideas about personal liberties that I want to be receptive to, but his stances make it very difficult for me to watch his videos since I'm not white.

It's more expensive to do business in a developed country rather than in a developing country. You're paying for the academic and legal framework that allows for the migitation of the risk of the procedure.
You only see the monetary costs; take into account the risk of performing the procedure in a third world country like Ukraine, and you'll find the costs a lot more equitable.

I can agree with this statement applying to politicians and gov't officials. But Buffet is a free market titan. He has to be good to get to where he is right now; the free market is not a cake walk. It's far different from just convincing some rubes to vote you into office.

That's EXACTLY why I'm also buying bitcoin while still investing in the stock market. No harm in playing the double game.

I'm curious about how this would work. I imagine it's a lot easier to pull off in the service industry, since you can just keep transactions off-the-record. But in healthcare, when you're dealing with patient records, I imagine it's a lot harder.
Tho, I wonder if the IRS is allowed to cross verify patient records for their audit, if it ever comes to it. I imagine not, so that might make it safer to do something like this.

I'm never selling mine, and the ones I do buy shit with, I'm replacing as soon as possible. My BTC portfolio will be passed down to my descendants fully intact and worth millions, hopefully.

I feel the same way about Gates. Dude wiped out Polio from half the world. A part of the reason why people from developing countries can even buy bitcoin is because of him. He's incredible.

Nah, he probably was on this subreddit the past 200,000 times the joke was made this month.
