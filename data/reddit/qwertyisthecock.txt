Nice, how many hacks does ETH have to endure before people realize there is a problem. Do you remember when eth had to fork to get peoples millions of dollars back? At least when bitcoin forked from a code error, no one lost money, because it was only worth pennies. Talk about shill 
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:21:23
It impossible that 
Bcash will ever be anything more than an altcoin :( 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:00:05
so hypothetically saying all this fud is true... who is bitfinex giving hundreds of millions of usdt to? And where do i sign up? This whole thing, if true, would actually raise the price and  not drop it because there would be no trade pair to go out to. unless its some other alt. like eth,ltc, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:44:13
oh boy! Please tell me what altcoin you are in that solves all the problems flawlessly and isn't just MORE speculative vaporware? And before you make an utter fool of yourself, realize that I own many altcoins and hold btc as well. So go on. 
Let me guess cardano, neo, and vechain are on the list? Shill
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:57:29
The difference between your shitty stock choices and btc, is btc solves an actual problem. Go back to your peng peng thread
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:11:38
No shilling. Im actually mostly in alts right now waiting for this news to pop. If you read the question, you would see I am having a hard time grasping how if usdt is being "printed" who owns it? Who is completing the buy orders of real btc on the exchange? What is happening to all the actual usd(or other fiat) (in the millions/billions btw) That is being deposited to bitfinex?? 
thanks. Once again, not shilling. asking real questions here.

I am not sure..... that was the logic you presented to me. You made the argument, so please realize the burden of proof is on you. You should educate yourself on logical fallacies. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:48:25
Right, I get it. It's called moving the goal post. I made a claim, you stated it was incorrect due to % lost. I never said it was the highest percent lost, I said points. So I am sorry you you have to move goal posts due to your insatiable appetite to be right. 
On the other hand, how am I losing when I have MORE bitcoin then I ever have had before AND more $ then I have ever had before? I am not in the red. The market may be, but anecdotal evidence is just that, IE you are in the red if you bought at 19000.

Btc is the least of our problems if quantum cracking actually comes to fruition.  Quantum computing is so expensive,  the cost to crack in the near future would be impossible.  Think year 2k. Was a problem but easily averted. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:46:33
$180 to $18000 it was a calculated risk. After it doubled topped 20k I decided to make a business decision, and so far I have correct. I have been buying of every daily low since and almos 100% back in with much more holdings than before(albeit less $ amounts, but that stuff is worthless anyway)
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:58:26
Nice.  Please post your short so we know you didn't actually buy at 9500 yesterday and now are raging us all.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:58:44
Speak for yourself. Some of us assessed the risks responsibly and sold at 18k noticing it is always a bad idea to buy at the top. Sorry for your hard lesson in hodling.

Wow, 1600 &gt; 500. Do you even math, bro? It is significant. You should keep trying though. You can move the goal post as much as you want... 
I have lost $ amount in the last two months yes, but have more btc AND more alts due to this dip. I have been here since 2011, my dollar cost into btc is roughly around $180. Sorry you like to project your misfortune on others. Keep trying.

Not everyone is in america, dude. plus. What's 20% when you made 500%
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:05:05
I admitted I made an educated decision, based on clear signs, that luckily turned out to be right. I never said I knew, could tell to future or anything. You literally assumed that. I if returned to 15% above my sell, I would have made another educated decision to buy in again, even if I was bull trapped. Don't confuse smarts with reading comprehension.

Or if you buy and sell into Tether, you NEVER owe taxes. Just be sure to send all your trades to the IRS to prove you owe nothing. Win win.

This article from some jackass that spends most of their time on r/conspiracy and political news, you have no idea what you are talking about. 
What about in 2008 when I was holding the bag on my three houses that fell 50% in value? I was told by the realtor i could fix them up and sell them for double what I paid.... seems that was a bigger fraud, with more investors, and more scams than btc... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:21:02
read the context. It doesn't matter. I stated the largest point drop in history, never commented on whats worse or whatever. This ass clown wanted to argue with me. Which is why he deleted his post. He knew he was wrong.

What about apple? Or the Dow in general. Even a fully regulated, fully vested system like the NYSE can't escape pump and dumps. 
NYSE biggest drop in history. BTC is only 9 years old, NYSE over 100. 
Don't you look dumb now. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:22:01
It's on a fairly downward trajectory, more so than btc. You sure about thaat?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:54:25
I am 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:11:44
yes. The bad thing is they report that 1099k and now you have the burden of proof to show you are within the regulations. Got a 1099k and didn't report it on your end because you knew you didn't owe anything (bought and transfered but never sold)? Well get ready for an audit in a few years that will be so invasive, you'll be paying tax on that $550 you got from grandma for you graduation present.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:39:43
When this audit comes out,  and everything is fine,  does this ONE idiot on Twitter make a public apology and reimburse us all for our losses? I'm sure I can find a lawyer  that would love to pursue him for his involvement.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:23:45
Hey how about you eat a dick? Does that sound good. Eat your own little baby dick. I didn't call it the biggest drop in history. The media did. Dow experiences its biggest drop in history today. over 1600 points in trade session. You should go read a little and educate yourself.

It is not completely different. It is the same analogous. Y2k threated security and functionality at the same time. Quantum computing will hurt literally every aspect of live, including btc. The analogy is the same, because we knew of the issue years before it happened, and everyone over reacted to it effect and thought it would be an incurable problem.

Tthe third is getting that 1099k at the end of the year that says you bought 4 bitcoins and now owe 20% of $80,000 although you bought all 4 back in january of 17 and put 6500 into the system. Utter bull.
