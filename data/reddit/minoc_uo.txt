Discover is 1% on all purchases, but double everything at end of first year.  Then they have 5% quarterly, like restaurant ir whole sale clubs.   Then some kinda coupon deals.
They have a good app on par with cap1.   
But what happened with Capital One?

I had no idea what a 'future' is.  From following bitcoin my understanding is now this:  People place bets for a stock(bitcoin) to drop.  If it drops, they make money. 
They are now pumping bitcoin and will then make it fall to make a lot of money.
