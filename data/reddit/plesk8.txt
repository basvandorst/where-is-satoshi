Wouldn't a simple alternative be to buy VPS space w/ fast internet, and send your shares to yourself on the VPS where your node is?  This would make you as a solo miner effectively running your own pool, but you're the only one submitting shares to yourself. And, as we know, Stratum shares are incredibly small and traffic conservative for the slow home connection.

Yes the luck is known (as in a coin toss = 50/50)
The pool tracks the blocks found vs. the probability of the blocks being found given the number of tosses (miners/hashing on the pool)
I pulled some stats published by the pool [here](
Pool Luck* (3D / 1W / 2W / 1M / 3M / 1Y / All Time)
59.314% / 68.126% / 75.325% / 75.604% / 88.919% / 93.439% / 96.109%
*Luck is how much each share was paid compared to 2% fee PPS (neutral luck/expected earnings). All-Time calculations started in Sept 2013.

I guess I missed Gavin saying anything about committing anything to XT.


Far too theoretical.
Even if it does, it happens. Who's to say he won't be considered to have done the right thing in the end, should the network accept the new version of Core.?
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:42:44
I see you point. I think I disagree that this change will cause any serious issue. And I also don't think the consensus model is at risk. I do not believe for a second anyone would stay on a fork that isn't the majority, everyone has too  much of a stake to keep it a single Bitcoin.
Its one of those things where, we should see this kind of debate on changing something more significant (like block times, total BTC, halving schedule, etc.  This particular change (block size) is so benign its retarded we're wasting so much energy on it.

How has the current debate *NOT* been decentralized and transparent?
It's been all over Reddit for cripe's sake. And, countless other sites, podcasts, blogs, twitter, and forums we're constantly getting links to.
WTF is *not* decentralized and transparent about it?
Now, if it were taking place only on a single forum where the BIP process happens and developers frequent: some "official" place or structure. That would be *less* decentralized and *less* transparent.
Is this post advocating for one particular version of Debate - the favorite of the submitter?

Nobody is saying the network will split. it won't. It will move onto a new rule or it won't.
People's opinions are split, sure, but one side will soon have to forget their stuff and move on, when Bitcoin (and the network) chooses for them.
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:01:31
There's the softer side of business to also consider: Marketing.
"Bitcoin Network votes to limit transaction capability and make it more expensive to transact."
^ this would be a shitty headline..
Bitcoin is the miner's product. As a company, the miner's do have a product that needs to be well liked, so people will buy it from them, since they are selling it.  The network, and therefore, BTC currency is the miner's product, they have an interest in having satisfied and happy customers who perceive it as the future.
A company can't be completely selfish an still survive.
edit: I mean to say: a company will be selfish to make more $ in the long term, but that looks, in the short term, like taking a few hits (acting in the interests of customers) in exchange for future returns.

At this point it's like, 3 people who don't want to get it over with and raise the size.
Time to make some proposals and let the network of consensus vote. Isn't that why Bitcoin is a consensus mechanism?
Make 3 versions
* 1. no change
* 2. 20 MB blocks
* 3. self-adjusting block size via algorithm
* 4. other?
Let the players decide, see which the network chooses, and let the longest chain win.
The voting system is built-in for shit's sake.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:38:45
The vote isn't the core devs, the vote is the network accepting a new version. The devs ought make a few different versions and *put them up for a vote* which means: give us node operators options, and let us install the software we want, and let the longest chain win.
Edit: preventing the network from having client options by extending discussion indefinitely is essentially like preventing a vote from the voting populous. This is also known as a **filibuster.**
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:43:45

we already decreased the size once. 
And, I have a different view than you about how likely a fork is with some parties refusing to accept a new version. I simply think a consensus would happen before the actual fork rules went into effect.  For this reason: *how suicidal and costly it is for any given party to diverge from the consensus*

Bitcoin XT is a project run by Mike Hearn, are you saying Gavin just defers over to XT?  Gavin doesn't currently have commit access to the XT project..
Another scenario is Gavin revokes commit access to other devs on Bitcoin Core and makes the block size increase and publishes a release. Once the change is accepted by the network (if it is), then Bitcoin Core is opened back up for business as usual.


Far too theoretical. No evidence this would happen. Additionally, the network is resilient. Anti-fragile. A fix would be found as soon as something serious went awry, and implemented soon after.

@_date: 2015-06-08 17:58:06
not exactly.
the follow-up fork to 'fix' the possibly too-big block size could easily be scripted to accept larger blocks *only* inside the range where we were all had consensus for the short-time to accept them, and then stop accepting them down the road (specific bock # later)
This way anybody who transacted in those larger blocks would still have their transactions recognized.


A currency that can explore something new, and adapt back if the new way had some concerns arising, is a currency that I WOULD have faith in.
In contrast, a currency with debate ad nauseam about a change such as this, is beginning to erode several people's faith in the currency, including mine.

If you've got a significant enough investment to actually mine real, whole blocks on your home DSL..... Then why, and how would you not find some faster connection, or rent space from a VPS, or move to some place where there is fast internet available?
The investment required to mine and submit blocks on your own is relatively gigantic to the point where it virtually eliminates anybody using the word "home" as base for their their operation, they've gone commercial at that point.
Do we really have a true use-case for this kind of "home" solo mining? Like, will anybody practically do it or are we imagining a scenario that doesn't exist, or that 1 guy somewhere does?  I'm actually [serious] asking this, I haven't heard of anybody mining (since maybe 2013) who doesn't have the cash to buy a VPS for their node and send in shares (like a pool, using stratum) or invest in a faster connection, or move where there is one.
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:49:05
Forks will be temporary only. Give me a 20mb option, let somebody with balls propose we move there and give a date, let the nodes start expressing their acceptance by upgrading to the new version, and there won't be forks. There will be a new rule or there won't.
@_date: 2015-06-25 21:56:55
What cost exists, if any, to the Bitcoin network, when some nodes act differently than others?
What kind of complications and implications arise when a node won't relay every transaction (when its run out of bandwidth) or sends things very slowly or not at all.  Would Bitcoin need to be segregated into fast nodes and slow nodes? Responsive nodes and maybe-responsive nodes?
I actually don't know the answers, I'm asking as a system architect. I have some questions/concerns as to what this would do to our software "product".

there is no way to know this. Preventing action until we can prove there is no risk, is essentially status quo forever. Some things actually require existing in real life to know how they will work... similar to Bitcoin, several doubted that it would work on theory alone.. Satoshi had the balls to put it into action to see how it would work. And, it turns out, in real life, it works.

I thought i'd read yesterday Gavin was working a code for 8mb blocks, doubling every 2 years... this was not part of BIP 100
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:58:41
If they're a small miner finding maybe 1 block every few weeks, they don't want to risk their found block not getting around to all the nodes quick enough, so they keep it small in size by keeping transactions out of it.
If it was a big block, there is a chance (which is still very, very small) of them losing their block because in the time it took to send around the network, a different miner found a block and got accepted by a larger majority of the network as coming first..  In this case the poor miner's only success in 2 weeks got "orphaned" and the block with their 25 BTC reward was "beat out" in the tiebreaker done by the network and they no longer have a valid 25 BTC in their found block.
For this to happen, another block would have to be found by another miner probably within the same second, maybe 2.
But, I can understand the overcautious approach a very small miner would take here.
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:55:24
What if he is being a great combination of a (1) leader and (2) technically objective.
There are infinite things to consider, nobody can consider them all. Mike &amp; Gavin are super sharp, and I trust they have considered enough.
A leader pushes for action an moves forward in the face of no agreement around him/her.  A leader understands that you don't know outcomes before you try.. Instead you choose, after consideration but without certainty, your course of action, and then take steps to be sure it doesn't fail.
From what I can see, these guys are doing a good job of  being both, as good as human beings can.
Contrast that with Adam.. He's arguably technically skewed (having a personal interest in lightning). Although nobody can argue he's not damn sharp.
Adam's leadership, however, seems to consist of scare tactics and desperate yelling. He's got a nice idea that's way too far from ready for prime time.  I'm not sure where his objectivity rests, in proposing nothing that's actually ready to do, just some ideas and thoughts and telling us all to wait, stop.. He just doesn't have it.  Honestly, he's starting to sound like a crybaby.
Mike is very right in saying: A fork won't happen. The code will include measures to be sure things only change if there is adequate consensus.  As far as I'm concerned, this whole "its contentios!" business is only there because Adam and a few others are making it that way. The technical side will have no contention. The dialogue is contentious of course, but that's only because we have some individuals choosing to continue to create contention. They *could* just stop.

@_date: 2015-06-18 17:36:22
My view is that they see one fork as preferable to many.
Even if only 1 hard fork was required (i.e. BIP 100), then it gets messy, not clean, strange w/ voting, etc.
I think their assessment is that there won't be any significant risk to make it much bigger, now. At least, any risks of a large size now are smaller than benefits of making *one* clean, simple change, that won't need to be worried about for a while, giving alternative solutions a time to mature.
Also, I tend to agree that "stop, we shouldn't do it all at once" risks are overblown, and theoretical. While legitimate thought experiments, nobody knows those worries are any more or less valid than the next people's.
As we've discussed. Pick your "side" as it were, and march forward, don't stand still. There is no way to find consensus on this.

I honestly don't see any other way than to propose something, get some followers, do your best diligence, and just make the change. I think any group/idea should/can do this. And, beautifully, Bitcoin's built-in consensus will be the deciding vote in the end.
I wish we could have a more *nice* and *clean* method, but I don't see any.
Since we're so adamant that there is no board, no 'experts', no voting populous, and nobody who should "depart from the group", and no ability to count, represent, or poll any said group, I think we should be equally willing to lose similar concepts such as "contention" and "consensus". Those are as outdated as hierarchy structures.

It does seem sudden and hilarious, like an idea out of nowhere. Bitcoin is better a settlement layer and we should deliberately make it more difficult to transact with Bitcoin? WTF? Seriously. WHAT THE FREAKING F ?? I can't say this loud enough.
This kind of sudden shit that takes choices away from people, only screams 2 possibilities. (to me)
1. Somebody is on a power trip
2. Somebody wants to sabotage it because they have other interests, political or financial in nature.
I actually have no problem if Bitcoin becomes a settlement layer, but that ought be a decision made because better transaction layers are available and people choose them freely.
Bitcoin should not become a settlement layer due to a deliberate decision to limit its capability as a transactional layer with an artificial limitation such a forcing a small block size.

I think the issue here is: There is no framework for coming to consensus in decentralized governance. Who is allowed to propose? Who are they proposing to? Who is allowed to reject? In the end, there is a go/no-go call, who makes it? Are they (?) allowed to make it if there are *any* dissenters? Maybe just a few dissenters? 1 guy can hold up a change? How many is too many? Who decides how many dissenters require a no-go? What if whoever's definition of decentralized consensus is never reached on anything, do we just never make changes anymore, period? Is that ok with everyone?

The difference is that ciphers and cryptographic protocols are technical, only.
Bitcoin is all that, but also, it is a conglomeration of rules, code, incentives, and human beings acting as an integral part of making the system work. Best described as a [Complex Adaptive System]( These rely so heavily on human behavior and individual actors and can't be projected theoretically with much success.
These sorts of systems require implementation first, then followed by observation, testing, and tweaking to get it right, rather than some kind of thorough analysis prior to going live.

@_date: 2015-06-02 18:19:40
Because we can't predict the needs of the block size that far out. If it was to automatically increase, I think it would need to be based on some dynamic factor (like size of n past blocks, or something).
The issue with a hard rule "double every 4 years" is that would cause us to have to fork the chain and do it all over again if, say, we found out Bitcoin grew WAY faster and those sizes were suddenly too small come a few years from now.
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:25:34
I think another big issue some are putting forward is the amount of time it takes for a 20mb block to get sent from one node to another on the network, once it is mined by a miner. This could, some theorize, make it more difficulty for slower internet connections to run the blockchain, in the day-to-day-new-blocks-moving-around-situation. 
Also, it could open up the possibility for miners to attack the network by broadcasting junk blocks that are 20mb, that take a different miner time to validate, essentially *wasting* other miners' time and giving the attacker a few seconds of extra time to be mining on the good blocks since they aren't wasting time with their junk blocks.
Additionally. There seem to be a few that think we should make miners get paid more (higher tx fees) and that by keeping blocks small, people transacting on the blockchain will have to pay miners more, encouraging more miners to mine into the future.
Anyhow, that's how I understand some of the issues besides the storage space issue.. Not that I agree these concerns should prevent raising the block size limit!
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:53:31

I think the major reason for this is that, managing one's own private keys and having your own computer/phone be independent of a cloud service is still not something for everyone.
In fact I'd say its only for a few.
We could all run email servers on our own since that is decentralized... then we could have more independent, private communications... I mean, there is email server software out there, has been forever! But we don't, we still use Gmail for the cloud, ease of use, apps, etc.
In fact, being a lifetime techie person myself, I still get nervous managing my paper wallets, wherever they are, don't think I'd want to risk so much money to a screw up in my own internet security, memory of a password, and my ability to use some offline device and wallet software out there correctly.
I don't think reduction in nodes is (1) accurate, as Gavin and others have pointed out and (2) related to the size of the blockchain being difficult to download.
Its related to easier and more full-featured options being available.. like people having migrated away from using their ISP provided email address to using Gmail, for instance.

I agree that it changes into a mantenance mode.
I would say we differ from your examples in that those became structured and hierarchical, where Bitcoin is intentionally NOT going to be that way.
Maintenance implies somebody has a vision for *how* it needs work... *What* (functionality? features?) we're maintaining. And that vision is consensual.
I don't think we can look to the past or existing processes for examples here.
@_date: 2015-06-16 04:10:13
Mike Hearn has rightly pointed out that this won't happen... 2 reasons to think so.
(1) some communication has taken place with the mining majority and the economic majority, they seem to be in overwhelming favor of a 20mb block change.
(2) Any change will give nodes adequate warning, and will only happen if an overwhelming majority of blocks express they are voting for it, and ready to head off on the next fork.
When  makes it abundantly clear it IS happening, anybody not upgrading in time would not only be galactically stupid, their efforts would be wasted and any effects would be extremely short lived and essentially meaningless.
As far as I can tell, Adam's continuing to spread the crash-and-burn scenario is getting a bit strange... beginning to smell.

From experience working in a company, listing to a ridiculous conversation 2 cubicles over happening just right now. There will never be "everyone's on board". This just doesn't happen.

Do we refuse to more forward on civil rights and equality because "not everyone's on board" ?

The current block size debate highlights why this is impossible.
It would seem all views want a stable Bitcoin.
it would also seem that people's views on *how*, specifically, technically, to get to long-term stability are fundamentally different, and they're not getting reconciled. Its not getting less messy. its not getting clearer, and I see no reason to think we can possibly invent some process to make it cleaner in the future.
We're literally at an impasse.
I think we would be best to assume this kind of contention can, and will happen with nearly every proposed change in Bitcoin, especially significant ones.
I am acknowledging and accepting this is the way it is with Bitcoin, the way it works and will probably continue to work.
Now, given that, how do we go about making changes/improvements toward long-term stability?

The closest option is Bitcoin XT coming out soon which will support 20mb blocks with a rule which says x% of recent mined blocks must be ready to support it, before allowing it.
Unfortunately there is the filibuster going on over at the primary codebase for Bitcoin: Bitcoin Core... and maybe Gavin will break it, maybe he won't.
I'll grab Bitcoin XT when the 20mb size option is available if Bitcoin Core hasn't got their shit together by then.

Your first day on a new pool will yield lower if the pool uses PPLNS to distribute rewards due to a ramp-up period in the "shifts". You would get this back when you pull away your hashing power and continue to get paid for a day. You must be patient and wait a few days day for the shifts to fill and you be able to get an accurate picture of your daily earnings. Because of the cold mathematical probability at work in mining (hashing), there are no material differences based on your pool choice *in the long run*. So, basically, our person who claims he only got 1/8 of the rewards when he tried another pool *just needs to give it time and understand it works out in the long run*. This is basic mathematics people. (The only exception to this is the fees charged by the pools)

An Eligius block has a very similar coinbase transaction - see:  
Perhaps this makes the coinbase detection method less reliable
Yet, I suppose Eligius would have a recognizable IP..
And the other method you suggested - checking who is mining P2Pool and correlating those addresses to the coinbase tx - that should still work assuming any algo is doing that.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:29:42
Right. You can be detected w/ statistics. Hence the suggestion to withhold only a random few.. so it could be explained away by luck.

IF you do this, Be sure to ACCEPT BITCOIN for payment at your restaurant! People with new coins will be looking for somewhere to spend their new money and you will get some extra business, not only from people buying new coins, but from people who already own Bitcoin and hear about your ATM and that you accept Bitcoin.  ALSO You'll inevitably get questions from people so you may need to train your staff to field Questions like "What's Bitcoin? What is That ATM? Hoe Does it Work?" Possible Staff response: "A new currency, digital, online, worldwide. We accept it for payment here if customers have a digital wallet." Then direct them to the info hopefully provided by the ATM owner. FLOW OF CUSTOMERS - You will get many people who don't want to eat at your restaurant. Be prepared for that. Some will just gawk and won't even use the ATM. Be prepared for a LINE to form at the ATM, the line could be out the door at peak times.

Indeed some central entities do this like ChangeTip - Coinbase also does. However, it sidesteps the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.

Thanks for the info.
I wonder, as you say, if Conbase is positioning themselves as a "liquid exchange" (They already do this by taking BTC and converting to USD immediately for merchants  a guaranteed rate). Perhaps they do this both ways, in more countries, then local merchants in developing countries turn the BTC to local FIAT, and possibly into Cash? Perhaps this creates and bootstraps a BTC economy in some other places. Could they, piece by piece, put together a BTC backend version of Western Union?  I'm just making stuff up now.. its fun to think about.

I thought it was fee free for Debit/Credit cards also, but I was also mistaken and corrected when I tried.
Bank transfers are the only "free" ones although I did notice they tend to have approx a 0.5% markup on coin price so that's how they offer it "free". When comparing with Coinbase I've seen their total prices differ approx 0.5% when comparing to the "final" Coinbase price which includes Coinbase and bank fees.

The world of internet and tech security is such that we must prepare for any/all manner of actions which individuals "could" employ against us. This applies to my wallet. I must secure it against every possible threat, trusting never in the goodness of humanity unless I accept the risks.  The Bitcoin network is the same way -- if a block withholding attack is a possibility, we shant ignore it, hide it, and hope people are "decent" enough not to do it. We ought realize its a real possibility (maybe a design "flaw") and something that could be employed. It needs to be dealt with so the community (or those affected) can minimize the negative impact.

I was thinking the market correction could happen from both angles - on the positive side: supporting a pool you like better - and on the negative side - attacking a pool you disagree with.  Perhaps the "market" of hashrate out there will balance out - because the perceived loss of profits on big pools because other hashers may be attacking them.

I think when the market is shifting around a lot, you're dealing with different algorithms employed by each company to determine a selling price. That's why I chose to check it when there was such a huge sell wall on Bitstamp to potentially eliminate the volitility.  During volatility, each company probably uses any number of feeds from various exchanges analyzing orderbooks to be sure if they offer a price they can actually get coins for that price... not likely the 2 companies will use the same algorithm for this..... but when the price is super-stable like last night, their algorithms converged to be pretty close.

How can you trust cash? Its so easy for people to just grab it and steal it.

I don't fully  understand P2Pool, but wouldn't it, as a Peer2Peer network, broadcast blocks on random IPs (whichever peer finds the block) with potentially fairly random payout addresses - so that would make it difficult/impossible to differentiate from an individual solo miner?

I don't know that I can give you a foolproof argument, because if I had one then there would be no doubters.
All I can say is when I look at where I see the world is going, and I look at the upcoming 20-and-30-somethings who grew up with the internet who are slowly gaining a voice of power in the world, I look at exponential growth curve of technology and computer innovation, and the increasingly decentralized nature of what "internet worlds" like games, online communities, online jobs, online life makes possible. Our whole way of life is slowly moving toward a new paradigm. Bitcoin doesn't make a whole lot of sense in the way life (especially for Americans) has been in the last 50 years. It makes the most sense when looked at from where we may be with technology, internet, and decentralization in 5 years from now, 10 years. Things could be unrecognizable, nation-states may be increasingly irrelevant, people may come to ignore borders and physical, geographical constraints... and from this perspective a decentralized internet currency is not only obvious and inevitable, but clearly essential for what's next in the story of humanity.
Not everybody sees this, and maybe not all bitcoiners see what I just described.. and who knows what will actually happen?
I guess you either see it or you don't, and make your decisions accordingly. The business of trying to convince people has been rather frustrating for me, so I'm given it up. If you see it like I do, then the storm is coming regardless, and we just need to stick around and watch patiently.

@_date: 2014-11-02 04:44:26
that breaks down a little when for instance, the MtGox trading engine is soooo laggy you:
# put in a market buy order when price is $180
# trading engine lags, spits, sputters, queues your sell behind thousands of others
# engine finally executes your buy at $240
# meanwhile somebody is executing a market sell when the price is $240
# trading engine lags, spits, sputters, queues your sell behind thousands of others
# engine finally executes your sell at $80
So. Traders are expecting a market trade value of &lt; +/- 5% the current price and instead get something wildly different.
Of course your statement is true whenever this MtGox lag business is NOT the case. All I'm saying is that sometimes crappy systems prevent the buyer/seller from agreeing on a price they thought they were agreeing on. And, although this wasn't the majority of the time, nor the majority of the cause of the price rise, it was a factor none-the-less and worthy of noting that some things did happen in a manner not intended by - nor explicitly agreed upon - by buyers and sellers..

The 0.001 BTC that we have traditionally been calling 1 mBTC or "millibit" has been incorrect. It should be "millibitcoin" since 1 BTC is not 1 bit, 1 BTC is 1 Bitcoin so 0.001 BTC is 1 millibitcoin.
a "millibit" then would be 0.1 Satoshi if we follow this logic and use "bits" to mean 0.000001 BTC. This could also be represented as 1 millibit = 0.000000001 BTC.  This 9th decimal place is currently not possible in Bitcoin

It means:
(1) Everyone who owns Bitcoins now owns 100,000,000x as many as they had before.
(2) The value of one "Bitcoin" would now be trading at approx $0.0000061 USD on the market.
(3) A 2 USD cup of coffee now costs 327,869 BTC
(4) The total "Bitcoins" currently in existence is 1,253,385,000,000,000 with an eventual cap of 2,100,000,000,000,000.

you probably don't even need to mention Bitcoin. You could, but you still risk them reacting like "ahh well, we know how well Bitcoin works" (however well they think from their perceptions) and then discounting what you've described
Consider not even mentioning Bitcoin, let them figure it out on their own if they keep an ear open. Talk to them about blockchain stuff (still not Bitcoin) in the future again.  If you can keep the loaded term out of things, you are probably more likely to have a productive conversation about the merits of the technology, the movement, and the implications -- which is the point after all.

3 bright halogen bulbs all at once: (1) Consensus based P2P network (2) *complete* public transaction history (3) math-based block reward and 10 min target time.
Up until this I couldn't understand (3a) how bitcoins could be "found" (3b) at a controlled rate (2) how you could transfer them and know they are legit and (1) how such a network is held together.
More bulbs followed:
- blockchain
- mining
- hash-based proof of work
- private-public key
- ability to adapt to issues (antifragile)
- Internet-fueled digital-world, location-less movement I'm seeing == how something like Bitcoin is needed, perfectly suited, and DUH.
Once I saw this I *knew* the network/currency was sound. It was aligned with the trajectory of us human beings. Technical solution found. Now all there was to wait for was a long road of bringing humans and businesses along for the ride... Naturally I invested immediately.

If a merchant is converting to fiat, then your example is nothing different than Paypal Fiat to Fiat to Fiat... except that perhaps your BTC balance is held as collateral until the fiat tortoise runs back into your Coinbase account.
I would imagine that soon after implementing this, they would be required to, just like Paypal, implement chargebacks and be responsible for mitigating fraud situations... unless I suppose they could find a "loophole" in the process whereby they can claim bitcoin was was technically used to pay for the item?

I didn't change the probability curve which dictates blocks will be found in a predictable time frame (converging on 10 minutes). I agree. The odds don't change.
I did, however, change when the actual event of a block time came around. i.e. without my tx it would have come in 3 minutes, but with my tx it came in 15 minutes.
Because the block hashes are radically different without my tx vs. with my tx, there is no way that next block would have come at the exact same moment both with, and without, my tx.

Exactly - You transfer ownership of Bitcoins by **re-assigning an amount of BTC** *from your control to the control of another* (from your address to theirs). This transfer of value to the control of another address is then recorded publicly and has the consensus of the global community. That "global community" also has so far spoken - by way of majority consensus on the current Bitcoin protocol - that Bitcoins value transfers shall not be reversible once the transfer of value is recorded globally in the Blockchain. -My attempt at more accuracy / clarity.

Not an economist/philosopher here, but Dogecoin is a good case study perhaps.. 1 BTC = 781,250 DOGE and 2 USD = 1281 DOGE. You see many tips on for 50-100 DOGE = 0.04-0.08 USD.

All exchanges I've used do exactly this - they charge you more for withdrawal than they turn around and pay the network in tx fees.

How would the effect be any grater with a larger block size? It seems to be it would just be more expensive to do the same thing with a bigger block..

I'm not referring to changing the probability, that, clearly, can't be changed.. every single hash is as likely as any other. I'm referring to the actual event of the lucky hash which solves the block. That event could come anywhere between 0.000000001+ milliseconds after the prior block, or it could come 100,000+ years after the prior block. All of these are technically possible. However, we know from probability and mathematics, that blocks are found most often around 10 minutes. In reality we see minutes more like, 8, 5, 18, 6, 11, etc.
What i'm saying is, since changing the input of a hash radically changes the hash, my additional input (and of course, everyone's) is the difference between a block found at 5 minutes or 11, or the difference between a block found at 45 minutes vs 20.
Said another way: if miners would have continued without my tx, the ongoing probabilistic function would have a block found around 10 minutes. Let's say the actual block found (without my tx) in this pretend-world, was a 5 minute find.  Now with my tx introduced, and the radical changes I introduced into the outcomes of the block hashes with my tx, the exact same outcome would not happen, due to hashes being so radically different. So, with my tx included, the block would necessarily have to be found at a different time.
This is analogous to you flipping coins, and somebody bumps you as you are flipping a coin. Did they change the odds of flipping heads? No. Did they change the outcome of that particular flip? Maybe.
In the same way I nudge the miners with every tx, changing the hash input and output, the block solution, and every subsequent block finding time.
The reason this is so much more certain than flipping coins, is that heads/tails is a binary outcome= there are 2 possible outcomes. With mining there are 2039498234092450947852 x 2394802498702948357902348 possible outcomes (not exact!). So, did my change to the hashing input change the outcome? you better damn well believe it did. And since it changes all the hashing outcomes, it would change when a hash of adequate difficulty comes around.

I think the block propagation speed issue being solved would go a long way to incentivize miners to include lower fee transactions into blocks.  As it stands, every transaction added to a block causes that block to be larger in size and thus delayed by a few milliseconds in getting around the world to the rest of the network.  Every millisecond delay is a millisecond a different miner could beat them with a different block being accepted by the network first. Even though the chance is low: If they were beat, even by a few milliseconds, the miner loses all the rewards of the block = 25+ BTC. So the miner is weighing the risk of losing all 25 BTC in rewards with the potential benefit of earning a few pennies USD including transactions.  Its a free market of sorts. Miners willing to take the risk will edge down to including the lower fee transactions.  The is part of the Game of Bitcoin playing out in Game Theory. So if the system was changed to propagate blocks at the same speed regardless of number of transactions, then I think you'd see many miners including 0 fee transactions or MUCH LOWER fee transactions - why? Because if there's no longer a negative risk in processing thousands of transactions in a block, then the miner can now switch to considering his/her personal interest the the success of Bitcoin, and processing tiny transactions (a.k.a. having micropayments work with Bitcoin) would contribute to Bitcoin's success.

The pool operator could build-in some double spending features. Or even offer temporary node control to a buyer.. Behind that node the entire pool's hashing gets directed for a short-time.
So far I've only read the abstract, but it seems to me an important potential attack to bring up.
For instance: Prior to this paper I have long heard said that: to get 51% a bad actor would have to purchase mining power and set up their own farm.  I gather this paper is asking us to consider: 
A bad actor could pay a few million $ to the top mining pool operators, enough hashrate to get 51, maybe 60%. Since a double-spend can be accomplished in a few hours (in theory), they would only need a short time to be in control of the pool's power.
Also, if only 1-2 blocks were orphaned in the double spending process, it may be difficult to detect and look just like a "feather fork" which happens often.
The concept is solid: Rather than trying to crack the protocol, go after human actors in the ecosystem.  This is similar to, rather than cracking the security of a company and hacking, you rather pay somebody to give you a backdoor.

If the fees are only 1%, then the tellers may only be making around 0.5% each.  Or less probably, so Abra can take a cut. Maybe tellers are making as low as 0.25% each?
Even so, if people/businesses *volunteer* to be Tellers, which they will, it will be EXCELLENT for users.

This shows how easy and *cheap* it is, right now, for a nefarious actor to DOS the blockchain.
While it wouldn't "crash" Bitcoin, it would cause confirmation delays for people/exchanges/wallets using typical fees.
Usability would take a hit, and it would frustrate new users.. if this went on constantly, it would slow adoption.
Wallets could solve this by analyzing the unconfirmed Tx pool at the time of sending to adjust the fees accordingly.
One possible conclusion: a hard (ie. 20mb) block size limit won't solve this, just make it 20x more expensive, which is still relatively *cheap.*  A self-adjusting, up AND down, block size limit may be a good option to combat a logjam (?) attack.

Probably not solo mining..... the user would want a payout way faster than a toaster could find a block solo mining..!
Probably, the chip encrypts the results of the hash (shares) and they get sent to the 21 mining pool servers, which decrypt the shares and apply them. 
Although if if my speculation were true, I don't quite understand why they would need their address encoded in silicon.. they could just take care of it on their end with their servers.......

I used circle with great success several times before they opened up to everybody - since then 75% failures. Here are a few gems from support. I'm basically calling it BS since I had worked up a great reputation with them prior to all these failures.
* "I'm sorry to hear that you have been unable to use a credit card to deposit funds to your account." This after making a purchase using my BANK account - seriously do they even LOOK at their system before responding? By the way it was the same bank account I used successfully 1 week prior. HELLO just do it again.. what's so F'in hard?
* "Our apologies for the inconvenience here. But the deposit transaction for $4.00 was cancelled due to us tailoring our fraud prevention mechanisms."  $4.00 are you serious? W. T. F.? If you think I am fraudulent why didn't you stop me from sending those $4 in coins out of my account just a second before making this buy to replenish my coins?
* "It appears your transaction was denied due to our fraud prevention monitoring, and has since been cancelled. We apologize for any inconvenience."
If they are finding somebody as clean and straight-laced as me potentially fraudulent, I don't see how they can do business with anybody.

There have been no reports of Coinbase requesting a government issued Photo ID and copy of a utility bill. The last Bitcoin business that required this for me personally was Mt. Gox.  The question is - why is Circle doing it the different, old fashioned way? If they're trying to be competition to Coinbase, they're not doing a great job by requiring these sorts of extra privacy invasions above-and-beyond what other top Bitcoin companies are doing. Others have figured out how to satisfy AML/KYC without such an inconvenient, manual, and invasive requirement.

Great point. It would be interesting to hear from the miners themselves.
I remember when a miner finally spoke up when the whole community was asking "WHY DO YOU MINERS CONTINUE TO USE GHASH.IO WHEN THEY ARE SO CLOSE TO 50% ??"
The response from the large-scale miner was particularly enlightening. It seems we can only speculate about why miners make the decisions they do.. and when we hear from somebody actually in the business of mining on a big scale, they hit us with things we never thought of.

Nope. Like side-chains or some other method of transactions that users may find as secure and with the same benefits of Bitcoin, but NOT Bitcoin, yet somehow backed by Bitcoin, or still using Bitcoin as the denomination.


Not sure what you're referring to.
I think I perfectly agree with what you're saying. If there aren't better solutions which people are gravitating toward (and they really aren't at this point - Bitcoin is still growing), then we shant force people to stop using the Bitcoin blockchain by purposely restricting the block size and making it more difficult (expensive) to do so.

I suggested a possible "attack" whereby an attacker would "fill the blocks" like this constantly, with adequate fees/priority. Confirmation times would slow, and wallets that didn't adjust fees up would create slow tx'es and frustrate users.
It would cost something for the attacker, however I think it may be a relatively inexpensive attack. I put together some rough math on my post:

I'm assuming this but could be completely wrong---
Depositing cash:
* User deposits Cash with an Abra teller.
* Teller has a bank acct withdrawal in the same amount (or slightly lesser amount so they actually *make* money being a teller.
* Money goes into Abra's bank/bitcoin backend. they handle it however they do
* User is credited with the balance in their Abra "Account".
* Abra holds the balance (in the least volatile currency I'd assume to prevent volatility) (or possibly in the currency of choice for the user?)
Depositing via Credit Card or Bank acct:
* Just like Coinbase or Circle - money comes from your Bank acct or CC and shows in your Abra "balance."
Transferring money
* User with a balance can send to another user.
* This is handed internally by Abra "off chain"
Withdrawing money
* A user with a balance initiates a withdrawal and chooses a location and teller.
* Abra debits the account of the user.
* A Teller gets the OK to give cash from Abra.
* Teller gives cash to the recipient
* Teller's bank account is credited the same amount soon after. (or a slightly larger amount so they actually *make* something for being a teller)
At least, this comes to mind...

Words from somebody who actually likes this exchange... offering another perspective.
I've followed the chat feed and it appears the exchange is changing owners, or at least adopting some co-owners. I'm optimistic for this change. RealSolid was just one person and it was difficult for him to do customer support as well as updates, fixes, admin, etc. The security, speed, interest payments, and feeshare options are all very good and this exchange innovated some of these concepts in the crypto world, some of which are now copied by other exchanges...  I plan to continue to use the exchange once it returns in whatever form.
His requiring withdrawal of coins as per the subject of this post - is a bit strange, I agree. ... But some positive speculation is called for I think: If the exchange is undergoing a major ownership and administration change, wallet security and ownership of coins in dead accounts may be a real issue in the sale of the exchange.. Perhaps they are fishing out dead accounts (and thereby the ownership of funds in those accounts) during the change of hands.
I would look more closely into the allegations against mcxnow, most are "the guy is a jerk" which is arguably true if you ever see him in chat. But you'll never find" he lost my coins" or "he froze withdrawals". Yes, he's had to freeze trading (not withdrawals) once when customer support was too much for one person. Yes, his feeshares are volatile and issued by him when he chooses (although they are traded freely and not inflated). This is the Bitcoin world = caveat emptor.. stop complaining.
I thought I would spread some more level-headed experience (leaning toward the positive) since a lot of the complaints here seem highly emotionally charged and if money was lost, it was not the fault of the exchange or owner, but rather due to personal investment choices, personality clashes, or "I wouldn't do an exchange this way". I realize RealSolid has a history - but if looked at closely its a history of being a jerk, and doing his own thing... its not a history of cheating, stealing, or bad business.
I would prefer this post rather be a PSA: Withdraw your coins before Nov 15.. (similar to the one about Bitpay to get your accounts verified) rather than a smear.  I would prefer differences of opinion on how an exchange be run result in individuals choosing not to use the exchange, rather than a smear. I would prefer individuals telling others not to use the exchange, do so with evidence of real owner fraud or negligence, rather than sounding warnings to the community based on personality differences or disagreements with how things are run.  AT the very least say "he called me a vagina" and that's why you don't recommend his customer support. Say "I wouldn't do it this way" but please don't smear an exchange that a number of people appreciate, including Max Keiser as RealSolid partnered with Max with StartCoin and MCXNow was/is by far the highest in volume for trading in the life of MaxCoin.
Thank you for listening, those who read all this.

Did you know that one issue with limiting the block size, is that all those transactions broadcast which didn't make a block (because of size limits) will bounce around in the memory of the full nodes on desktops?  So, if we get to a point where actual demand for the network is 8 TPS and blocks can handle 7 tps. we're going to have to deal with full nodes keeping TXs in memory which won't leave memory for a good while, because there is no room in blocks.
If we increase the block size to 20mb, it won't probably cause ANY changes on how full node clients perform  for a good while, because probably only a handful of blocks will be &gt; 1MB at first, and its not like the BTC Tx rate is growing THAT fast right now.
I'd say we're perfectly safe to make a rather small change (block size 20mb), and deal with changing/tweaking other things as they come up.
One other thing: If solving some of those other things you mention is going to be done, we ought get into the habit of making tweaks to Bitcoin. So, making this tweak is a step in getting out of the "don't touch it!" mentality which is making the protocol become more stale by the minute.

it would probably be a 1 satoshi worth colored coin. And, if 1 satoshi were worth anything that significant in the future, we'd probably have an update to Bitcoin by then (I'd think?) that split out bitcoins into more decimal places, and consequently split satoshis down much further, and the colored coin could then be transferred to one of these much smaller and less valued units and the 1 satoshi which was so valuable could be used by the owner for buy dinner, or a Lexus. ;)

Well. We've said it before and we'll say it again... Coinbase and others need to follow US law which includes watching large transactions and filing reports for suspicious activity. 50K from Bitcoin sites into Wells Fargo is probably what they would consider suspicious. SO if Wells saw your movements from multiple Bitcoin sites, WELLS probably filed a report on you. Coinbase I think is required to report any transaction over certain limits, which are unknown but I've heard speculated to be as low as $3k. Even if they're not required, they probably do just to stay on the good side of Uncle Sam.. They have employees' and investors' asses to cover.

Technically you do have to hold satoshis. Not very many though.
You can't claim a hash without a transaction. And, a transaction must have at least 1 satoshi sent (+ they will likely include Miner's fees = more satoshis)
So, technically, they will be buying bitcoins in order to make transactions and pay miners - so that requires the use (and short-term holding) of BTC currency.

A single pool operator could of course, but that's just one pool. A bad actor who made deals with many pool operators would be able to put the hashrates of many pools together toward a common purpose.


Why not? If a Pool Operator can do it, then they can figure out a way to get that same ability (control of the chain/forks) into the hands of our bad actor, and figure how to do it temporarily. This is very possible.


Yes, there is.  It's called: little effort + big *certain* payoff. From a pool operator's perspective, this would be easy $$. A pool operator just attempting a double-spend on their own would have to orchestrate the details of the double-spend, which is a significant challenge. AND they likely don't have the hashrate alone. Contrast that with a pool operator being paid a few million dollars to just redirect their hashrate toward the payer for a few hours.  
A pool operator may not have the same idea for an evil plan, nor the desire, nor the social/people/negotiating/organizing skills to be able to coordinate bribing the other big pool operators. Its so much easier to just rent your pool for a time. A government or other entity with a massive desire to mess-up Bitcoin could and would have the incentive, would find the $ to rent hashrate, and would be able to make the deals to make it happen... these would be a team of professionals executing the plan of renting multi-pool hashrates, a plan far too complicated for a pool operator, and likely beyond a pool operator's skill.

I'm not sure what you've discussed in the past. But the one thing I think is grossly overestimated (and I heard it from you) is the power of the "miners".
If a set of mining pools (say, 75% of hashing power) decided to jump on a fork that changed the Bitcoin Protocol: they, of course, could. Their chain then is longer, and therefore valid, right?
Not exactly.
Nobody considers the power "everyone else" has to rebel.
Say the "bad" miners want to change the protocol with 75% of mining power.
The "good" actors would stay on the old fork. The "old" "good" fork would contain only 25% of mining power... so it quickly becomes shorter. So its doomed, right?  BUT here's the catch. PLEASE HELP PEOPLE GET THIS: Non-miners who make up a serious part of the ecosystem would have to choose which fork to stay on. So, this includes big, important players like: Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Bitstamp, Circle, BitPay, Bitfinex, BTC-e, BTCChina, etc..... And all their userbases!   IF these big players chose to stay on the shorter chain, the "good" fork, then while the "bad" miners would have a majority of the hashing power and a longer chain, their longer chain would be relegated mostly useless, on par with the testnet = worthless bitcoins...  BECAUSE at that point the coins on the longer "bad" chain are no good at Bitstamp, Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain.info, etc. then the miners would very quickly realize that mining worthless coins that nobody recognizes is not profitable. A rational miner at that point would not lose their profits by mining unrecognized coins, they'd switch back.
PLEASE stop the worshiping of the miners, there are other players with social and "utility" power that have just as big of a say in the chain.  This, I believe, extends the consensus mechanism beyond the miners to companies that represent "use" and indeed "users" of the blockchain. Further, users can choose companies who picked the fork on the blockchain they approve of. So, the average end user still has more say than they realize. Average users are not victim to the majority of hashing power.
The part I think gets missed FAR too often is that, Bitcoin is more than a technical beast. If you look at forks and hashing power only from a technical perspective, a miner perspective, you miss half the picture. Bitcoin is a social experiment also, filled with human beings with choices made for various reasons: some ideological, some ignorant, some financially motivated, others just want the damn thing to work so they can buy dinner. We're all mixed up in this thing. Users far outnumber miners at this point. I see the tides turning: Miners will be at the mercy of users choosing to transact on their chain.... Miners will become scared to deviate for fear of getting on the wrong chain with worthless bitcoins.
Another thing that isn't talked about enough is WHAT IF  the 2 forks both had enough following that we end up having 2 chains *forever* or even more than 2? Hmmmm, possible. Why not? This has been explored here...Very thoughtful analysis:  (images are not displaying)
Of course, this is all speculation until we have a real fork and the shit hits the fan... I could be very wrong about all this. Just tossing out an idea I think needs more airtime.

^ this
If the limit were proposed at 150mb, I'd be concerned. 20 isn't serious.
Seriously people. 20mb is not such an egregious offense it needs to be blocked. Sure, discuss differences to be done in the later future. But, for God's sake, don't get yourself in the way of this rather benign change.
Think about it: By the time the block reward dips low enough for miners to require Tx fees to survive, we'll be dealing with full 20mb blocks and wondering if we could change to 500mb. If so many people have alternative ideas to transact off-chain or the like, let them get something implemented by then so we actually HAVE another option.
Do we want the Bloomberg headline "The Bitcoin community has taken actions to prevent customer adoption of their currency, effectively making it more expensive to transact by limiting the total transactions allowed, causing users to pay higher and higher fees to compete with others who want to use it."
Queue Ripple and others: "We don't do that bullshit, come on over."
We're not at critical mass adoption yet. People are still using the BITCOIN blockchain, not any other incarnation of a side-chain or off-chain ledger. So, we need to be sure as new people join the current system, they can USE it as it works today, cheaply, since how it works today (transacting ON the BITCOIN blockchain) is what we actually have working. We can't suffer any remote possibilities that Bitcoin is difficult or expensive to use. Eventually, perhaps. Not YET.
20mb blocks buy time while all the other "proposals" out there (which aren't nearly as ready or easy to implement as Gavin's) can get their shit together with some code, and some well-tested working prototypes that consensus (the rest of us) will agree are stable enough for BTC Prime time.
Better yet. Make such a great alternative to transacting on the Bitcoin blockchain, that people naturally gravitate away from it due to the alternative solution being so much better with less friction. Then, Bitcoin transactions WILL stop growing naturally, because people are doing it elsewhere. Maybe then, if miners starve, we can consider adding limitations on block size.. slowly..
Best not to force people's hand in such an open market as this, because we're talking about people, not machines, who are given to all sort of perceptions and biases.

I literally have no idea what you just said.
You don't have to pay a miner's fee, but it may take some time to get  the transaction confirmed if you don't. I would assume a place as professional (and I'd assume: serious) as Nasdaq would want their bits embedded in the blockchain ASAP, so I would think they'd be paying the tx fees.
There's nothing "later" about a transaction in Bitcoin. If anybody sends out a transaction... either: (1) it's valid, and it will be confirmed or (2) its valid and it won't be confirmed possibly due to too low of a fee or (3) it's not a valid transaction and won't ever be confirmed.
There is not "later" or "importing of a key" that has anything to do with a transaction or a miner fee.

Technically, yes. It would require someone to design such a fork in the protocol to make those stolen coins unspendable, and then have them be issued to somebody else (whether to the victim of the theft, or perhaps to miners). Such a fork in the protocol would need to be accepted by a majority of miners, exchanges, nodes, etc.
I would think it is very unlikely to happen, as the vibe I get from the community is that this would set a dangerous precedent.  Rather, I sense the prevailing attitude is one that Bitcoin should work the way bitcoin works, for thieves and non-thieves alike. I've heard it repeated over and over again: It isn't the Bitcoin protocol that needs to be adjusted, but rather Bitstamp, et al. practices that need to be adjusted to stop thefts or even the possibility of thefts in the future.

Its worth asking WHO will recognize a blockchain registered trademark.  I'd LOVE for it to be recognized universally, but I don't think it would hold up anywhere *yet*, even though there are already several ways to accomplish it.  A trademark is binding through government law and if somebody violated it, they'd have legal repercussions. As of now, I don't think your blockchain registration is enforceable in any meaningful way.

Possibly the price would go up... due to Bitstamp buying their lost coins back. If Bitstamp has insurance or even if they don't... Likely, if they want to stay in business, they'll need to re-acquire their lost coins somehow. In buying 18k BTC, they may move the market some in an upward direction.
Assuming there is not an equal and opposite sale of those same 18k coins.
Assuming a lot of things.
Just a possibility

An analogy for finding a block I personally like:
Think of the miners each rolling a dice that has 1000 sides. Everybody is playing the same dice game.  The first miner to roll a multiple of 100 (i.e. 100, 200, 300, etc) has "found" a block. Everybody knows the rules of the game so when you roll a 600, you "broadcast" that dice roll and your block to everybody. Everybody will acknowledge because they all know 600 is a multiple of 100 and you found a solution first. You can't fake a roll without actually rolling because the other nodes will also be looking for "proof" which is to say, they will *need to see your actual roll* which you share with them to prove you rolled a 600.  Side note: This also explains why miners with more mining power find more blocks: because they can roll dice faster and thus get more chances at "winning".
When any node sees your block, they check it. They check to make sure you didn't include anybody's transactions that were double spends or invalid, they check to see your block is sequenced *after* the block they already know was previous, they check your dice roll, to be sure you didn't cheat. If it all passes, your block now is the last one in the chain and this is independently acknowledged and verified by all... there is no judge deciding if you found a block, you must rely on the consensus of all other peers (nodes)...
Now, the miners express their acceptance of your block by adding your block to the end of the chain on their node, and they start rolling dice to find the next block after yours. If for some reason you sent out an invalid block, it will fail the tests by other nodes and the other miners won't roll the dice for the next block after yours, but rather they will still be rolling dice for the block after the one before yours... to win your spot, and your block will eventually be discarded by the network: "orphaned".
* 1000 sided dice = all possible block hashes
* everybody playing same game = everybody is "hashing" the same hash function, looking for the same winning pattern
* winner is a multiple of 100 = block hash matches a pre-determined pattern. The pattern is the difficulty, and your hash must be &gt;= the current difficulty.
* winning pattern hash looks like 00000000000000000ae6cf543a90977a8d61a61f7a0a366cca1ce38c33a83bfa (this is the hash of block 356569. The winning pattern is - over simplified - a certain number of leading 0s)
* fake a dice roll = give a block hash of a winning pattern but fail to provide inputs to the hash function which yielded the winning pattern hash.
* proof = your block contains a winning pattern hash.. and.. the inputs to the hash function actually do make the hash you provided, when verified by anybody else.

This all assumes we have foresight to be able to develop such a thing that can


Who said it needs to be this way?
And, I have my doubts we could achieve that.. because things come up.
* There could be some DDOS that we discover can be mitigated with a core protocol change.
* There could be a bug discovered requiring an immediate hard fork.
* Something else around the block size (or algo) isn't working and gets changed
* Plenty of other things we can't think of right now!
I'd say the more nimble the users are at upgrading versions the better. 
We've gotten out of practice.
Better a nice long-planned fork like proposed with the 20mb block size be used to get us back in the swing of keeping stuff current.

Neither is right or wrong.
I'm suggesting *if* XT's rules kick-in because it garners 75% of the hashing power and creates a fork, those on the 25% side will also move over to the XT fork.
I think this would happen whether the "cause" of the fork was XT, Core, or something else. (with some exceptions not present in the current situation, see below)
I'm also not saying the "initial" direction it takes. I'd be saying: if a longer BTC chain has  75% of the hashing power, that's the direction it will go and the other side will see moving to the 75% fork as the preferable option to fighting. (excepting some circumstances, see below)
The rightness or wrongness of the move is still debated, so I'd avoid making right/wrong claims. I'm merely describing "how I see the system works".
There is, of course, the exception, *which I do not see is true in this case*, where the economic majority (coinbase, localBTC, Bitpay, exchanges) disagrees with the fork. Also imagine the fork was some kind of hostile takeover by a hardware manufacturer that just turned on a server farm. In this case, even the 75% fork could "lose". It would indeed have the longest chain, but if Coinbase, Bitpay, and exchanges all choose the shorter chain, that is where commerce, transacting, and the general Bitcoin using populous will go.  In this case, a shorter chain would 'win' and have the value (higher price/usage) where the longer chain would 'lose' because few people would care to use it as it lost the 'network effect" i.e. Usage/Value. *I'll repeat I do not this is happening in the XT situation, nor will it this time, I'm merely explaining how an alternative is possible, of course, if circumstances were different.*
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:31:03
Its important to hear commitments from players that represent some of the "economic majority," like BitPay.
This gives confidence that IF the blockchain forked into roughly 75% hash power that supported BIP 101, and 25% that didn't, then, the chances of survival of the 25% chain depend it garnering support of Bitcoin services, like BitPay.
The side of the fork that BitPay (and others like Coinbase, Bitfinex) support brings all of their users along with them, and renders the chain BitPay (and others) didn't choose more irrelevant.
BitPay just told us (more or less) they would support the BIP101 chain in case of a fork, which takes away strength from the possibility a non-BIP101 fork would survive.

"Builds" of Bitcoin software are not decentralized.
In fact, when we allow many candidate builds of Bitcoin, we give ourselves more options.
The choosing of *which of the candidate builds* will get implemented is a decentralized as node operators are decentralized, and as decentralized as miners and mining pools are.
The point of this article being: we don't even have candidates (bitcoin builds), let alone could put candidate solutions to a vote (votes = nodes &amp; miners using them) if we don't allow the candidates to formulate their own opinions and submit a baked idea (i.e. XT breaks ties and releases a build however they choose to do it) for consideration to the voters.
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:40:48
I think it doesn't matter about nodes? The go/no-go for XT to increase block size depends only on 75% of miners choosing it, not notes. IIRC
Consider me, my 3 nodes aren't doing anything in particular for the users of the network, except adding 3 more points of blockchain storage, transaction relay and validation.  My nodes would be quickly ignored..
Properly, the nodes that represent users and new transactions being relayed are the ones that "count" in practical terms.
@_date: 2015-08-18 21:40:54
Its unfortunate that the media sees XT as the "offshoot".
Yes, its technically an offshoot, just as *every other* software change is, until it is implemented and used.
They could just as accurately have said "*Irreconcilable disagreement* threatens to throw development of the digital currency into disarray"
"*Traditionalists afraid of change digging their heels in* threaten to throw development of the digital currency into disarray"
Philosophically, the jury is out as to which perspective of our debate is "the offshoot."
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:57:49
@_date: 2015-08-18 18:30:48
There is a point of inevitability that will register with virtually all players involved when/if the XT chain actually succeeds and larger blocks begin to take place on the chain.
At that time, people's personal interest in Bitcoin still "being successful at all" will outweigh the ideological/business leanings.
If Bitcoin 'fails' or loses enough credibility from a split: Lightning suffers, the value of people's investments suffer, and the idea of a decentralized currency gets set back in the minds of the world at large (whoever is paying attention). 
I think people are smart enough to see that, realize that, and I don't think any significant amount would stick on a 25% chain when the 75% chain is clearly the winner.

lifting the limit to 8mb does not mean 8x block size today.
In reality, after lifting the limit to 8, block sizes stay the same as they are today on average, and are allowed to increase naturally per user demand.

That means you clicked the confirmation link Cryptsy emailed you. That's what "conf" means in this case: Cryptsy has verified your Bitcoin withdrawal using an email link (confirmed - at Cryptsy only)
The line below shows "pending" still, when that changes, it should include a "Tx" indicating the blockchain transaction where the money was actually sent. At that point you can look it up and see it, and your wallet should see it also.
As for now you could consider them safely in Cryptsy's outgoing queue. As for why they are slow to send them, probably a minor system issue (this isn't uncommon at exchanges).

It's a terrible comparison. Bitcoin ASICs (powering most of the BTC Network) only do 1 thing: Sha256 hashes.. and when these are compared to Supercomputers (which can do nearly all your laptop and phone can do) it isn't much of a comparison. Supercomputers can do MUCH more than the BTC network, but don't do BTC mining very efficiently as compared with Bitcoin ASICs that leave supercomputers in the dust on Sha256 (mining), but can't do anything else!

I'm using BTCGuild because their payouts are consistent, and profits include block transaction fees.  Also, they have great uptime and support on IRC.
I'm projecting approx 35% increase in difficulty per month - using those calculations, there isn't much mining hardware you can acquire today that will even pay itself off.
Seriously, I'd recommending putting some hard numbers together, along with a very conservative (high) projection of continuous difficulty increases - I don't think 35% /month is even conservative considering the past few months and what we know about the insane amount of up-and-coming ASIC players. I'm thinking there are very few who will profit from mining anymore. Only those with early pre-orders or connections getting high-powered mining equipment before everyone else. If you don't have an advantage like that, I don't see the numbers stacking up.
One alternative I'd like to mention. If we have faith in BTC/USD price rising significantly in the future, perhaps mining would be profitable, but in that case, I'd buy-in with USD--&gt; BTC --&gt; Mining hardware (as of Today 1 BTC is under $100) and then perhaps when BTC = 500+ USD, you can sell the BTC you mined --&gt; USD at a much higher rate and your profits will be better from a USD perspective.
Of course, this is all speculation.

I like to say Bitcoins are "issued" at a constant rate and you can participate and receive some of the newly issued coins. Maybe you prefer to call it "released into circulation" by rewarding those who "run" the network and validate transactions for everybody.
If people want more info about this, I tell them the issuance rate is based in math and cannot be changed.
Very few people press this any further.  Explanations of Code changes, consensus, and 51% attacks are rarely required.
Agreed, "making" Bitcoins sounds very odd to people, even scammy.
I think "issued" or "released" resonates better. It keeps people from thinking any one person can control new Bitcoin creation and instead (rightly) explains the hard and fast "rules" of the Bitcoin system that people may opt-in and follow.

Too soon to know.. too little data (too few blocks) have occurred since the change to get an accurate forecast.. As of this writing, only 1 block after the new difficulty was found in a very lucky 4.5 minutes, so that's all the estimators have to go on.

We can't know if this is solved because the Shared Send service is a coin mixer. We only know the coins went into the mixer.. Without knowing the destination address we have no idea if the coins came out of the mixer. Only the OP and blockchain.info would be privvy to that information.

Fix the fee representation to reflect the 0.0005 BTC default. The current video shows 0.01 BTC.

I clicked the link, but I'm not savvy enough to understand what this is.. and what is the connection to Coinbase? How would this affect me? Plz explain.

Are we sure this is the same Ross Ulbricht?

looks like a scam, smells like a scam

Yeah. I think Coinbase has done so much well. Now time to shape up their communication abilities.

Make it professional
- Update the list of "things to buy with Bitcoin" to the most common and legitimate things one can buy. i.e. You can buy groceries, beer, electronics, gift cards, cars and homes..
- I like alpacas as much as the next guy, but please remove the "alpaca socks". While that sounds cool, it makes the currency sound silly.
Thanks for the great video skills!

I purchased movie tickets for my family in advance of the showing for Ender's Game on opening night.  Next day I txted my brother my Bitcoin address, that is how he paid me back for tickets for him and his girl.

ZERO - because at the rate things are going, something else may come and eclipse BTC or completely take it out and force us to switch to something newer/better/more secure.
At least, this is one possibility

Every block divided among miners is actually worth somewhere between 25 BTC and 25.5 BTC on average due to Block reward + Transaction fees paid by users of Bitcocin. My observations are that block fees average approx .25 BTC per block. Which is roughly 1% of the 25 BTC block reward.
BTC Guild has a 3% fee for their PPLNS reward system - which I use. But since Block fees are included in payouts, that brings the effective fee to around 2% if we were comparing to pools who share only the block reward (25 BTC)
There are other pools with lower fees, but for now I'm sticking with BTC Guild for more than just profit reasons:
- Pool has been down less than 10 minutes in the several months I've been mining
- great support on IRC
- very consistent payouts
- nice and easy-to-use website, free API usage on my smartphone
- Now they sell ASIC USB Block Erupter miners for a very decent price
I am not familiar with hhtt.

Good Old Fashioned Bad Luck - is a possibility - looking at the recent blocks it appears the average is 20 min / block or so. Don't forget that mining - while executing a simple "formula" = sha2 - is totally dependent on luck - The network adjusts the difficulty which, when it goes up, it lowers odds that miners will find blocks - keeping blocks finds around 10 minutes.. This is only a probability, however. Analogous to flipping coins, It is absolutely possible that you would have what appears to be a_difficult_time_flipping_tails. See BTC Guild, the largest mining pool, just reported a streak of the lowest luck in 35+ days and is already on the upswing after said streak. (see chart at bottom of page: 
as I am finishg up this post, things are speeding up already (

Yes. Agreed.
I've been a long-time completely legit customer and now I'm being downgraded. Not cool.
