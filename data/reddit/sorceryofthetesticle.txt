Hey man, I've been impressed by your enthusiasm for btc. As a very minor hodler/user , I'm skeptical about bitcoin's future due to (what little I know about) the block size debate, centralization concerns, rumours about the dangers of forks and these kinds of things. But, I also see the writing on the wall as far as fiat and fractional reserve banking us concerned. It seems like both options kind of suck and hodling is basically a gamble on whether or not the core devs and miners can be trusted not to fuck up the transition process once the crash happens. Do you mind me asking your perspective on all that stuff? Why/how do you have so much confidence in BTC specifically, and what are your thoughts on the blocksize debate? Also, if you don't mind me asking, where do you get deceny information and arguments about bitcoin stuff? I have no idea where to look and it's getting tiring sifting through all the neurotic, half-baked fear based speculative writing around here.

They use your original deposit as collateral. If you sold the loaned bitcoin for USD, and the USD price of bitcoin goes up by a lot, GDAX can force you to buy back BTC at a higher price and give them BTC from your original deposit to make up the difference. This is called a margin call.
For example:
You borrow 3 BTC to sell at 1050 USD each, using 1 BTC as margin or collateral. Here, you have $3150.
Price goes up to 1100 USD and your broker executes a margin call, which means you have to return their 3 BTC. So, you go to buy 3 BTC, and with the $3150 from the original sale, you can only buy ~.2.863 BTC to give back to them. In order to make up for the missing coin, they take 0.137 BTC from your margin, leaving you with 0.863 BTC.

Ah, an unmoneyed ally. Fair enough
@_date: 2016-06-26 05:43:36
Because we need to do and say everything to convince ourselves that hodling isn't a gigantic gamble.

So then how can I exhaust myself by keeping up with what's going on with bitcoin?

What has to happen for the potential value of bitcoin to become a mainstream adoption point? What BTC has on eg. gold are the programmatic, bookkeeping, and advanced accounting/contract aspects (negatives being its intangibility and lack of shininess), but as of yet these qualities are not used or useful. Obviously the long term idea is that the network will be robust enough to handle many millions of blockchain calculations a day, but how the fuck does shit get to that point, and how does it not get strongarmed out of the spotlight by government sponsored blockchain technologies? It's very easy to get excited about the potential, but a little easier to get pessimistic about what a. Needs to be done and b. Will likely happen along the way.
Intuitively, btc just seems like a bloviated fiat currency that is backed on something even shakier than debt obligation (that is, speculation about its actual utility). What makes it competitive and preferable to any of the potential thousands of other blockchain implementations? is it purely its status as most widely adopted blockchain technology?

Neoreaction is skeptical of central banking and fiat currency to put it mildly. Seems like the kind of crowd who would want to see BTC flourish.
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:18:56
Here's to hoping. Can you imagine? What an awesome price.
@_date: 2016-06-13 23:15:55
Look at any price chart of any trading instrument. Huge, fast, protracted increases in price more often than not correspond with a significant drop soon after. Hopping on the bandwagon at this point is EXTREMELY unwise because the inevitable sell off by people who bought in months ago will lower the price again, and if you buy in close to that sell-off point, then you lose money unless you have stop loss orders in place. Obviously you don't know how high it will go, but the higher it does go, the lower your potential profit margin/expected value on investment.
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:25:19
Well my dick is definitely the biggest. Take that, nerds.
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:23:21
Because fewer people agree that those currencies have value compared to BTC. That's it.
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:11:21
All these people saying they're gonna buy in sound like delicious targets for somebody who's sitting on a stack of short positions :)

No, but I quickly learned that you can run a node which prunes an arbitrary number of blocks from the locally stored chain without too much affecting your ability to confirm incoming blocks.

Yes, and they are as irrelevant and unrelatable as ever.

...the sub paid for an intentionally poorly drawn ad that called Bitcoin "magic internet money." Not sure what image you think this place wants, but retarded and childish are definitely on the list.
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:19:15
So the idea is that blockchain size increases exponentially as block size increases? Or that computational requirements increase exponentially as blocksize increases?

Hodl in a wallet with private key that only you control, wait for the fork, download the new node or wallet client for the new chain, enjoy your 2 types of coin.

Just through observation of everyone here: Handling FUD is how you make money. All the crises and angry arguments about 'what ought to be' are an indication of profit potential, and they are all there to scare you into giving someone else your money. The more you understand that FUD is not reality and it's there to take from you, the easier it is to let go and let your investments make money.

I have no info about the BCC wallet or which exchanges will even accept BCC, sorry.
@_date: 2016-07-06 01:13:48
Is there a term for the supply that is more or less immediately available/available for near spot price, including the btc that exchanges are willing to sell, the btc that randos have for sale otc, btc available to be used for products.... That supply might temporarily decrease post halving eg. if people begin to hod more (at least we all hope, heh). Seems like total supply is inadequate as a speculative stat.

I was literally thinking about leaning python for bitcoin purposes yesterday. Looks like I have no excuse now, thanks.

Might be able to mine an altcoin with a lower hashrate. You could speculate on said altcoin by hodling, hoping for the coin's value to increase relative to other established altcoin or btc. I haven't checked but there's gotta be some opportunity for arbitrage along those lines so you can actually be profitable mining a coin.

When the rewards stop, miners will still be required to perform cryptographic calculations to update/verify the bitcoin ledger as transactions happen. The idea is that enough people will be using bitcoin for transactions that the miners will be able to turn a profit by charging fees to process transactions. Miners already do this, by the way, it's just that they are rewarded for their efforts for solving blocks as an incentive to get the currency started, and to inflate the supply in a gradual, sustainable manner.

What is bitcoin supposed to be used for?
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:33:12
Buy some,  send it to a btc gambling website, withdraw to a btc tumbler and have it sent to a fresh address which you control. Tell the IRS to piss up a rope if they ever come knocking, which they won't unless you make the retarded blunder of trading btc for fiat via a regulated exchange.

It fucking SUCKS if all your bills are electronic and your mailing address is a PO Box. You have to bust out your fucking rental agreement. It's so god damn stupid, I will make sure never to pay taxes on my crypto gains just because the state has its fist so fucking far up everybody's ass that it ruins what should be a simple transaction. The coinbase situation is a perfect example of why we need decentralized, peer to peer anonymous electronic cash in the first place.

He said he doesn't have an economics PhD, implying he is uneducated in the field. If you can't parse that from his post, maybe you should reconsider your understanding of all those books you 'read.'
