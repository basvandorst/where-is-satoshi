Yikes. I don't think you should be slinging shit when you aren't thinking things through yourself. Maybe OP is the Plexcoin guy. If you are an American or Canadian and Bittrex is holding your wealth and there is a warrant out, Bittrex could be approached and the account could be deactivated, frozen, or seized.

Do you have any outstanding warrants? Are you wanted in any state or country? Have your assets been frozen by any banks? Do you have insane credit issues?

The government is the only entity that has the power to enforce environmental initiatives as well, which is a *long term* investment that businesses aren't interested in. Businesses and the "free market", which is run by mortals who only live 80 years, operate with an outlook of, say, 50-100 years, not 500 years. Our short lifespans are a massive constraint on free market economics. Wise men plant trees under which they will never sleep.

The US government is not a model government by any means, but there are many governments in the world doing great things and acting in the interests of its constituants. Also there are many levels of government other than the US federal branches which are just operating in this insane game theorist's hell

It wasn't created out of thin air. Others put their money in, you bought their money with your coins. You bought someone else's money. If you changed to USDT and then cashed out, there is less now invested in crypto.

The price all year has been held back due to uncertainty. Big players are waiting for guarantees, while small players were getting in for potential gains. Now the big players will get in, and 2X will happen next year or even in two years when the community is ready for it.

From my other reply:
Thanks for your thorough reply. By store of value I was referencing the anti/non-inflationary aspects of Bitcoin rather than its intrinsic store of value. Semantics, but an important distinction
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:00:18
Not everyone is understanding this video. He's not talking about fiat specifically (he is sorta, but not really). He is talking about the classically-taught *properties of currency*. Currency must store value, account for the value of other things, and act as a useful medium of exchange. Bitcoin hits all these points so long as the network is maintained and stable.
I'll describe the pitfalls of coconuts in reference to these properties. First I want to express that I do not have anything against coconuts. I do not have a bias. They are delicious, and coconut oil is is the duct tape of the oil family.
1. Coconuts are poor at storing value. They do not last forever and they rot over time. If you traded money for coconuts, you would want to use the coconuts as quickly as possible. By contrast, a seashell would stay as seashell a thousand times longer than a coconut would stay a coconut.
2. As a unit of account, coconuts could be just as good as anything, but it depends on the plentifulness of coconuts relative to the plentifulness of other goods. A highly plentiful item usually has less value relative to other items, so it becomes a good unit of account. Alternatively, an item that can be subdivided into smaller parts would be a good unit of account (a 1kg block of gold can become 1000 1g blocks of gold, or a Bitcoin which can be subdivided into satoshis/infinitesimals)
3. As a medium of exchange, coconuts are not very useful. Firstly, they are somewhat big compared to shells. If 1 coconut = 1 shell then think about how many more shells you can fit in a shopping cart, or in your pocket, or in your wallet. Coconuts, cows, televisions have value but they do not exchange well. Digital currencies, paper, and other lightweight and quickly-exchanged goods are excellent mediums of exchange.
The video speaks about shells representing a store of coconuts, which has to do with having a reserve representing an actual good. This isn't fiat currency. Fiat currency represents *enforce-ability* and *perceived value* - it isn't pegged against the value of gold or silver or coconuts. The US dollar has value not because it actually represents a store of gold, but because the US military and economy is itself very powerful. In the USA, it's illegal to not accept the US dollar as payment. The value of the US dollar is in not going to jail by not accepting it. This is why people do not like fiat currency because it's inherently based on centralization and manipulation.
Edit: going further, the reason Bitcoin is *not* a fiat currency is because there is an inherent cost of production (an input of electricity, technological capital in the form of mining equipment, and academic knowledge), the cost of which is increasing over time, which then increases the cost of creating a new Bitcoin and thus the value of existing Bitcoins (since all coins are ubiquitous - it does not matter when they were first mined, they are essentially identical). Why would a Bitcoin miner sell a Bitcoin for less than it cost to mine it, or for anything less than a small profit? That's the foundation of Bitcoin's store of value. The actual technology promotes it as a medium of exchange, and its divisibility as mentioned earlier makes it a great unit of account. This is why Bitcoin is not a scam or a fraud - it hits all the classical points of a currency. It's simply a transformation of input into a product that reflects that input.
Edit: wording, phrasing, fleshing-out of ideas.

Yeah the idea is that the actual currency doesn't degrade or change. With fiat, store of value implies that excessive money isn't being created. See Zimbabwe or Venezuela for recent examples. Their currency is a poor store of value because it's worth less and less each day, to a drastic extreme. Usually central banks peg the interest rate close to GDP growth. Pegging the interest rate above or below GDP growth is a mechanism used to speed up or slow down that growth. Some see this as manipulation. China undervalues its currency to maintain its net exports. China could arguably grow much faster if suddenly the renminbi was worth way more, but it also jeopardizes its trade advantages which got it to where it is in the first place. Most Western countries don't want to little or too much growth either. Most look at around 2% GDP growth per year, which is why you see central bank interest rates and inflation rates around that same figure. The small-growth thing is somewhat political and somewhat philosophical and almost entirely aimed at stability and aimed at giving those who currently hold large sums of currency, and those being paid in that currency, some confidence that their wealth will stay in tact year by year.

Because the creation of domestic currency is typically linked more closely to GDP growth rates, birth rates, and thus inflation rates. Crypto-enthusiasts believe it should be linked to spare electricity and graphics card technology, which doesn't comprehensively reflect the economy.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:31:09
I was being facetious but my point stands that currency for the sake of currency doesn't make sense. Currency should reflect something that is meaningful to that nation or group of people, and Bitcoin doesn't hit those marks for a sovereign nation, while cryptocurrency technology does slot in more generally for managing a fiat system.

I am certain that Catalonia will be able to sustain themselves without turning to Bitcoin as a money solution. They are highly industrialised and modern. This is not Venezuela. If their movement of assets is blocked or constrained by Spain I am certain they will be able to find banking options through Switzerland at the very least.
