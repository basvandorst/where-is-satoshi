Yea, you're confusing me dude.
You first say inflation helps loaners, not debtors.
You then throw out an implicit "not shit, Sherlock" at my statement which literally states the opposite (inflation helps debtors).
I don't see the need for being condescending. It is you who is being unclear, and I was (and am) actually legitimately interested in understanding what the flying fuck it was that you were trying to get at.

Inflation is good for debtors, not loaners.
Suppose loan of $100 with nominal interest rate of 2%. Inflation is 2%.
Repaid in a year, debtor gives back $102. But adjusted for inflation, its $100. That is, the real interest rate (which equals aprox. nominal - inflation) is 0%.
In this example, inflation exactly offsets the interest rate. Unless nominal interest rate was higher, loans would not happen.

What? I'm not assuming either of those things
It is simply true that if I borrow 1 bitcoin, and it keeps deflating, that is very bad for me because when I'm due to give back that 1btc it'll be worth some amount of times more than when I initially borrowed it. 
in other words, (kinda, sort of) real interest rates = nominal - inflation
r% = i% + deflation
suppose deflation rate of 10%
r% = i% + 10%
Unless the nominal interest rate is negative, then the cost of borrowing would be very high.
Do you think BTC loaners would be OK with setting negative nominal interest rates (ie: paying people to take their money) in order to offset the costs borrowers would incur by buying 1btc now and giving it back later?
