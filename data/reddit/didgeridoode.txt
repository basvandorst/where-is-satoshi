Now read again and think... You're giving the answer yourself: "the price at BTC will be automatically sold", not bought. That would be a stop-buy. A stop-loss (or buy) will never show up on a market depth chart, period.

Some? You mean on "not even half a coin".

If it's a lot of money for anybody, that anybody definitely shouldn't be 'investing' it in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:23:06
Imagine the possibilities! Satoshi invented free money, basically...

"The demand is there"... A often stated but never proven hypothesis. Looking at the charts and paying attention to the small details like the humongous red bars should be proof enough for anybody that the demand for BTC in general (even at the current rate) is, in fact, not there at the moment. If it weren't for China, there wouldn't have been enough demand to even get BTC to $100. If China is not on board, then that's where BTC is headed. You seriously think a couple of 100BTC orders (bots even) on finex and a handful of daytrading kids and amateurs will change anything about that?

"Holders are doing a great service"? And what service is that, exactly?
"Just because I'm saving doesn't mean I'm not spending lol wut"
Yes, saving does mean not spending, that's what the word means. Just like when you're spending it means you're not saving. It's really not that difficult, they're even two different words.

I always use my money to actually have a life. I've never understood why I should save up any money, except for the regular stuff like your car breaking down or whatever. It's the same with bitcoin, why the hell would I spend my money on bitcoin, hodl it and watch the rollercoaster? How does that make any sense at all? Yes, it might be worth a lot, but still, you sat on your ass watching a Chinese freakshow instead of having a life. It also has a high potential to crash, then you sat on your ass having no life and now you have no money either. The vast majority of you proud hodlers are only talking about a couple of thousand bucks, maybe a couple of guys with even $10k, sorry, but even that is absolulety nothing. The guys mentioning they spent another $100, you serious? Go do something useful. You want bitcoin to succeed? Stop hodling, start spending your bitcoin and try to live on bitcoin. Spend all of your money, but switch it for bitcoin before you're spending it. Stop trading, stop looking at it as an asset, use it as a currency.
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:06:54
I do not follow your logic, it just doesn't make sense. Long term hodlers will be fewer, bitcoin worth less and the few hodlers will have the equivalent value of 1 Terracoin after a while? Good luck with that! I'd much rather have adoption and coins divided among more people, that'l make only a tenth a coin worth more than a million hodled coins.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:15:36
Of course, nobody stops anybody from massive spoofing, which is seen continuously across all bitcoin exchanges. Also, stop-losses and the like are not portrayed in the graph, only current limit orders that are mostly likely pulled in the last seconds by the use of bots. This all pretty much renders a market depth chart useless. Better use some actual TA here, but then again, in this situation or in a similar heavily manipulated market even TA can be rendered useless.
@_date: 2017-01-18 00:06:52
It might be fun, but $400 bucks/month is useless. Get at least a decent amount in if you're trying to make some money, if that's the goal. My point is, trading/hodling is not helping bitcoin succeed.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:22:42
How can stop-losses be shown as bids? They are market sell orders executed when price hits a certain point. No way in seeing when they will be executed and how big they are. The exchanges themselves of course could see them and abuse that fact, I'm pretty sure they are.

Pretty much everything about bitcoin is speculative at this point. If there were any demand, there'd be no sell-off. You're only fooling yourself if you think those red bars depict demand.
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:56:05
True. A lot of people visit China, including myself, doesn't mean I trust the Chinese government one bit.

You're one of those people that think they should never pay more than production cost? That just doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:41:33
Yeah, those are the people here starting threads with titles like "I'm looking to invest $50 worth of bitcoin, how do I buy it.". That's definitely not going to help against today's countless 500BTC sell orders. Weak demand would even be good, at least that would mean there is some degree of demand. When big guys are trying to get rid of their BTC and they sell with market orders, then that's bad news.

They use bots of their own to set buy and sell walls. If you are placing a limit order far enough below/over their bot orders, your order is created almost instantly. Trying to place any order right in front of theirs, or selling/buying into one of their orders seems to trigger a removal/change of the bot order so you can't sell/buy into it or get in front. Your order then takes 10 seconds to a minute to be created or the web-interface simply generates an error after waiting for 20 seconds and the order is not created. The error mostly is not even displayed, you only see a red bar. It is absolutely impossible to use for fast daytrading or during high-volume periods. It's VERY annoying, and very unprofessional.
If they want to use bots, fine, but be good at writing them so your trading-engine does not use all it's resources to cross-check every paying users' order against your own! Or simply remove those dumbass bots altogether, there's plenty of liquidity on all markets to go without them.
EDIT: Even when you get an error, you can see their bot order jumping right in front of the price you entered, meaning that is was not just an error and your order was processed but not created.
EDIT2: If you place an order in their app, it seems to be placed without going through this checking mechanism. This works great to get around their bots, however, it'll take you -at least- a minute to enter or even to retrieve the right trading pair.

The only possible way for miners is via foreign exchanges. They have the funds to set up a system with a foreign company to be able to get the money out. For 'regular' people this is pretty much impossible, which is another reason for OTC for exchanges being pretty impossible. What in the world are small buyers going to do with that BTC when they can't exchange it back to CNY except for OTC. They would have to make a lot of profit trading BTC/whatever coin to be able to break even when selling back OTC.
I think OP is pretty accurate in his prediction that this rollercoaster is far from over. Too many people jumped back in to thinking BTC will now moon.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:22:06
I can imagine. Pretty sure you'll profit in the end. I felt stupid buying my first coins at $10. Am I glad I did right now.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:54:09
My point exactly.
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:44:45
Yeah, have finex stop using them for their inside trading.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:55:06

"If you hold you don't lose blah blah.." is of course for the greatest part a bunch of bs. If you bought the high in 2013 and held, you've tripled your money, but if you sold, bought back and held, you've got 40 times that money. Your choice of course, but hodling like an idiot and looking at red candles has not made anybody any richer. It's bad advice in general. Means you could have made 10% on your BTC today.
EDIT: Simply hodling also defeats the purpose of bitcoin, not transacting/using btc does not increase adoption. Buying stuff with 10% more btc than you could have yesterday holds people back from actually using their btc, further adding to the problem. All hodlers hoping for a house in ten years don't understand it'll be half-dead in ten years when nobody is actually using their btc.

Neither did I. Nor did I say you did. Just saying we're hitting level stupid again. Which we shouldn't be, whether it's buying or selling.

finex is a fraud.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:00:47
Either they withdraw BTC to sell against USD (unlikely but possible in some cases), or they sell to withdraw CNY directly, either way, it should drop on all currencies.
EDIT: Or, the volumes were so fake, everybody actually already did that in the past 2 days and all we are still seeing is the exchanges own bot's actions. Wouldn't even surprise me.

This and S2X HF, the main reasons for the next dip.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:03:25
I agree with a lot you say, however that is not the/OPs point. Good news long term does also not equal the bad news that it is short term. When miners can't sell their coins (even though I'm sure most of them will find a way), we'll lose a lot of hashpower from China. That's a major concern. It might be good long term, short term however it will push the price down even further. It might also be bad long term, we just don't know yet.
All he's saying is it is too early to be able to fully see the consequences, which is correct.
Edit: the panic-buying on the bounce confirms the critical mass of bitcoiners will continue to panic buy or sell either way, that will never come to an end whether good or bad news.
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:31:11
Actually it's already 11% in 24hrs, that's not nothing. From the looks of it it's quite a few big guys getting out, which means it's heading way further south. Some of the guys on this sub need to get their heads out of their asses. Trying to HODL their monthly $100 worth of bitcoin while whales sell them in single 500BTC orders. That's not healthy, it doesn't lead anywhere, it's just whales taking your money.

"To HODL" is not my point here. Just saying the panic-selling makes things far worse. Re-introducing volatility levels in the stupid range doesn't necessarily strengthen BTC/crypto in general.

I'm gonna say it again: great ideas do not necessarily end up 'being big'. Look at Betamax... Yes, Bitcoin is awesome and it could potentially end up as 'the biggest thing ever'. No, potentially killing off Bitcoin while being at war over blocksize will not push Bitcoin into the realm of the 'biggest things ever'. AIM can suck all of our dicks, statements like that are an open door.

Some Chinese HFT bots ramping up rate again... *sigh*... Who the hell still believes that crap? With centralisation all around, no actual trading going on but bots and zero adoption, this'll end in tears for a lot of people as soon as a couple of Chinese guys start cashing out in USD.
@_date: 2016-10-11 15:03:21
Yes, thinking it will you're implying all other factors are/stay equal. What if we stumble upon a shitload of gold? What if we find something else to be more desirable or of more value? Just like that, interest in BTC might deprecate, it does not have to have any value at all, that's why nothing is "due". It annoys me when people say "bitcoin should be at blahblahblah", it "shouldn't" be anywhere, it just happens to be somewhere and that's in no case an indication of future rates.
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:32:50

The arguments do, however, make sense. We could agree that blocks 2-11 are most likely Satoshi's, and therefore signing anything with the private keys of those blocks is more proof than signing it with the private key of block 1.
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:56:43
The argument does not rest on the delay between the genesis block and block 1, but on block 2 being mined 79 seconds after block 1, with the extranonce jumping from 4 to 11. This differs completely from the rate of increment that is showing between block 2 through 11. Apart from that, it would be a funny coincidence that the extranonce in block 0 and in block 1 is both 4.
Block 1 was mined the same day Satoshi released the software, why is it so hard to accept that because of this, the probability of block 1 not being mined by Satoshi is reasonably high? He surely would have waited to mine before the software was downloaded...

Lost a lot as well. Not all hope is lost though, I think there's still a chance it'll resurface. Now getting my crypto out of the other exchanges I am on.
