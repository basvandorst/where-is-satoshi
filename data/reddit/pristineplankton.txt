I believe that's M1. I got my figure here:  which you're right about, it doesn't include time deposits or such which would be counted in M2. M2 is at $13950.90 Billion [according to this site]( Of course, I'm sure Bitcoin will be worth more than all of the USD M2 supply, more than double all the world's gold and [half of all US stock's market cap combined]( by 2020. Seems legit.

Banks will be needed with cryptocurrency still. What do you think Coinbase is slowly turning into? Why do you think have all major banks teams working on blockchain tech as we speak. Do you think one day they are just going to pack up and stop doing business? Banks provide lot's of services beyond simply storing your cash, and even if that was the only thing they did there would still be demand for it in the crypto world too. Do you think the Winklefoss twins have millions of dollars lying on paper wallet under their pillows?

It's your wallet. If you claim that this isn't you should submit proof saying otherwise. And yeah, I was surprised too how little there was on it.

To be fair, you have to do a very high amount of research to understand Bitcoin. The main algorithm is extremely complicated, and without a solid grasp of Byzantine fault tolerance most of the code will go over a typical vice chairman of one of the largest companies on the planet's head. There’s also Bitcoins nihilistic outlook on the future of banking, which is deftly woven into it's philosophy - Satoshis ideas draw heavily from  Nick Szabo's and Wei Dai's writing, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these visions, to realise that they’re not just bold - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in r/bitcoins catchphrase “hodl,” which itself is a cryptic reference to a post a fat fingered guy made on bitcointalk. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as luke-jr’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a car with $BITCOIN$ plates. And no, you cannot hitch a ride. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ��

This subs obsession with Roger Ver is absurd. I come here to occassionally check out what's going on with Bitcoin but these days it's 50% memes and 50% Roger Ver hate. Haven't seen a post about what's going on with the actual tech in ages. Maybe there's nothing to talk about?

[Take your pick amongst the - by now - way over a thousand chains.]( Not here to shill anything but personally I'm interested in distributed storage and chains that can enforce contracts. I would advice against investing in anything you don't understand. If you don't know exactly why a certain project is better than the competition don't invest. 
To be fair in this crazy market we're in right now you could also just buy any coin and probably come out in the green. But that strategy works until it doesn't one day.

Because the smart people have moved on to other projects to build meaningful blockchain applications. Meanwhile Bitcoin has developed into a cash cow for the largest stakeholders and they're milking it hard. No sensible discussion allowed here lest you be censored. Circlejerk hypeposts claiming banks will be obsolete in a couple of years and fiat money is going to cease to exist are always good to get more people who don't understand the monetary system and are angry at banks/the government to come on board. Add to that all those crypto "news" sites constantly linked to. 
Btw: Bitcoin is a kind of fiat money, depending on the definition you use. Only difference is it isn't legal tender. But it isn't inflationary as it is now and the rate of inflation/deflation can't easily be controlled as it can be with government issued fiat. Which would actually be a weakness, not strength if it were to replace the dollar. The FED would lose one of their most important fiscal tools.

I agree. 
But people will not be their own bank. It's almost comical to me how removed some people here are from the real world. Regular people will not store their life savings on an immutable ledger where it's all gone if they mess up just one minute detail. Banks and insurance companies are not going to disappear. Banks have existed forever. You could have easily stored your gold somewhere "safe" in the past too, but most people didn't.

The Weimar Republic was a liberal state with [Berlin]( a major world city at the time. There were tons of Jews around, amongst all kinds of other people. The time right after the hyperinflation is called the "golden twenties" and was arguably one of the best times in the history of Germany with tons famous works of art, film, literature and music produced.

Lol. Total amount of the largest 18 currencies in circulation (excluding CNY) in 2016 combined: $4,7 trillion. 
Estimated bitcoin supply by 2020: 17718750
Which would at $1m per coin give you a BTC market cap of $17.72 trillion, or more than 3 times the amount of all major world currencies combined. Seems reasonable.

- Oktober 2017: "Those gains are nice already, but there's still room for more suckers to buy into this bubble. 
- Recently: "Looks like nearly everyone has sold by now. Time to buy back in. Let me say something critical of Bitcoin while at it to buy a few cents cheaper. Those plebs are so easily played. Rinse and repeat."

Ok, I got a question about those mushroom pizzas or whatever it is: Who would think it's a good idea to do shrooms in some busy backpackers restaurant in a third world country? I understand the opium and the weed but a full blown mushroom trip? 
You ever tried on of those? And are you sure they aren't actually just regular mushrooms with some with meth or some other popular street drug sprinkled on?

I didn't mean PGP keys. Maybe *signed* was the wrong word. The best proof we'd have is if he moved some of the early coins. Unless there's proof anyone can write messages in the name of Satoshi.

Do they store the actual coin? Or is it just an exchange with a physical location.

Musk is also quite busy with Tesla, SpaceX and co. What makes you think he even follows crypto startups? With Musk being such a serial entrepreneur, having founded at least 8 companies, having announced a new one this very year, and also with his track record of going all in with his private assets, it seems much more likely that his money is tied up in all those projects. And if there's anything left it's probably in a well diversified stock and bond portfolio like any billionaire has it. He isn't really in the VC business. Of course it's possible he's got some play money invested in crypto but it's really just speculation on your part.

Of course there will be more and more long term holders over time (like for example lost coins). And obviously in the first 3 years there wasn't anyone around to hold 3-5y yet.

Sorry to be so sceptical but you have your drink and then a full blown trip? Lasts 8 hours but feels like 2 days, something like that? I mean I'm sure there are people who'd enjoy something like that in such a public setting as a restaurant but that's rather rare in my experience. Also there must be a ton of first timers not prepared for it who totally freak out and the strange alien environment would just make it worse.
I'm no fan of meth btw, it's just a drug that all over the place and readily available in SEA, that's why I brought it up. I mean someone who'd never done shrooms wouldn't really know what they are taking.
