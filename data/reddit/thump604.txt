You should recheck prices for your "epicurean" and global GFE experience.  5 BTC won't be cutting it.

That’s the reason for the other projects required for the entire supply chain necessary to meet the various demands.

This looks very promising after I discovered it yesterday and read up on it.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:41:06
Very true my friend. I was there too and returned later and still blew it.  Maybe this time I get it right.

Me for a month, moving from wallet to Coinbase 
They are so busy they can’t get to me yet, but they have to to add more coins and more issues
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:36:31
It is possible for the transaction to be setup to fall out?

Gemini is more than a wallet

I'm stuck inbetween 2 lackluster entities providing no support(purse and Coinbase).  I have a transaction pending since November from Purse to CB.  Is there anything I can do to determine source of the issue to alleviate suspicions on Pursue shopper etc and move it along.   A mod here told me this was okay to post here, in this thread.  PS - I do not suspect the issue is a BTC issue, but looking for wisdom from knowledgeable community.

Is it a large correction? Trying to make sense of trading?  Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:02:49
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:19:17
Don’t use them. They are not to trust
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:55:09
Ya, their maybe trading it and will let me have it once they are done

What a riot 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:51:39
Is there a way to check the fee in this case and increase it?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:35:22
I think this is the correct one: 
I don’t know what the fee set is but I have sent same way before and after

Get a paper trading account on a real platform like Thinkorswim and learn

This is speculative investing where I recommend a buy and forget strategy of HODL long.  If you day trade alts be prepared for disappointment.  End of day make sure your decisions are based on pre established rules, not emotion.

I was going to say something similiar. but now only this.

Yes, but not as good as 7k

I wonder how long the public will allow and consent to this data collecting that can be aggregated for surveillance by corporations that serve customers. You really think LE needs Amazon for this and LE is the only intended customer?  This isn't about just Bitcoin, no about more private systems. This is about a public company collecting data from the data marketplace and creating profile for LE. Time to decide where you spend your money and what you will tolerate. The US having loose talks about consideration of something similar to GDPR is really quite pathetic and so late, especially coupled with fact the Snowden revelations were a core catalyst for GDPR.
