Interest is not related to fiat. I very much doubt there are people giving out interest-free cryptocurrency loans.


Currently, none, but you are right that those fees are wildly disproportionate to the cost of providing the service.
Also, unless I am very much mistaken, don't all of these cryptocurrency exchanges charge transaction fees for exchanges? Aren't there fees for doing Bitcoin transactions in general? You're making a very weak point indeed if you are claiming that cryptocurrencies are somehow liberating people from the tyranny of fees!


I think you are confusing a lot of topics together, friend. In one breath, you are talking about fiat currencies and central banks like the US Federal Reserve. In another, you're talking about personal banking (loans, ATMs, fees).

I think there are different kinds of trust.
I don't see why you think cryptocurrency is in any way better. I agree that the mathematical foundations of it are "trustworthy", but so much of the practical operation of a coin seems to rely upon flawed trust as well.
I mean, this post of yours was right next to this [one]( which sounds like a pretty huge flaw. Say what you will about fiat currency, banks, and credit cards, but I have more "trust" that I would have some recourse against similar fraudulent activity with the traditional infrastructure, and that's an important kind of trust to have.
When I casually read stories about exchanges collapsing (Quadriga CX) or smart contract loopholes getting exploited to let people swindle money from investors/account holders, I honestly don't get why you think the crypto world is actually better. The technical provability of the coin as a scarce resource vs the arbitrariness of a fiat currency seems like one of the least important aspects of the whole financial system realm.
