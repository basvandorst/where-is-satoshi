Never talk to the police. Even if you are innocent. If you think you will be better off or treated leniently if you talk you are wrong, so wrong.

I don't know where the author got the figures on number of accounts or simultaneous online users but they do seem to be (deliberately?) playing down the size of silk road.
In the early it days it seems like many of the sellers were small time dealers selling small amounts at above normal prices. Now it's clear there are some sophisticated organisations selling at wholesale prices and quantities, kg listings are now not uncommon. Also silk road now has options for vendors or products to be listed in stealth mode which are not publicly viewable; the admins explained stealth was added as some vendors wanted to disguise the size of their operations.
Silk road is much bigger than this article makes out. While the authorities may not be interested in busting buyers and possibly not dealers they will/should be interested in the long term implications. The site has been running about 18 months I think, what will it be like in 5 years?

Exposure on SR can bring sellers more business than they can handle, sellers need some way to control the growth of their business (other than  price).

How many do you want and were are you based?

It's not really my point I was paraphrasing the justification given by SR admins which was apparently based on feedback from the vendors. Sellers wanted to control growth and hide the size of their operations. 
It's a problem for sellers having bad customers claiming goods did not arrive. I can see many wanting to to build up a trusted client base. Also publicly advertising wholesale quantities negatively affects the retail market. You might not want your Kg listing right next to your 1g deals, especially if your only going to be offering Kg to customers with a decent trading history.

It's a really good use case for bitcoin. Will support it when I can

The tor browser bundle can be set up in minutes.
getting bitcoins is easier everyday.
the site it's self has an escrow system so dealers are not paid until you confirm delivery. Also the value of coins is hedged while in escrow so no worries about price fluctuation. It's very safe and easy.
You should have no worries at all receiving drugs in the post, if it was detected it would be destroyed the police would not try to get an arrest for a personal amount. But it wont be detected anyway. Obviously this depends were you live, bad luck if your Australian for example. Also If you are involved in other illegal activity at the same time your risk of being caught is multiplied as is the risk that the police will prosecute. Only commit one crime at a time.
The weak point for Silk Road is that buyers can cheat the system for refunds by claiming none delivery. Also LE can do this to make it less attractive to dealers. I predict this will happen more and more. Silk road will either adapt or fail and something else take it's place.

Straight question: What about Silkroad?
It's been running a log time (in relation to bitcoin economy)
It's profitable so little incentive to run off with my cash.
It's "battle hardened", so less likely to get hacked.

search for offshore hosting, most of these companies aim at gambling sites but would work for you. some also accept bitcoin
