Its not crazy, its sounds desperate. He wants people to buy bitcoin so the demand and thus the value increases, so he might cover his losses or sell at a profit.
Nobody knows if bitcoin will ever get above 10k again, especially not OP

Its not reposting if it hasnt been on reddit yet.
Aren't we all here because we're **not** on facebook, twitter etc.?
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:09:55
I blame those people who wan't to get rich with a minimum investment in a very short time. Not actually using BTC for anything else, creating a bubble and hoping to cash out early enough.

Darknet Markets, its what raised the value initially imo
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:58:03
because it could be going in the other direction as well.

so what is it now? They clearly scan your messages, or they have a secret master key, or are you just talking out of your paranoid ass?

"Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet"
What a joke if you don't use it
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:37:35
Thats an issue as well but not necessarily for the currency. 
The German people e.g. save too much money. More spendings would be better for the economy.

I only used bitcoins for buying things in the past but no that the prices, transactions fees and transactions times gone up (the daily fluctuation doesn't help either) it's pretty much not useful anymore. 
But that's the thing that jump-started BTC in the first place. I really hope it becomes viable again, even though I'm not holding anything.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:16:22
what are the current fees then ?
@_date: 2016-05-03 12:27:36
I found and registered for Cubits yesterday.
They're seated in Germany and accept a variety of payment options (credit card, bank transfer, some instant bank transfer agents)
I tried Sofort because the credit card handler doesn't accept my visa, but the transaction is pending for for 4 hours already.
But aside from that, it seems ok.
Fast verification procedure, 2fact auth. , nice GUI, fees heavily depend on payment method.

his arse
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:19:42
Thats it, I better sell my 0.05 Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:34:16
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:27:00
At what price did you buy in?
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:29:04
and now your credentials pls
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:31:18
And that food place sells the received bitcoins for regular currency. 
At least the exchange providers will be happy
