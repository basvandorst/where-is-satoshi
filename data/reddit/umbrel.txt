We don't have direct relationship with all providers in the world, sometimes there are 2-3 third party companies in between, so we cannot make it cheaper. We're looking for better rates for popular destinations all the time.
For US and few other countries fees are 0% (our offer for T-mobile only became worse just 2 weeks ago, so now it's not 0%)

Hi, easiest way to find out if it's supported - to just enter the number into the form.
This list you mentioned actually is just a dictionary of prefixes, not intended to provide coverage information.
We're trying to improve all the time, and your suggestion will be taken into account.
There is also a coverage map
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:30:27
Yes, it is. We have agreements with mobile networks directly or indirectly through 1-2-many 3rd party distributors.

Hi guys, I'm one of guys who's working on this service, we will check what happened with your orders and comment here

BTC is nothing here. There is 1 physical merchant 
10-15 people are coming to meetups.
Why I do that? Because I don't lose anything except my time

Sorry to everyone who experienced similar issues. This is high-load related problem, our traffic today is much higher than usual and some parts of the system do not behave well.
Please, try again later

Webmoney is there for a year now. Yes, you can do that through webmoney if you're ready to pay high fees.
But it will appear as separate and easy to use service.

Believe me, it's not on purpose, just never had time to list all countries
Maybe useful:

You be surprised, but you may find similar services not related to Bitcoin and they charge exactly same fees as we do, just because there is no other way in some countries.

I know for sure, It's my original tweet. These kiosks are one-way only, but that should be enough.
These are actually payment kiosks of ManGo wallet company. They have nothing to do with crypto-currencies at the moment.
Bitcoin will appear on mentioned kiosks as one of services.

You don't need 2-way ATM if you truly believe in Bitcoin =)
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:39:52
Just wait couple weeks until it's announced
@_date: 2014-05-06 08:23:14
It's really not a big deal, I can start same service, but there is no demand
@_date: 2014-04-20 07:04:20
It has nothing to do with bitcoinwireless, except the idea is similar.
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:46:12
It's different country to country. In some places we have 0% fees, while it sucks in some others. Thanks for the feedback

Must be javascript problem, not all posted fields contain proper values.
I'll continue testing, while you may try to reload the page and start over after all javascript is loaded.
@_date: 2014-04-20 10:16:21
Thanks for the info, we will try to contact them to check if they are interested in partnership.
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:40:43
"... and it doesn't actually sell bitcoin directly." - yet

That's good, but there are 2 things:
For client side generated QR chat clients still won't show preview.
Domain has to be somehow in community hands, then wallets can safely use it, otherwise they will not trust it.
@_date: 2015-11-19 19:12:32
Anonymity is not my biggest concern here, what information will be available to the server? IP addresses of servers for that particular chat client, which prefetches the url to show preview to the user? I'm pretty sure it's not really a secret anyway.
Wallets will not request this link, they will only attach themselves as handler

Applied a month ago, I'd love to get any response at all.
"You're not good enough" would be ok.
