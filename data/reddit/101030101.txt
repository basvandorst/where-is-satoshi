It's cool. All this is teaching an entire generation of digital kids, is that old people celebrated by other old people for being authorities say stupid shit most of the time. 
It's important to make your own mistakes, learn from it, and gain wisdom from it instead of getting some sort of formalized educational authority (diploma) by listening to those old people. That is not how smart works. There are millions of highly educated fools out there.

Don't mention it again. And definitely don't cash out an investment that you don't want to cash out because someone else wants you to. Just buy her stuff or a vacation which just seems quite expensive out of nowhere. If she asks, say it's because you made so much on Bitcoin, and kill and avoid the subject again. She'll get curious eventually.

So basically you're saying that in the last days, a large amount of shorts were opened on a stable pricelevel (with spoofing walls thrown up on every dip) and all that needs to happen for those shorts to become profitable is a sizable dump down at the right time to snowball the TA bots into selling.

There has never been a store of value that was mostly owned by the youth of the population. Ownership of other stores of value were always correlated with old age or being born in the right circles. 
It would be a paradigm shift if this one works out, so I'm not too worried that some need a bit of reassurance and justification on it.

Just liquidating assets. Starting with inventory, since that's never getting worth more $. 
Then the next thing on the balance sheet, to cover operational expenses and possibly future investments. They're not willing to liquidate BCH yet, since that value might go up a bit.

Remember Paul the octopus that predicted the world cup matches correctly? Anthropic principle says, that if enough people make predictions, there's always one that just randomly happens to be right every time.
Also, there was this story of a trading god/expert that turned like 2 btc into 200 btc. And he was right so often, that he lost 200 btc in just a few wrong trades one day.

If I'm reading this correctly: in March 2018 pure speculation overtook genuine interest and trading, and in July 2018 the genuine interest started increasing again after the blowoff from December 2017. Means we should be in a general uptrend again, but with Bart patterns persisting (and possibly getting worse).

It's called a fake buy wall. It helps someone with deep pockets sell their remaining stack at a fixed (higher) level, because others will place buy orders just above it, and once pulled the price goes much below it.
If these 'buy walls' appear, you know big pockets are cashing out.

First, there's hundreds of moments in the last 2 years that contradict the current stability. Snowballing of leveraged positions, manipulation, sudden spikes and dumps from insider trading, stablecoins shitting themselves and driving trading bots insane, etc etc etc. Legislators and regulators have a much longer memory than most of us.
Second, the price is currently clearly controlled, by Bitfinex leading the market. Just look at the walls and trades both ways and all you can do is laugh about the blatantly obvious price control. Anyone can see this, and blatant price manipulation is not a sign of a stable asset worth investing in for the fundamentals.
For what then? I don't know. Maybe to allow extensive OTC trading at a stable pricelevel for now. Or maybe to be stable and then slowly rising when the stock market goes to shit, luring mom and pop investors over at the right time. But definitely not to please dinosaurs. That's like hearing a lying kid say "look, I'm definitely honest now, because I haven't lied in the last 5 minutes!"

On the positive side, at least there wasn't an OTC transfer that would have just shifted ownership from one massive owner to another. 
Selling it on exchanges, it ends up with thousands/millions of people, and I think the more Bitcoin gets distributed the better it is in the long run. Even if whales/traders bought most, they will sell again on a runup in the future, increasing the distribution to fomo buyers.
No point in a few rich people holding massive wallets for Bitcoin to grow.
@_date: 2019-02-13 09:03:24
Yeah, or they just install WeChat, Alipay, Grabpay or one of the other massive payment providers that are used pretty much everywhere by the 1.3 billion people in China. They turn down cash in most places, pointing at the QR logos. No WeChat, no buy.
Trying to become a mobile payment platform is seriously 2-3 years too late in Asia, where &gt;60% of every soul on the planet lives. While bitcoin was fighting over Segwit, LN, bull/bearmarket and hodl, they sucked up the market potential for mobile payments. Done deal.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:17:46
It's a feature, not a bug. The feature is that only 1 Bitcoin is supposed to exist after a fork. Having a long (2016 block) adjustment time ensures that the chain with dropping hashrate dies, so that no 25 different Bitcoin versions co-exist. It could also mean it's the current/old/incumbent Bitcoin to die. Either way, it's by design.
Changing it requires a hard fork. They take months to prepare as a minimum if you want to do it safely. So the choice is with the user. Move/migrate to another coin, or accept the current status and hold.

It went from $14 to $1000+ in a year (x70-x75), after which the biggest exchange (80% volume?) collapsed. Early fortunes, most of the stolen coins, tanking investments from the earliest fomo'ers, all were liquidated in the many months following before a new balance was found.
Now it went up roughly the same in terms of $ multiplication, but over almost 3 years, while dozens of better quality exchanges came around and the ecosystem and general awareness grew a lot. Then a crash, but no dramas, no major catalysts, just profit taking from the bubble. You don't x100 without a bit of x0.3. 
It's still up 30x from the last bear bottom btw..... A low in February (2 months after the crash) hasn't been broken until now (11 months after the crash). 
Not all cycles are made equally.

Well, it's been said that market capitalisation is a useless metric for crypto since the beginning.
I mean, the market capitalisation of USD is immense, and rising steadily for the coming years/decades. Yet, a USD devalues every year, but still people prefer it above all else for payments or savings. It's a useless metric.

Huge for the regime yes. Lure in crypto, then force adoption of own coin because it's soooo much better and safer, pushing people to exchange their crypto for their coin.

What you bought into is worth about $1000 maybe. What others bought into is worth $19.5k, or $0, depending on whether or not they are bullish or bearish on their speculative asset.
Face it, the price was driven up by speculative FOMO, not by fundamentals. To which point it'll go down once that FOMO disappears is what everyone is waiting for.
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:14:11
Don't be naive. One of the 2 chains is supposed to die quickly. This was intended by the original bitcoin design. You don't want several spinoffs to co-exist. The fact that BCH cheated on this by forking with replay protection and EDA is the reason why it's still annoying BTC at this moment.
You don't need replay protection if you can't transact on one of the 2 chains. The small hashrate chain should be considered unsafe, vulnerable to attacks and unstable as well, requiring 20 confirmations possibly before a transaction would be deemed safe.
One of the 2 chains shouldn't survive long enough for anyone to send coins and wait for exchanges to support both, so the whole hardfork (which is deemed an upgrade) could be pretty much a non-event.
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:12:54
You're asking why there is a dump out of nowhere, taking the price from ~3900 to &lt;3500? How about people trading on inside information? Like when that happened with the Chinese exchange closure news. And the BTC-e closure/arrests. You're left to see why the price has gone down until after news is released. It's how free markets work, get over it.

A supermajority hardfork, where ~95% of the hashrate follows the new rules that went into effect (what Segwit2x has been since it's activation), is the update that Bitcoin is going to have. The forking point in November is where the 2MB part gets followed through. The minority not accepting these new rules will fork off the majority chain and can stay with it's own desired rules, or implement new ones. 95% of the nodes can enforce the rules of the 5% hashpower (be it overkill though) and 5% of the nodes can enforce the rules or the 95% hashpower (be it on the low side), there is no conflict there, just different chains and visions. Ideally, the minority chain should die, as there should only be one bitcoin, no matter how vocal or creative this minority is with measuring what a majority is. The original thought was, hashpower = voting power. This remains unchanged, until a group forks off and installs different rules. Until that time, if you want a vote, put your money where your mouth is and get hashpower. You don't get to vote, or change the voting rules, just because you disagree with the majority of hashpower. Hardfork away with different rules or PoW algoritms to do that.
The Bitcoin Cash chain cheated on this, by changing the difficulty rules, allowing them to survive where they should have died. The point was, they never wanted a single Segwit block, hence the rush hardfork off the main chain, with replay protection, leaving everyone on both chains in peace. This will also mean, that Bitcoin Cash will not implement Segwit, as this was the reason for forking in the first place. And the more the Segwit2X/Segwit crowds seem to be ready to go at war, the better Bitcoin Cash will be as a hedge. A bunch of major altcoins will also be waiting to profit from this chaos.
Now, all of this speaks of the technical side of things, and partly of the social and emotional part of it. Eventually, the market will decide. The Segwit2X and Bitcoin Cash hardforks might slow-brick all the current ASIC mining equipment. The Core developers that do not wish to switch to other chains might have coded their last lines on bitcoin already. Roger Ver might be the new head figure for bitcoin. Core might have struck a genius path through the current murky swamp and might have saved bitcoin and everything it stands for. Dash might rise to the throne, or perhaps Dogecoin will. We'll find out in the next months for sure. I'm for sure keeping in touch with what is going on without tying myself to an outcome, even though the 2 (3? 8? x?) piles of monkeys on their respective rocks would rather see vilification, shit-throwing and all-out war just to get stuff going their way. Grow up, learn business and respect other individuals. I support the principle of bitcoin either way, and depending on what the market does, will continue to make the crypto end boss chip away at the powers that necessitate its existence.
And if I've said terribly stupid things above, so be it. I'm just a dude that loves bitcoin/crypto and wants it to succeed on all levels. The fact that I've said dumb and stupid things would then show that it's actually pretty hard to have an educated opinion even for pretty well informed laymen, which are already miles ahead of the general population.

So..... technically, with both claiming to be the real original and unbroken main chain of blocks called bitcoin, they have now dumped waaaay below the depths of the 2013/2014 bear market. 
They're currently making new 5-year lows.
Boy, crypto enthusiasts and adopting merchants will LOVE that.
