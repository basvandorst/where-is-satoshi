When you set up your wallet, did you copy your seed (12 /24 words)
If so then you don't have to do anything.
Just install the wallet app on your new phone, pick the option "restore from a seed"
Then type your words
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:24:19
So everything should be OK ;)
Yes that's it, your words are your coins. They are not stored on your phone but on the blockchain.
The wallet app is just a way to interact with the blockchain, check balance, send and receive transaction

How do you change BTC to Monero without having to pass by an exchange ( which obviously have your ID )  ?? 
Even if they have your ID will they be abble to trace the transaction ? Can they see that you exchanged BTC -&gt; XMR ?

The average cost of electricity in the US is $0.12 per kWh. For a single server I'll use 3741kW annually as an estimate. That would be about 450$ per year per machine.
Let say you can do 10^14 decryption per second. That is 3.15x10^21 decrypts per year for one machine
You need to do (on average) 2^255 decryptions in a year, so you would need :
( 2^255 / 3.15x10^21) = 1.84x10^55 machines.
To figure your cost you would multiply that by 450$ and get about $8x10^57 or 8 octodecillion dollars.
Gross World Product is about 63x10^12.
So brute forcing a 256bit-key would cost about 10^44 the GWP.
Edit : maths are not mine

Bitcoin is a currency that exists on the internet, that is created on the internet and that realy serve the needs of the Internet generation.
It does not belong to any governments, it is not controlled by any banks.
Bitcoin isn't a company, a product or a service.
 
It is an internet protocol, a method of communication just like we say the Web or email. It does not belong to anyone, it's a shared commun public good on the internet.
Bitcoin is a digital currrency and payment system that is a shared good and it is controled collectively by the participants on the network
 
It is a completely global and open system of money that anyone can participae in without asking permission, without registering for an account or showing IDs
All they need to do is download an app, like you would if you want to surf the web and download a browser.
If you want to participate in bitcoin all you need to do is download a bitcoin wallet and you can participate in the network, send receivepayments 
 
BITCOIN IS OPEN, BORDERLESS, NEUTRAL, CENSORSHIP RESISTANT INTERNATIONAL MONEY THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO BANKS OR GOVERNMENTS
