What do you mean "his talks"?   As in transcripts of the ones he's posted on youtube?

The actual value of gold is far lower than it's current value.  As far as economies are concerned, if it reverted to that actual value overnight then it wouldn't be all that much different than crashing to 0.

It is not as soon as you think.  Based on average life span and current age of baby boomers, they going to be around for a while. 
But American baby boomers are only a small part of the global market.

This is far from the last time a new technology will grow quickly. It will something different next time, but it it will happen over and over again.

On one hand we need those people to grow adoption.  On the other hand, they were here for profit, and they will be back again for profit.  This wasn't a one time cool trend.

Stop posting about it!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:47:58


The difference here is that blockchain is global.  The American baby boomers are only a very small part of the potential user base.  Crypto doesn't necessarily need baby boomers to increase adoption.

To be fair, that is true for many things while travelling.   You wouldn't travel with nothing but a Visa card in the same way that you shouldn't travel with only Bitcoin.

Then why are you here commenting about it here?   Just use your bank and continue with your life.

On what time scale?

This isn't going to happen overnight, but that doesn't mean it can't happen.  Technology is growing quickly.  Our processing power, data storage, communication structure and more are improving every day.  Years ago the data that we consume today sounded like science fiction.  
People around here absolutely overestimate the adoption rates.  The banks aren't going to be shutdown because of blockchain next year.  But in the longer term future it absolutely is not impossible.

How does Brave compare to the new Firefox version?   
I have some research to do.

There isn't one single answer.

I don't know what your point is, the statement you quoted is still entirely correct.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:01:29
I'll stick with my generic example to show a concept.  Thanks for the input.

We aren't stuck with the current state of bitcoin forever.  Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market is relatively brand new and developing.  
There are other cryptocurrencies that are better for privacy and remittances.  As development continues and adoption increases then we will see a more defined landscape of what crypto can accomplish and how it compares to the other services that already exist.

Well for USD it is bad to keep a set amount of dollars in a savings account because the value of those dollars would decrease in value over time due to inflation.   So it is important to find a way to use the dollars in savings in order to not lose value.  We end up loaning our money to the banks so they can use it and compensate us for that usage. 
The same concept isn't popular in bitcoin yet, but it is entirely realistic in the future, and from other cryptocurrencies.   But that doesn't mean that bitcoin today cannot qualify as a currency.

Maybe you should should look that up yourself before claiming to know the outcome.

Well Monero for one.   And others.
None of these were are easy to develop, and all of them need to be "paranoid" about their security.

Define "almost nobody"?   How many people is that?
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:51:16


So what is the threshold between investment and currency?   When 10% of users use it as a currency does it then become a currency?  20%  40%?    
Millions of people obtain and hold USD in a savings account.   They don't plan on using it, they are just holding it until they retire in a few decades.   Does this mean it should not be considered a currency in that situation?
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:01:01


Well that is blatantly false.  


I'd suggest selling any crypto you have and buying those beanie babies.   Keep us updated on how it goes.

If you want it for the price it's worth then go buy it yourself from an exchange.  They are doing work for you, that's not free.

How are the votes set up?  Is it based on hash power or something else?  
For example, if I set up a mining PC at home, how much would my vote count compared to someone who has a serious dedicated ASIC mining rig, or multiple in a data center.
