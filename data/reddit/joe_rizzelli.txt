Something I have been thinking for a while was to fork to add back at least those we know are lost. But this would be very contentious. On the other hand I realized by reading economic theory that as long as it is sound money, it just needs to be divisible to a quantity fit for purpose, i.e. purchasing power, the total number of coins does not matter. 
We need to think that in our fiat wallet today, we are interested in taking with us a specific amount of “purchasing power”, say equivalent of 20$ bills. It does not matter if it is 2x10$ bills or 1000x10 Bolivar bills.

Nice, have a few questions? 
Basically that remittance centre works like an ATM? Or there is something more involved like multisig&amp;co?

How much of their machines is kept to BTC mining? Is it known? The can drop bch hashpower and move it fully to btc i guess?
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:47:18
eheh will do!
@_date: 2018-10-26 09:48:42
i have seen people fomoing into this...
@_date: 2018-10-20 06:24:00
yes, but i have seen it around
@_date: 2019-03-10 12:50:13
Is the theory that they lost money starting to mine BCH and dumping BTC? They are still mining BTC tho and I guess can switch back..there must be something more to it.
@_date: 2018-10-28 14:32:23
i have been to the other bar, the one that does bot accept BTC, and i paid with my card..so it is cashless in the sense of no cash but they take fiat. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:02:45
ahahah nice one!
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:34:44
ahahah nice!
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:04:22
man, it is all about the market... demand/supply sets the price, regardless of the cost of making it, regardless if miners hodl or not.

@_date: 2018-06-21 21:26:21
i think the real question is: how do you prepare yourself for the next big financial crash? Would be nice to have a book on it, like how to diversify etc. in these cases.  Crypto could be a safe haven but that is not as of today, not now, we need more stability at least in BTC with all this pump and dumps people won’t see it as a safe place to put money on. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:44:31
the move to viewership based model for cell phones/already commoditised services with a lot of competition (ok maybe not usa) I do not understand...For instance for those who owned a 2G phone back in the days every call and sms were billed on the spot. Then the subscription models came in later and has been a great success because we are online all the time. 
If we talk like vehicle insurances then yes I agree. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:06:41
Look, I did not mean that. I am running a BTC full node now and checking into LN and for sure it is not easy! But I just thought that having LN payment for a company will be like having a till and a POS today, it does not require coding skills to set it up. So if you learn the code you will be able to do much more than installing LN terminals :) 
@_date: 2018-06-21 12:56:52
eheheh real garbage but it’s on us to educate people around
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:37:17
an expert at setting up LN for businesses? isn’t it supposed to become as simple as sending email? Not sure I understand what this expert would do? Unless you mean one of those “experts” that come home to install a router to my parents :) 
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:10:56
yes agreed. Although I checked last 24hr volume of google stocks was about 1.2M -&gt; 1.5B$, vs 4B$ Bitcoin....so actually volumes on Bitcoin are much higher, at least on exchanges....so I am confused a bit here :) 
edit: ah maybe because price of btc is 7x price of google stocks? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:48:22
why the fed would need to buy more toxic assets? in theory they should be buying govt bonds to put more money in circulation..
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:40:05
I have only recently come to realise that there are really 2 scenarios: 1)you joined very early and increased already substantially the value of your asset vs fiat. It makes sense to use the asset, help those merchants who decided to get it. And obviously fund startup or invest in general that will push down the low fees and immediate payment stories. 2) like many, you worked hard and bought at 15-19k$. Then it would be either a) you had no clue and just bought the moon&amp;lambo fantasies, or b) you bought in the vision of BTC as means of exchanging value without central authorities or monetary policies. As for a) it does not make sense, because you either already sold at 6k$ for fear or just waiting for the value to go back to 15-19k, with no interest whatsoever as the coins may still be on coinbase. Now, for b) you bought the vision at 19k$, and maybe keep buying, then you might spend only to reward merchants, and to fuel the new “economy”, not because is particularly convenient for you. Anyway in this case you are actually waiting the world realise the value of having a scarse digital asset that can be transferred across the world, which will be happened thru fiat-run govts messing up with their people and/or faster Internet geographical coverage than financial access points can be created.

ahaha yes sure :) good luck! 
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:22:53
I think that should Bitcoin become settlement layer for more than payments then maybe a lot of TXs would make mining still profitable. Plus new tech that will be more energy efficient so to leep
PoW costs down. However, I have no idea how much miners can gain when all payments will go over a layer 2. Does anyone have an idea? 
@_date: 2018-06-19 23:50:26
dude makes sense to me, but i do not have an answer :) What I am trying to do when now selling a few musical instruments i no longer use, I would offer a small discount if I get paid with BTC just to incentivize people :) 
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:20:58
Nice review good job!
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:57:39
watched it this morning! they could have hinted to some work in progress to increase txps and the fact that bitcoin is not anonymous :) 
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:23:24
ok thanks but what is the author’s conclusion on whether we need crypto or not? bc the title hints at a good discussion on the need of crypto but it is actually covered at the end in a few lines -_-
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:13:21
true, pretty obvious. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:45:00
when playing with leverage? o.O Or maybe volume is in $
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:47:14
exactly my point
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:08:17
again, nobody cares how much you spend to make BTC or if you hodl or not. The market (demand/supply) sets the price...plus I can move to other coins remember. Even if you were alone producing BTC and the price would be very low, but nobody wants it, then you could keep all you mined BTCs...which you may exchange for other coins or not at loss, your problem, bc no demand.
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:58:24
Yes I am already planning to stop my revolut premium membership 
@_date: 2018-06-04 09:16:32
maybe if you have commitments like mortgage and other expenses you could leverage your btc asset and get a loan with the likes of SALT??
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:43:16
thanks for the explanation, this says that marketcap is not great metric for crypto. But not I am wondering why it is for stocks? Say Google’s market cap is 781.5B$ but also what you said applies here. However in stock market marketcap is used with much more confidence.....
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:36:14
if it works would be game changer
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:18:42
ahahah nice once!
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:46:40
mmm ok, can you summarize the point made by this article? and what value is this adding to our crypto knowledge?
@_date: 2018-06-23 16:36:01
I do not think we “complain” about Bitcoin...it’s just a lot of people joined at peak, then kept buying the dip but we are still near the lows...it is more “disappointment” I guess then complaining. I did all the above but I also kept studying the technology/software which is so fascinating, which most of those joining at peak did not. Had they done that, there would have not been any disappointment. And so us, the community, we have to keep them educated, that is also why I started to create some tech educational videos on BTC in my own native language. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:42:19
Hey man this article is a bit pointless tbh
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:07:33
Yes good take on the market cap topic
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:12:56
uh?! the hell is that? just to confuse more I guess
@_date: 2018-06-12 04:52:18
Of course
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:52:35
dude, you dropped the mic to an empty bar, anyway, the flaw in your point is that you are assuming demand for the asset. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:06:33
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:30:34
nice design!

why the metal dip before stocks? If that bc people selling gold and buying stocks at ATH for fomo?
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:42:47
Not sure what part of “market (demand/supply) sets the price” you do not understand. It is all market cycles. I can make a beautiful painting spending a lot of time and raw materials, but there may not be market for it.  Or I could get an offer at very low price and I have to sell it to feed my family, and that will be the price. 
We have to be careful here as btc community, the reality is that there is no sound theory backing the idea of the floor prices for BTC as asset class. It’s all about use cases and demand.
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:56:11
that sounds right to me if and only if BTC will have reached more stability or much more volumes than today...
@_date: 2019-06-01 07:38:53
Hey guys do you think this is going to divide the community again? Ending up in the private BTC vs the existing traceable BTC?
@_date: 2019-06-02 19:28:49
yes..i did not put that in bc (to me) that is less likely than digital gold
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:08:12
Really? I find this hard to believe..
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:04:27
i do not understand this point “the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin” can you explain?

I suggest you watch this video from Andreas Antonopoulos. I understand the concerns but there are other methods to increased privacy by using Bitcoin as it is today. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:02:24

@_date: 2018-07-07 21:00:58

yes, but no GBP afaik
@_date: 2018-07-01 16:06:18
I would say custodial services, insurances, more business developers to incentivize merchants particularly around food/groceries. That is for developed countries. For instance, even in London adoption is very very low when it comes to restaurants, bars, shops. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:39:29
The other question is: can bitcoin become a global currency knowing that out of 21M, few millions have been lost? You could say even some gold got lost, right but here we know for a fact how much will ever exist. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:36:30
At the end it’s a matter of network effect, not hashing power. Yes, they can do all of that, but then Bitcoin, as we know it, will still live and you can choose to support that chain by using it.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:07:48
totally agree
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:04:58
love this!!

@_date: 2018-04-21 10:42:20
Google doing the same, the idea is having a blockchain cloud product. Which is fair for those who want to experiment with this tech whilst being in isolation...basically proposing a blockchain as a service. Nothing wrong with it and good for incumbents. Not all applications have to be running as decentralised, particularly for business operations. Obviously you won’t go and create a worldwide digital currency on a “blockchain as a service” platform :)  
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:33:14
I had issues too earlier today, basically when you wrote this post
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:40:23
I came to this conclusion after pretty much 2yrs. 
In developed (semi stable) countries btc solves for having a (possibly wolrdwide known and recognised) digital store of value that, if ever needed, would be easy to transfer. 
The pain with existing payment methods is not *big enough* for the average joe (in developed countries) to switch to btc for payments. 
This should change as they become more aware of financial transaction privacy issue. But not certain. 
If streaming money becomes a mainstream reality then they will most likely switch.
All the rest of use cases will come from unstable and developing economies. 
On ledger absolutely impossible btw.

**Privacy on Financial Transactions**
It’s funny&amp;scary at the same time, as I woke up this morning and read this on linkedin!
Literally yesterday evening I was talking to two colleagues about me being a supporter of privacy on financial transactions for normal people like ourselves. 
Because we are going all-in into a cashless society (which i love for the practical benefits), just think of if this “service” from Barclays became enforced upon us. 
Today we are struggling to accept or deal with privacy on data when surfing the web. I think this will look so meaningless in 10yrs when we will have to cope with our purchasing power and spending habits potentially being censored.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:14:08
sure. But look a bit further..and this feature being rolled out to everybody but used at customer discretion today, it really feels like the framework being put in place to trigger massive censorship in a cashless fiat money society.
