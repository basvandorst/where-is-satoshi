Is it too late to get in on this
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:40:23
Sorry, I should have mentioned that. I'm stationed in the U.S. right now.

I've tried but no luck. The thing is I don't have physical access to my bank because of my location, the only thing I can really do is use my debit card or link my bank account.
Any suggestions?
