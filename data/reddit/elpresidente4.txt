You are correct. The bitcoin hype is over unless people actually start trading goods for bitcoin. All this talk about no need for fiat currency and so little adoption among the major goods sellers.

Guys, i think the best moment to sell was at 20K. Now, when there's no south korean exchange to artificially inflate the prices, the price is stabilized at realistic levels. This thing couldn't go on forever. There's a certain psychological barrier up to which people are willing to buy a bitcoin. If it becomes too expensive - nobody would really want to invest in it. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:02:52
according to me it's gonna be mostly around 5K

Call me a bitcoinless pesimist if you like, but I don't think the financial revolution will come soon.

It seems the market for bitcoin will be useful mostly for traders with lot of money to burn. Buy low sell high to gullible people.

Why does this company exist yet? Too many people not realizing they can use their debit cards to send or receive money?

Well, it takes me 2 years to save for 20% of one bitcoin so, I think I'll pass for now.

As an ignorant person what does this mean?

Gold was a threat to the economy, because the bankers couldn't stretch the balloon too much. With fiat currency you can stretch the balloon as much as you want. Just gotta be careful that people trust it.

Why is Shakira buying bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:45:34
why didn't you buy when it was all low for like a year?

I dunno, how many times in mankind's history has everyone who invested in such a "mirracle" become rich? Yes, a certain percent always will get rich, but everyone? I like the idea of everyone being rich, but lets face it, we're on planet Earth. Life isn't supposed to be easy for everyone.

Bitcoin hasn't changed my life at all, I am too poor and don't wanna risk my slow accumulated savings for something so fickle, but I like the energy of this place.

I hope it works out for them. I think people should have money in their pocketses.

The cost of mining one bitcoin in China is $3172, the price is getting there. Once it hits that threshold, it will drop down even faster.
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:52:38
You started buying when they were most expensive to buy? Wow, at this point, you are screwed even if you sell, so I suggest keep it.

I love the passive aggressive tone of this.

Whenever I have a possibility to buy bitcoin, I'm always without extra money lying around. If I have money I usually forget about bitcoin.

Ok, If I buy lets say half a bitcoin and in the next months the value goes up to $10000, does this mean that I can double my money just like that? Seems too good to be true. Where do I even buy bitcoins?
