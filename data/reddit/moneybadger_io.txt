Ronan from MoneyBadger.io here. Another way to 'evangelize' would be to use my service to send some small amounts of BTC to friends/colleagues.

Check out our service [MoneyBadger](
Very easily send Bitcoin by email, **no accounts required**!
Bitcoin is returned to you if it's not collected.

That's one of the features, yes. However, it's not some advanced mixing/tumbling service; MoneyBadger simply acts as a middleman, thus making it that little bit more difficult to trace source/destination funds. 
MoneyBadger can also be useful when gifting someone Bitcoin, especially to those who are new/unfamiliar with Bitcoin.

Hi BitcoinFuturist, Email communication is encrypted for the initial 1-2 hops, however as you mentioned, there is no way to guarantee further hops will continue encrypting this traffic. This could be avoided by encrypting the email content itself and using PGP or similar. However we believe this would sacrifice too much from a  usabillity perspective. SMS communication and it's security does indeed vary a lot from provider to provider. It is by no means a very secure form of communication.
Bearing all of the above in mind, this is why we have a maximum send limit when using MoneyBadger. It's quite unlikely such Emails/SMS will be compromised, however in any case we do recommend only to use our service with small sums of Bitcoin.

Hi time_dj, simply because we were prioritizing the launch itself. We will be adding such a policy shortly, along with measures that address such concerns. Thanks for raising this topic.
@_date: 2016-12-16 06:40:46
I totally agree, but that isn't to say that some central/trusted third parties don't have something to offer. I believe MoneyBadger to fall within this category.
@_date: 2016-12-16 06:41:47
Thank you =)
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:31:53
Yep, your last point is spot on. But not only can it be useful from a privacy perspective, it also allows you to gift Bitcoin or introduce newcomers to Bitcoin in an easier way. Please see some of our other comments in this thread for a more detailed response.

Hi Coinosphere, I believe Coinapult requires users to create accounts in order to use their services. MoneyBadger can be used without accounts/logins.
@_date: 2016-12-16 01:05:48
This was my fault; I needed to make a quick config change and this is why your session hung.  
If you ever want to try again you will see it does indeed update within seconds. Thanks for using MB.

Hi cypherblock, some comments as follows-
*  Private keys are generated on the server
*  What stops me; moral reasons and the desire to offer a valued service to the community. The former obviously doesn't stand for much, but you did ask :-) I'm not in this for a quick-buck or to make a profit.
*  Simple answer - our service needs to be running in order to process withdrawals. I have some ideas how this could be done differently though, watch this space.
*  Related to the above point, there could be multiple ways of handling withdrawals. The current approach is the easiest of these, however there is the added risk of trusting and relying on a centralised service. I will consider adding different withdrawal options, depending on the user's knowledge/ability with Bitcoin
* Yes, although I haven't thought much about how to handle this kind of information. My plan is to delete some of this logged information after some X period of time.
Additional note - The level of risk really depends on how long the recipient waits to withdraw their Bitcoin. Best case scenario, funds can be withdrawn within minutes of the deposit being made.

Hi ToEsExLoMi  
1) There is a flat $0.30 fee; this covers the cost of sending a BTC transaction  
2) Monetizing isn't a priority for me. I'd rather it become a valued service.
@_date: 2016-12-16 06:54:45
Hi opebit, thanks for the feedback. I agree, such information should and will be added to our FAQ.  
The process is as follows - once the deposit/order has been confirmed, an Email/SMS will be sent to the Recipient. This message includes a unique withdrawal code, the value in Bitcoin available for withdrawal, a reference message if one is entered by the sender, and lastly a link to our website where the withdrawal can be made.  
This is another feature in the pipeline; option to deduct fee from either sender or receiver. Thanks again for your comments.
@_date: 2016-12-16 05:53:21
Yes, you sure can. The recipient will receive a unique withdrawal code, which they will then need to use on our site in order to withdraw their Bitcoin. When withdrawing, you do need to provide a Bitcoin address. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 01:43:51
I have heard of blind signatures but haven't researched these as of yet, will check it out. Thanks 
@_date: 2016-12-16 06:57:14
Thanks - if you have any suggestions/doubts, feel free to get in touch directly.

Hi BTCAlex  


Never did we anywhere even come close to saying anything of this sort. Please don't spread disinformation.  
Security hasn't been overlooked. As for privacy, we have since implemented the procedure I mentioned earlier in this thread. No user information will be retained in our system.
@_date: 2016-12-16 06:01:47
Hi pdubl, the user will receive the following information - a unique withdrawal code, withdrawal value in Bitcoin, and a reference message if there was one entered by the sender. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:13:55
Hi blockonomics, thanks for your comments.  
Regarding the Bitcoin newbie scenario, you could do it directly of course but there are some drawbacks by doing so:    
- you need to initiate communication and offer guidance before you can even send any Bitcoin
- the new user may not feel motivated enough to spend time downloading a wallet etc.
- you sacrifice some of your privacy by directly sending Bitcoin 
MoneyBadger addresses all of the above; use MoneyBadger and the Bitcoin newbie will be notified of the fact they have received Bitcoin, even anonymously. The user is now incentivized to download a wallet, and they can then at their discretion decide when and how to withdraw this Bitcoin. All of this can be done without any knowledge of or communication with the original sender.  
Another scenario could involve some friends or co-workers. Maybe they're familiar with Bitcoin but have never had a reason to create a wallet and experiment with it. By MoneyBadger'ing over some Bitcoin to these people, you can be sure they will be willing to invest time in to learning more about Bitcoin. You could even add a reference message, such as a wallet suggestion, that will be included in the Emai/SMS message.
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:43:57
Exactly - it is quite simple for anyone familiar with Bitcoin already. I will be making some changes soon, to make it a bit more descriptive for users with zero experience with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-16 00:53:01
Hi Bitcoin_Acolyte, apologies, can you confirm it is resolved?
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:06:40
