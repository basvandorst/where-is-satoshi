This is what I got today from someone that I generally consider intelligent:










It was a pretty miserable argument because I told her to go look at what "value" means in the dictionary, and that discounting things for being imaginary means she placed no value on any artistic contribution that someone imagined, and that saying Bitcoin doesn't exist is the same as saying that no file on a computer exists, and so on. In the end we pretty much ended up with less respect for each other than when we started, and nothing gained. It was like arguing about the cultural value of religion in @_date: 2014-03-24 18:21:07
[The Bank of England published this report]( where it says Bitcoin "may have more conceptual similarities to commodities, such as gold, than money."
So that's the approach at least one bank is taking to it.

Argentina's currency has suffered massive devaluation in the last several years, so people started keeping their savings in USD. To prevent that, the government made it very, very hard for people to buy USD, and jacked up the price (there's an official exchange rate, but you can't buy at that rate). This created a parallel market where people bought USD up to twice its official value, as the government refused to devaluate. At the beginning of this year the official rate jumped considerable, and was then contained by the government through burning reserves to keep the price down; retail prices also went up considerably for everything. Anyone who has savings in the local currency has been trying to put it in a stable foreign currency before the next spike makes it worthless.
