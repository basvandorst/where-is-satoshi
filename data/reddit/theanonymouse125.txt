I found a local bitcoin ATM when I bought bitcoins, cash in machine, straight to my wallet (or the machine can make you a wallet)
Not sure where you live, but that's what google is for

Actually the past few days I have hit a stall in increases, my reinvestment in hashrate is only holding my daily returns constant, which seems to be aligned with the blockchain difficulty increase today.
IDK tho.  Still seems too good to be true.

QR codes can be scanned by any camera, any Bitcoin wallet app will be able to scan QR codes.
When I used a Bitcoin ATM, they charged about a 10% currency exchange rate, FYI.  Fiat refers to traditional forms of currency (USD, Euros, etc.) Bitcoin is not like these and is considered a Cryptocurrency (see Bitcoin FAQ videos for clarification they explain it very succinctly).
Hope that clears things up a bit ��

Yeah I saw that too. If AMHash hasn't collapsed I might believe that thread. In hindsight it more seems like one person trying to pimp his own specific Ponzi :P not saying that means hashocean is legit; but that thread isn't on the level either.

Haha see it how you like it, I see it as "A is a Ponzi, B isn't! So invest in B!!" *B collapses, thread somehow maintains legitimacy*
It was just slandering everyone else to up his own referalls/site traffic :)
That being said half of all my defense here is just me hoping I'll get my money back lol.

Why not?  Because of the potential for scam?

You are 100% correct in the calculator being less than legit.  But on my own calculations I am getting an actual reinvestment gain of 1% daily and will get ROI in a matter of days if I can only reinvest all profits daily for a few months
