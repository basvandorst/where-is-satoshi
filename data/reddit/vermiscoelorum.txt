This assumes that one finds adequate hashes by exhaustive search, but I didn't have that in mind, and you acknowledge that, at least up to now, the most powerful clique decides what history is, why should they not happen to be malevolent? To conclude from power honesty betrays a leap of faith defeating BTC's purpose.


Short sighted, there are more interesting developments to speaking a longest block-branch than filthy lucre.


Not if one were clever enough to grow it farther than the official longest Blockchain branches. Not by brute force, that belongs to the would be oligarchs now in charge of the network.

Oh you sure do when you say


Your honest nodes may as well be reduced to a singleton. Imagine, putting aside the \*actual existence\* of low cost SHA-256 "shortcuts", a Godnode or Skynet e.g., a QC spitting block hashes i.e., baptizing blocks on a whim.


You \*believe\* that no such entity exists. It is only a matter of months before your lacking a priorism is corrected with a posteriori shock and awe.


Not at all worthless. Every node participating will accept FastSHA-hashed blocks even if the first one of them were an immediate successor of the Genesis block.
Nothing at all is rewritten, on the contrary a new longest branch is acknowledged by every (a majority if you will) client.


What if one were to not only master SHA-256 but also ECDSA, even if only through brute force? Could not such a one forge transactions from every Bitcoin user? Could he not act Robinhoodesque and give to himself? Not for lucre's sake but just to punish them?
EDIT: But who needs brute force if you can FastSHA a longest branch without any of your transactions in it?

TL;DR: Blockchain Apocalypse soon; all your Bitcoin are belong to me.
