bitmex is created by brokerage people what can you expect?
only bots making people lose money, no organic trade, all money is earned by the house and this begins to control the entire market, as is that the derivative controls the base product, fake satoshis or futures contracts control the real ones , I think I'm getting everything wrong, bitmex sure? \_ Who leaves their coins in exchanges?
only xbt worthless
if you are a professional trade you know that an emerging market without much liquidity and even more not being a physical metal, such high leverage stifles the market
you want bitmex to kill all the investment in the market
you think that leverage without liquidity is good and healthy for a market
I think you are blinded by the short money
why don't you make short in other markets and let btc grow for everyone not only for bitmex to control the entire market like it does today?\_
