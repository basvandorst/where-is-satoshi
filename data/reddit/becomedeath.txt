Get this guy a free 21 computer. He's clearly legit.

Right... okay man. You know me and my experiences and are clearly capable to make a judgment call like that. Giving up on BTC now cause thinks it's not for me.  Also, great response. Well thought out and articulated.

What was my misunderstanding exactly?

Additionally, do we want BTC to become adopted by the masses? Because just yesterday I sent FIAT from me to a friend via my CHASE app for free, instantly. How do I go to that friend and pitch BTC to him? What advantages does it provide the average  consumer at this point? You're delusional if you think the current path is sustainable.

Not sure on the timeline, but I would expect it to be good within the next 24hrs. But I could be wrong. All you can do is wait at this point.

Okay man. Sure.

That's it, blame me the consumer. Not the tech or the small block size. And no, no promise was made to me specifically, but if you look at a large amount of the PR and marketing that has been done for BTC since it's inception, a fast ledger, was kinda a selling point. But I digress, please tell me how I'm in the wrong here.

It's not Electrum. The BTC network is backlogged.

Are you joking right now? Are you for real? Are you a real person that lives in this world? It's BTC... not freedom. Calm down. And if you want it to be freedom, wouldn't you want it to work on a basic level? I mean I would, but I live in reality.

I don't even know how to reply here... It's such a ridiculous reference yet accurate.
