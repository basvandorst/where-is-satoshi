Why do you think that is different than cash?  People already work off book and avoid payroll.
Most governments, such as the US, already have laws in place to tax citizens paid in foreign currency.  Even if a US citizen lives and works outside of the US and holds only currency other than USD, they are still required to pay US federal taxes.  Bitcoin doesn't change that.

You should really re-read the paper, or at the very least, the FAQ on the sidebar.  The system is intentionally beyond control.  Funds in addresses for which the key has been lost or is not known are unrecoverable.  There are no central organizations or individuals that can manipulate balances.  The bitcoin foundation does not control bitcoin, it only advocates for its adoption.
You'll notice that we tend to laugh at people who suggest regulation or that governments will control bitcoin.  That's because its just not possible.  The mathematics involved are specifically designed so that using the system the way it is intended, as a user with a key, requires little energy, while the energy required to attempt to use it without a key exceeds what is available not just on our planet, but in the Sun and the entire solar system.  It will be a very long time before humans can manipulate stars on the scale required to crack bitcoin.
This is why we laugh when politicians threaten it.  They may be able to regulate at the edges, where fiat or goods are exchanged for bitcoin, but they cannot manipulate bitcoin itself.

The programmable money aspect is my favorite part about bitcoin as it promises greater autonomy and automation for systems.

The language used is intentionally misleading you to think that this "fast lane" is something new that adds bandwidth.  It's not.
Let's be absolutely clear on what this really is.  It is a subdivision of existing bandwidth, giving priority to those who pay extra.  All other traffic will be forced to take a backseat and share whatever scraps of bandwidth are leftover.
To re-frame the analogy properly, the fast lane is not a new lane.  It is as if you got on the highway one day to find the same number of lanes, but that only one lane was open to the public, and every commuter is trying to squeeze into this one lane.  The other lanes, which *your* taxes have already paid for(created by DARPA, expanded by the NSF, and [$200 billion paid directly to carriers for expansion projects they never delivered]( are now only open to the highest bidder.

This thread is what mathematicians call "a fucking disaster."
Mathematically, there can be no shorthand solution, thanks to the pigeonhole principal.
Let's start with the example of mapping an 8 bit address space to 7 bits.
    11111111
    1111111
The 7 bit space will contain, on average, 2 collisions for every address because you're trying to cram 256 addresses into 128 spaces.  Every bit that you reduce this address space by will double the number of collisions.
For anyone saying firstbits is a successful way to do this, no.  Firstbits is actually the perfect example of the collisions that occur when you attempt to reduce address space and why shorthand cannot work.
There are already more than 15,000 firstbits collisions in the blockchain.  And that's just with the current in-use addresses.
Example:  [1159on]
It does not mater if you expand the number of firstbits.  Scanning the blockchain, I find:
15432 collisions in the first 6 chars
1478 collisions on the first 7 chars
380 in the first 8 chars
There's even a collision for the first 28 chars, which appears intentional.  It seems that someone went out of their way to demonstrate this.
And it is the perfect example of why you cannot reduce address space.  It differs by only the last character + the checksum.  Therefore, you cannot reduce the address space by even one character without inducing a collision.  It's even less than that, though:
Now my base58 sucks, so feel free to correct me, but
    3 = 0x000011
    w = 0x110110
This is a real world example of a collision of 2 addresses that differ by only 5 bits.  You can't even reduce the address space by a whole byte without these addresses colliding.  Whoever did this, thank you.
**Any scheme which attempts to reduce the number of bits of information corresponding to an address will eventually produce a collision!**  Therefore, any human readable alias for an address must be at least as long or *longer* than a bitcoin address.
Or for the bird lovers out there:  100 pigeons cannot fit into 10 holes without smooshing several into the same hole.  Smooshed pigeons cant fly.  They cant do much of anything once they've been smooshed.  I know you just wanted to care for the pigeons and make sure they lived in a pretty little dollhouse, but there were too many, and now they've stopped moving and your parents have to take them out back and bury them.
TL;DR: You can't shorten addresses without killing innocent birds, but you can make them longer.

The way I look at it is that we can't provide them with any more information than if they had learned about bitcoin on their own.  We don't have any secret information.  We don't know someone's passwords or private keys.  
I'm not the trusting sort.  A sad story about a dead spouse and missing money sets off alarms for me.  But if they did some independent reading about bitcoin, they'd still know what to look for.
In this case, they would eventually learn that they're looking for wallet.dat files on the computer and paper wallets around the home.  Eventually, an understanding of mining would reveal that they should check the config files on the mining hardware for the pool it connects to and the passwords to do so.  Maybe check the smartphone as well.

Blockchain 2fa and wallet backups are sent via plaintext email.
It's not unheard of for employees at ISPs to sniff traffic and grep the mail spools for plaintext passwords.  Sniffing leaves absolutely no evidence.  Every hop or link between your email's source and destination is a potential vulnerability.  It doesn't even have to be your ISP or blockchain's, your traffic transits many third party networks outside of either party's control.

DOD doesn't advertise routes for their address space.  Many companies take that as a license to use that space as if it were RFC1918 space.  It's not, and it is very bad form to pretend that it is.  If the DOD were to suddenly start advertising those routes, Sprint would be left scrambling to re-address all of their customers to a suitable range.
What you're seeing is simply the result of Sprint using the DOD address space internally, and translating with NAT externally.  At no point is the DOD network actually involved.

1.  The price is irrelevant.  $10 worth of bitcoin buys you $10 worth of goods.  $10 worth of litecoin buys you $10 worth of goods.  You don't have to spend "a whole bitcoin."
2.  Because you can spend bitcoin in far more places than litecoin.  Many online merchants accept bitcoin, including major merchants like Overstock and  Tiger Direct.  There are also many brick and mortar retailers accepting it as well.  Only a handful of merchants accept litecoin online and I've never seen it accepted at a physical location.

Let's use the firstbits example, which is both a problem with address space and 3rd party trust.  Your friend needs money and gives you his firstbits address [15adMq].  You send the coin.
Did it go to [15adMq]( or did it go to [15adMq]( ?  They both have the same firstbits address.  Wait, which one is even his?
Let's say you're aware of this and you send a small amount to test.  You get lucky and it happens to go to the one that belonged to your friend.  Great.  Now you send the rest.  What's to stop firstbits, a third party, from changing the address that [15adMq] points to?  Who's going to reimburse you when the second transaction goes to the wrong address?
The tipbot is another example of 3rd party trust.  You don't control the keys.  The operators could run with everyone's coin at any time.  Or less maliciously, accidentally destroy all the keys and backups.  That's why it is so strongly recommended that you don't keep more than pocket change on your tipbot wallet.
Users almost always gravitate toward ease of use, even at the cost of security.  Every time a service is created that allows for a reduction in security, it puts users at risk.  Just look at brainwallets and how many people have had coins stolen from them.
If I were less scrupulous, I would create these types of services and then exploit their weakness.  Eventually, someone will.

Why would a government be unable to tax it?  Let's assume US gov and income tax.  Is the US government unable to tax employees paid in USD?  Are they unable to tax US citizens paid in foreign currencies?
Employers operating in the US must report wages.  Employees are then liable for the taxes on those wages.  US citizens working in foreign countries paid in foreign currencies must still report those wages.
I'm not sure why people think the established laws don't apply to bitcoin.  There are already many currencies in the world.  Governments and laws already take that into consideration.  No new laws are necessary to handle bitcoin.

The goal is to have a number of individuals within the community which intentionally draw ire.  The bulk of the community will expend it's hostility on those individuals leaving less hostility to be aimed at worthwhile posts.  Simultaneously, the act of attacking those individuals builds a sense of camaraderie among everyone else and ultimately results in a strengthening of the community.

Trustless computing doesn't mean that it can't be trusted, it means that a system has been designed to not *require* trust in any part of it, as the entire system is exposed and can be reviewed and verified by everyone, all the time.
Contrast this with trusted models, such as banks, closed source software, or secretive governments, where you are not allowed to see the inner workings.  In those cases, you not only have to trust that everyone involved is acting in good faith, but you also have to trust that they are competent.  Bitcoin requires neither.
Bitcoin's value is that it requires no trust.  It's open source, so you don't need to trust that it will do what it's supposed to, you can verify that for yourself.  Similarly, you don't need to trust that a transaction has been recorded, you can verify it by examining the blockchain.  An understanding of Merkle trees means you don't have to trust that those transactions will not be reversed or altered.  And so on.  Once you understand it, trust becomes irrelevant.
While that applies to the protocol, it unfortunately does not apply to many of the services that make use of it.

Bitcoin's security lies in it's enormous keyspace and zero trust model.  Adding a layer on top of that which reduces address space or requires trust will reduce that security.
Reduction in address space will eventually result in a collision.  Shortening addresses is not a valid option.
Distributed DNS, like namecoin, also creates a first-come-first-serve problem.  In that case, it lead to automated bulk registration of any desirable domain and variations on them.  Being distributed, there's no dispute mechanism.  Once someone registers your name and any reasonable variation thereof, you're helpless to do anything about it.  Add the social engineering aspect, and even if you manage to acquire a desirable name first, someone will register all the slight variations on it which are hard for humans to detect.  It's far easier to see the difference between 1ChJMjNNu2cYef9ZsBZesyqqJPmCUSm6aW  and 14PFLDZPnMFr2KMqcgifGBQn4f5DmLy2rE than it is to see the difference between nanoakron and nanaokron  The second is far more dangerous and exploits human weaknesses.
Bitcoin's addresses are long and random for a reason.  Being that a digital device and network connection are required to use bitcoin, human memory and communication are non-factors.

Revising the last 6 months of the blochchain would require more hashing power than is present in the entire network.  Less power and you'd fall behind.  Equal power and you'd always be 6 months behind.  26,000 times as much power would be required to catch up in 10 minutes.
If you could afford more hashing power than the bitcoin network(which already has more hashing power than anything else on the planet) you'd probably be smart enough to realize that executing such an attack would destroy confidence in bitcoin, driving the price to zero, and you'd have spent *billions* to corner the market on something that is now worth nothing.

If she attempted to do arbitrage via gox, she's gonna have a bad time.  Gox will delay her withdrawal for months with a variety of bullshit excuses.  After some time, they will tell her they can only process the withdrawal for an additional fee.  Guess what those fees will amount to?

Translating private addresses to public address is fairly standard, but using addresses publicly assigned to someone else as your own private space is bad.  Unfortunately it's very common.

51% attack is not valid in this case.  Removing BTC from a single address to which it was transferred 5 years ago would require rolling back the entire merkle tree, undoing *every* transaction going back 5 years.  That's the entire point of using a merkle tree.  Every transaction since then would be undone.  Every miner's block reward since that point would be gone forever.  I doubt anyone would go for that.  Once something's on the blockchain, it's essentially permanent.

The blockchain is just a merkle tree.  Every hash is a hash of all previous hashes.  You can't alter a single hash from any previous block without changing all hashes that come after it.  Every transaction would have to be re-mined.  The rewards from mining those blocks would end up in the hands of whoever mined them this time, not the same miner that mined them the first time.  After the first round, the inputs would be in different addresses with different owners and different keys and all transactions based on those inputs that are supposed to come later would therefore be invalid.  That's the whole point of the blockchain, the past is immutable and you can only add to the future.
No, developers cannot just add something to the code that would do that, even if they wanted to.  Transactions are based on public key cryptography.  No one, no matter what changes to the code they may make, can sign a transaction without the key.  They're still bound by math and physics.  That's the genius of the system.  From the moment it was released into the wild, it was beyond even it's own creator's control.
Updates and changes to the code cannot undo the past, they can only add functionality going forward.

That's not simply moving money, that's converting assets.  I'm not sure what you're trying to get at.  Any taxable action must be reported by the institution performing that action.  There's nothing magical about bitcoin that means existing laws don't apply.  You can try to use bitcoin to avoid these things, but any business or individual that wants to operate legally must remain in compliance with the law.  Anyone who chooses not to operate legal may end up facing consequences if caught.  Bitcoin doesn't make it impossible to get caught either.  If you take a disbursement on your 401k, there will still be record of it and any legally operating entity will report your tax liability, regardless of the currency in which that transaction takes place.

I think you overestimate the reach of regulation and legislation in a truly global economy.  Countries that have attempted to regulate bitcoin related businesses and services have succeeded only in pushing those business into friendlier jurisdictions.  The announcement of prohibition of bitcoin related businesses by superpowers such as China and Russia have caused brief panic selling, but ultimately did little to prevent bitcoin adoption even within those countries.
Criminalizing possession would be especially entertaining.  A private key is just a number.  You would have to make it illegal to know of any number between 0 and 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,935.  That would mean that clocks, banking, anything that uses maths all goes away.  The US has a long and laughable history of trying to fight cryptography and make certain numbers illegal.  My favorite, and luckily short lived, episode was when they tried to declare professors of mathematics to be arms dealers.  These types of legislation tend to backfire on the politicians who support them.  More can be found with a search for "illegal numbers."

Distancing ourselves from anyone accused of a crime seems more like a great way to damage the community.  It's trivial for a gov to level accusations against anyone for anything.  That sounds like something that would play perfectly into their hands.  I've always preferred innocent until proven guilty.
As for Charlie specifically, from what little information I can find about the case, it seems like they're really reaching.  To put it into perspective, it would be like accusing the CEO of a bank of money laundering because one of their customers made a withdrawal, then gave that money to a friend, who gave that money to another friend, who gave that money to yet another friend, who then bought drugs with it.  Then the guy he bought the drugs from bought something with that money, and the guy who sold it to him then deposited that money into his account at the same bank.  That's not laundering, that's an economy.  No one blames the banker for what customers do with their own dollars.

Use a hole punch to add the proper hole to your forgery, attach the real apostille to your forged doc, tie with the ribbon and replace the sticker.
You now have a forged document with a forged notarization but a *genuine apostille seal*.  Nobody looks past the apostille, but even if they did, it's not like they know every notary.  Hell, you can skip the whole 3D printed part and go old-school, making impressions with a blunted toothpick.  They're not going to know the difference.
It's not just bitcoin exchanges where the notary/apostille system is the weak link.  Ever wonder how someone gets an SSL cert  issued for a company they don't work for and domains they don't control?  There's even fun to be had with banks and courts.  It's not that the system is outdated, it was always seen as a joke by any dedicated criminal.

No.  This article, and the many articles like it, make claims based on overly simple assumptions and without any direct evidence.  It does not take into account the fact that one person can store BTC in many addresses and that many persons can store BTC in a single address.
Many of the large addresses belong to exchanges, shared wallets, and gambling sites.  That's BTC belonging to many people stored in a few address.
Many individuals also use multiple addresses, change addresses, and HD wallets.  Without associating them all, such users would appear to be many people with smaller amounts of BTC.

Five years ago, Satoshi made the controversial decision to use secp256k1 instead of the standard secp256r1.  k1 was thought to be less secure as the NSA and NIST promoted r1 over k1.  r1 became the standard and bitcoin has been the only major implementation of k1.
A few months ago, r1 was shown to be potentially backdoored by the NSA.  k1 shows no signs of such a backdoor.
Many of Satoshis' decisions defied conventional wisdom and best practices, but have since been show to avoid the pitfalls of the standards in an almost prescient way..

For those that may actually be concerned:
At some possible point in the future, *if* quantum computers become viable(which we are currently nowhere close to) re-using private keys *may* become insecure.  Mitigating the problem is as simple as not reusing addresses.  When you spend from an address, you create a single transaction, for the entire balance of the address, with multiple outputs.  Some to the intended destination of the payment, and the remainder to the next address your balance will be held in.  All of this was anticipated, automated, and implemented nearly 3 years ago as [BIP32](

Recently, there has been a sudden rash of feminist anti-bitcoin articles.  Most complain about the demographics: that bitcoin users are mostly males.  They typically imply that the community is hostile toward and has prevented women from joining.  I'm still trying to figure out how.
I don't know the gender, race, or really anything about most of the users here, except that we share a single common interest, bitcoin.  I also cant ever recall being asked my gender before downloading any bitcoin related software.  I'm not asked my skin color when joining a mining pool.  I've never been denied access to the blockchain based on my gender.  Bitcoin doesn't give a shit how your were born.  
On the other hand, I can recall that far more women than men have been dismissive when I've talked about bitcoin.  It's only recently, with the large price gains, that the women I interact with have stopped mocking me and become inquisitive.  I try to remain courteous, but it pains me to remember how different their behavior was only a few months ago.  Now it's becoming intolerable as feminists push their revisionist history and falsely claim that women were excluded due to sexism.  Reminding them of their own derisiveness toward bitcoin only a few hundred dollars ago brings out only anger in them, but no self reflection.  They simply refuse to acknowledge that the only thing that kept them out of bitcoin was their own shortsightedness.  They would instead blame an entire gender instead of taking responsibility for their own lack of action.  Let's not forget that blaming an entire gender or race for your own problems is incredibly bigoted.  And no, feminists, you don't get to try to change the meaning of words to allow yourself to be bigoted, racist, or sexist while pretending that you're not.
All of this reminds that we've seen this exact pattern before.  Years ago, the bulk of women derided anyone of any gender for playing video games.  It was un-cool in their eyes and they wanted nothing to do with it.  As the popularity grew, they suddenly wanted in.  Unfortunately they had, through their own action, made enemies of the gaming community.  No one should be surprised when the people you've spent years mocking would rather not associate with you.
It also reminds me of the tech sector and stem fields in general.  Only a decade ago, the terms geek and nerd carried purely negative connotations.  While both men and women were quick to put nerds down, it was more often women who initiated the social exclusion of both male and female nerds.  Only a brave few women defied the sisterhood and pursued their interests at the cost of being an outcast.  Seeing how poorly those that did so were treated, few would opt to follow the same path.  Once again, women had excluded themselves.  It wasn't until the tech sector become popular, and highly profitable, that more than a handful of women would want in.  And again, we find that those who chose to mock instead of learn fail to take responsibility for their own choices and would rather displace blame.
Don't worry though, somehow, someone will manage blame "patriarchy" for women sabotaging fellow women even without any men involved.

It is already known that there are potential key collisions in bitcoin.  Multiple private keys can correspond to the same public address.  This isn't my logic and it isn't flawed.  This is math.

Mental gymnastics to misrepresent what I've plainly state aren't going make you correct.
It is a branch of math, which means it is math.  Just like all squares are quadrilaterals.
If you're really hung up on the specific part of math they need to ban to prevent encryption, that would be division.  Specifically, the modulus, which is the remainder from any division operation, and gives us the one-way function.  I'm sure you can see the problem with that.

In this kind of escrow, a cheater can't win, but it's still possible for you to lose.  It at least takes away the profit motive for cheating you.  The seller is assured that the money is reserved for him, while the buyer retains the leverage that the seller hasn't been paid yet until completion."

BX also lacks the volume to move 100k quickly and at a decent price.  20k in buys would drive the price there above all other exchanges.
OP would be best served by spreading money across a few exchanges.  This would both spread the risks and allow purchase at better prices.  Which exchanges will depend on what country OP is in.

Yes, it is.
In the US, this is called a bait and switch.  They advertise one service at one reasonable price, but once they have your money, they then tell you they're having problems and it can only be done for a additional, exorbitant fee.  They are hiding behind the fact that the legal fees associated with an international lawsuit most likely exceed that of the money customers are looking to recover.  
Get your money out of Gox any way you can.  **Never do business with them again.**
The best thing you can do is to contact them daily.  Ask to speak to a manager and refuse to back down until you are in touch with one.  Demand your money at no additional fee or your bitcoins back with all fees reversed since they have not provided you will the service you've paid for.  If they refuse, ask for the next level manager.  Repeat.  Just keep at it.  It may take weeks, but be relentless and don't settle for anything else.

The idea is that when you solve a block, you delay in broadcasting it to give yourself an advantage on the next block.  Therefore you make more money.
The short story is that anyone who successfully did it would drive the price down, eliminating the incentive to do so.
The longer story is that it's unlikely to be successful.  The first time someone else solves and broadcasts the same block you've been delaying means you've just lost money and wasted your time and power.  We tend to see the same block solved by two different miners within seconds of each other every week, meaning it's not a realistic attack vector.

I'd be out of my depth on anything specific to Mycelium.  Does anyone know if it uses SSL or sends in the clear?
Here's what I would do:
* Install a packet sniffer on his phone, or connect his phone to a wireless network and sniff the connection from a separate device.
* If Mycelium sends data in the clear, conduct a similar transaction(with a small amount that you expect to lose.)
* If Mycelium sends data via SSL, you'll need to set up proxy with a fake SSL cert.   Configure the phone to use that proxy and import your fake cert into his phone.
* Look to see if the second transaction is generated by the phone or not.  This should get you started on determining where the problem exists.

Are people going to start using brainwallets again?  If so, it might be worth running my bot again.  I'll watch these threads closely so I can adapt to countermeasures.  
Bitcoin is only secure because of its enormous keyspace.  *Anything that reduces that keyspace reduces the your security* and makes it easier for someone to take your coin.
A brainwallet with as much entropy as bitcoin requires a minimum of 12 random and completely unrelated words.  The problem is that no one does that.  They use a few words or phrases.  Few people can memorize long meaningless strings.
If you can memorize 12 unrelated random words and be sure that you wont forget or confuse them, go ahead.  Anything less than that and you're risking your coins.

I doubt you know who Satoshi is, but even if you did, I'd strongly advise against revealing their identity.  If they wanted to be known, they would reveal themselves.  Instead, *they have chosen to remain anonymous*, and with good reason.  It's not your place to decide otherwise, and potentially disrupt their lives.
Bitcoin's opponents have failed to attack it on technical merits.  They've tried to attack it based on who uses it, and they would surely turn to attacking its creators.
Better to remain anonymous until such time as bitcoin is so widely adopted that it wouldn't matter who created it or how dark the secrets of its creators are.

I was also thinking that payment processors may also start mining instead of retailers, but what you've said sounds most likely.
I could see the pools creating a high priority queue for such an agreement.  Something like:
* Retailer sends each newly generated receiving address to the pool.
* The pool then accepts any transaction to that receiving address, even if it does not include a fee, and guarantees it will be included in the next block, if they solve it.
* The pool keeps a record of these high priority tx's that they have successfully mined, and periodically bills the retailer.  (or flat rate instead)
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.  On the one hand, it provides a way to reverse who pays the fee by taking it out of band.  On the other hand, I'd worry that if many pools adopted this, the high priority queues could disadvantage anyone without access to them.

Why does your friend think that the address you've linked belongs to him?  Where are you getting that address from?
I ask because you do not own an address within gox.  You do not have coins within gox.  Once you transfer to a deposit address, those are not your coins any longer, you only have credit.  What happens to those coins after you deposit is none of your business, as they no longer belong to you.  They cannot be stolen from your friend as they are no longer his.
It's much like a bank.  You give them cash, they put them it in the vault with everyone else's cash.  Those bills no longer belong to you.  You have only credit.  When they give those bills out to someone else, they are not stealing from you.  
If your friend is missing 6 btc from his account, it has nothing to do with the address or transactions that you linked.  That transaction is an incoming deposit that ends up in gox's "vault".  A withdrawal from gox would originate from one or more addresses with thousands of btc in them.  Your friend doesn't own those addresses either.


You very clearly just accused gox of having a security problem.

If the hard drives and backups of thousands of miners and full-chain wallet users all crashed at exactly the same time, yes.
Or if all miners and user all threw away the current code and began running flawed code that corrupted their copy of the blockchain all at the same time, yes.

The probability of a collision is very, *very* low, but it is possible.  In this case, someone could have a bot watching millions of brainwallets generated from a dictionary.  By pure coincidence, Mycelium could have generated an address that happened to correspond to a brainwallet already being monitored by that bot.  The reason I'm hung up on relating this to brainwallets is that the destination address did successfully sweep correct horse battery staple, which is the hallmark of such bots.  An accidental collision is *extremely* unlikely though.
Of course your friend also could have download a modified version of Mycelium from an untrusted source, or have other malware on his phone that grabbed the key.
Edit:  
Looking at the [transaction]( this may not be a bot.  It was relayed by blockchain.info itself.  I'm not familiar with Mycelium, but I imagine it relies on a 3rd party for access to the chain.  Is that 3rd party blockchain?

There are two ways out:
1. Take MtGox's 5% offer.  They'll process the withdrawal, but take an additional 5% of your money.  It demonstrates they're capable of processing withdrawals, the services you already paid for.  They just hold your money hostage until you pay even more.
2. Cancel the withdrawal and transfer your BTC to another exchange where you can withdraw it.  The problem here is that you've already paid .6% to MtGox for converting BTC to USD for withdrawal, and now your paying another .6% to convert USD back to BTC to move it.  You just paid MtGox not once, but twice, for a service they didn't even provide.
Either way, it looks like a scam to users.  Because it is a scam.  The largest and most well known bitcoin exchange operating in such a fashion makes all of bitcoin look bad.
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:35:37
It's a poorly written article.  Many of the large addresses belong to exchanges and shared wallets.  That's coin being held for many people.  Some of the other large addresses are old, haven't been accessed in years, and are considered to be lost.
On the other hand, an address is not a wallet.  A user may have their coins spread across many address.  You wouldn't be able to tell if an individual owned 60 percent of the coins if they kept them spread around.  There's really no good way to tell how much an individual owns.
I'm also not sure why anyone thinks that it's possible for wealth to be distributed equally, or why it would be desirable to do so.  There will always be someone who does something better than someone else.  I'm sure you'd hate to receive the same compensation for producing 1000 perfect widgets a day as the fuck-up who produces 50 flawed ones does.  This also removes the incentive to work harder.  In the above, the fuck-up is only producing 50 because they know they receives the same compensation regardless of their effort, so why bother doing more than the minimum.

It's limited in the protocol to approximately 21M.  A change to that number would require a majority agreement of miners, which is unlikely as it would devalue all coins and make mining less profitable.
If you're worried about the number of coins in circulation becoming too small to be usable, don't.  We're currently divisible to 8 decimal places, and that can be extended, making bitcoin infinitely divisible.  Such a change would also require a majority agreement, but would be more likely as it has no effect on value.

They're not insisting that the rise in price will cause a fall in price, they're pointing out that the depth tables on all major exchanges have no support for the current high prices at the current volume.
The current high prices are the result of small volume (.1 to 10 btc) buy orders at high prices.  This is most likely the result of panic buying by inexperienced investors without large amounts of capital who are chasing overpriced coin.  When the current influx of noobs wears down, the prices will nosedive until they reach the large volume orders (100+) of experienced investors with real capital that are waiting at much lower prices.  You may have heard of these large orders referred to as buy or sell "walls."
As those prices fall, the experienced investors will take advantage of the panic sell by lowering the prices on their large orders, driving the price down even further.  This switches from the current sellers market to a buyers market.  Eventually the trend will reverse again, and again, and again....
The large players on the exchanges ultimately determine where the price will land for long periods, not the people fooling around with a few hundred dollars.  Those large players are not the ones buying at the current high prices.  When the kids run out of lunch money to buy coin with, the adults will go back to butting heads and inching their buy and sell prices closer together.
Then the next wave of press with draw in a new batch of kids who run around making lots of noise and the cycle repeats.
Ultimately, the value of BTC will always rise in the long term, but there will be many ups and downs along the way.

The biggest problem with claiming that altcoins have their own market cap is that very few of them can be exchanged directly for fiat.  Almost all of them can only be purchased by first purchasing BTC and then exchanging it for an alt.
Litecoin is the exception, bet even then, that's rare, and most people acquire it by way of BTC.
This is very evident when following the price and "market cap" of altcoins.  Their prices all follow BTC's.  They rarely move independently.
For example, when the price of BTC recently dropped from the 1200's to the 600's, the exchange rate of BTC to LTC(or any other alt) didn't change significantly.  If litecoin et al. were independent, it should now cost twice as many BTC to purchase them.  Instead, all alt's lost half their value as well.
Altcoins seem to lack their own market caps, but behave only as submarkets of bitcoin.

Now you've cleaned out your account to prevent them from collecting?  It's bad faith transaction like this that have caused them to implement such strict risk mitigation, making it tougher on every other buyer.
When the ACH fails due to insufficient funds, you will rightfully be flagged as high risk and they will likely refuse to do business with you in the future.  Luckily, there are many other people eager to buy that BTC, so they probably won't lose money due to your actions.

* What will the price be in x,  predict the future for me,  I want internet strangers to tell me what to do with my money.
* How much money can I make mining with my cpu?  None, I don't believe you, I'll do it anyway.  I want to get rich.
* I read about [potential problem from a long time ago].  I haven't bothered learn anything else about bitcoin, but I'm going to parrot some article and ignore the counter arguments.
* I'm pretending that I'm concerned about [x], but I'm really just butthurt about not being an early adopter and failing to get rich quick.

Coinvalidation suddenly sounds great.

I do wonder if the people around here claiming that it wont be all that bad really understand what's happening.  We've finally created a decentralized currency that cant be directly control by any central authority.  Now we're faced with a new threat from those trying to indirectly control it.  When I suggested mixing to intentionally taint the coin in circulation, I was met with people afraid to taint their own coins.  The service isn't even operational yet, and it's already begun [controlling these people through fear](
We've only recently arrived at this system that allows us to escape the financial manipulation of the rich and powerful.  Let's not make the mistake of trading one master for another.

Second, localbitcoin uses a shared wallet.  The unique address is used only as an identifier for your transaction.  It does not belong to you.  The transfer is credited to your account and the funds are sent on.  If you want full control over your bitcoin, you'll want to use a non-shared wallet with addresses for which you hold the private keys.

It's a mistake.  The author meant private key.  Obviously the public key is... public.
As long as you have never signed anything with the private key, it's immune to attack by quantum computing.  Anything signed with a private key leaks a tiny bit of information that makes private key discovery easy for a quantum computer, but only reduces the keyspace a negligable amount for traditional computing.

Why are so few windows users aware of NTFS's alternate data streams?
You could hide your wallet file in an alternate stream of any file, without it affecting or being visible in the contents of that file.  Instead of hiding it *within* the same file, think of it as hiding your data *under* the first file.
Heck, you can hide your real wallet.dat as an alternate stream of a fake wallet.dat.
    copy MyRealWallet.dat wallet.dat:stream2
Even better, if someone tries to copy your wallet.dat over a network, or to a non-NTFS system, they'll only get the fake file (primary stream.)
You could even hide your wallet in a zip, inside an mp4, under an alternate data stream.
Before you bother with any of that, realize that security through obscurity is not a good solution.  You should encrypt it with something strong enough that it doesn't matter if an attacker obtains a copy.

You can either say that nobody owns the blockchain, or that we all own the blockchain together.  It's entirely peer-to-peer, so there is no central authority.  What's more is that the algorithms and code that build the blockchain are open source and free for all.

It's a great way to mess with trading bots that use the bid/ask spread in their decisions.  By having another bot flood the market with small bids at every point, you mask the real spread and hinder the ability of other bots to trade effectively.
There's also been some evolution of this.  I noticed that the first generation of spreadmasking bot always placed orders at the minimum bid size.  After a time, some trading bots seemed to begin to counter this by ignoring all bids at the minimum size.  Then a second generation of spreadmasking seemed to pop up which uses orders just over the minimum.
On other exchanges, a different type of bot keeps small orders above and below the bid and ask, respectively, and doesn't require flooding.  These bots are easily manipulated though, and you can force one into unfavorable trades by stacking your own small bids under or above it.  Most of the time, they come right back, but if you screw with them enough, and start costing the owner money, they'll go away for a few hours.
I'm not sure if the goal of these second type of bots is spreadmasking, or if it is to manipulate other bots into overpaying.  Occasionally, you can watch two bots get caught in feedback, both trying to one-up eachother, and drive the price into a wall of waiting orders.

I'd assume they're all custom and unique, and not publicly available.  If your bot is profitable, you wouldn't share it with others and lower or eliminate your own profits.  Most of the above was discovered in the process of writing my own bot, encountering problems caused by other bots, and developing countermeasures.  I'd love to see the internals of other bots as well.  It would have saved me a lot of time.
If your question was less about how bots make decisions and more about how bots interact with the exchanges, almost every exchange provides a public api.  For example:

Gox is currently only processing withdrawals if you agree to pay an additional 5%.  On top of the flat withdraw fee.  On top of the .6% you already payed to convert btc-&gt;usd.
If you attempt arbitrage via gox, you assume all of the risk and they take all of the profit.
They are not processing withdrawals without the additional fee.  My small test amount has been held hostage for 5 months now.  For the first 3 months I was regularly told it would be just another two weeks.  Later, they refused to give an ETA at all!  Now they wont even respond to me.  The cost to initiate an international lawsuit would exceed the money to be recovered.  They know this, which is why they're happily fucking over thousands of customers.  I don't expect to ever see that money again.
Keep your money far away from gox.  They're operating with all the signs of a scam.  When they run out of customers who allow themselves to be extorted, they'll simply disappear with your money and bitcoin.
I'm actually just waiting for the day they announce that "someone" stole all the bitcoins they were holding and they're bankrupt.  "All our coins hit a mixer and they're gone.  So sorry.  Nothing can be done.  Oh well, I'm off to my new beachfront mansion."

It would appear that they've cut deals with multiple exchanges to purchase coins.  The deals seem to include an upper limit to the number of coins they can acquire per day.
Their first source of coins appear to be the coins sold back to them by their users.  After that the price reflects bitstamp + a few % and eventually works it's way to Gox + a few %.
It has been indirectly confirmed that bitstamp is a source by manipulating the price on bitstamp and watching the price on coinbase follow along.  The rest is based only on passive observation and not experimentation.

Both.  First the price will rise.  Then the rise in price will cause some people to sell high, which will bring the price back down.  Since many people are holding long, fewer people will sell than hold, and after falling, the price will land above the previous price.  Then the cycle repeats and repeats unless something significant disrupts it.
This is essentially the same pattern followed by anything that is traded.

Let me give you a tip on working with Bank of America.  Don't do it over the phone.  The headset jockeys in the cubicle farm don't give a shit about you.
Go in person and establish a relationship.  Be polite.  Ask to speak to the branch manager.  Calmly explain the problem.  With an amount of that size, they will understand that you're upset without you needing to tell them.
If you are nice, your branch manager will fight FOR YOU, not with you.  He or she understands the system better than you ever will.  They know who to call and how to get the issue resolved in the quickest possible way.
I've been in a very similar position to yours multiple times, and let me tell you, having someone experienced within the company fighting on your behalf turns the entire situation around.  It becomes effortless for you.  You just sit there and listen to them make the necessary calls.  Most of the time a branch manager can resolve the problem before the close of business.  If the problem is with one of BOA's partners(many of their services are not in-house), it may take 1-2 business days to be resolved.

Way to pump and dump.
NXT goes against everything Satoshi would have wanted.  All nxt coins already exist, and we have to trust the developers to distribute them fairly.
We could argue about devs holding coin for themselves to dump when the price gets high, or about relying on their definition of fair, but none of that really gets to the point.  Satoshi believed in systems that required ZERO trust.  They knew that any coin that required trust would put power and control in the hands of a few individuals that could manipulate it.  It is unlikely that they would want anything to do such a coin.

They advertise one service at one reasonable price, but once they have your money, they then tell you they're having problems and it can only be done for a additional, exorbitant fee. They are hiding behind the fact that the legal fees associated with an international lawsuit most likely exceed that of the money customers are looking to recover.
Get your money out of Gox any way you can. **Never do business with them again**.
The best thing you can do is to contact them daily. Ask to speak to a manager and refuse to back down until you are in touch with one. Demand your money at no additional fee or your bitcoins back with all fees reversed, since they have not provided you with the service you've paid for. If they refuse, ask for the next level manager. Repeat. Just keep at it. It may take weeks, but be relentless and don't settle for anything else.
Sorry you have to go through this.

If you're thinking of using Gox for arb, you're just throwing your money away.
They hold your money hostage for months until you agree to pay an extra %5
Yes, that's extortion, but they don't care because international lawsuits are cost prohibitive for their customers.
%5 is about the difference between gox and elsewhere.
You take all the risk and gox keeps all the profit.
If you have money at gox, convert it to btc and get it out of there asap.

No one's been able to get money out of Gox for months.  Unless you agree to their extortion.
Eventually the offer to do it for an additional fee.  That fee tends to be the same as the profit you would have made from arbitrage.  It is the reason the price is higher on Gox.  People selling there are just trying to cover the additional cost of Gox's protection racket.
In the end, you take all the risk and Gox keeps all your profits.

I've broadcast transactions (without fees) that have never confirmed.  So it is possible, although not reliable, as there is always the risk that it will eventually confirm.
There are a few things that retailers can do to protect themselves.  The first is to require 1 or more confirmations.  If you don't want to make customers wait for a confirmation, requiring them to include a tx fee is rather reliable as it *significantly* increases the likelihood that a transaction will get mined.
Pure speculation:  If bitcoin gains wider adoption by large brick and mortar retailers, I suspect that many of those retailers may begin mining themselves, with zero fee, to ensure that all transaction get mined.  The cost to mine, divided across many retailers, could be minimal and still cheaper than losses to the type of fraud you describe, and still cheaper than credit card fees.  Again, pure speculation.  Someone would have to provide proper numbers and analysis on loss/fraud/ccfees/mining to evaluate such a possibility.

You think a month is a long time to wait for your money from Gox?  You're going to be waiting MUCH longer than that.
My small test amounts still haven't arrived from 3 months ago.  Estimates are around 22 weeks.  Some people suspect that number will be closer to never.

That would be a very bad idea as it completely circumvents the security of bitcoin.
CC's are insecure by nature.  Anyone with your card numbers can use your card.  A card linked to bitcoin could empty your address.
Bitcoin's security lies in the fact that you sign with the private key, never having to expose it.

Reused on the network?  Yes, there's nothing to stop anyone else from using one of them.  They aren't registered as in-use in any way.  The chance of someone else stumbling upon the same key is astronomically low though.
Reused within a vanitygen search?  Not really.  Vanitygen discards any pair that doesn't match the pattern.  If you were to try to save them, it would require an enormous amount of disk space.  It takes roughly 1GB of disk space to store 10,000,000 key/address pairs.  Similar to the above, it's astronomically unlikely that vanitygen would stumble upon the same key/address twice(unless your RNG is broken).

The order was for 4800 coins.  The volume during that the short time for which that order existed was around 200.
The wall was originally placed at 640, which was just above the lowest orders in the book.  Many of the orders above it were canceled and moved below it, driving the price down without it executing.  Repeat at 620, repeat at 600, repeat at 580.  As soon as every order below the new 580 wall was eaten, then the wall was pulled altogether.

Definitely get out of Gox via bitcoin, and DO NOT attempt to withdraw to USD with them.  
USD from coinbase is the fastest I've seen, once you're verified.  Whatever exchange you choose to use, begin the verification process now, as it can take weeks in some cases.
Personally, I wouldn't store them on an exchange.  I'd use a paper wallet.  When you need to sell, you can transfer to the exchange of your choice.  The average block time is 10 minutes, and most exchanges require 6 confirmations before allowing you to withdraw, meaning about an hour.  After that, Coinbase takes 3-7 days to deposit into your bank account.

I couldn't tell if she didn't understand bitcoin, or if she was intentionally trying to give false impressions of it to the committee.  Most of what she said was nonsense.  "It was created to tear the world apart."    "It's already been used by terrorists."    (If I'm quoting her correctly)

The following is speculation based on the very limited marketing information available.
Coinvalidation appears to be working toward the following:
1.  Work with governments to create regulation that requires AML/KYC for bitcoin users and their addresses.
2.  Encourage businesses to only conduct business with users identified by the system.
3.  A blockchain parser that associates addresses inputs and transactions with specific users.
This would not be a modification to bitcoin, but a separate system monitoring the blockchain and tracing all of your transactions.  It hinges around either getting governments to force citizens to use it, or getting businesses to force customers to use it.
It's an attempt to indirectly exert centralized control over bitcoin and its users, as there is no way to do it directly.

Do some research first.  Pick a different exchange and begin verification there.
If you're looking to buy bitcoin, you'll be paying significantly more for them on Gox because sellers have priced in Gox's extortion fees.
If you're looking to sell bitcoin on Gox, thinking you'll make more because the price is higher, you'll just end up loosing money.  You cannot get fiat out of Gox without paying extortion fees.  They will hold your money hostage for months hoping to soften you up, before finally springing it on you that they will not give you your money until you agree to give them %5 of it *in addition* to the fees you already paid.  Why hasn't anyone sued them?  Because they hide behind the fact that the cost of an international lawsuit exceeds what the people they screw would hope to recover.

I think you have the hate backward.  Every 5 minutes another "expert" claims that bitcoin will fail tomorrow.  We simply take pleasure in them being proven wrong.  Over and over again.
Why is it the future?  Bitcoin may not be, but a crypto currency is certainly the future.  Bitcoin is just the most likely to succeed.
We are becoming an information based society.  We finally have programmable money to compliment that, and it was long overdue.  I think the most compelling feature is that it is digital, and can be easily be incorporated into autonomous programs and all types of electric devices.
Some other reasons:
* There's a freedom that comes with bitcoin, having greater control over your own finances.  This will become even more import if governments continue the current trend toward authoritarianism.
* It can not be counterfeited, unlike all other forms of currency.
* It's very secure.  No one can spend it without your private key, which you do not have to reveal to create a transaction.  Compare to credit cards in which you have to reveal your card number to use it, and anyone with that number can use it.
* It can be sent anywhere in the world, across borders, almost instantly.
* It's cheap to use.  Much cheaper than credit cards or wire transfers.

First, congrats on your decision to dump Gox.  Let me help you with that!
1. Dwolla has decided to end all relationships with anyone who deals with bitcoin.  This effects CampBX as well.  As of 10/15 you can no longer transfer funds into CampBX.  As of 10/28 you can no longer transfer funds out of BX with dwolla.
2. They've fucked up their dns , and the SSL certificate is not valid for the domain being used.  Instead of using the create ticket button, use the helpdesk link to the right.  This goes direct to the thirdparty helpdesk system with a valid cert.
3. Some of that will be resolved by the above.  Be sure to mention the invalid cert in your ticket.  They really just need to purchase a new cert that matches their support site alias.
4. Should be partially solved by 2.  Be aware that their helpdesk site seems to be operated by a 3rd party, so that's it's own security concern.
I've worked with BX.  It seems shady at first, but I investigated and found it's actually incompetence.  They really should fix it.
As for alternatives, I've worked with most major exchanges specifically for the purpose of finding one that seems perfect.  I've yet to find one I fully trust.  They all have issues.  Instead I spread my risk out by dividing money between them all, except for gox.  It's a messy situation, but it's better that loosing all my investment if one were to go dark or become compromised.

But where are you getting that address from?  Is there an actual withdraw listed in the account history tab that includes that as the destination address?  Something that looks like [this]( except with 1NZWaxFkBjt5MnKUfviMr82ZGcspaHAYuA listed?
From there, it is then sent to 14PRwA5ja48vsTsJE9vPCeaBrmjBuo6Can, which *appears* to be a deposit address for the shared wallet at 1CbR8da9YPZqXJJKm9ze1GYf67eKAUfXwP.
For some reason, I was under the assumption that 1CbR8da9YPZqXJJKm9ze1GYf67eKAUfXwP belongs to gox, although I can't find a source for that now.  If it does, Gox should be able to tell which customer recieved those funds via the deposit address(1CbR8da9YPZqXJJKm9ze1GYf67eKAUfXwP).
If that is an actual withdraw, your friend will have a hard time proving that he's not the one who initiated it.  
If your friend really did not initiate this withdraw, I'd be more inclined to suspect that security is compromised on the client side, not server side.  If someone were capable of withdrawing funds from any gox customer without authentication, we would see much more if this.  They would likely just empty gox completely. 
On the otherhand, this could just be a bug on gox's end, and not a security problem.  Although such a problem is just as serious.
I'm curious as to how they respond.  Keep us posted and good luck to you and your friend.

I set about testing exchanges a few months ago.  The tests were fairly simple, get money in, get money out.  My goal was to determine which exchange I wanted to do larger business with.
They all failed.
A few I had trouble getting fiat into, unbelievable.  If you cash my check, but still haven't credited my account three weeks later and wont respond to inquiries, you better bet I'm going to take action.  With one exchange, it took contacting their bank, who launched an investigation, before they would respond.  So I won't be doing business with them.
A non-exchange service was the only one that I was able to successfully get fiat into and out of.  Unfortunately, they've limited the amounts, and repeatedly and without warning, increased the hoops you have to jump through to use their service.  Recently, their greatest feature, which was their speed, has become unusable for me due yet another round of policy changes shoved onto users without warning.  I've tired of this behavior and I'm no longer using this service either.
The largest and most well known exchange lived up to a well deserved reputation for being impossible to get your money out of.  Once you initiate a fiat withdrawal with them, consider your money lost.  It has been several months since I initiated my test withdrawal with them and I am still fighting to get that money back.  They even offered to manually process my withdrawal for an additional 5%, and I still have not received it.  I don't expect to, ever.  Their responses have lead me to believe that they are now undoubtedly operating in bad faith.  They continue to blatantly lie by advertising withdrawals as taking two weeks, when they know this is not the case, nor has it been for a very long time.  Once they have your money, they hold it hostage while offering to complete the service *you're already paying for* with an additional 5% fee.  The only other option they offer is that you can convert it back to BTC, a process which incurs another fee.  The result is that users who have *already paid* to convert BTC to USD now have to *pay again*, all without ever being provided with the withdrawal service they initially converted BTC to USD for.  Just to be clear: **their only business is getting customers to pay fees for services which they never receive.**  Even if they one day were to begin delivering the service that they claim to offer, I would never again do business with a company that has behaved in this fashion.  Ever.  
The fastest, most reliable, and hassle-free method I've used is in person exchanges through localbitcoins.  Even though I carry only the value I'm exchanging and that which is needed to exchange it, I'm still worried about the day someone decides to pull a weapon.

The idea of a mixing day isn't really to mix, but to demonstrate the flaws in any system that would attempt to alter the value of currency simply because of where it has once been.  Mutual substitution is critical to every currency, including bitcoin.
The whole idea is terrible.  The moment such a system comes online, thousands of users would intentionally taint the addresses of the people responsible for such a system.  Then taint the addresses of every business that uses the system, along with anyone else that supports it.  For good measure, taint the donation addresses any politicians behind it.
After that you'll very quickly see how they're happy to exclude themselves and their friends from the system while everyone else gets screwed.  Make no mistake, it's an attempt to carry social classes into bitcoin.  One set of rules for the rich and powerful, another for everyone else.

The behavior almost suggests an AON order, which isn't supposed to be available on Kraken.


The "yet" suggests that they plan on offering it in the future.  It could even be available in their engine already, but not the interface.

Brainwallets are a terrible idea unless you use a ludicrous number of random, unrelated words.
It seems that most people don't.
Bitcoin's security lies in the enormous number of possible combinations characters that make up a private key.  When that number is reduced, such as by using a brainwallet without enough entropy, security is compromised.
Not long ago, there was a post almost every day by someone complaining about how their address had been emptied.  Where you using a brainwallet?  Yes.  Luckily, most of the people who crack these brainwallets are regulars here, doing it to educate people on the dangers of brainwallets, and will return your funds minus fees. 
While it's an individual's choice to take the risk and reduce their own security, brainwallets were hyped as *adding* security for so long that I don't think enough people are aware of the risks when choosing to use it.
I'm divided here.  I don't like the nanny aspect of protecting individuals from themselves, yet this is a real problem.  A better compromise may have been a big red warning message or popup, but users tend to just ignore those and click through.
Either way, this does not ultimately prevent the use of brainwallets with the service.  You can still generate your own brainwallet outside blockchain.info and import the key into it.

1. Have you tried any of the mobile apps?  Scan a QR and tap accept.  I think of wallet software much like web browsers.  Some are better than others, but browsers are not the web.  We're also still very early in bitcoin's lifecycle.  Just like it took the web and browsers time to mature, it will take time for bitcoin to mature.
2.  This is a big problem.  Yes, it's not a problem with bitcoin itself, and existed before bitcoin, but it does affect bitcoin users.  I wish more people would take security and backups seriously.  I can't understand why, after losing information multiple times to crashes or security breaches, people don't start taking precautions.  I actually hope that people will start taking these things more seriously as bitcoin adoption grows and the risk of real financial loss comes with it.
3. Similar to 1, bitcoin is still just starting out.  Nobody was on the web in the beginning either.  There are a growing number of retailers, but we have a long way to go.  
I think this all leads to another social problem.  Among newcomers, there seems to be an expectation of a finished product.  That's what most people are used to.  The general public isn't familiar with an open source development cycle and ecosystem.  I'm not sure it's in bitcoin's best interest for it to have so much press so early on.  Many people may be turned off by it's current state and not understand that things will get better.  It would be a bit like giving someone an alpha build of Windows.  They'd think it was sketchy and hard to use, and that could negatively effect their perception of a future final product before even seeing it.

For starters, your information is entirely wrong or out of date.  Gox is no longer the dominant exchange.  Bitstamp alone has more volume that Gox, and there are now many exchanges distributed around the world with high volume.
That's not really relevant at all anyway.  Exchanges are not bitcoin.  They are simply a place in which people can gather to exchange values.  What happens inside exchanges is also off-chain, meaning it has almost nothing to do with bitcoin itself, aside from using bitcoin to denominate value.  Bitcoin can be exchanged in person or over the internet without a third party.  In fact, most bitcoin transactions don't involve exchanges at all.  Exchanges are not bitcoin, just like banks are not cash.
When gox was hacked, that only affected gox.  The rest of bitcoin went on and ignored them.

It can't defend itself against its name being improperly stylized.
But you wanted serious.  Most of the technical weaknesses have been discussed ad nauseam.  There's still room to debate economics.  But I'd like to touch on a social problem. 
Bitcoin, in this early stage, and as you've noted, is vulnerable to misinformation.  Gish Gallop is an asymmetric social attack wherein opponents spread fear by listing a large number of possible weaknesses or problems, many of which may not even be real.  It takes very little time and effort to do this.  It seems to be increasingly common in interviews and articles with an anti-bitcoin slant.
The problem is that defending against this takes much more time and effort, as each point must be refuted in detail.  It's nearly impossible to properly address so many issues in a short interview or in the limited feedback section of an article.
To combat this, we should return the onus to the person making the claim.  If someone presents a potential problem or weakness with bitcoin, we should require them to provide evidence supporting the existence of such a problem before wasting our efforts in engaging them.

You would find other addresses that started with 1Archive, but it would be improbable that you would ever find the same address.  So improbable that it's close to being impossible.  By some estimates there's not enough energy in our solar system to ever reliably find the same key for the same address twice.  We'd need two more suns just to power the computers that would have to run for billions of years before finding a key collision.
There are ways to improve your odds of a collision, though.  For instance, if you knew that the key had been generated with a flawed RNG, and which flawed RNG, you could use the same one.

As much as I hate MtGox and would love to see them go down in flames, I'm skeptical of your friend's claim.
Did the balance *in his Gox account* actually decrease by 6 btc?  
Gox uses a shared wallet, so after coins hit your deposit address, they are passed on to Gox's main holding address.  You do not own the deposit address.  It is only used temporarily as a unique identifier for your deposit.  You also no longer control those coins.  Your account is credited with the amount deposited there and you operate within Gox off-chain and *entirely on credit* until you withdraw.
If it was so trivial to hack gox, you'd see a LOT more than 6 BTC stolen.
You should understand the system before making accusations.

Nobody wants to hear it, but the depth tables on all the major exchanges tell the story of a bubble.
There's no support for the current prices from larger players.  They all have their buy orders at much lower prices.
Right now the prices are being propped up by panic buyers, chasing higher prices, but in small volumes.    This is most evident when you see that the price on coinbase has now exceeded mtgox!   Panic buyers are scrambling to buy massively overpriced coin, afraid they'll miss out, but not knowledgeable enough to read the market properly.
Once the panic buying subsides, there's just no support for the current prices.   We'll see a freefall until we encounter larger standing buy orders at lower prices.  That free fall will cause large buyers to lower their offers once they realize that their driving the price again, bringing us back to sanity.

I monitor most of the exchanges.  BTCChina became unreachable for a few minutes.
The other exchanges, while still reachable, seemed to react to this by panic selling.  When BTCChina came back online, its price had also plummeted.
This did not seem to follow the pattern of DoS attacks previously seen on other exchanges.  Those were proceeded by small orders attempting to manipulate the price.  I also have no access to traffic monitoring in china, so I cannot say that it was DoS'd.   Whether this was an attack, a technical problem, or the result of abnoramally high but valid load, I can't say, but...
The most interesting result is the realization that the small order manipulation turns out to be completely unnecessary.  The price could be manipulated indirectly by only DoSing one exchange and trading on the reactions of another.
Exchanges will occasionally go offline for whatever reason.  The real problem here is that there are a huge number of skittish investors in bitcoin, and it's *them* that are easily manipulated.

Those of you who were not tuned into the crypto scene in the late 80's and early 90's may not be aware of just how important those words were.
Exporting "strong" cryptography was a quick way to find yourself under investigation.  Mathematicians were being labeled as arm dealers.  The NSA was pushing clipper chip and mandatory key escrow.
Civil disobedience was the only thing that really saved us.  Everything you weren't supposed to distribute got distributed so far and wide that there was no longer any point in them trying to keep it a secret.  Everyone got decent crypto, the public was warned about clipper, and the laws were changed to make math legal again.
[Clipper]( is one of those things that should be taught in school.  It stands as a warning about exactly how little respect governments have for the privacy of citizens.  It also demonstrates that the current revelations about the NSA are nothing new.
