Dogecoin...to the moooon!

Something will. Everything is replaced eventually. I think it will have more to so with technology than something better than bitcoin using the same blueprint.

It says right there on the first page, last line.

I'd smoke a bitcoin if I could.

I see some transactions from over 40 hours ago still not on blockchain.info. How long is the wait for coins? I made a cash deposit at about 3pm central time today and really expected things to go fast like before. Am I looking at a few days or are you starting to catch up?
EDIT: Not 5 minutes after posting this I got the email. Watching it on blockchain now. Thanks cashintocoins!

Are you saying that there are no big fish in the game or that the small fish are the ones gaming the system?

SR tumbles the coins.

Who are the big fish. Individuals, corporations, governments?

Just wait it out. It'll correct when all the band wagoners jump off.

You'll need a stamp that just says 'bit' so you can stamp your quarters and say, "here, have a bit coin".

There are big money players trying to game the system now. China was just a monkey wrench in the works that will benefit those with the capital to buy at the low price point before it jumps back up. Big money always wins.

Because value of bitcoin will rise again, and if it doesn't then no one will buy overpriced hardware because it's not cost effective. Therefore, hardware prices will have to adjust to make sales.

I'd like to see $60 again.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:25:45
Now it needs to drop another $360, then the correction will be complete and we can ride the wave back up to ~$240 for the next few months.

Mine would be 3 one dollar bills
