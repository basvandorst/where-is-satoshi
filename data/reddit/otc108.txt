I had been hearing about BTC when it was around 9K, and everyone was speaking in hushed tones at work about how much money they were making (I work in the tech industry).  So, I decided to hop on the bandwagon.  BUT.  I wanted to learn about bitcoin first, so I took an online course, did my homework, learned about markets and trading, etc.
When I felt ready, I started getting verified on various coin purchasing sites and trading exchanges.  This step took forever!  "I'm gonna miss the boat at this rate!", I thought.  Finally, all was set.  I made a reasonably large purchase of bitcoin, after having a discussion with my wife as to why I was spending money on this ("what's bitcoin?"), and started trading.  This was in January of 2018.  Everything was going fine, and I was actually making money off of trades... I was up!  Then, slowly, the value started to go down, offsetting all of the gains I made.  "Surely it'll bounce back", I thought, as I ceased all trading activities.
At the end of January 2018, I had lost about 40% of my portfolio.  I lost faith in it, when a month or 2 prior all I could see was potential.  I had all these high hopes of trading for gains and getting more BTC, and then HODL.  A couple months later, I stopped talking about bitcoin.  When people asked, I'd tell them ,"I can't talk about bitcoin right now".  By summer, my response turned into "shut the fuck up about bitcoin".  And that's how I feel today.
Currently, my original investment is worth about 30% what it was initially.  My wife asks me occasionally about it, and I just tell her "best not talk about that".  Will it recover?  Maybe?  I haven't sold anything since Feb-March 2018, and will not do so unless it moves back up.  Til then, it's a sore subject, and I have no faith in crypto.  I will reluctantly HODL until the last fraction of bitcoin turns to dust in my hands.
