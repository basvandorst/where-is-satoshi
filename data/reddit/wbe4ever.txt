So you get trolled out of the troll box hit some filters after spamming constant FUD, cry to the mods, cry to r/bitcoin get deleted and now you are here . Let me guess still hurt cause you sold your ETH right ?

Concerns you ? Lol 
Lies ! Evidence ! It's a troll box you muppet . 
What's even funnier is that I didn't lie you seem to be behind on news and stuck in your butthurt "believe " world . 
You spammed over and over again . 
It seems you hit a filter and got shadow banned for a few minutes. Happens to all of us . 
Did you try to post other github links to find out ? 
There is no conspiracy or cover up by the mods but If you want I can send you some tin foil which you can wrap yourself with next time you enter troll box Supreme Court . Lol

Chinese mining pools have way more power over Bitcoin then VB has over ETH . Sure it's not a single person but when profit comes to question  they sure are.

BTC is good mate . Only problem is it doesn't have a link with Anz and one other bank . Check it out on their website .

How can you be so in denial over what is happening to Bitcoin . 
Ok VB has some power over ETH , shit he created it but I wouldn't say he overlords it . However you do not except how centralized Bitcoin is. 
It's fascinating really is .

I think Vitalik has enough cash not to worry at 22 . Fork was needed as ETH would be dead otherwise ,it's just what it is. 
Now good luck getting your Chinese mining pools to do to things in agreement when you will need to .
I own both coins and your ETH bash is crap and getting old . Look at your own neighborhood and how decentralized it is you are before you talk shit .
