Number of reasons. Super fast transactions, independent currency not based on government, inflation free, no middle man. It's going to grow, [this YouTube video]( is kinda corny but it does a good job shedding light on how it can be very confusing but still the future. Even [Floyd Mayweather is on board]( and yeah I know just cause he's got a lot of money doesn't mean he's smart, but if someone with that kindve power has been advised to invest in crypto's, it's looking very promising

I only have an iPhone, I use the Coinbase app. Yeah, there's a fee, but it's so simple and user friendly. I use it to buy Litecoin and Bitcoin

I'm new too, but bitcoin is only going to go up. I wouldn't worry about trading it like with stocks, but more of a long term investment. I think if you put a couple hundred at least in BTC every month you'll have hundreds of thousands, if not millions within a decade. Don't worry about little mini crashes, it'll always recover

There will only be 21,000,000 BTC ever, and it must all be mined to achieve even that which will take years. As the demand for it grows, the value will only increase. With the 21M cap, it'll protect from inflation
