It invalidates everyone who doesn't just want to cash in on all the other fools who buy in to speculate and actually wants bitcoin to be accepted as an international cash. If bitcoin keeps fluctuating like that it's never going to become a common currency.

Nice argumentum ad verecundiam there fella. You should never ever listen to a person that has financial incentive when it comes to investing. Seems like you had neither economics nor debate classes at high school

Two things, and I am aware that I am going to be downvoted but whatever. First of all, this is a repost, I don't even come here all that often but I've seen this 3 times already. Second, you can not expect an unbiased objective report on bitcoin's future and current state. He has massive investments in bitcoin and so he is obiviously a believer, but don't get your hopes up just because he said something nice about bitcoin.

No they won't
They'll be making memes hoping they can get more people to HODL so they can get BTC to 15k again and cash out at a small loss.
