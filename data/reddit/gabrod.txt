Thank you look answer below
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:13:45
Can you dm me those links? I am interested in reading them as well... Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:03:07
so i will be hashing sha 256 to verify transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:29:18
I was trying to send it to bitstamp...
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:35:43
I feel that those verifying transactions are getting the easy money, how can I become one?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:25:52
Does the fee increases if you send to multiple people, or no?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:53:27
Awesome! You changed someone's life!
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:04:56
The person who stated that posted this link, 
But I havent checked myself
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:07:12
the hashing power in the website you provided. How do I check what I need or how much?
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:20:24
Are miners the one in charge of verifying transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:09:05
Holy shit I am getting charged $77 in fees if I do a transfer now. Is this the new normal?
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:53:33
Do i need to buy 2 dozen video cards too?
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:24:39
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:58:00
Sorry for the dumb questions, learning as I go. what is the purpose of hashing sha256? And another thing. My electricity cost is 20/cent kilo where I am at. is it still profitable?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:58:36
The mmultiple output would be considered the amount of people? Sorry kinda new here
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:43:39
Thank you for the explanation but I apologize since I was not clear enough. I am sending from a wallet that is not from coinbase, is a phone wallet
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:36:49
I meant to say, isn't sending to bitstamp the same thing as gdax, it should be  a lower fee
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:28:11
Thanks, but in comparing to sending each person individually, would it be lower, or basically the same?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:30:53
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:01:58
Yes, I am part of the convo there as well, but hers is in progress at the moment and I didn't want to derail her post, besides a house, I made this one for whoever bought something big besides a house. Thanks for the heads up to others! :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:31:57
Im curious as well, if you were to pay a house cash, all you need would be a realtor and a re attorney. But, would the attorney request to verify where funds come from or basically just pay him his share in fiat and pay the owner in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:04:48
For the rest who are not ignorant like the first redditor that responded. I am interested since I am invested in this, if it ever comes the opportunity where I can do this, I would like to know what I am getting myself into.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:13:56
Thats not the issue, I just don't want to do 5 different transactions. If I could do 1 for all 5 and pay a lower fee, I'm down :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:17:09
Olga, 
I created a new account and my limit is 7,500, I verified with bank account ID and credit card. How can I get my limit increased and be able to use that limit???
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:50:52
Is Bitcoin Core safe?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:08:15
Im trying to do both
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:30:14
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:03:31
What wrong by leaving in it? you are just getting an additional one
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:43:57
I believe she paid it completely with Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:20:17
If you dont mind me asking. Can you explain the process of how it happened? In order for you to change the deed in your name, you needed a real estate attorney, didn't he ask you for proof of where you got that money from?? Or did he verified it some other way?? Please it would be helpful if you could be as detailed as possible. Very interested in this! thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:16:58
Ha! I noticed that. What type of info it leaks?
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:57:52
Is it safe? whats better bet This and Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:47:00
Am only able to see purchases on coinbase and gemini, no transfer fees
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:59:46

@_date: 2017-11-20 08:08:33
Trying to do both.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:09:00
Yes thats what suppose to happen, if you want to "test it" you shoul do it with a small amount in it "just in case"
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:24:01
I think you can without funds, but the whole idea is for you to see if the funds comes up, because if it were to be zero you wouldn't know if it did work or not
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:30:33
Can you explain a bit further? How did you  "bought" ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:37:17
Will it drop again to 9's because of such surge?
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:32:45
Thanks, but the previous op mentioned about leaking info into the servers, so I wanted to know which type of info
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:01:52
Says the guy with a 1 week old reddit account?   
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:17:40
Well I am having a really bad headache!
* What is the purpose of the fork?
* What is the probability of this thing plummeting after the fork?
* Are you getting double of what you have after the fork? 
* Same value or less?
* What is the best most secure wallet you would recommend?
* Where is the best place to buy a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:47:38
Shout out to coinbase for holding my deposit for more than 5 days!
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:06:44
Fuckkkkkkkk that, it is 153gb that I cannot store in this computer :P. Any other option?
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:48:00
I will check it out. thanks
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:10:37
I think it will bounce back
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:32:09
Everyone is HODL :)
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:33:35
bought 1 tenth at $718 I really want to buy more but scared of the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:35:25
Funny how they say that if you have a question to come to reddit and post it, but then after you do, then they try to portrait you as something else. Common sense is not so common after all.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:47:49
I just started and this is what it comes close to what i need, but when I input the data, I am off by $115. because I have to figure out the closest price when I got it. any tips and /or tricks?
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:38:29
Thank you for bringing this up.
@_date: 2019-09-06 00:10:40
Even if I live outside the USA? Do I need to be a citizen?
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:52:41
Thank you., I have used bitstamp before, so I am familiar with it, I am just trying to save in the fees.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:48:24
Thank you I will check it out
@_date: 2019-09-06 00:29:01
Thank you, have you used them before?
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:38:49
lol, that amount is in dollars :P
@_date: 2019-09-06 01:51:00
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-09-06 00:26:28


Thank you for your reply. Never heard of these companies, I will definitely check them out. Have you personally done business with them?
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:38:19
Have you used this place before? Is it legit?
