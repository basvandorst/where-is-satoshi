I don't think you were rude. In the heat of it what you said was logical, she has no idea how risky that is and could care less. I would never want an employee like that.

yeah, but i don't think it was enough to warrant how much backlash op is getting. I would be pissed/annoyed in that situation.

Hello, i've been looking around at Bitcoin a little as a possible way to resolve an issue I currently have and I was wondering if it's a good idea or not.
I'm originally from America but moving to Europe and right now whenever I use my American bank card to make purchases or withdrawal money here I am paying a conversion fee to my bank. If I used all of my money to buy BTC I wouldn't have to pay a conversion fee and then when I want Euros I could withdrawal from BTC and convert without a fee right?
Is this a good idea or bad idea or am I totally off base here? Any other suggestions for using my money out here without paying constant fees?

Thanks for the help! And yeah that makes sense, I can understand that it's similar to investing and not a short term solution. I've watched my 401k bounce around a few times and I think I'd like to test some.of my money here.

Yeah that make sense and I should probably just do it cause I'm sitting on a large amount and I'm not making any interest from my bank. I'm just hesitant on where to start and if I'll lose any money in the process.
