Of course block times are about the same...what does that have to do with anything? The average block time should always be about ten minutes. That's just how the Bitcoin protocol works. Nobody who knew what they were talking about would suggest that Bitcoin Cash was going for shorter block times.
As for fees, take a look at the 24-hour histogram [here.]( The vast majority of fees are well under $0.05. The average is apparently being distorted by a small number of extremely excessive fees. No idea why anyone would pay over $2 for a BCH transaction. No properly functioning wallet would ever calculate a fee that high, so they must be setting it manually. The highest fee I've literally ever paid was $0.03.
Meanwhile, [the average fee for a Bitcoin transaction]( is more than $30. I would complain if Bank of America tried to charge me that much to send a wire.

Really? So did Bitcoin Cash temporarily become Bitcoin back in November?
Could Bitcoin Cash still become Bitcoin in your view, if enough miners were to switch over (and stay switched)?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:47:53
The central argument here is a dishonest oversimplification. Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin, not an entirely new ledger. Forks are not knockoffs. Bitcoin Core does not own the technology or the protocol, let alone the Bitcoin "brand."
The Core chain isn't even the oldest! Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash have a common history. That's how forks work. Either they exactly the same age, or else neither of them is any older than its latest update. The first block of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is also the first block of the Bitcoin Core blockchain.
Here's a question to think about: when Bitcoin Core does finally decide to go through with a hard fork, and a small group of dissenters inevitably stay behind to maintain the legacy chain a la Ethereum Classic, what will give the Core devs and their supporters the right to insist that their "new" product is the "real" Bitcoin? Will you all abandon them and go down with the ship at that point?

The point you're missing here is that the "utility" of a store of value fundamentally depends on its market price, which is a function of *all* demand flowing from *all* possible uses--not just demand for a store of value. If I buy a Bitcoin for $18K and the price collapses to $2K when another cryptocurrency goes mainstream and speculators move on a few months later, Bitcoin will have totally failed me as a store of value.


All of this is quite obvious and none of it is particularly relevant, but thanks for sharing?


 
If you don't like it, here's something you can try: stop assuming that everyone who disagrees with you is "confused" or "misled." Stop talking down to people and pretending that you're above the fray. That sort of behavior tends to be somewhat divisive.


Not right this moment, no. But it's a worthy and entirely achievable goal that is only being actively and seriously pursued by one of those projects.
We're already beginning to see the consequences of Bitcoin Core's lack of interest in the "electronic cash" use case. Steam no longer accepts BTC. BitPay has announced plans to support BCH. Events like these will have a real impact on future demand for Bitcoin, which will affect Bitcoin's price, which will affect Bitcoin's utility as a store of value.

The line between negligence and ordinary incompetence can seem pretty arbitrary sometimes.
The usual way to answer a question like this is something called the "reasonable person" test. You basically ask a jury whether or not the defendant's actions were consistent with what they'd normally expect to see from a minimally careful person in the defendant's exact position.
That may seem super subjective at first glance, but it's our go-to standard for all forms of professional negligence, and actually doesn't lead to serious disagreement or controversy very often.
Here's an analogy: your foot hurts, so you go to a podiatrist. Instead of recommending night splints and a set of daily stretches, as the vast majority of podiatrists would do for a patient presenting with your symptoms, she insists that you try an experimental new radiation therapy that *might* cause your toes to fall off...but if it works, you'll be faster than Usain Bolt!
You might get lucky and make it to the Olympics. Regardless, the doctor's recommendation was clearly irresponsible, and she would almost certainly bear some liability for the costs associated with any missing toes. No judge or jury would accept the vast hypothetical upside as a valid defense.

"What's the problem? Can't you poors afford to pay $30 for your $4,000 Bitcoin transactions? That seems perfectly reasonable to me."
The state of Satoshi's Vision®, December 2017


Bitcoin can no longer be used for normal transactions. How is that not a meaningful problem?


There's another block size increase planned for 2018--probably to 32MB. Also, Bitcoin Cash is perfectly compatible with both SegWit and the Lightning Network, if it ever comes to that.


I believe this is where I link you to Satoshi's white paper. But you don't seem like the kind of person who would be persuaded by that sort of thing, so let me try a different tack:
The current price of Bitcoin (and thus its feasibility and attractiveness as a "store of value") depends very heavily on speculative demand. What do you think will happen to that demand when another cryptocurrency becomes the first to achieve true mass adoption? Bitcoin Cash might not end up being the winner of that race, but at this rate it seems quite certain that Bitcoin Core will be among the losers.
Bitcoin's current market cap is about $275B. The total global gold supply is worth something like $8T. Both of those amounts are dwarfed by the value of the global supply of normal fiat currency, which has been estimated at **$60 trillion.**
Just some food for thought.

That just isn't true. There is actually a massive amount of overlap between BTC and BCH miners. Many of them switch back and forth freely according to what's most profitable at the time. Some mining pools are even set up to do that automatically.
That's what happened on the 11th of August--BTC mining difficulty was way up, and BCH's price was surging in response to the S2X cancellation.
The point is that nobody has ever actually followed (or intended to follow) the rule described by It's a confused misplacement of a similar rule that is fundamental to the Bitcoin protocol: whenever there are *compatible* forks (which happens all of the time,) the fork supported by a majority of miners will prevail, because it will inevitably produce a longer chain. The Bitcoin protocol always gives priority to the longest valid chain. That's one of Bitcoin's most important security features: if you don't control more than half of the hashing power, you can't get away with fabricating transactions.
This rule does not apply to incompatible hard forks like Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash nodes will always give priority to the longest valid chain of Bitcoin Cash blocks, but they will never recognize post-hard-fork Bitcoin Core blocks as legitimate. Likewise, Bitcoin Core nodes will never recognize Bitcoin Cash blocks as legitimate, no matter how many miners switch to Bitcoin Cash.

Of course they can. But they have a fiduciary duty to their clients. Legally, that's the highest possible standard of care.
What that means in practice is that they can be liable for losses that result from bad advice. What counts as "bad advice" in retrospect is obviously somewhat subjective, and will depend a lot on popular sentiment. 
At this point in time, "spend your life savings on bitcoins and meet me on the moon!" most definitely would qualify as bad advice.

I never claimed to be *completely* ignorant about the technology. I do understand how it works on a basic level. I have read plenty of arguments on both sides of the scaling debate. Don't mistake modesty and a willingness to admit mistakes for total incompetence.
I also understand that people who know way more about it than both of us put together disagree with each other on the question of whether or not a block size increase would be justified, but broadly agree that a small one would be harmless at worst. 
The fact that the Bitcoin protocol "doesn't care" is 100% irrelevant. The protocol itself is mutable, and the people who control it are not subject to it. When I refer to "the political situation," I'm obviously not talking about the internal mechanics of the protocol.

This is a common (and extremely confused) misconception about fractional reserve banking. Please [read up.](
Try thinking of it this way: a deposit account is effectively a loan that a depositor has made to a bank. That's why your bank pays interest on the balance of your savings account. The bank lends some of that money out to other borrowers, but as long as it manages to collect enough interest and hold enough cash in reserve to honor occasional payments to its depositors, it will remain solvent.
That practice does cause the money supply to increase in a technical sense, but only if we count full deposit account balances (i.e. the bank's full *obligation* to its "creditors," or deposit account holders) as part of the current money supply. That doesn't really jibe with the way we generally think of money. If I were to borrow $500 from you, would you continue to regard the full balance of that loan as a part of your personal money supply? Probably not.

Can the futures markets really be relied upon to predict how coins on the S2X chain would do in the event that major exchanges gave them the BTC ticker?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:14:55
Volatility seems like an argument *against* waiting for "dips." If you can't make consistently reliable predictions, how can you hope to properly time that sort of thing?
Here's what I mean: say the price increases by a total of 20% over the course of a full day, from $1,000 to $1,200. It rises steadily at first, then dips by 5% at about the 12-hour mark, from $1,100 to $1,045. If you wait for the dip, and only buy at the very bottom, you'll be better off than someone who unluckily chose to buy in the hours immediately preceding it. But you'll ultimately do *worse* than anyone who wasn't waiting for anything and bought during the first four or five hours of the day.
What if the dip doesn't happen until hour  What if it doesn't happen at all? If you can't predict when a dip will occur, how long it will last, or what will happen on the other side of it, then waiting for it is truly no better than just picking a moment at random. It may actually be worse in the long run, because it gives you false confidence in your ability to time your trades.
EDIT: If the price actually *crashes*, and you're very confident that it will recover, that's obviously another story. But it's probably best to use dollar-cost averaging as a general rule, supplemented by additional purchases whenever it's very clear that the price is dramatically lower than it should be.

The overwhelming consensus among actual economists has long been that ABCT cannot be reconciled with the empirical data, no matter how much you like the story it tells. Your own inability to account for basic facts about the rate of inflation is a great example.

@_date: 2017-11-05 02:37:05
I don't think that makes any sense. If all of the big exchanges decide to call coins on the S2X chain "BTC," and begin buying and selling them at BTC prices, then those coins will have literally become BTC for all intents and purposes. At that point, why would the price of those coins *in their former lives as altcoins* be relevant anymore? Why would exchanges base their decision on that?
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:24:58
I think it's a bit misleading to say that fiat money can be created "at will." That makes it sound like an easy thing for a person to do on a whim, which obviously isn't right. Why would anyone bother going to work if it were feasible to kick back at home and conjure a few bucks *ex nihilo* whenever a bill needed to be paid?
The money supply may not be perfectly finite, but it is very carefully *limited,* and that may be close enough for government work. Can you think of a good reason to believe that the occasional creation of new money should be more disruptive to the economy than the discovery of a new gold deposit would be?
Speaking of gold...don't we already have a naturally scarce fungible asset that can be used as an effective store of value? What's meaningfully novel about Bitcoin with respect to that particular use case? Do you think that fiat money's only real advantage over gold is that it's more convenient, and that massive numbers of people will voluntarily make the switch to "digital gold" now that such a thing has been invented?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:36:10

@_date: 2017-11-11 22:07:11


Of course not. The differences aren't especially important to people who only want to use them as a store of value, but there are many functional differences. I would describe block size as a functional difference. Smart contracts certainly also qualify.


You think this is the market expressing a preference for bigger blocks? No. It's a reaction to [news that the NYA fell apart and that  a "planned upgrade" had been called off.]( The technical particulars are immaterial.
There's a general perception that discord within the community is causing problems. For those who dig just a little bit deeper, there's a parallel perception that Bitcoin Cash is unaffected by those problems.
Separately, the Bitcoin business community was well-represented at the NYA, so they've just been shown compelling evidence that they have exactly zero influence over Bitcoin's development. The idea that they have no choice but to trust the Core devs unconditionally probably doesn't sit super well with them.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:01:53


Really? You think that Janet Yellen can just straight up print money for herself and all of her pals?
And do you think it's *easy* to become Chair of the Federal Reserve?
I'd also point out that if the Core devs and big Chinese miners got together, they could pretty easily change the block reward schedule and total supply limit. The BTC protocol is enforced by convention and the collective consent of its users, not the laws of physics.


If it's true that the Fed has been creating recklessly excessive amounts of money for decades, then why do we not see runaway inflation? On the contrary, [inflation has been consistently low and stable]( since the mid-80s.

Because that's how you achieve "consensus" in real life, among free human beings who depend on each other but don't always want exactly the same thing: by making compromises.
The miners offered to support SegWit in exchange for 2 MB blocks. That deal would've made just about everyone pretty happy, and the Core devs should've taken it. Instead, they appealed to a bunch of goofy decision-making norms that seem to have become something like a religion for them, pretended to be literally *unable* to make such a decision on behalf of "the community," and then proceeded to implement SegWit--despite the fact that before the NYA, it never achieved greater than 50% support among miners.
Do you believe that miners should have zero control over the direction of Bitcoin's development? That's called a (very stupid and weirdly authoritarian) *political position.*
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:51:07


Thinking about it in those terms seems like a really serious mistake to me. Miners don't have to go out and sell their coins right away. If S2X ultimately becomes BTC, the S2X tokens mined right after the fork will ultimately be worth BTC prices, even if they're worth much less before the exchanges make up their minds. In that case, the miners who stuck with the original chain would be the ones to lose out.
The most profitable chain is the one that will be BTC after the dust settles. Saying that they'll mine "the more profitable chain" is like saying you'll bet on whichever horse is going to win. It doesn't work like that. You can't decide the outcome based on the outcome.

But either chain could be labeled as "BTC" after the fork. If the exchanges sell coins on the S2X chain to buyers who ask for BTC, at BTC prices, and those buyers are able to turn around and sell those same coins to others at BTC prices, *those coins are BTC* for all intents and purposes.


If exchanges decide to treat the B2X chain as the "real" BTC chain, then coins mined on that chain will ultimately be valued at BTC prices. Why should anyone care about how much those coins go for as speculative coin split tokens, under a separate ticker, in anticipation of the (hopefully brief) transitional period immediately following the fork? Why should that decide anything?
Here's the question that futures markets can amswer: which chain is preferred by people who are willing to make reckless bets on the outcome of the most contentious hard fork in crypto history?
That's it. They cannot tell us what miners will do. They cannot tell is what exchanges will do. They cannot even tell us what the average individual user prefers. And they surely tell us absolutely nothing about the big institutional investors that have been driving up the price so dramatically over the past year.

This is such a good and important point. It's hard to say exactly how much of BTC's present value can be chalked up to Wall Street speculation, but it's instructive to remember that it was worth about $700 a single year ago.
The current price is totally decoupled from utility. Investors prefer it because other investors prefer it. They don't care about block weight. They couldn't give two shits about SegWit. Their preferences could easily change on a dime, because for their purposes, the major cryptocurrencies are functionally identical.

The value of any currency is a function of demand, and the US dollar enjoys endless, unlimited demand.

That's true. But you seem to think that the market will reject it because the miners won't mine something that the market will reject. Do you see how that's circular?
The market may reject it regardless. But what are the actual odds of that? I don't think the average subscriber or Twitter user with [NO2X] in his handle is necessarily representative of the Bitcoin market anymore. 
The big institutional investors that have only  recently joined the party are the ones who are responsible for the insane growth we've seen this year. It isn't obvious to me that those people care about the Core developers or spend a lot of time worrying about whether or not Bitcoin is fulfilling Satoshi's original vision or whatever. I feel like they'd much rather invest in a cryptocurrency that's stewarded by people like Jeff Garzik and the DCG.
If they are the market now--and I think there's a strong argument to be made that they are--then maybe it's a mistake to write off S2X so confidently.


The difference is that it's Bitcoin, if all goes according to plan. And Bitcoin is worth $7,000 at the moment.


Jeff Garzik used to be a Core developer. Gavin Andresen is also in favor, and he used to be the lead maintainer. Also, do you really think that no talented developers will be willing to work on it in the event that it becomes the main Bitcoin chain?

Bitcoin's success doesn't validate the political and economic views of its most ideologically motivated users. If anything, the opposite is true: its wild volatility and dramatic growth ensure that it cannot be a practical alternative to fiat money. Its value will always directly depend on the health and continued reliability of the very institutions that it's supposedly meant to subvert.
In my opinion, the goofy, loud, economically illiterate technolibertarian core of the Bitcoin community is the project's single greatest liability. If they continue to control the direction of Bitcoin's development, institutional investors *will* be scared off, and a lot of wealth will be destroyed as a result.

...which is exactly why coins on the Core chain will probably be more valuable right after the fork. What's your point? That value doesn't somehow attach itself to the blockchain.
Say the exchanges decide to give the BTC ticker to the S2X chain, and relabel the Core chain as "BT1." What do you suppose would happen then?

You seem pretty committed to ignoring me, but I'm curious enough to ask this anyway: do you believe that the whole SegWit2x controversy boiled down to a straightforward dispute over a technical problem? If so, what were your own objections?
Note that the threat of slightly increased centralization is not a technical problem. The fact that the Core devs are apparently either unable or unwilling to negotiate with the business community isn't a technical problem, either. Those are political/economic/philosophical problems, and it isn't obvious to me that expertise in the underlying technology is directly relevant to them.

How difficult would it be for Bitcoin ABC to implement that as soon as second layer solutions become available?

Perhaps there is no block size that solves scaling *permanently.* But transaction fees are arguably out of control *right now,* and it's not like the network is going to need to scale to 5 billion users overnight. If you had to guess, how many years of reasonable fees  do you think 32 MB might buy us?
Also...why not both? At the risk of triggering flashbacks of the last time the BTC community tried to compromise on a scaling solution, wouldn't LN work even better and be even cheaper on a main chain with a higher block size limit?

So wasn't the software actually working as intended? It sounds like they were waiting for a big block that was never mined.

My confidence there had a lot to do with the fact that none of the many arguments I'd seen against a block size increase seemed to be founded on legitimate technical concerns in the first place. They were political and philosophical arguments over who should be in control of the protocol and how decisions ought to be made.

Why not? Is it some kind of secret?

Surely you don't believe that crony capitalism only exists because we went off the gold standard. So what actually is your argument here? Just that the Fed's ability to increase the money supply might somehow indirectly make the problem worse, by empowering the government to spend more money in general?
Please either be much more specific or don't bother responding.


No, not "equivalent." Two things can be analogous without being equivalent in every way.
I'm mainly just trying to call attention to the irony. Difficulty is centrally important to Bitcoin's own money creation mechanism, and there are very good reasons for that, so it's funny to me when a Bitcoin enthusiast claims that difficulty is "irrelevant" to the question of whether or not it should be possible to create new US dollars.

Right. The miners can go do their own thing whenever they want, so long as they're willing to risk millions of dollars, most of their customers, and the future success of their businesses.


So you don't seem to even know the meaning of the word "politics," yet you are extremely convinced about subjects and you respond to people to lecture them even though you clearly don't have the slightest idea what you are talking about? Wow.


Are you kidding me? Are we looking at the same post? Here's what you actually said about that:


By your own admission, **there is no technical issue.** This is a purely political problem, and you aren't going to be able to say anything remotely intelligent about it until you accept that.
EDIT: Did you actually read through the thread you sent me?
According to [Greg Maxwell himself:](


He also seemed to anticipate the present moment by alluding to "political decisions disguised as technical ones."
