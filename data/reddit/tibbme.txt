This is the crypto world, normal rules don't hold. They make their money from trading so turning off the trading engine would actually hurt their hip pocket. They're not trying to save bitcoin or bring justice to the scammers. They're just trying not to get caught up in that mess. Trying to be as close to business as usual as possible

Yup, watching it play out now on BTC-e. Moderator confirmed. geecko09, no. this is temporary. We are only punishing bad behaviour in the community. Blacklisted coins will be cleared when enough time passes or justice is served. This type of community behaviour is supporting BTC's future. This is a democratic decision among pillars of the community. If one of them disagreed, then this wouldn't be happening. Any one of these links breaking would have broken the chain.

A big dump and the withdraw on BTC-e would wreck their system. they'd make money off it, but then everyone would be dumping too. it'd be like a run on banks. Likewise with all exchanges. they're co-ordinating with all the other major ones since nobody wants to be the one that gets the biggest dump and run
They also have connections to the fiat world and their withdrawal partners may not be able to handle massive fund outflows.

They're not asking for reversible transactions. Evo admins got rich by blocking all transactions and taking the money for themselves. Even if Verto and Kimble are dox, the community is just asking them to reinstate Evo for a while so that normal transactions can go ahead. No crap about reversing transactions

Verto and Kimble are PM'ing people asking them to be mules. For those that don't know bitcoin, if you accept their offer to be a mule, their tainted coins will taint your wallet and all your coins. You will be in the same boat as they are for a measly 10%. DON'T DO IT!! Support the community. Say no to scammers who hurt the community.
