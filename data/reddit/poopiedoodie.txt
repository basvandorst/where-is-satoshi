Yesterday i sent $6000 using wifi cruising at 30,000 feet for free. Using my bank account. It was amazing.

Please stop. Just like the other 30 times something was huge and would take Bitcoin mainstream nothing will happen. Will you people ever learn? 
And to the OP: your title is retarded. Next time try to sound less like a crazy cultist and just copy and paste the original title.

Your question is so ridiculous i'm not even gonna answer. The stuff you people come up with just to defend your hero is insane.

Do you seriously actually believe this? If so it is time to get your ass out of fantasy land.

he ran a highly illegal drug market, was involved in money laundering, identity fraud and will go to trial for hiring at least 1 hitman. According to chat logs and best of all his own logs he tried to have 5 or 6 people killed. 
 
Why exactly do you want him to get his money back and why would it be nice if he could go home?
Edit: maybe some of you should look up what the purpose of the downvote system is. Hint - Censoring people you don't agree with is not it.

I could replace the word Bitcoin in your text with any of the other 100's of coins that exist. 
Is it also a fact that they will become the currency of the future? According to your logic it is. 
Or is only Bitcoin allowed to be the one currency because you are invested in it?
Also hilarious how to guy who asked this got downvoted. Apparently you must agree it's a fact or you will be punished with downvotes.

No you tool. It's because another sub linked to here. 
Is this really all it takes to get all euphoric? My God.

I'm no lawyer but i very much doubt the government will give back seized money to the owner of a drugs market. 
Yes, those 2 feds screwed up hard and Ross should be given a new trial. But he still ran an illegal market and he simply won't be allowed to keep that money.

As huge as the 50 other times something here was huge? Or even huger?!
Are you euphoric right now?

Haha no. You sound a bit cultish. Scary.
