Private is not the same as publicly or privately traded.

The problem is people who are selling probably aren't visiting this sub or are victims of the shutdown.

Once again, you are detracting the discussion further away from the initial premise.
First of all, you contradicted your own reasoning when you first said that the government is jealous that other people are making money.
Nowhere did I personify law. I'm simply stating my understanding of where the law is coming from. And I provided reasonings on why my interpretation is reasonable. This, in case you forgot, was the premise of the discussion.
Also, you probably need some basic economic lessons. Do you truly think the majority of Chinese citizens hold Bitcoin and the government officials are hoarding all the Chinese dollar yuan? Of course not. Also, banning Bitcoin most prominently reduces the double edge of the wealth effect. It eliminates the downside of coin crashing and potential bankruptcy of certain coin holders.
And just to introduce you to the human world. People sometimes act good and said action will benefit people around him. This in term will indirectly benefit the former. However, do not confuse the indirect benefit as the primary intent of the said good action. It's merely a side effect.
Anyways, it seems like you studied or think you studied some theories in policy or philosophy. But I guess there is a gap between knowing and understanding.

Everyone have self interest but to describe a policy like that as self serving is a little bit ridiculous. Regardless of its effectiveness, it's motivation is to protect the financial market, not government jealousy.

You are picturing the Chinese government as a selfish entity.
It's more like that they don't want extreme uncertainty and volatility in their economy.
Stability and order are their emphasis. This isn't "if I can't make money, no  one can"

Good point! This isn't a private Chinese news source.

You clearly aren't responding to what I'm saying and are arguing against some other arbitrary theoretic concept that you think I said.
You are taking on the extreme that all government policies are non-altruistic and self interested.
What I said some government policies are self interested and others are aimed to benefit the society. This is probably a much more realistic description of the government.
Before you detract the discussion into a rabbit hole, the initial argument was about the Bitcoin regulation which in my opinion is the latter - ensure financial stability ( not government jealousy as you have said).
