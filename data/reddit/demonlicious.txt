bitcoin is too small, and therefore will continue to be manipulated by whales and exchanges for their profit, not ours.
when a lot of new adopters come in, the price will be crashed, and when they exit, it will surge. so they buy back in higher, and rinse repeat. it has been like that since bitcoin's highest moment at least.

i'm sorry guys, it's all my fault.
just before the eth fall, I bought some, so the price naturally had to fall.
as btc fell too, I bought a few more btc, and naturally, btc had to fall harder.
it's not rocket science, if I buy a coin, it falls (rip dogecoin).

only if it fixes its issues fast enough. if it lags too far behind, and it lags tremendously already, people will abandon it for more useful coins. meaning, it will rise slower and selloffs will crash the price hard. we don't want to be in that situation.

bitcoin isn't liquid enough to manipulate like the futures market? also, it will add some significant stress to the network?
the reason the traditional business market is pushing for tax breaks and risking customer alienation with fees is because people stopped investing with them. they lost credibility. therefore, they won't come to destroy crypto, they'll come to take over. they need a new game.

I'm new to this issue, and from what I gather by just glancing at the article, we're headed towards higher fees, and that it's a good thing.
question then. could a mining entity purposely congest the network with transactions to force even higher fees? they wouldn't go to extremes, but just enough to make it even more worthwhile to mine for them?

bitcoin isn't to be "used" through exchanges. exchanges are the best way to acquire them atm.
so it's a risk, and smart people do that transaction as quickly as possible. don't leave coins or cash on any exchange, no exceptions.

thank you.
linking any person to one address; could that not be done by any online store that you've bought something from? even if you used a spending wallet. online stores currently share/sell their data at one point or another. so it's inevitable that we'll be tracked unless we go through pains to make many transactions using some kind of community coin swapper, but those transactions fees will make that unappealing as well.

how do you think a currency can fail? even in countries with runaway inflation, the currency hasn't "died".
if something happens to the dollar, then 1 bitcoin = that many more times the dollar.... 
if 1 bitcoin = 500$ = 500 loafs of bread
then if 500 loafs of bread = 5,000,000$ after a crash, then 1 bitcoin = 5,000,000$...
bitcoin doesn't become stronger nor weaker as long as we focus on fiat. only heavy adoption and scarcity of bitcoin will make it's value rise.

let me tell you about the problems of bitcoin and pc.
i have my coins in a separate laptop. so i turned it on to buy a trezor but bitcoin core wouldn't sync after. tried many things even copying full blockchain from another computer. never synced.
so i downloaded multibit hoping I could use the same wallet file on it, but multibit needed java. so I download java, but it doesn't instal. so i get the standalone version and then I install but it won't import the wallet file.
fuck this, i'm done for this year. I've got like 10 coins on there and I can't access them because bitcoin core is a piece of shit that doesn't sync in the background.
all this fucking talk about seed passwords doesn't make me feel safe at all. i don't get to chose my words, fuck that. bitcoin isn't ready for prime time if a person like myself with 15 years of windows experience can't get it to fucking work correctly every fucking time. too many issues, too many risks, too many "choices", all of them less than ideal and very complicated.

Sorry but if a bitcoin companies' whole point is to "fuck up" and steal your bitcoin, then they are not "suffering and dying". They have won.

well, I see no reason why all bitcoin companies shouldn't run away with your money.
they'll just start another company using their friend's cousin as ceo and run things from behind the scenes.
reputation is worthless in this kind of business, and whether you like it or not, everytime another scam happens, there'll be less and less of a chance bitcoin survives.
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:59:46
people who have bitcoin mostly bought it through exchanges, so already have a somewhat trusting relationship, and there are exchanges that pay out fast.
you couldn't pay out huge amounts fast either, certainly not better than an exchange because as soon as you're moving big money, bam, you're like a bank and need to comply with regulations. so your market would be people with small amounts.
is anyone really looking to cash out 50$ of btc fast? and pay a fee on top?
imo no.

i just started reading about this, so don't take anything I say as fact, but it seems to me that BU supporters want bitcoin to be more flexible and not centralized, while CORE is the opposite.
the slow transactions should of killed bitcoin in my opinion, because it was sold as internet money, not internet gold. we know the gold market is a scam, so should we trust an internet gold market? luckily, we're still here, but for how much longer?
who is right? doesn't matter, the clever one will win so start mitigating risk now.
miners are taking control. i don't know if it's good, but it's happening.
as a holder, all I care about is the value of my coins, and apparently the miners too.

@_date: 2017-03-24 17:19:01
true, but ETH doesn't fit that category.
most of us selling btc, are buying A LITTLE of ETH. and just waiting for the fallout on btc.
anything but a compromise that includes the miners will hurt btc price for a year at least like mount gox.

@_date: 2017-03-20 00:38:27
title of post "So, Core wants us to trust miners not to steal Segwit's anyone-can-spends, but will not let them have a say on block size. Weird."
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:30:03
thank you, initially I thought BU was better, but then I read more arguments, and now believe BU is potentially dangerous, no reason to to rock the boat right now (even with slow transactions) with something unproven/unpredictable.
yet, I am also as fearful of segwit. over at btc, there is a fear over segwit. someone should address that here and there!
@_date: 2014-05-31 21:57:28
the only message you should spread is that bitcoin is undervalued at the moment. when people learn it was available for dollars, they think they missed the boat and don't want to be a part of it now even as the price keeps going up, because they don't know what the roof is. it could be there already, it could be overvalued, they don't know.
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:38:47
I get uncomfortable as soon as gold is mentioned because to me gold will always be a scam.

contributing to the core project and contributing to bitcoin directly are two very different things.
a popular idea might not be liked by core, so that contribution would get nowhere. 
hence, the importance in flexibility in the code (which might have it's own dangers),
am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:23:51
i have read r/bitcoin and r/btc throughout this all, and both sides move goals and lie when convenient. makes me lose faith in the bitcoin community. makes bitcoin (and crypto) seem like a scam.
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:15:16
exactly, and my opinion is that even after that, whoever survives will stay low (price) for a while before confidence comes back up (which happens when people FORGET WHAT HAPPENED LOL).
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:33:42
please explain, BU says it makes the security code seperate from the other options like segwit or size increase. meaning a more flexible code, more options, better competition, more innovations. core is strict about them being the only devs, and that's limiting progress.

so that should not be a chinese miner's currency. the chinese goverment could take over jihan's operations, if it hasn't already, at any time.
chinese investors should flee bch? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:16:08
here's why bch won't surpass btc in my opinion. mainstreamers don't know about it, and it took them so long to learn about btc.
if suddenly btc took a dive, the majority of them, I believe, would simply never take a second look at crypto again. and none of us wants that.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:40:13
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:31:07
HODL, btc will survive, all the noise are distractions to separate your from your money. they will keep getting more convoluted and "dire" since the old tricks won't work anymore.
if btc dies, mainstream confidence in crypto dies. that's why it won't happen anytime soon. not until mass adoption, not until governments start laying their own coins. once trusted big governments lay their coins, btc will lost their advantage, because that's just how most people with money will think, they care about imagined confidence, not facts or experience.
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:59:03

as long as you're buying bitcoin with fiat and cashing out with fiat, it's still part of the fiat system. once the rich have most bitcoins and the corporations have the most miners, what will be left? a manipulated fiat dependent asset.

ok me and my bitcoins will sit still in paper.  you see,  the existence of safer hardware wallets has some of us questioning the safety of all other wallets.  therefore unless we get a hardware wallet,  we won't participate in the bitcoin economy further than buying once and holding safely in paper wallets.  moving my bitcoins from the exchange to a secure laptop and then to paper wallets was a stressful experience.  I wo the repeat it regularly for purchases.
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:09:32
yes. although most cultists here will tell you otherwise. they mean well, but I will take truth over passion every time.
things aren't priced in bitcoin, they're priced in fiat. if the government asks banks to stop dealing with bitcoin, then it's over before we get to where things are also priced in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:24:45
therefore the safe bet is to hold.

@_date: 2017-11-03 14:20:54

biggest holder doesn't mean they hold so much that every country won't mind changing systems. there are a lot of more important advantages to fiat for the ruling class that they wouldn't abandon it that easy. taking china's reserves could be easy by war and other measures where the ruling class still wins out.

nothing wrong with hedging. it's really anyone's guess as to what could happen.
bch should of been dead, but it isn't. is there going to be a seesaw in value between the two coins? who gains from that? the "elite" from both sides that tell us what we should think (when to buy or sell by creating fear).

anyone who buys precious metals on paper is screwed as well.  those are times when legitimate businesses turn into scammers and get away with it.

unless you have instant processing, it's worthless for small business.
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:44:35
i disagree.
bitcoin is a purely speculative device (right now). it's not practical for every day applications. to complicated to acquire, use and secure.
the japan thing is nothing more than making japan attractive to bitcoin tourism.
btc nor any other crypto will be ready for mass adoption in the coming years.

what is it about white males and surveys? why are they so attracted by it?
can I put a survey in a bear trap and catch me some white males?

no regulation prevents crypto exchanges from putting fake buys sells correct?

do not sell crypto at a loss. that's the only lesson to be had since 7 years ago. HOLD, buy on crashes, and HOLD. but keep ears on the news. some coins do DIE.

you said crowdfunded ownership. we already have the ability to invest without btc.
I am talking about crowdfunded ownership problems.

investing in bitcoin is the highest form of risk possible. rewards can be great too, but the truth is no one can tell what's going to happen. governments can ban the holding of bitcoin or tax it to high heavens, net neutrality could affect the network, a fatal flaw could be found or introduced, etc...
one thing I'm 100% certain is, powerful governments won't allow bitcoin to overshadow their currency forever.
buy low, sell high
people around here pretend to "believe" in bitcoin, but most of them just want to profit (turn bitcoin into fiat).
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:27:11
if you think bitcoin is dead, sell
if you think bitcoin is in some growing pains and price manipulation to shake of weak hands as it always has since inception, then hold
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:17:44
these markets analysis always suggest buy or hold. yet, bitcoin does also go down.
I expect it to go down, way down, and then get back up, like it always does.
I would bet all my money on the whales that play with bitcoin than any actual world financial event.

you only have the illusion of freedom under extremist governments. right-wing governments are extremists.
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:41:48
but if crypto was more popular, they wouldn't need to launder? they'd keep their ill-gained wealth in crypto? how is that better?

bitcoin hasn't killed anything yet.

not if they are sexists and racists. not in the least.

if bitcoin becomes a right-wing currency, then it is already dead.

it's pretty much what peterson does.

the numbers I saw said otherwise, doesn't matter, why limit the other side to just two then, add a the third most popular and it's beaten.
plus retired people watch more news. of course older people will more likely be conservative.

this is why a major goverment instituted cyrpto would easily take the lead.
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:59:42
what's happening right now is bitcoin is being concentrated in the hands of the few elite. that's what a right-wing economy looks like.

they will make being off grid illegal by fabricating scenarios of depraved off grid criminals. you cannot escape, you must fight. until most of us realize that, we have no hope.

i disagree on every point, but since you seem to post without fact checking, i'm not going to bother with this any longer.
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:13:57
i'm saying stop posting right winger names in here. bitcoin doesn't need to be associated with garbage.

perhaps the exchanges know how much of which people have, and don't want a run on the bank so to speak
