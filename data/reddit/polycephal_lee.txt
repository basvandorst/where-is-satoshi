So it is completely ridiculous to think the most powerful political structure in human history would kill a man to retain it's power, but more believable that "the Russians" are trying to manipulate American elections by educating the American people with true facts? Give me a break.
Even if it was Russian interference, it's interference that I want, because it makes me a more knowledgeable voter. I don't care who the source was, I care that the source spread truth. Regardless of who the leaker was, it's a sad commentary on the state of politics in America that we have to rely on clandestine actors for truth.

I mean, the data that was released was true. I don't care who released it, I care about its veracity. 
But everywhere now you see the media repeating trite stories of scary Russians, and no discussion on the content of the leak. It's not a grand conspiracy theory, it's a complicated system of incentives. The Clinton Machine has steered the media before and practiced quid pro quo for people like DWS breaking the rules to help the Clinton Machine. That's what the leak was about. Now we see the media all aligned on the Russian spin, and no talk about the content of the leak. It's classic misdirection, and it benefits Clinton immensely.
I don't believe it's the Russians because I don't see any reason to. I have seen 0 evidence that points to Russia over say China or Bangladesh or the Isle of Man. The words of the national security state apparatus experts don't mean anything to me, they are in the business of collecting and disseminating truths and lies both, for the explicit benefit of their employers. They have no duty to the truth, only to narratives which help them achieve their goals.

So you would rather have a poor user trust a LN node operator than a bitcoin node operator? I don't see how everyone running their own bitcoin node but having to use LN to transact is going to happen. If you want everyone to run their own node, then the ability to transact on-chain must be democratized. If you want to attract users who don't run their own nodes, it's better for them to trust the inherent bitcoin protocol rather than a secondary layer.
Miners would not heavily centralize simply because larger blocks are possible. You would need a solution like [head-first mining]( to eliminate attacks that generate deliberately long-to-verify blocks, but that solution exists. That solution eliminates the head start due to validation time and transmission time. This is not a solution just for 2MB blocks, it can improve the network today by making a better alternative to SPV mining.
I don't see how to accomplish LN without a sidechain peg. You can call it "locking funds" and keep calling all your tokens bitcoin, but it behaves the same as if there's an intermediate token that's temporarily not bitcoin, that's pegged by individual parties ad-hoc. (Also I am not hopeful for LN, its failure mode of delayed payment = no payment is unfit for bitcoin.)

I don't think this is true. It does slightly increase the cost of running a node, but nodes are altruistic anyway. And mining is subsidized. The slight increase in cost may prevent fully distributed nodes and mining, but still keeps mining and nodes decentralized. Not everyone needs to run bitcoin for it to be decentralized.
And looking at this cockamamie LN plan, restricting on-chain access to those with lots of bitcoin (LN fees earned are proportional to stake) is a much bigger form of centralization. It is a paradigm of the rich getting richer, which will further centralize these sidechains, and is a much bigger risk than asking already subsidized miners to pick up a tiny bit more cost.
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:52:00
I don't see any evidence there, I see lots of speculation by a firm whose specialty is state contracts and state actors. Of course they're going to think it's state actors.
I also maintain that regardless of if ze ruskies did breach the DNC, there's no evidence that they were the leaker. Multiple parties could have breached the servers, but personally my money is on an [inside whistleblower](

Also, I'm upset that everyone glosses over the simple fact that the DNC can't possibly know how many intrusions there were, so even if they had incontrovertible evidence that the Russians did get in, it doesn't mean that they were the ones who leaked it.

This is incorrect. A moral hazard or conflict of interest can exist without the agent in question actually doing immoral things. The fact that incentives pull them 2 different directions is all that is required. That is eminently the case for Blockstream devs.
The argument is not that the conflict of interest has harmed bitcoin - the argument is that the conflict of interest may influence development towards for-profit goals rather than the lofty functional goals most bitcoin users have. This remains a threat as long as the incentive structure remains - new people can be hired into that structure, existing devs can be lured from their principles by the money.

Nodes operate altruistically, at a loss. There is no incentive to run a full validating node other than ideological altruism. It is not market forces that govern how many full nodes there are, and as such, the argument that "2MB blocks make full nodes more expensive and thus eliminates decentralization" falls on its face.
The same is true for the argument of mining centralization. As mining validation costs increase from 2MB, that slight increase in cost is more than made up for by the mining subsidy. Market forces are not governing mining completely right now, because miners are prevented from making blocks as large as they'd like. A free market would let miners decide how to make blocks based on their own economic calculations of costs and revenue, and would find a healthy equilibrium in the case of no subsidy. It is not rational to artificially establish a floor on fees, but especially not rational in the paradigm where the subsidy is vastly larger than the fees.
LN is a sidechain, so I don't see a jump there.
@_date: 2016-08-30 00:25:27
That's why I'm not so inflammatory. Bitcoin won't die from small blocks. Miners will eventually realize they can make more money by making bigger blocks and that will be that.
But it is simultaneously very sad to see efforts to control the conversation rather than let the best implementation rise to the top in an environment of free speech. I'll continue to fight for the openness of this forum, it used to be great, and is still the biggest.

b) don't censor for awhile? It's not hard, it's basically a zero step process. Don't do the thing that you're doing now. Then if backlash grows larger than it is currently, maybe switch back to a). 
It doesn't seem like a difficult decision to me, the only reason a) is preferred at the moment is because of the paternal "we know what's best for you" attitude. Which seems like it's a cover for the "we want to make money with off-chain layers by keeping bitcoin crippled" attitude.

So we do have a rather large disagreement. I don't think the most constructive way forward is to wait for ideological consensus and only then allow discussion for implementations. That is exactly backwards. What is best for bitcoin is for many implementations to exist, be tried, and tested. Progress is anarchic, and we don't want to miss a good idea. The exact beauty of bitcoin is that it provides an economic incentive mechanism to achieve implementation consensus without ideological consensus. An implementation existing and being talked about is no threat to achieving consensus inside the protocol. We've never had and never will have ideological consensus, but we have 100% consensus on "what happened in the blockchain." Bitcoin is not married to the idea of ideological consensus (or ideological fascism as it has become), it is only married to the idea of protocol consensus.
The entire beauty of bitcoin is that it turns ideological strife into consensus implementation. It thrives when there is minimized ideological consensus - more variety in ideas. The rules of bitcoin should be "make all the implementations you can think of, publicize them, and see if anyone else thinks they're good too. If they are, everyone switches", not "this one implementation is king, whatever it decides is law."


Non-consensus implementations (ie potential improvements) need to be able to be promoted. End of story. If that doesn't happen, we have implementation tyranny in bitcoin, where core is the dictator. has redefined "protocol consensus" to mean "ideological consensus among core developers." Core developers aren't the only people in the world who use or write bitcoin, and they aren't god. Is bitcoin supposed to be a platform for a privileged few to make decisions and changes from the top down because they know what's best for us, or is it supposed to be a platform that's open-source, where anyone can float any idea? Stomping out discussion of ideas reeks of fear and Twentieth Century thinking.
On to BIP101. "Descend to centralization" is a risk with maintaining small block sizes as well. Small blocks incentivize off-chain services which are centralized by their nature. This is arguably the motive force behind this entire fiasco, the blockstream desire to keep the blockchain crippled so they can charge access to their side chain.
I understand why you feel like the community is abusive. It is exactly the case that nothing you do is good enough from our perspective, because "good enough" is leaving. Anything short of that is not enough. As good as you may be, he can override you, and has been shown to be a destructive force for bitcoin discussion.
@_date: 2015-06-29 08:26:24
Additionally, it's not just about restriction of payment, it's about sound money. The reason Greece default is such a large issue is because the money supply of the Euro is over 90% debt at the moment. That is unsound money. In the case of widespread default it means 90% of your money vanishes. This is much more serious than not being able to send some money out of the country.
Capital controls are about keeping money in the fractional reserve system to prevent it from breaking. But when you have to forcibly keep capital in the system, it's already broken.

cool story bro, thanks for coming to our sub
we're here because there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin, and thus hyperinflation should never happen. capital should never fly from bitcoin, it should always be the place capital is fleeing *to*. simply because it's more universally scarce than any other asset that has ever existed in the universe. throughout history the money that always wins a currency war is the one which is harder to make. it's impossible to make more than 21 million bitcoin, so it seems pretty likely to me it will defeat all fiats which inflate geometrically, and can be created for free.

right, but they're a crap store of value because human beings can make more of them, they aren't scarce. commodity money needs a number of properties to become valuable: scarcity, saleability, fungibility, recognizability, transportability, and divisibility. bitcoin would be like beanie babies, if more beanie babies couldn't be made, if they were weightless, if they were all identical, if you could send them through the internet, if you could recognize a counterfeit instantly, and if you could divide them in a million pieces and recombine them trivially.
bitcoin is not about payments, it's about a monetary network that no one can fuck with, that is strictly limited in supply, and this provides an unprecedentedly good store of value. 


me, dumb gullible idiot: I like bitcoin as a tool to store value
you, brain genius: if something isn't performing the unit of account function then it's worthless as a savings instrument
there are 4 stages of commodity money: first as collectible (bitcoin pre-2010, when it was $0), 2nd as store of value (we are here now), 3rd as medium of exchange (probably years away), and finally as unit of account (decades away).

Marx was obsessed with class, specifically the division between a capitalist and a laborer. "People who work" are the opposite of a capitalist. A capitalist is someone who deploys abstract ownership of something to extract value from the people who work. If you want to see the razor Marx uses to make this distinction, look into the difference between the [MCM and CMC]( cycles.

You're totally correct, but this system isn't stable. Under capitalism, any profit maker immediately tries to wall off any competition, and one of the methods is using the state. This is how the private FED came into existence in the first place under capitalism.
In practice capitalism always ends up encouraging accumulation, because those that accumulate get stronger, and those that refuse to or can't accumulate die off. This force is what leads to monopolies, regulatory capture (like you're talking about), and even fascism sometimes.
The best we can do against capital accumulative interests is to make tools that can't be denatured or cheated, no matter how asymmetric the accumulation gets. This is why bitcoin excites me so much.
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:17:44
It hasn't caused widespread price inflation yet, what it has done is kept certain asset prices inflated. The FED owns 20% of the mortgage backed security market ([$1.7T]( which means house prices are re-inflated back to their nice and healthy 2007 levels.
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:08:20
Yep. There's no "intrinsic value," rather "value" is more like a verb than a noun. It means someone values it. It's relational, not fundamental.
What  should read is that "it's costly to produce, which is why we don't use paper." 
Each Bitcoin costs an amount of work needed to compute the block in which it was generated. This is akin to mining gold or silver - it's a costly action, which gives the products value. Same with cowrie shells or any early currency, they were as valuable as they were difficult to get.

I did, but I'll spell it out again for the old men with lead brain in the back. Fiat inflates geometrically, your share of the total continually declines because new tokens are made. Bitcoin is hard capped at 21M, so when you buy 1 token, you have 1/21 millionth of the network, forever, regardless of how big the network gets. There is no supply response in bitcoin, no matter how high the price gets. This means it can outcompete every other asset as a store of value - it has the most scarcity of any asset known to man, it is the hardest asset to obtain. 
Simply think about the interaction of any 2 monies over history, say beads vs gold as an example. Beads can be manufactured easily compared to gold, so people who traded away gold for beads lost a ton of value, and eventually everyone became convinced beads were worthless as money. This is the same dynamic with bitcoin and fiat, except USD is even easier to make than beads, and bitcoin is even harder to make than gold.


The currency war is between all fiats. Bitcoin can't join the war because there is no one in control who can devalue it through changes to monetary policy. That's why it will win while all other currencies competitively devalue in a race to the bottom.


You don't have to leave, just wanted you to know of a safe space for you where your terrified mewling might be more appreciated.

I would consider myself more of an anarchist than a communist. I don't want a very strong state, I want a minarchist control over things that really need central control, like tragedy of the commons situations or nukes. Large organizations (both states and corps) have a tendency to start caring more about their own reproduction than the purpose they were originally created for and as such should be minimized as much as possible.
That being said, most anarchists consdier anarcho-capitalism something of a contradiction. "Capitalism" implies a state recognized legal fiction of businesses that structure labor in a hierarchical way where employees must obey employers. When you incorporate a business, you are incorporating *inside a state*. A free association of people producing value doesn't need to be incorporated in a state, and imo it shouldn't be run like a capitalist enterprise, where the person who provides the capital gets to control all of the surplus value. Market forces != capitalism
Maybe I'm market-minarchist, or market-anarchist, or anarcho-syndicalist, the taxonomies are endless. Regardless of the labels, we can both see terrible structural relationships of our current system that lead to cheating and oppression, and we have a way out of that diseased money system now!

This felt like a hub of innovation today. It was not huge, at less than 500 people probably. I met multiple people who drove or flew more than 6 hours to be there, all of them already employed, just looking for a better or more interesting job. 
I got to speak to some of the key people of BitPay, Kraken, Circle, Blockchain.info, Sean's Outpost, and about 30 other newer companies. They were looking for many types of roles from marketing to developers, with front end developer probably being the most common. It's not an esoteric cryptography job market anymore, it's starting to look a lot like a standard Silicon Valley job market.

This is a great paper that details some of the ways in which Bitcoin is revolutionary.
It's of worth to note that the author wrote this before a decentralized trusted ledger became possible, a private cash that can be trusted without having to trust any one entity or issuer. Because of this, he underestimates the validity of the scenario where "cyberspace could obtain sovereignty as far as currency is concerned. Cyberspace could obtain monetary independence with respect to money". His conclusion of cyber nation states is less probable if there is no cybercurrency issuer.
All in all, I like the ideas, and the language used to describe the internet in 1996.

The only "too expensive" scenario is the one where users would need to transmit less value than is possible with the protocol. Let's say that's $0.01. The smallest current unit is a satoshi, right now a satoshi is $0.000006. For it to be too expensive, the price per bitcoin would have to increase by 156,490%, to $1,000,000 per coin.
And if that happens, the protocol can be changed to be more divisible.
Things that work on the network effect don't compete very well, there is usually one clear frontrunner and then other niche services. Telephones, TCP/IP, SMTP, languages, etc all behave like this. A lot of alts like namecoin and ethereum will fill good niches and be valuable, but not to the extent that they overtake Bitcoin.

To say that "Bitcoin has no intrinsic value" is daft though. As much as anything else has "intrinsic" value, Bitcoin as a novel elegant solution to the Byzantine Generals problem has significant value. That solution enables trusted decentralized networks through the use of cryptographic proof of work, which in turn enables digital scarcity.

That point makes sense.
But it also makes sense to determine the legality of something based on the amount of benefits it provides compared to the amount of harm it causes. This is what legality battles are usually about, from gun control, to abortion, to invading other countries, etc.
In Bitcoin's case, neither the benefits nor harm are known, it's a disruptive technology. The few known cases of illicit use are high profile and enough to cause a large sentiment against Bitcoin. The comparison to dollars is to show that we've defined an acceptable level of use of dollars as law-circumventing because it's convenient to do so. That same logic applies to Bitcoin - a few illicit drug trades are an acceptable cost in order to realize the benefits of Bitcoin.
What needs to happen is more high profile cases of Bitcoin being used to help people. The benefits need to be more obvious. *I* know that there's significant benefits, but laymen do not.

There's no need to be angry. Google intrinsic value. First of all, the first result is for the stanford encyclopedia of **philosophy**, one of my favorite resources for philosophy. 
What you're describing (which I disagree with) is this: 
There is also a financial definition: 
And there is also numismatic value: 
Even in the first definition, people use "the costs involved in that process [of creation], as a measure of the item's intrinsic value." Mining Bitcoins is a multimillion dollar industry currently, which would make them have "intrinsic value" even by your definition.
As far as correct terms go, you should perhaps contemplate using "use value" instead of intrinsic, since that is closer to what you are espousing than any definition of intrinsic I can find. And in terms of "use value," Bitcoin's is tremendous.
Also, I'm not making up that definition of "value", here's the word for word definition: "the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something."

Plagiarized from Wikipedia:  


Bitcoin is involved with Ponzi schemes in that it prevents them. It is a collection of math and computer science that prevents lying in financial situations. Anyone on the network can transparently see the entire operation of the network. The concepts of operators, profits, and returns are all different within Bitcoin. Operators are simply people who elect to solve some math problems for the network. Profits are simply new tokens that get created by the protocol, not tokens coerced from other users. Returns are non-existent; there is no expectation of additional BTC tokens when a user acquires some.
In conclusion miss teacher lady, Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme in the same way that email is a Ponzi scheme: it's not. It's just a series of mathematical operations, a technology, a tool.
Alternatively, just retitle the paper to talk about "blockchains" or "Distributed Multi-Party Membership Systems".

I do not think intrinsic value exists. Value is a human judgement like I said, which changes based on the environment, and is thus conditional and subjective, not intrinsic and objective.
In a world with instant free teleportation, cars do not have value any more as transportation vehicles. Their value was not intrinsic, it was based on a subjective need of humans.
In a world where a company loses control of all its assets, the shares of a company no longer have value.
In a world where iron is an obsolete metal, completely surpassed in efficiency, cost, strength, scarcity, etc, iron no longer has value.
It's all relative, none of it is intrinsic to the thing in and of itself.


Value can not be independent of what people think it's worth, value is the word for "what people think its worth."

On this we agree. Unfortunately it already takes too many resources to mine (but this was predicted, and acceptable as long as complete cartelization is avoided), and first-world level resources to run a full node. But right now almost anyone can transact as long as they have internet. I would like that access to continue for as long as possible. If that means moving the accessibility of mining from &lt;1% of humans to &lt;0.1% of humans, it does not seem catastrophic. If it means moving the accessibility of running a full node from 20% of humans to 10% of humans, that also does not seem catastrophic. But if it means transactions cost moving from $0.01, that seems like a much bigger deal. Not only does it restrict the fraction of people who can directly access the blockchain, *it increase friction in the bitcoin economy*. And it's also a bigger unknown: how a fee market will develop is a much bigger open question than how many resources it takes to mine/run a full node at a larger capacity.
Honestly the best case scenario seems to be to do nothing and let a fee market develop, then see what happens as an experiment before implement something like BIP 101 or any similar increase to redemocratize the ability to conduct transactions. We're going to run into a fee market eventually, but it doesn't have to be now, mining is really heavily subsidized. Fees will have to rise to be competitive with the subsidy, and that looks awful when the yearly subsidy is this large a percentage of the bitcoin supply.
I'll talk about Lightning Network when it exists.

Bitcoin is simply the agreement of all parties. The protocol is not set in stone, and was designed to morph into whatever the majority wants it to be. It is a protocol designed to reach consensus from discord. More discord means more strength for bitcoin, it means a wider pool of ideas to pull from. Bitcoin should eat all of the best ideas, not be surpassed by an altcoin that has a better protocol. And that is exactly what will happen if bitcoin-core hijacks bitcoin and prevents it from evolving.
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:57:15
Yeah. People talk about how governments can't shut down transactions because you can't shut down information. In the same way, drama and politics can't shut down writing new code. It may slow or accelerate it, but code can come from anywhere. If the new code is better, more people will want to switch sooner. If people have big problems with the code, value flees and pressure is higher to make the code better. It does not matter who the author is, it only matters that the code does what people want.
This is how bitcoin is supposed to work.

Framing XT as only adding centralization risks is much less than honest.
At worst, it slightly centralizes mining/full nodes due to increased costs. At best, it removes a giant incentive for centralization, namely the limit on on-chain transactions.
Mining and full nodes are not the only things that can become less distributed - on chain transactions can become more centralized too. Increasing the block size limit is a way to avoid transaction centralization, to keep on-chain transactions available to everyone. Arguably, democratization of transaction is much more important than slight speed advantages of miners or slight increases to costs for full nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:08:51
Yeah a majority fork is by definition not a hijack. This is why it was insane to brand XT as an altcoin back in 2015 - it required 75% threshold.

3 charts that show US tectonics moving towards a massive earthquake:
- [Velocity of money]( is decreasing from its peak in 1997, decreasing even through the 2008 bubble and the "recovery". This is an important measure of economic activity / size of money supply.
- [Labor Force Participation Rate]( is also cratering. This measure is more important than unemployment because it shows how many earners there are relative to the total population - the total population consumes what the earners produce. With fewer earners, they must earn more to maintain a larger ratio of "dependents."
- But [Median Wages]( are unchanged since 2001.
When you put these 3 together, you see fewer and fewer people earning less and less money, buying fewer and fewer things. Only by defining economic activity by total GDP can the establishment call this anything but a depression. It may not be a depression on balance sheets of multinationals, but it is in savings and deposit accounts of working people.
These are all extremely large, long term tectonic effects of economic gears grinding to a halt. At some point people will have to reduce their standard of living (ie now) and will start getting angry, looking for alternatives to the current establishment.

No range of individuals can speak for "everyone that uses bitcoin" except for everyone that uses bitcoin. We'll vote with our coins and our nodes for the implementation we want, and there's nothing you can do to stop us. It is how bitcoin works. You cannot hold the protocol back from becoming what people want it to be.
Controlling the conversation is an underhanded way to prevent attractive rule changes from happening. Let the ideas combat each other in an arena of free speech and let the victor be decided by the users. Top-down control of money has failed many times before, let's try bottom-up instead. That is what bitcoin is about - getting away from robed oracles dictating the truth to the masses, and letting the masses create their own tool.

There has already been a fork removing the 21 million limit, and it was not adopted by the economic majority because it is a critical rule. But if the majority did remove the 21 million limit, I would use the fork that still retained the 21 million limit because I know those tokens have more long term economic value. The majority of value storage would eventually move back to the strictly limited fork and it would become longer.
You misunderstand - the 21 million limit is not enforced because some god on high says "thou shall not change this part of the protocol, it is consensus-critical" and it is not enforced by preventing code from being written or talked about. It is enforced because it is better for the people using bitcoin, and it is enforced by the people using bitcoin. That is how all rules of bitcoin should work - the rules of bitcoin should change to be whatever is best for everyone that uses bitcoin.

You can't prevent a contentious hard fork long term. And I don't think hard forks should be feared. They give holders the option of selling one fork for the other, and miners will follow. This is a good thing, it means that bitcoin will never sacrifice evolution for stability or order. 
And I'm okay with forking now, I would rather have the growing pains up front. Any potential ETFs should not be under the impression that no one will fork bitcoin. It's almost certain that it will be minority and majority forked in the future. And that's a good thing, it's the trauma of evolution.

Come out from under the blanket. Realize that the community overwhelmingly supports different implementations, and that this makes bitcoin stronger, not weaker.

There's some sound academic treatment of the bitcoin network by Emin Gun Sirer, who is simulating the whole network right now. Here's his paper on Selfish Mining 
I see a lot of danger in trying to route around miners. Miners are integral to the balance of the incentive mechanism and security of the network. Soft Fork already tries to route around dissenting hodlers, and now there's talk of ignoring what miners want too? 
Personally I think the incentives of mining are fine, and when miners realize they can claim 20btc that is just sitting in mempool, that will be pressure on them to upgrade.

But the change that you mention would make me value that token at 0, so I would sell all those tokens and buy the old minority fork, which would cause its price to rise, which would cause miners to move from mining the broken chain to mining the old chain.
This is why I'm in favor of segwit as a hardfork. It changes the economics of transactions, and as such there should be an opportunity for hodlers to reject that change by selling the segwit fork coins and buying more of the old fork.

The soft fork does route around hodlers. Hodlers have no option to reject the economic change. The economics of the protocol change with segwit - standard transactions become more expensive, and P2SH transactions get cheaper. A hodler can not opt out of this, their non-p2sh transactions will become more expensive. Imo this is a big enough deal that hodlers should be given the option to sell the new coin and remain on the old chain, which is what a hard fork would accomplish.
Miners *are* the ecosystem. They don't get to unilaterally decide what bitcoin becomes any more than hodlers or devs. But miners and hodlers do have ratification/veto power over the devs. I agree that miners are preventing bitcoin from evolving, but that is their economic prerogative. It is up to us as users and devs, to incentivize them to upgrade.
The promise of bitcoin is that it will take people's selfish interests and align them into a sound, trustworthy ecosystem. Miners being selfish is not a problem, it's a necessity. Once the mempool has 2500 btc of fees in it, miners will be stepping over themselves to upgrade the protocol.

15 min is ridiculously long to validate all transactions, but let's run with it. So all of his blocks are long verify, but one in every 10 is invalid. If he's building his valid blocks on top of that invalid block (ie has a headstart), then he's wasting even more proof of work than just making invalid blocks. If he's making his valid blocks not on top of that invalid block, then he's merely wasted 10 min of proof of work (on avg) that he could have instead used to get a coinbase reward, in the pursuit of getting a coinbase reward sooner on the next proof of work.
It's not a rational attack, there's nothing to be gained in the long term, only temporary coinbases that will be seen to be invalid after a time. It's irrational to spend 10min of work to get 0 reward, and it's irrational to spend 10min of work to get a head start on a chance at the reward for 10min of work. Much better to just straight up do the 10min of work and get the reward validly.

The point is that the protocol is supposed to be the ownership layer. Stealing should be disallowed by the protocol. If the protocol allows it, it's not stealing.
The fact that the code allowed something that the authors didn't intend is not surprising. But a cryptocurrency should execute the code, and assign ownership based on the code. It should be indifferent to humans and their intentions, it only knows the code. The fact that "stolen" tokens can be returned by an authority is very worrying.

In my estimation, making blocks larger increases censorship resistance as transactions can get in with cheaper fees.

Head first mining solves the long verification times. I remain skeptical that network latencies are an issue for anyone in this day and age. It doesn't add to centralization at the very least, it's not like you need to be a multimillion dollar mining op to get 1MB/s down. The capital costs of ASICs dwarf the cost of a 2000s era internet connection.
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:32:22
But that's completely fine. Validate the header, start mining on top of it, meanwhile validate the transactions. If you find an invalid transaction, stop mining on top of that block, as everyone else will. The malicious miners' proof of work is then wasted as no one will accept their (invalid) fork. They only succeed at wasting their own energy.

I'm not advocating more centalization, I'm advocating for more function of the tool itself. That does mean that fewer people will be able to do *all* parts of the tool (validate+mine), but it also means that more people will be able to use the part of the tool that's useful to them (transact). Painting it as "centalization bad, hulk smash" is disingenuous. It makes some parts of bitcoin more expensive, and it makes some less expensive. That centralizes some functions, and further decentralizes other functions.
Some degree of centralization is unavoidable. To put your head in the sand and act like bitcoin is somehow magically resistant to capitalized interests is naive. The point is that it uses these capitalized interests fighting each other as its strength. You're correct, if competition is only a farce, then bitcoin is dead. It needs real competition among capitalized parties, not just the appearance of competition. But trying to use regulations like a block size limit to stifle capitalized competition is unlikely to work long term, and it misses the beauty of how bitcoin makes these self-interested capitalized parties compete against each other for the benefit of the network.

Point taken, and I agree that proceeding with caution is best. I still think the network could easily handle 10mb blocks, and an experiment at 2mb shouldn't be out of the question.

I don't see how unbounded nodes automagically results in centralization. Making people use a computer made after 2010 to validate does not add any centralization. We've already seen capital requirements balloon *exponentially* for mining and it isn't catastrophic. It has somewhat made mining less distributed, but it is still decentralized (ie there are still competing self-interested parties).
I don't see what an *incremental* increase to the cost of validating is going to change.

Organized management of resources (ie the state) is a [good solution]( to many problems like the tragedy of the commons, or neglect of externalities, or prevention of irrational loops.

There's also 6btc of fees just sitting there that miners can't claim because some central planners are preventing miners from choosing how large to make their blocks.
It's not just a problem for people who want to transact and have to deal with delays, it's also a problem for rational miners that want to make more money.
@_date: 2017-01-10 08:27:31
I don't want a state ideally, but I do want complex organization, and some things are better managed together.
An irrational loop is something like doing heroin or blowing all your money gambling. I'm not saying those things should be illegal, but there are cases when people need others to pull them out of a spiral, and any society needs to have that function. You don't necessarily need government to perform that function, but government does perform that function sometimes, and it's a good thing for those people when it happens.
Tragedy of the commons was initially coined from grazing land. Today it can be applied to overfishing and groundwater usage as well as externalities like air or water quality.
Monopoly on violence is no good, I agree. But planned resource management is sometimes useful, and I think sometimes necessary. Global warming is a huge threat, we have to find a way to sequester CO2 and manage the energy costs of doing so.

Decentralized != fully distributed
If you are looking for a network that infinitely avoids the iron law of oligarchy, you are not going to find it. Bitcoin makes the iron law of oligarchy work for it.
Mining is already in the paradigm you're talking about, and it's not catastrophic to bitcoin, because all that is necessary is selfish competition among *some* actors, not among *all* actors.
Not everyone is going to be able to fit a world sized ledger in their pocket. As long as multiple competing parties keep copies, it's fine.
But also, lets say decentralization is the goal, ask yourself about what happens when thre's not enough room on chain. People have to use off-chain, *centralized* services.

The privatization of the commons is an extremely sad thing. I'll trade you a Molyneux video for a Zizek video. 
The commons of open source are part of what attracted me to projects like bitcoin. They are free to use and view and modify. I want a poor child anywhere on the planet to be able to use Linux to learn whatever he wants on the similarly free Wikipedia. I don't want him to have to pay licensing fees to get into each successive layer of walled gardens. Commons are an extremely powerful thing, and I think they are measure of the success of a society.

inflation is bad for the value storage aspect of money. necessarily.
artificial spend pressure does speed up an economy, but that is irrelevant. we are not here for a money that makes the economy go even faster, we are here for a money that can't be diluted. a money that can't be counterfeited conveniently when there is a recession. that's the interesting thing about bitcoin, the aspect that it outcompetes every other asset at.
bitcoin is the opposite sort of pressure on an economy. inflation pressures one to spend immediately, because the value of their money is evaporating. people buy whatever, just to avoid losing value. on the other hand, deflation pressures one to save, to only spend when they really have to or find something really great. an artificial spend pressure on an economy will make it go faster but an artificial saving pressure on an economy will make it build better things.

The part that isn't "citizen run" (you're right, I shouldn't have said federal), is the part where a 6% dividend gets paid to the shareholders of a privately owned institution. The faces that represent the institution are not the puppet masters, it's the ones with the money, the vested interest of the shareholders and member banks of the FED. Because of this I think it's more right to focus on the fact that the money creation is privately owned, rather than the public face. Unfortunately we don't even know who owns it, and so we don't have the owner equivalent of Janet Yellen or whoever to shift focus to.

Anarcho capitalism is a contradiction. Anarchism is rejection of hierarchies, and capitalism is economy organized explicitly around employer-employee hierarchy.
We need anarchism in our fundamental protocols, but we can do without the hierarchical power structures and asymmetries of employees obeying employers. Markets aren't equivalent to capitalism, we had markets for thousands of years before capitalism.
The first step in establishing a market is disallowing theft, and if you develop an organization to disallow theft, you've created a government. Markets cannot exist without enforcement of rules.

Centralized factories and distribution from hubs will be around for a while longer, that's true. But I envision a future where means of production are used by people and not owned by anyone. Andreas's self-owning car would accept payments from riders, and gradually run down. Mechanics would be able to fix the car and be rewarded accurately for their labor, and no owner needs to enter the picture. You don't need the role of a capitalist, sitting there taking a slice simply because he owns the car.
And bitcoin takes the means of production of money itself out of the hands of pure capital. In the old financial system, you can make money simply by having money, the rules would bend with very little work if you had money. In bitcoin, you have to actually *spend* energy to make money, merely *having* energy or money is not enough.

It's not about regulations, it's about redistributing wealth. If you leave capitalism alone and don't allow workers to effectively organize, it's going to starve itself; when the few have all the money, they can't make any money from the rest of the people.
I didn't say anything about regulation, it's more about having laws that redistribute wealth to keep the engine running. It's an upwards waterfall fountain, you have to keep refilling the bottom for it to flow upwards.
@_date: 2015-04-29 02:59:50
This shouldn't be very hard to understand, but it's taken awhile for this sort of rhetoric to become mainstream. 2008 did nothing to deleverage the economy. Instead, extra leverage was created by creating money at the political instead of private company level. So now instead of just banks on the hook for these ridiculous amounts of credit, you also have the citizens of the anywhere that uses the Euro, US Dollar or Japanese Yen on the hook. 
It's ridiculous that this kind of policy made it through, it is such blatant capital writing laws for itself, creating more money for itself, and forcing government to hold junk assets to avoid their own losses. We are in another 1930s depression mode right now, about 80 years after the previous mass deleveraging, but this time it has been hijacked by corporate interests. 
Notice how no one is better off than in 2008 except for the top. That should tell you something. Capitalism is naturally a trickle up system, where those with capital make money from those without. It takes organization and laws to balance that effect, and those with capital have historically, purposefully set up obstacles to organization. They have purposefully donated to representatives who no longer represent. The trickle up effect is so far unbalanced that capitalism has now stalled itself by starving itself of demand.

Sure but pure capitalism also does other bad things against labor, things like shoot hundreds of workers dead for striking. Completely free capitalism means all values get sacrificed in the name of profit, including the value of human life. We don't want society to get that far, therefore we have to restrain profit seeking to a degree. 
The current abuse is policy wrought by capital in capital's interest, including the bailouts and subsequent quantitative easing. It's not as attention grabbing as striking workers being murdered, but it's still economic savagery on the people for profit. It is central to capital's nature to try to overcome any obstacle to accumulation, it is inherently a system that needs balancing before it breaks itself and the people who make it up.

@_date: 2015-09-30 22:57:40
All I'm doing is looking at history. Historically, capital has prevented the bargaining power and wealth accumulation of workers, using any means available. It is an inherent characteristic of capitalism, in that it's a system based on getting more money by paying others less. To do that you must coerce in some way, whether by clever bargaining, misinformation, intimidation, force, or manipulating laws. There is huge incentive for capitalists to marginalize laborers, which means that marginalization is an inherent part of the system.
Capital buying force to ensure its interest is also a very inherent thing to capitalism. You can't ensure private property without force. The very genesis of property and capitalism is the use of force. You contend that laborers can use force too, but government often works for the capitalists in preventing that force. The establishment of government is to protect landed gentry, even James Madison explicitly says the government should "be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority."
The history of government is the history of protecting private property using force. This is why anarcho-capitalism is contradictory.

We're using the same definition. Labor is a cost, and when you don't pay labor commensurate with the value they produced, you get profit. In fact that's the only way to get profit.


Profit = Revenue - Costs. That is true. But if Labor Cost = Value of Labor, then Profit = 0. The only way to get a positive profit is to pay a worker fewer dollars than he generated in the value of products he worked on.

Technology *can* change class structure, but it hasn't really. Wages of the lower classes have gone down in the last 40 years, despite technology explosively increasing productivity.

If you look at any source for wealth/income levels over time, you will see that it is getting more, not less concentrated.

In the absence of manipulable rules structures, it can buy force. This was done often in the early 1900s, where striking workers were regularly massacred by hired thugs.

It's hard to say since we don't have any examples of technically advanced anarchist societies.
A good exploration is done in Ursula K Leguin's novel The Dispossessed (she's been anarchist since the 60s). They train their children at a very young age to be collectivists and sharers. The novel does a good job exploring people who aren't motivated to contribute to society, and also the reemergence of hegemony within anarcho-syndicates.

I never said anything about doing away with capital. The only thing I think is wrong is that capital retains an unfair share of the surplus value generated by the workers, and has unilateral control over the deployment of those resources.

I would define the unfair element as the fact that unorganized employees are much more vulnerable to capital than capital is to any single employee (it's asymmetrically more painful for the employee if the employee quits or declines a contract). Because of this discrepancy in power in negotiations, employees are often shafted.
Unions can remedy large portions of those problems, but what you've seen since the 1980s is capital rewriting the rules of organization in its favor to marginalize unions. It's my contention that capital will always do this, because when it harms the negotiating power of its employees, it can take more of the surplus value from them. There's incentive in alienating workers from each other.

That is what I predict for bitcoin's future as well. And that is protocol agnostic. Just because they predict that doesn't mean they actively work to push it in that direction. Bitcoin itself won't be regulated, but you can be damn sure the same kind of institutions that dominate today's money will try to dominate bitcoin too. It's an asset, and it's good at storing value, of course people are going to build shit on it and with it, and corporations have far more resources to do that. That's not a conspiracy, it's just incentives and resources analysis. It's similar to what's happening with the internet, corporations largely own and distribute access to it, and now are in the process of walling more of it up through slow lanes. This is corporations' nature, and they have more resources than ever before.

Right now the politics here are to try and squelch the arguments of the user side, pretending there is no downside for anyone if we keep blocks small.

Open communication allows for a wider pool of potential to select from. The way to protect bitcoin is to expose it to danger, not to shelter it from different ideas. The more inflexible and rigid it becomes, the larger the chance that some better thing takes advantage of that vacuum.

Precisely this. If smaller is unequivocally better, then we should lower blocksize to 100kb today. Why hasn't that been proposed? Because it's insane, there is trade off between smaller and larger blocks. The argument "smaller is better" is absolutely ridiculous.

It was about Bitcoin-Core, it doesn't violate theymos' weird ideas about what bitcoin is and isn't.

To say there is mutiny is to miss the entire point of bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't have a center. Core is just a word attached to one implementation. There is no captain to mutiny against. Bitcoin thrives on discord and variety - this is the definition of antifragile. Not, "it doesn't break", but, "it gets stronger the more it is tested and experimented with". Don't fear change and experimentation, embrace them.

Also consider the other extreme, think about reducing block size to 100kb today. Would that have a centralizing risk? Absolutely, as more off-chain services would arise to process user transactions in bulk before committing them to the chain. In extremis it would reduce the access to the blockchain for users.
The question is whether you want to have gatekeepers and high fees to writing to the block chain, or slightly higher costs to mining. Since mining is subsidized heavily at the moment, it seems far more rational to push extra incremental costs there than onto end users.

The crashing the bus metaphor fails when applied to the FED. They know what they are doing, they pay a 6% dividend to private shareholders. They are not blind, and they know who can take advantage of ZIRP and QE. 
They will never acknowledge their involvement in creating this mess, probably most of them don't even understand it. They actually believe neoclassical economics, because that is the only thing taught at most prestigious schools. Completely missing is Marxian and Hayekian economics. See Richard Wolff for a great description of this. Neoclassicalism, and more narrowly, Keynesianism, are holy to universities these days, so most alumni can not even think in other terms. They've been trained to solve problems in a Neoclassical way, that is all they see. It might be a good example of Sapir-Worf in action.

What I'm concerned with ultimately is ability for regular people to transact on the blockchain. If we keep blocks small for miner validation, fee pressure will rise, and some people will be squeezed out of the ability to transact on the blockchain. 
I would love for a solution like lightning network to exist and simultaneously provide cheap access to the blockchain while keeping validation short. But it doesn't exist, and we are on the verge of access to bitcoin becoming more expensive and technically more difficult. It is also "expectingly egoist" of people in the developed world to think that anyone in the world can afford high fees.
I do want a lasting solution like lighting, but we need a stopgap measure right now. Without it we risk tarnishing the brand of bitcoin just as a new wave of adoption is hitting.

However when a bank tries this with crypto, it will be immediately noticeable. If you try to pay me in Chase Bitcoins, I won't accept them, I will only accept bitcoin that is on the real blockchain.
This is the big revolution of bitcoin, it makes the money multiplier firewalled from the money supply. So organizations are free to multiply as much as they want, but when it is inevitably found out that they are insolvent (eg mtgox) then the resulting bankrun will be firewalled off from actual blockchain bitcoins. The proprietary coins can be multiplied at whim, but only the coins on the blockchain have long term value - precisely because they can't be fucked with.

I know they don't "print" as in ink on paper, but they create money through creating credit. Loans are newly made money, and it is entirely fungible with the old money. Any money they loan out is money that they still owe to their depositors, so in net more money exists after a loan is made.
eg a bank takes $1M as deposits (which it still owes to the depositors), and then lends this money out to other people, who will pay it back eventually. At the end of that repayment, the total money that the bank controls is $1M + the loan principle + interest. More money exists inside the bank at the end of the lending process than before the loan was created. The money is created when the loan is issued, and can be destroyed before repayment if the debtor defaults.
Loans create money, that is elementary. The special privilege banks have is that their loans are fungible with dollars, where as any IOU that I create will not be interchangeable with dollars.

Yes I'm sure Basel 3 will prevent armageddon forever lol. You've gone full kool-aid 
You can blast me with Keynesianism academics all day, the fact is that it created the biggest financial crisis since 1929. I understand the motives behind ZIRP and QE, and I understand how they encourage spending. The problem with them is that they steal from the future and are deployed supply side, which is why I say "pushing on a rope." We need these inflationary measures deployed on the demand side, since it's wages that are the current deficiency in the economy. Why not offer ZIRP to home owners / student debtors? And how is QE to the people impossible? Simply give everyone an extra one-time tax refund.


The big difference here is that those people would no longer be saddled with debt/rents, and so they'd be able to exercise demand in the economy. When assets get inflated via QE it does nothing for the demand side.

Also I want a tool that is a programmable bearer instrument that can be sent through the internet.
I understand that deflationary currency sucks for an economy focused at growth at all costs, but it's great for an individual focused on saving at all costs. Spending incentive is removed, and saving incentive is introduced, and so products must be made that much better to get people to part with their money. Yes maybe that's worse for the economy, but you're not talking to the economy, you're talking to an individual, and I play this game for myself, not for the game.

Bitcoin is an alternative money that is backed by computers performing cryptography. It was created as a way for people to be able to exit national currencies and their associated inflation/bailouts/QE/etc.

Not saying that it's necessarily a bad thing. Just saying that it centralizes as much (or more imo) as large blocks do. With small blocks you are dependent on trusting gatekeepers and off-chain transactions. This will lead to centralization of transaction portals.
Neither of these centralization effects are going to kill bitcoin, they will just make it different. The question is how powerful/costly you want bitcoin to be. Personally I would like for extra power, and for the cost of that power to be distributed to miners, as all bitcoiners heavily subsidize them through the coinbase already.

Monetary policy, especially post-2008 is arguably designed in a favoritist manner also. QE was distributed to special interests, bailouts were given to special interests, and FRB/ZIRP is only available to a select amount of approved banks.

Those with more capital will always be able to make better ASICs than those without capital, and as the majority of the hashrate, they would heavily influence what code gets run. 
But complete distribution of mining power is not what is required, merely decentralization. It is a much lower threshold, achievable as long as multiple self-interested parties are competing. I think it survives ASICs and beyond, and gets more decentralized from where it is now as more deep-pockets get into it.

Credit and money are fungible. Banks can create new money as long as they can find someone willing to take on the debt.
Bitcoin brings back the distinction between money and credit. In an instant I can tell the difference from a real bitcoin on the blockchain and Chase's IOU bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:34:26
No, the money multiplier from fractional reserve banking is distinct from the spending multiplier.
When we spend money among each other we are moving all of the money, not changing the total amount of money at all. The multiplication that happens is in the spending, not in the amount of extant dollars. When banks issue credit, they are multiplying the total number of outstanding dollars that can be held at any one time.
If you borrow $10 from me directly, I straight up give you $10 and **I no longer have it**. If I deposit and you borrow $10 from a bank, they give you $10 and then still tell me that my $10 is safe and secure. There are now $20 functioning in the marketplace, $10 of which are brand new, created by the bank giving them to you. You'll eventually give them back to the bank, the bank will have $20, and still owe me $10.

@_date: 2016-07-27 03:03:48
I fully agree. And that explicit announcement by the miners is a rational market decision. The blocksize limit constrains miners, they could make more money if they could collectively decide.
Ideally you have a miner publish a block, containing some parameters about their intentions. ie: 
-I am making blocks as big as x.  
-I will not accept blocks bigger than y.  
-I will head-first mine or SPV mine on top of blocks as big as z.   
I want to see what happens with this. It seems resilient against long validation block attacks, but I don't know if how easy it is to create small valid blocks that also take a long time to validate. If it's easy and free, then it may not work. Or maybe you can head-first mine those blocks and it's ok.

Look, I don't want any of these bandaid policies. All I was saying, is that if you *are* going to do them, at least do them in a way that works. A way that gets normal people back into the economy, instead of a way that rewards the creators of the catastrophe. You're correct, bitcoin folk, especially I, don't want any of this interference shit, interfering in games makes them unplayable. If you can't predict what the market is going to be like in the future, you can't make prudent long term decisions. More than anything we just want a sound game, where if you play by the rules, you can play. And changes to those rules aren't easy, involve consensus, and can't be forced. 
I disagree that QE isn't "printing money" (literally the first line of wikipedia: "Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy in which a central bank creates new electronic money in order to buy government bonds or other financial assets to stimulate the economy"). If it wasn't unfairly influencing the economy, they wouldn't do it. The whole point of them mucking about with QE/ZIRP is to "fix" what the economy is doing "wrong," trying to stimulate more credit in an environment where we desperately need a deleveraging. If they let gambly players lose, let toxic assets die, and had a consistent interest rate it would be more sound long term. I am not going to be surprised when the next crash comes and everyone learns that more debt doesn't fix a debt crisis.

Bitcoin is subject to the interests of capital too. People can make money off of it, so people will put money into the game. Those with more money win the game more. Mining already is dominated by multi-million dollar corporations (mining revenue is about $400m annually). That is not *fully distributed.*
But it is *decentralized*. All that is necessary for decentralization is multiple competing self-interested parties. Nodes can get a little more expensive without harming the network, and mining nodes are the nodes that really matter. Even with small blocks mining has centralized a lot.
Not everyone can mine, and nothing will change that dynamic. It's highly asymmetrical, but that's okay, that's the beauty of bitcoin. Bitcoin can't prevent capital grabbing for power, but it can put certain powers out of reach, and it can make the competitive grabbing beneficial to the people being stepped on.

The network would not die immediately. Miners would decide how big to make their blocks based on the costs of including transactions and fees.

You missed the point. Merely spending money does not give rise to value.

Not necessarily true. Value as an exchange medium is one component, but there's also its ability to store value. In this way it mimics gold. No one buys anything with gold these days, yet it still has quite a high value. Bitcoin does everything gold does and more, it is better as a medium of exchange and as a store of value.

What I want to know is what Litecoin has over Bitcoin. It has a different hashing algorithm, a different amount of coins, and those seem like 2 very minor differences.
I see these altcoins like providers of liquidity for Bitcoin, mainly because Bitcoin is the only one that's tethered to sale of actual goods and services. Admittedly it's a very small tether, but it's there nonetheless.

But there is a reason we have auditors, because people do lie about income specifically for tax purposes.
Now imagine trying to do an audit of a multi billion dollar company with bitcoins. The auditor would have no way of knowing how many public keys were owned by them, and thus no way to gauge the real earnings of the company.
You could put one face on for the tax man, and another face on for the public.
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:22:12
Thanks for the answer!
The remaining question I have is: How do they know to take *you* to prison if you have many public keys which are not easily identifiable as *you*?
I'm thinking in terms of corporations trying to dodge large amounts of taxes. It seems like by using Bitcoin a corporation can be just a meaningless public key, especially if it is one that deals primarily in digital goods. How would any government find this out? It also seems possible that corporations or people can make multiple public keys that they use just for the purpose of dodging taxes.

The intrinsic value of Bitcoin is as a currency that can be traded securely, instantly, anonymously, from anywhere to anywhere, with extremely low fees, without extreme regulation (that's the be your own micro-bank part). That value is extremely high.
The second part of your last sentence is spot on though.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:11:39
Yeah but I automatically compare $5 to a cheeseburger more than I compare it to its equivalent value in Yuan. That is a qualitative difference to how we measure Bitcoin's value currently.

I think the biggest obstacle is that people have been conditioned their whole lives to think of dollars as valuable. They just don't think about the fact that it only has value because everyone agrees it has value.
To them, the value of a dollar is an immutable, unchangeable fact, that just is.

Let's see if I understand correctly. If I import my paper address to a wallet that has many addresses, when I make any transaction from my paper address then all of the funds get debited into the multiple addresses in the wallet? Seems like this wouldn't be a big problem unless you wiped your client's wallet in an effort to be secure. The BTC would still be in the client correct? They don't go to some mystery address?

You're getting really hung up on the semantics of "entrepreneurial." I don't necessarily disagree with your definition, but the spirit of taking risks and doing something that's never been done before is similar among investors and innovators. 


Why limit it to only one thing? The more functions Bitcoin is able to perform, the more valuable it is. It can function exceptionally well as both a medium of exchange and as a value store. They are not mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:34:10
I just watched you on Cspan, thank you for representing us as a knowledgeable community!
In regards to policy making, what you should understand is that the government will never be **able** to prevent Bitcoin from becoming mainstream. 
As an analogy, consider music downloading. Many laws were passed that attempted to prevent peer to peer filesharing. That has not diminished the fact that millions of people pirate music every day. The only way to win against peer to peer sharing is to provide a service that has a higher benefit/cost ratio than piracy does. You can charge money and provide extra features (eg itunes) or you can have advertisements (spotify, pandora, etc).
The government needs to show that it's worth going through some amount of governmental control when using Bitcoin. If there are benefits to spending being tracked by the US gov (eg federal guarantees) then we will voluntarily use it. If however, there are severe detriments to spending being tracked by the US gov (slower transaction times, exchange freezes, taxes) then we will simply go around whatever system the US gov puts in place. 
Personally I doubt that the government will be able to regulate Bitcoin in an elegant manner, since Bitcoin is everything it needs to be already, and any government involvement will cause significant friction. The recent NSA scandals exacerbate chances for regulation, as these scandals have undermined trust in the government, and provided impetus for becoming even more anonymous.
Thanks for your time.

So, if over half the mining power does not switch over to the new client, will the new fork be unsuccessful? (I know this is not very likely, I'm just wondering if it could theoretically happen.) I'm wondering what would happen to the economy if the miners split like 49% / 51%.
@_date: 2013-03-21 04:24:35

@_date: 2013-03-21 00:21:18
The problem I see is that as Bitcoin increases in popularity, the purchasing power of other currencies will decrease. Taken to it's extreme, Bitcoin is the only currency left. In such a case, I can not think of a single way to tax those anonymous users who are trying to avoid taxation, unless you tax the transaction itself.


How would a government be able to impose a fine like that, on an anonymous entity?


Maybe not, but my problem still stands. Bitcoin will make it easier for companies to hide all or a portion of their earnings or even be completely anonymous. I'm not saying the problem lies with Bitcoin, I'm not trying to tear down Bitcoin, I'm just wondering where we will get government funding when most businesses and transactions are anonymous.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:02:25
It is creating value. The more demand for Bitcoin, the higher the value of Bitcoin. It's an entrepreneurial risk, invest in something early before it's proven, before the mass population adopts it, and there's a big reward.

I specifically said a commodity acting as a currency, not a tool of a government declared a currency.
You're correct, in the case of fiat (literally "by decree") money, the value is because it can and must be used to settle legal debts such as taxes.
In the case of a commodity acting as a currency, like gold, silver, shells, beads, etc, it is simply a medium used to store and exchange value. No one forces it's acceptance, usually the nature of the commodity allows for it to be a good tool in keeping track of who owns how much. This is where Bitcoin (the payment network) succeeds.
Bitcoin is an extremely good commodity to be used as a store of value and medium of exchange, while being stateless. It is a reversion back to commerce before the state existed. I definitely did not mean to give the impression that it derives value in the same way fiat does, I was trying to say the opposite!

My point is that if I never convert to a centralized currency, I've never realized any gain that's measurable in dollars.
If I sell my truck for BTC, and then use the same BTC at a later value to buy a different truck, would they use the difference in conversion rates for BTC to calculate the gain? This seems inaccurate at best, and very easy to manipulate in my favor.
Ie I could move all my BTC to a different wallet when the price spikes to $900, then spend those BTC when the price is back down at $540. Using the conversion rate calculation, I would have a realized loss on that wallet (540-900=-360), independent of my actual gain/loss from other wallets. I report this loss to the IRS, but I don't tell them that I actually obtained the BTC at $250 (540-250=190). Thus I realize a gain ($190) while reporting a realized loss(-$360).

I'm still concerned by the tax issue, as a larger percentage of the economy moves into the digital space each year.

This is the key. But there's another important piece, and that is the fact that people are still measuring the value in terms of fiat. Bitcoin will only become it's own currency when people perceive it to have a value in and of itself, not just a value because it's tied to a different currency.
In my opinion this is why the bubble will pop all the way down to the $50-$60 range.

@_date: 2013-04-11 00:18:25
$50-$60 represents where the "normal" growth curve would be right now. By "normal" I mean minus this large group of recent adopters that are treating it exactly like a security instead of a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:11:36
I'd be much more concerned about profit driven entities that try and write their own transactions (or edit the protocol) through having an absurd amount of hashing power.
If an entity is buying Bitcoin to control the supply, they will only succeed in further legitimizing it. Furthermore, it would cost them dollars to gain Bitcoin. If they want to sequester the bitcoins indefinitely then it will be a strict loss of dollars. This is untenable by any entity.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:00:56


Bitcoin was created for essentially this purpose (Silk Road, etc). The people who actually use it as a currency are having a hard time dealing with this insane speculative volatility. The speculation is actually collapsing some of the real trade that was happening with Bitcoin.
My point is not that you shouldn't measure your BTC in $, my point is that right now a majority of traders are measuring BTC in **only** that way. This is harmful to the adoption of it as a currency.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:58:45
The demographics don't really matter, all that matters is whether there is speculation or not. Same thing happened with the housing bubble. The people buying bitcoin right now aren't buying in order to use the bitcoins, they're buying for pure speculation. That is what causes a bubble.
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:20:30
I think it's a little different with silver, in that someone can observe me spending the silver. They can't observe my body sending bitcoins over a private TOR network. They have no way to trace that transaction, so they have no way of knowing that I should owe taxes on anything.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:35:00
The exchanges are the only thing they could possibly hope to regulate.
The value will eventually be measured in terms of purchasing power against a basket of goods, but that will take considerable time. There's too much speculation and not enough use as a currency.
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:13:36
Ok, so it would require collusion between miners, merchants, and buyers for the change to be ratified?
Also, can you explain a little more what happens when there is a new fork that people are mining and trying to trade on, before the new fork has overtaken the old fork? Do the new fork miners just not receive coins for blocks? Do new fork transactions just fail outright?
Where can I learn more about the nuances of forking?

So are you essentially saying that it would be impossible to tax transactions that are completely anonymous?
What if, for the collective good, a group agreed to the taxation, and were large enough to create a dominant fork over the currently untaxed fork? In that way could the world democratically decide to implement taxes on bitcoin transactions?
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:19:12

I don't think it's that difficult. Several times throughout history a majority of the population has voted for tax increases, voluntarily.

Ah, escrow, yes a 3rd party trusted mediator would do the trick.
I'm curious how a government would collect cash from encrypted addresses not tied to people living on a single continent or anything. Would they just tax all transactions on the network? If so, is it possible to implement that in the current Bitcoin system? If all users agreed that 1% of transactions should go towards the "education address" or something, would that be technically enforceable?
@_date: 2013-03-21 04:10:07
I like the public education I got, I like the fact that I don't have to risk my life overseas, I like being able to work and pay a part of it to go towards roads and bridges that I drive on, people that inspect the food I eat, firefighters and policemen that protect us, etc etc.
Anyway, I don't want to have a political discussion here, especially not regarding libertarianism as it is rife with ideology and impracticality. Suffice to say that I actually enjoy making other people's lives better, mine is already good enough.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:36:11
I understand you're complaint, but I think you are a little confused on how currency works.
The value of the payment system is different from the value of the coins. For example, other altcoins use a similar protocol and do not have as much value. If your hypothesis was correct, then any payment network created would have coins with the same value, or at least similar value. This is not the case, so there necessarily must be some other factor driving value here.
You can talk about belief and faith and whatever, but what it boils down to is that people value something that other people value. That's how it's always been, as far back as hunter gatherer times. You bartered for things you wanted, using something someone else wanted. That is what commerce is. Then with the advent of a commodity acting as a currency, people began to value the currency in and of itself, simply because other people also value it (ie they will accept it as a form of payment).
You may not be very comfortable with this, but the bitcoin units (as opposed to the payment system) do not *have* to be accepted by anyone. People only accept and value them because other people do. Yes it's weird, but this is how currency works. It's a delusion that, when shared, makes it real.
If I offer you a pile of shit, you're not going to trade me anything for it. But if every single other person you know, and every business would buy that pile of shit for $50,000, then it starts to have real value to you!

@_date: 2013-11-20 21:47:55
Well deterrent punishments wouldn't be the same as regulation, but I get your point, they will be able to do *something* about it.
But that's only if they're able to link physical goods or a routing address to an identity. It's currently possible to avoid that, and thus avoid any punishment it would entail.

What kind of decentralized currencies have existed in the past? Gold? I would argue that we don't really have a good benchmark to discuss the consequences of a globally decentralized currency, because we haven't had one before.
I think the problem arises because Bitcoin addresses are so anonymous. With multiple governments and only one type of citizen (wallet), won't there be fighting between governments as to who gets tax from each Bitcoin address?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:22:39
Whenever a currency originates organically, it does so through general acceptance as a commodity first. Precious metals, shells, beads, etc. 
The new types of fiat currency are substantially different than this, and Bitcoin is not like those currencies.
