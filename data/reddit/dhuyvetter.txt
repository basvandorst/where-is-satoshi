Comparing Bitcoin price in ZAR on localbitcoins.com and BitX there is a large overhead in buying Bitcoin with Rand: 1 BTC = ZAR 7,486 on BitX which is 463.14 USD, while BTCAvg tells me the current price is 436.36 USD. So there is an opportunity for arbitrage if you are able to buy Bitcoin with USD or EUR and sell for ZAR.

Your first and second point are about the price of Bitcoin, which has nothing to do with the protocol, the technical. And technically Bitcoin is completely decentralized, so the second point is just wrong.
I would love to discuss Bitcoin, especially with people who don't believe in it or thing it is faulty in some way. But discussion is only possible on the basis of some knowledge of what Bitcoin actually is.
Price instability is an issue at the moment, I agree. But it is to be seen if price stabilizes over time.
In itself it wouldn't be a problem if the price doesn't rise, actually, it would be good if it stayed more or less the same.

I generally agree with your comments, I just don't see those as problems with the protocol. If you had replied earlier with more then just a few words, it would have been easier for me to understand your arguments. I am sorry if you feel I was attacking you personally, it was meant as debating your arguments.

All Wikipedia needs is another edit war. ;)
It's good to update wrong information, but it is better to not edit out stuff, but just add why the article is wrong or outdated.

In what way is the Bitcoin protocol broken?
You are right that Bitcoin isn't all good (or all bad), but the main drawback I see at the moment is the price volatility, which isn't related to the protocol itself.
If you see some way in which the protocol is broken, could you please elaborate?
