Congrats for the idea and for the domain name.
Definately, I'm going to spread it when people ask me why to buy bitcoins :)

Let's see... :) 
What is really clear is that they're talking about Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:58:25
I didn't downvote your post, lol
@_date: 2014-09-21 13:45:19
I've tested the sites with the greatfirewallofchina and other tests like the one from: websitepulse.com and for example litecointalk.org is ON. 
I don't know why they just ban 1 specific site. As well, for Bitcointalk, users can use  temporally or VPN's as well (?) is it true?
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:49:03
hahaha OMG.
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:15:36
Nice to see how people celebrated the bitcoin pizza day!
Really cool! :) 
As well, promotion in social media accounts is always good!
Happy BitcoinPizzaDay!

I know. 
I was just sharing that link to let the other user know one of the changes introduced in the v.0.10.0 core.
@_date: 2014-05-29 22:58:42
I always use Bitcoin-qt or Multibit as wallets.
But... if you can access to your account, please contact with the Blockchain support team and they're going to unblock your account when they verify everything :) just keep calm :P
Recommendation: Use software wallets and not just the blockchain one

Good luck with your presentation +!!
Just be yourself and explain everything you know encouraging people to participate asking questions or interacting with you ;)
IMO, the paper wallet gift should depend on how many people is going to be in your presentation... maybe ~1$ worth of bitcoin?
Some ideas you can use (.psd files):  and then go to images :)

Welcome, but... if you're a spy. Just try to forget everything about the other and focus on yourself.

@_date: 2015-05-13 01:00:32
With average computers you're not going to mine anything...
Keep in mind that there's hardware like ASICS that are specially designed to mine, so... with the current difficulty and hashrate, your average computers have nothing to do vs. this machines.
There are other ways to obtain bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:27:13
First of all, check that you have backups of all your wallets.
Once you checked everything, select your wallet, go to tools&gt;'Reset Blockchain and Transactions' and then wait until the process finishes (you're going to see a percentage indicator)
If everything is ok, you're going to see all the balances confirmed ;)
Hope to help you!

I've heard good things about your project. Being a quick and easy way to buy/sell bitcoin, congrats on the 2nd year being here!
One question about fees: are you planning to reduce the "buying" fees or  customers are satisfied with it?
As well, do you have a list with all the supported currencies to buy BTC on bitquick?
Thanks a lot! :D

You can check stores, restaurants and many many more shops that accept bitcoin as a payment method (all over the world) on:

I'm not using Electrum (now), but i was thinking about it some days ago... because (maybe) I'm going to switch from my usual wallet (Multibit) to another one...
You can use Electrum while connected to Tor, is it true? Your IP is not going to be compromised then, I think.

Thanks for hosting this initiative on the Bitcoin subreddit, if you want... in the next topics you can also add another interesting project like DoctorsWorldwide. (*Is a UK-based charity created to provide medical relief and aid to those who are in need*)
Their official site: 
Thanks for everything, guys!
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:06:02
Yes, of course you can ;)
The blockchain has a lot of possibilities... and of course it can be used as a secure way to vote.
Take a look to this interesting platform:  (some days ago someone posted the link on r/bitcoin too)
Very interesting project, as all the ones that are blockchain-related!
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:10:08
Great initiative, here you have an up-vote and comment!
Keep up the good work :)
And guys… look for local-charities in your countries and discuss with them the fact of accepting BTC as a donation method!
@_date: 2015-03-01 02:42:07
Are you looking for a meetup in order to be +secure about the trade?
Keep in mind that Localbitcoins have an escrow service and the seller is not going to receive anything until funds arrive to the escrow, too. Then: both parts are going to receive their part... you're going to receive bitcoins and he/she's going to receive FIAT.
Hope to help you! ;)
@_date: 2015-02-27 02:34:45
Coinigy was free since their start for the first beta-testers or traders interested in the platform...
Now: they're asking for a mandatory payment to use it... :s 
IMAO: bad decision.
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:38:21
Not sure if trolling or serious, [lol](
@_date: 2015-03-01 02:45:57
The best thing you can do is work... it's obvious that we're not going to receive anything if we don't work to obtain something ;)
There's an interesting board on bitcointalk: "Services" --&gt; there, you have people offering jobs or looking for guys with skills that you maybe have. Why you don't take a look to it? ;)
As well there's a subreddit called jobsforbitcoins or so in which people is offering or other ones are looking for employees to work in lots of projects!
This is very important, but you can always earn some from this amazing bitcoin community! People usually send some tips :P they're very generous!
Hope to helo you!
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:58:32
Of course! Thanks for your tip, too :)
@_date: 2015-02-27 02:33:18
Blockchain is like an open book where everyone can check the network status or bitcoin transactions, that's why is possible to track all the addresses from the blockchain but you don't know who's their owner ;) as easy as that!
The bitcoin addresses are random and they're not linked to your name or nick (at least if you don't specify it on a forum or wherever you want.
Hope to help you with your question :)
@_date: 2015-02-21 00:34:10
wow! Like it :)
New background... hehe

Hi and welcome to Reddit Dorian! +I've been reading some of your responses and it's obvious that you think that Bitcoin a good idea and you will use it, but... are you going to continue being active in the community or this was just a special occasion?
Thanks in advance. I hope everything goes well for you. ;)

Congrats for the present that changetip gave to you! That's because you hold some BTC in the past and now you've been spreading with the community :P
In my case I'm spreading the love for bitcoin too, but as a developer and designing resources to promote it :)
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:19:48
Hi  Thanks for this awesome initiative! Up-voted!
With this kind of posts, people can find interesting projects and initiatives to donate! In my case I think that all the children deserve an opportunity. An opportunity to study and learn. 
That's why for example initiatives like '[Building Schools for Africa]( are awesome! They can give a opportunity to boys and girls that they can't go to school now.
Hope you like the idea! As well on the OP they're interesting ideas, too :P
