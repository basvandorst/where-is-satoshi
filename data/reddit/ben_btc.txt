Those companies ARE investing in Bitcoin, just not in the strict Cash sense. By lending their company's reputation to the ecosystem, they are potentially doing more good than simply buying some Bitcoin as an investment.

This may or may not be true but this kind of attitude is not something that gets anyone anywhere. The argument should not be the fault of the (potential) users, but rather the product/companies that are trying to push a product that users don't understand.

I believe he's showing off the cheeky BTC amount (21,000,000 bits -- corresponding to the 21,000,000 possible BTC) not the dollar amount ;)
@_date: 2014-11-20 19:02:09
I'd donate $5 ;) This is a good idea. I also like the stealmywallet.com idea. May have to start mentioning it when I explain bitcoin to people

and just for the record I don't think he's annoying at all I'm super excited to see him speak up close and personal :P

It's peer to peer trading, we only provide a space we don't make the market, and there's nothing wrong with that according to any existing or future regulations.

Very cool. This is the kind of thing that Bitcoin needs to help spread the word! Blockchain this and that is cool and all but you can't forget about the digital cash part.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:56:12
How would you improve it? That's just unconstructive criticism!
I think the price is a little steep - 0.6 BTC is over $100 one could get a Trezor for that.

There are many people in the Bitcoin community that have the same sentiment, and it could certainly happen. The question the article is getting at is: why hasn't it? 
Part of the reason is that there is clearly not enough effort (in the US and elsewhere) to promote Bitcoin and educate people about its benefits. Or make it easy to get ahold of. 
Bitcoin ATMs are great for the latter, but not really at the typical 10% markup you find on most of them.
@_date: 2016-11-21 18:26:09
The article's premise is that the average person and even the average business use case simply doesn't need or recognize the need for Bitcoin/blockchain, when the current systems are serving them "well enough."
The sectors that have the most to gain from Bitcoin - right now - are the grey and black markets, such as legal marijuana dispensaries or illegal online marijuana dispensaries.
As much as it hurts to admit, I have to agree. Using Bitcoin is mostly a fun novelty for me. I like to say I bought stuff with Bitcoin (and it's nice to save money when I do, such as purchasing on Amazon w/ Purse) but it's not exactly life changing..

I think the Bitcoin Foundation was supposed to be the 'industry group' that facilitated such activities, but unfortunately it got wrapped up in scandals and isn't doing much right now
@_date: 2016-11-21 21:36:45
I don't think the article was saying Bitcoin Is Dead; simply that everyone was trumpeting the imminent interstellar domination of Bitcoin and $10k/per exchange rates etc a couple years ago and today we are still almost in the exact same position. So the article asks: "Why is that?" -&gt; 'Because BTC doesn't solve any problems for the average person'
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:10:36
I have to agree with the fact that Bitcoin is "intimidating" and "not needed in influential markets" - the combination of the two limits the amount of people that are willing to spend the time/effort to (safely) learn how to acquire and use Bitcoin.

This is fake. Probably a virus. Link is Coindesk.us and all other links on the website go to Coindesk.com

How would you say the meeting went?

Bitcoin, "Why bitcoin is no joke" is listed at the top as one of the feature stories in the magazine. It is a story about Chain.com and the further interest investors are showing in blockchain technology. 
The guy on the cover and the story about him "Boy In The Bubble" is unrelated to Bitcoin.
Combined with Blythe Masters being on the cover of Bloomberg, I'd say Bitcoin is getting some positive press this month.
