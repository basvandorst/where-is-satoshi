There is only 21 million btc, if every group of business, like businesses that posses a lot of brands like Unliver Proctor LVMH wants to set up channels between their businesses, there is not enough bitcoin for every company in the world to have channels funded with 1btc each, so millibitcoins or even less will be enough...

When you pay with credit card, the bank, and thus the state as they have access to all banking datas in clear, knows : The name of both parties, the time of the contract, what was bought and for how much.
When you pay with bitcoin and look at the blockchain, you don't know who contracted with whom, also you know at what time, you don't know what was exchanged, and you don't know for how much, as it is very rare that real bitcoin deal are done at the speculative exchanges price.

There is no legal price of cryptos, so if price is not expressed in fiat, you faithfully can't determine at what fiat price you bought. As long as bitcoin is not recognized a currency and that there is no legal basis to fix price they technically can't tax you.
If you buy a computer it has a market price legally in fiat. OCDE do a lot of publication of market price of basically anything. Thus on this you will have to pay taxes.
However you should consult your tax lord doctrine on this and be complient, as they can basically do whatever they want and even if you are right it takes years to have the court rule in your favor.
Note that they can only create a debt in fiat on you and can only take fiat out of your accounts.

@_date: 2018-01-28 23:02:18
Indeed, but cryptos is easy to cash out if the market collapse, and the bitcoin is affected with a tempo, then people will probably cash out where they got a lesser bad hit, which could trigger a cryptos collapse also

Kraken should create a smart ordered ticket list, when tier4 accounts send request it should arrive on top, 
I know that people and mostly ones that trade 100$ are sending the most tickets and flooding the support, so big traders should be able to have priority access to the support and it can be done using the amount traded by the trader in its account life

National cryptos is the best thing that can happen to the crypto.
It will enable instant purchase of decentralized crypto with centralized one on exchanges.
Which is currently an issue as it is a pain to use regular obsolete banking infrastructues to get in crypto. The only issue regarding mass adoption is the point of friction for the wealth transfer. 
The smoothest this friction is the fastest crypto will grow.
The other issue is what do the cryptos sellers will do with all thoses fedcoins.. thing they need to solve.

Most bullish news of the past 2 years, as we know that investors used this futures to gamble on bitcoin during high volatility rate.
Which lead to the crash as before the futures if you wanted exposure to bitcoin you needed real coins thus pressure on demand.
The natural long gamble on bitcoin is the acquisition of physical coins which became very easy since 2017. 
The natural short gamble on bitcoin is the futures contract, but since no sane human will short bitcoin a 3k4€ and such low volatility, this future becomes useless.
However some traders even bullish or long need shorts to manage their books and trades it is part of the process, which is mostly happening on bitmex and other exchanges nowadays.
Get coins till you can, as after the halving it will be very difficult to acquire some. Today the market do not always keep it up with the high inflation rate which means 1800 new btc to absorb every day wich is a lot.
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:47:21
You're right illiquid assets tend to have a decreasing value. Bitcoin is highly illiquid. Liquidity is obtained by having a lot of people have demand and offer, sometime offer sometime demand on the same person is also possible. Hodler mindset is to restrict offer in the aim to increase price, because it is cheap people who are afraid to "loose" the few bucks they have. But empirically it doesn't work like this. By suppressing the offer you're also suppressing the demand as people that don't find what they are demanding will most probably go look elsewhere instead of biding crazy. The best thing that can happen to this community is to start airdroping bitcoins to friends, 5-10 bucks, it may cost you 100-200 bucks but it is worth it in the long run.

All right but the volumes traded should point to an equilibrium, I'm not convinced that most the people believe it is backed. I think most of the people are 'not sure' which means it should not be so well priced.
And even if backed 100% I believe Tether should be priced above 1$ as it is a $ that can be moved without the hassle of real $ which is under strict control of the fed. So real back $, virtual and less permissioned than the real one should motivate people to pay a premium for 1 tether. Which is not the case, which points toward something strange.

You should probably rethink how you give value to currencies in a 2nd table. As the entire 21 million btc should be able to buy the entire rest of currencies if you want it to be pegged to btc. There is not 3 billions btc so it doesn't really make sens to say that entire market cap of Yuan is this amount.

I believe wall street cash out bitcoin before the stock market. Crypto crash is the sign of stock crash. If wall street crash the available money of investor will be too low to diversify to crypto. However the fundamentals, LN Segwit Schnorr etc etc, of bitcoin is going to help it grow beyond moon.

1- It shows the miners that the people clearly intend to use btc instead of b2x, which can make them choose to run the btc protocol.
2- 2x transactions are trying to use btc nodes to propagate, running a full node Core 15 is rejecting those transactions making it more difficult for 2x transaction to propagate. 
3- It secures the network and help decentralization, which means that people and miners have more incentive to use the most secured and decentralized network.
And more arguments can be found.

Its fine just download core and open port 8333 it wont affect muc your pc if its a gaming one

dude you need to educate yourself about nodes, of course it affects since b2x deliberatly and openly says they want to use btc nodes to propagate, it's not different network as the protocols are still very close. for example every non core 15 nodes up today can propagate 2x. They even use sybil attack to trick your node into accepting 2x nodes and transac

It rejects 2x transactions. Thus 2x only rely on less the 800 nodes to run all its protocole which is not enough to have a nice smooth fast secured network. And it shows miners that we won't use those coins so its useless to loose time mining them.

A network where we can only pay with mobile nodes and cannot receive... very usefull the road is very long...

@_date: 2017-10-30 08:07:04
Indeed it is, because the protocol of 2x will be under the proprietorship of corporations. So if a law passes and says that corporation have to comply to certain rules or get fined heavily they will follow

Thats not exactly how it works. As technical adjustment will happen and the pool size would increase with the price going up. If you add up since when you started the race until you reach the objective, it will be much more than 32M bought. Also arbitrage bots with other exchanges with tame the price down. And the more the price is up, the more you will find new sellers. Adding hidden orders. You will need a fews million buying a few thousands to reach this. Plus with liquid, bitcoin liquidity is supplied faster that with onchain transaction, so you cant really have an empty shop effect anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:25:56
The price per btc is always transparently displayed on localbitcoins, it is written in big multiple times, when you chose the seller, when you choose how much you want and when you are in the payment process in BOLD in the middle of the screen. Maybe reading would have been a good idea.

They should bring paypal to court, and make a joint case with all the people that were blocked for more than 10 days.
Under french law a bank or equivalent can hold funds for 10 days, to have time to fill a complain to the financial authority that checks for funding of terrorism or tax evasion. The authority has 10 day to respond. and if they dont respond it means that the users activity is not considered as the 2 mention crimes. Which means the bank has to unlock the account.
Im almost certain that this french law derives from european law, which means paypal has to follow this even though they make you sign that they can hold your funds for 180 days. Indeed property right is constitutionnal everywhere thanks to the french bourgeoisie of 1789 and those laws are of public order. Which means even if you sign the opposit, the judge will act like those terms were not written.
Im sure those laws exist in the US and elsewhere, however if no one brings paypal to court, they will continue to abuse their customers.
