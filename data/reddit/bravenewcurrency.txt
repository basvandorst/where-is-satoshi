But the value of a dollar [changes every day]( 
If everybody's money (and all prices) were in Bitcoin, you would think the dollar is fluctuating.

Spoken like a true American. People in other countries disagree with you.

The original Arduino is based on AVR (an 8-bit microcontroller with 2K of RAM). They have some later/more expensive (less popular) boards with ARM.
AVR is not open source, but it's dirt cheap (~$1), and only requires 2 or 3 components (~$1) to turn it into an "Arduino compatible".
But 8-bit computers are so weak they could never be a miner. Heck, they are probably not even powerful enough to control a miner.

I'm trying to say that fiat isn't always stable. (See Brazil).  So for some people, Bitcoin is already more stable than their fiat. I'm just responding to "I don't see how this is possible" by saying "it's already possible in some places."


I agree. But I also see there is a chance that the dollar could start doing wacky things in the future (Imagine Trump gets elected and defaults on our loans.) That could make Bitcoin look relatively stable.
Disclaimer: totally not advocating for Bitcoin, just saying that it's not impossible.
Years ago, someone did a study on a big MMO (Massive Multiplayer Online game) and found that it's economy was bigger than most countries. I'd be interested to know where Bitcoin volatility is compared to all other currencies.
