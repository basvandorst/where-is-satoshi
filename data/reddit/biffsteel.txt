I remember years ago when people almost listened to what whiny-ass Ver had to say.

They probably don't wanna get ripped-off on the Internet. They might like it up close and personal.

Roger Ver-red off course, and took 8 gullible people with him.

I'd get someone you know very well, and CAN TRUST, that's into BTC, and let them purchase some for you. Then HOLD IT! Preferably in a hardware wallet. There will always be time for trading later, after you've learned more, and have more money.

Where do we go? **W-a-y** up, **w-a-y** down. Welcome to Bitcoin.

Stop by your previous job in a couple of years and let them smell your new Ferrari.

I read all of that. Not sure what that says about me.

Send it to me and I'll send you my crazy girlfriend. On second thought, keep your BTC, and I'll send you more if you take her.

Buy now, you'll be an **EARLY** adopter. When BTC is sitting at $289,413 does it 'really' matter if you got in at $12,000 or $11,000?

When your currency is "valued" by the weight of the paper, not the denomination of the note.

How would you know if BTC was, or is, "overvalued?" Some say it will go into the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars. I believe it's overvalued if no one wants to pay the asking price any longer. I don't believe we're anywhere near that price, but that's just one man's opinion, and on BTC, I believe one man's 'guess' is just about as good as another mans. We're in uncharted waters here. Almost daily I watch the 'experts' explain why their previous 'guess' was wrong. They do it in an 'expert' manner, however. They don't really wanna admit that they're just guessing also. They usually use 'trends' as a part of their guessing, but there's not really a lot of history with BTC, so their trends aren't so valuable.
