You mean like Trezor?

Also another piece of evidence supporting this idea is that I remember reading that one of the ways law enforcement hacked the website was something to do with corrupting the php.myadmin page of the Silk Road website.  
So it seems Silk Road was written in PHP language, the same language that MtGox was written, and the language Mark Karpeles is an expert on.

If 50 people donate 2 cents each, then it equals 1 dollar. Not to mention if Bitcoin increases in price, it will be a lot more someday.  I wish people donated me 2 cents worth of bitcoin back when it was under a dollar. I donated the 100 bits, because someone tipped me the 100 bits earlier.  I would have donated more if I had it, but I don't have any coins in my tip account, because this was just a throwaway account.

Yeah DPR was pretty vocal on the forums, spreading his libertarian ideologies.  There were 2 parts of the site, one was the marketplace, and another was a forum where people just talked about stuff associated with the website.  Anybody could join it.  
DPR even had a book club thread, and was spreading libertarian ideas, and austrian school economics.  The movie night was where he would just recommend in a thread a movie for everyone to watch and then discuss.  I dont think he specified any particular way to go about it, but some would go about seeking the movie online.  
The stats caught some people off guard.  People didn't even realize that the admins had been saving that much data on buyers and sellers.  The data was useful in some ways to help give information for buyers and sellers.  It helps reduce scams, but it comes at a security cost.  As a result of the controversy they quickly changed the updates so it was more ambigious.  Instead of saying 176 transactions, it would say something like 150-200 transactions.  The data also had the amount of money spent by buyers as well as the % of refunds given.

Well I dont know about that.  But the new features were very controversial.  For one, a lot more of everyone's buy and sell stats became public, which raised security concerns, and controversy on the forums.  Also the "new DPR" did some controversial things like having a movie night, which some people were concerned would lead to a security risk for people who may stupidly download or watch the movie online (possibly on clearnet).

The guy did set up the first Bitcoin exchange, which provided price discovery for the first time.  We can give him credit for that.  Although ultimately the site was too amateurish, and got hacked.  There were also criticisms of the Silk Road website as well, and they got hacked too, by law enforcement.  Also interestingly the Silk Road hack involved the php.myadmin page, and Karpeles claims to be an expert on PHP.

Probably just a coincidence/good guess in my opinion.

Excellent points.  I hope Ross' lawyers have some experts that can compare them.
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:01:42
Ok ok, there is always a critic:

If you don't like it, then don't tip, and don't troll people for it.  A lot of people disagree with you.  In fact back in the original tipping tuesday thread, it got hundreds if not thousands of newbs into Bitcoin based on 100 bit tips.  At peak price 100 bits was over 10 cents.  This adds up fast when others contribute instead of just trolling it.  I consider your post and others trolls here to be the insulting ones.  Get a life and stop crying and whining and filling the thread with trash.

You could make the argument that he set it up initially as an experiment, not necessarily condoning illegal activity on the website. Although he is a libertarian he does not necessarily want to take legal risks, or profit by breaking the law so he turned the site over to Karpeles or others. 
Then later when Karpeles saw the law closing in on him, he could have threatened Ross saying do this or we are going to make you the fall guy or kill you.  Since there could have been some circumstantial evidence that Ross was involved it could have spooked him enough. Perhaps realizing he may become the fall guy anyways, Ross with limited options, reluctantly accepts the offer while scared for his life and liberty.  Kind of like when the drug cartels offer people "silver or lead".  Under threat of his life, it could be argued that Ross is an innocent man.

What is wrong with tipping?  If everyone in this thread tipped 100 bits it would amount to something significant.  I would have tipped more, but all I had in my changetip was 100 bits, which was tipped to me by someone earlier.  Notice I didn't troll them for it.  I just re-tipped it to someone who deserved it.  
The purpose of my post was not to just tip 100 bits, but to encourage others to tip the OP for doing a great job, but of course instead of tipping, you just get trolled here by buttcoiners instead.

They will probably get on board soon, I think they use Braintree, the paypal subsidiary and Braintree has been putting a lot of ads out recently that include bitcoin in them.

Lets tip this man, for doing an excellent job of reporting!
100 bits @_date: 2015-01-16 00:49:26

You're an idiot, did you not read my post?  Someone tipped me the 100 bits earlier so i re-tipped it.  Mostly my post was to get others to tip the OP since he did a great job, so I threw in all that I had.  If I had more in my tip account I would gladly tip more.

One thing supporting Ross, and this claim is that right before Silk Road was taken down, DPR was on the Silk Road forums claiming that he was a "new DPR", and that the old one had passed on the reigns to him.
Also at that time, software upgrades were made to the website suggesting there might be some truth to it.  Someone new took over and started updating and changing the site around. From the short time that the new DPR took over, the website updated more features than it had in the entire year previous.

I think this ad is hilarious, and never gets old for me.  But maybe a more professional looking one with the wizard and stuff would be cool too.
