In this case, isn't the network compromised by too many people using the same node architecture?

Are you serious?
We dodged a bullet because no one exploited the bug yet, but if you don't think it is serious, I'd really like to see your list of more serious bugs.

I am a bit concerned by:




That seems to be suggesting decreasing adoption as a legitimate method of ensuring consensus.
I have to strongly disagree with the assertion that absolute node count does not matter.
Absolute node count is a potential indicator of people actually using Bitcoin. It's an indicator of decentralization. It's not perfect at showing either of those things, but it reflects them to an extent.
Bitcoin would be a failure with a 100% ratio and a single node because that means that no one is using it except for the person who controls it. Yet, that's the logical conclusion of what those tweets say.
I'm glad he was challenged on this on Twitter, but I do feel this is a dangerous ideology for our developers to have, and hopefully he will expand and explain these comments in a way that can make sense.

Do I need to attribute this quote for you?


It is intended to show that even if that improbable (impossible?) occurrence happened, it would take 3-4 months before BCH could be considered to be the "honest chain" with the greatest proof of work invested in it.

Well... They are.

If the majority chose to not "upgrade" and that caused a chain split, it might turn out that you're not using Bitcoin.

Page 12:


I believe the appropriate accounting standards would be to apply the method of valuation that most conservatively (results in the lowest) estimates asset value.
They lost hundreds of millions in the crypto market this year, and are refusing to acknowledge it on the books.
We all know they have about a million BCH and some odds and ends, yet they're claiming to have ~$1B in crypto assets.
The actual fair market value would be in the $600M to $700M range, but because it cost them a billion, their balance sheets show a billion.
That is pretty fucking disgusting.

Honestly, it looks like a tire fire, and that they are trying to be deliberately misleading in their presentation of the current financial status of the company.
Page 12:


We know that they have approximately 1M BCH, and approximately $60M USD, collectively, of other coins including BTC, and small amounts of Dash, LTC, and ETH.
By ignoring the actual fair market value and presenting the value of their cryptocurrency at the cost they acquired it at, they have disclosed current assets of approximately $1B of cryptocurrency. Well... 2 days ago 1M BCH was worth $400M USD, plus the odds and ends, and they have $500-$600M tops.
When describing their NET NEGATIVE CASH FLOW on page 11, they state that:


Can anyone who tell me what would happen if they tried to sell 1M BCH on open market to satisfy their liquidity needs?
In 2017 and 2018, they prepaid suppliers a total of $1.2B USD (page 47). On page 40 they recognize that "High inventory levels may increase our inventory holding costs, risk of inventory obsolescence, markdown allowances and write-offs." This is that pre-paid inventory they spent $1.2B on.
Further discussing inventory pricing on page 45, they write:


Page 45 is interesting, because it disclosed their profit margin on sales between 52% in 2015 and 36% in 2017. An S9 was selling for approximately $1,500 USD in 2017. If that represents 36% profit, we can estimate the costs at $1,100 USD.
The current price for an S-9 is [$440 USD]( That represents a 60% loss.
Despite all of the above, they disclose an inventory asset valued at $887M USD on page 216.
I don't believe they have followed good accounting practices, which I understand would require them to value these assets using the most conservative method of valuation, i.e., the method that results in the *lowest* valuation.
They haven't done so and the result is that their reported assets are vastly inflated. Similarly, as they have accounted for cryptocurrency income as part of their cashflows using the same cost accounting, they have minimized their net negative cashflow, which is actually substantially greater than reported.

Upgrades have always been "opt in" until now.
Don't like a feature that is being added or changed? Keep running your own node with the rules you want.
This sort of "mandatory" upgrade sounds dangerously like centralization, where the core developers get to dictate what counts as Bitcoin and what counts as consensus.

Difficulty doesn't alter total hashes required for total work.
Over the same time period with a constant hashrate, you either get lots of blocks with low difficulty added, or few blocks with high difficulty added, but the total work should remain constant.

The market regulatory criticisms about the reporting of fixed costs are really telling.
Bitmain reported on their asset sheet and income financials the cost acquired basis for their crypto assets instead of the fair market value.
That fair market value dropped about $200M in the past 24 hours.
If they tell the truth about their assets and inventory, they're likely already bankrupt on paper. If they keep lying, they will never get listed.
Very interesting times.
