I think your answers are very good, however there is one simple idea you could add: the same question that was posed to the swiss parliament, "why not just treat it like any other foreign currency?", regarding both taxation and trade. ( source:  )
Also you kind of dodged the "where is btc in 20 years" question, which is understandable, but I think there is no harm in admitting that while cloning btc is trivial, the idea of the distributed ledger is quite powerful, and here to stay.

These are all valid concerns.
Most can be attributed to the early stage of development though.
Yes, only you are responsible for the safety of your coins, and the risk of theft even from your local wallet is still high.
But hardware wallets that are more resistant to malware-infested computers are already being built.
There will also be trustworthy providers who securely store your coins for you, with insurance. Might even become a service current banks offer, but this is still far away.
But hardware wallets should make it possible to store them securely even for the average windows user.
The anonymity is also being worked on, but if you follow best practice and do not re-use addresses, which most wallets already do automatically, that already provides a moderate amount of obscurity. And with the latest ideas of CoinJoin and Secret Addresses it gets even more complicated to attach your name to a transaction.
The anonymity of the creator really does not matter, all code and protocol is public and can be and is being reviewed to ensure there is nothing malicious about it.
blockchain.info probably won't run, they have proven to be trustworthy so far. But yes, lots of online wallets have been hacked or were scams. Again, in time there will be reputable online wallets providing secure and even insured storage.
You are right, for something like eur - btc - usd it is not yet cheaper than the cheapest current methods.
Biggest benefit is only seen when you already have coins, and the receiver is willing to hold them. 
This is still a long way off, but with increasing competition even Western Union-style transfers should become cheaper.
And for merchants accepting it via coinbase/bitpay it already is cheaper than credit cards in many cases.
Transaction fees should fall as well with increasing BTC value and due to competition between miners. However, there will always be fees, they're the incentive for miners to keep the system running in the first place. 
Usually all transactions show up within 1-5 seconds as unconfirmed. While not completely safe, they can be accepted for "small" amounts as long as some precautions are taken, like only accepting payment from unspent outputs, with a fee, and listening on the network for double-spend attempts. Also some attacks are already pretty costly and require exact timing, and while I don't have an exact number, they would probably not be worth it for coffee/groceries/a gas bill. 
If you are buying a house or ordering something expensive online, both merchant and customer can probably afford to wait for 6 confirmations. 
So give it some more time, technological developments and competition should alleviate most of your concerns.
The system itself is cheap and secure, just the endpoints are still lacking.

The biggest promise of Bitcoin is that it could enable anyone, anywhere to trade and do financial transactions with anyone else on the planet, with
- Low cost
- High speed
- High security, at least in being sure that money sent to you is really yours, and also not counterfeit
- No interference from banks/payment processors, no-one can block/freeze/cancel your transactions or account
These are the core values Bitcoin offers.
Apart from that some people also think that the current global financial system is not working very well, and that a currency only under democratic control of its users might be worth a try.

Absolutely right, they are backed by nothing except the shared belief they will still be worth something tomorrow, and that other people will still accept them in exchange for goods and services.
It shares this with all fiat currencies, USD and EUR are just backed by the promise of governments that they will still be worth something tomorrow.
Gold is just backed by its properties of being uniform, scarce, hard to destroy and being shiny. People saying gold has "intrinsic value" are just as misguided as people saying Bitcoin is backed by math.
Bitcoin does however have properties which are backed by math which make it useful.

I don't think convincing people is a good idea, especially investing.
I usually just tell interested people everything I know, the good things, but also the risks. They will make their own decision.

Ok, this is the one thing I dislike about BTC and used to like about LTC.
And while Satoshi himself/themselves foresaw the eventual centralization of mining (see  ), I think he wanted to push that point as far back as possible.
However, I think it might already be too late for LTC as well.
I was sad when I found out that over 4 Million BTC are in the hands of about 20 people (  ), as I was hoping it would just be lots of miners who held their coins from the beginning.
But is it really any better with Litecoin now?
Again, we probably have a few miners, and then we have those who bought them with USD or BTC at Exchanges. Or, to be more precise, Exchange.
Really about the only place to get LTC fast is the infamous BTC-E, home and origin of nearly every Pump&amp;Dump of every altcoin ever.
Hideout of the equally infamous "fontas", who comes up with brilliant pump and dump schemes like  , that actually work and would be illegal in the real world.
So now, tell me, with a quarter of all litecoins already mined and nearly exclusively available through BTC-E, with the "early adopters" mostly being early BTC adopters who bought them for cheap, do you really believe LTC are even one iota more democratic than Bitcoin?
I was hoping so, but I believe it is already too late.
We only need one cryptocurrency, BTC now at least already has a broader ("fairer") distribution, even if it's still lopsided, but I think that LTCs advantage of having ASIC-resistant mining is already gone.
So I believe that yes, scrypt would have been better, but it is too late, and now all we can do is at least support only one currency, to take away the power of greedy altcoin-speculators, who know they are adding NOTHING of value, but pretend to do so with a straight face.
If BTC and LTC had started at the same time, LTC would have been my choice I suppose. But I sadly believe it is too late.

Well they should get paid of course, but I don't think it is part of the same transaction.
I don't know if it could be implemented in the transaction, maybe specify a fee to be paid to the escrow address on resolution?
Or it gets deducted from the payment to the seller, or one party would have to make a seperate payment to the escrow service.
In any case, it would probably be the buyer paying them, either directly, or indirectly by paying for the sellers' markup when they have to pay the escrow service.
I suppose we'll see when it gets implemented.
@_date: 2013-09-21 18:01:01
Ok I think I finally understood what you were getting at.
Unfortunately I do not know nearly enough about tax law to speculate if your proposed change would be good or not.
@_date: 2013-10-10 02:26:30
Yes, and depends.
For real anonymity you would have to jump through a lot more hoops,
like make a throwaway mail account and a throwaway blockchain.info wallet, accessed from IPs that can't be traced back to you.
Then you'd have to meet with a seller, so you can pay in cash.
Bonus points if you wear a wig and funny glasses.
As long as you don't plan on trying to hire assassins this would be overkill, just use a throwaway email, pay with cash, and you should be good.
Be careful of course, only meet in safe places like a bar or restaurant or something, and should you ever sell this way do not get ripped off with counterfeit money or reversed payments.
If you are ok with giving your ID, coinbase and bitstamp are reputable companies who have worked quite well so far.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:36:35
I am not an early adopter, I just seriously wonder
- How many global currencies does one planet truly need?
- How is a nearly exact clone any improvement over the first implementation that seems to work really well?
I respect coins that are REALLY different, like NameCoin. NameCoin has truly innovative features, I wish more people would develop for it.
And I even respect coins like FreiCoin or PPC. While I don't like them, at least they are trying to experiment with new features besides "New name, More Coins, GO!"
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:55:05
This just goes to show that a good escrow service is actually valuable.
**With the escrow feature already in the protocol ( "multi-signature transactions"**,  **)** there will be good escrow providers which also CAN NOT suffer from some of the problems PayPal has.
With multi-signature transactions, I send a transaction with 3 recipients, BFL, "BitPal" and myself.
This transaction can only go through if 2 (or even 3) parties agree that the funds should be released, until then the transaction is in limbo, with noone having access to the funds.
So BFL ships, BFL and I approve the transaction, BitPal is not involved, everyone is happy.
BFL doesn't ship, I try to redeem the funds, they try to release the funds, BitPal will decide by making BFL produce evidence for shipping.
BFL ships, I try to scam them and redeem the funds, they try to release the funds, BitPal will decide by making BFL produce evidence for shipping and by having me produce evidence of a bad or broken product.
**This is different from current Paypal as:**
1.) If vendor and buyer are happy, BitPal is never involved. They can not freeze funds or accounts as long as vendor and buyer are in agreement.
2.) No customer can chargeback via their CC company or bank, it is only up to BitPal to collect evidence from all parties and decide. You may not like this, but it protects the vendors as well as you, and now BitPal can focus on their job of mediating instead of having to deal with 4th parties (CC company/bank), so they should be able to do their job much better.
Much of the hate PayPal is getting stems from 4th parties being involved and from the ability to arbitrarily freeze accounts.
With both of these dangers removed, a much better escrow service is possible.

It all boils down to the same situation everyone is in now: either pay taxes, or don't, and try to hide/launder the money but run the risk of getting audited and found out.
And thanks to the blockchain 1 key associated with you is enough to trace a lot of your economic activity.
In case everyone is so good at hiding their coins that taxation does not work anymore, governments would be forced to put taxes to such good use that everyone would actually like to pay them.
I don't see that happen for several reasons, foremost because auditing will still work.
And the usability of Bitcoin for tax evasion or money laundering is overstated.
Simply put, have 10.000 on a secret key, do not use it, nobody knows, great!

It was just said, the same as any other transaction.
I sell you a service/goods, I pay the taxes on it, I will also probably hand them over to you as part of the price. They are denominated in my local currency, and are taxed the moment the transaction is happening.
Doesn't matter if I accept EUR, BTC or Chocolate Gold Coins, the process is always the same.

I asked blockchain.info, and for the moment it is still disabled with no estimate on when it will be back.
Someone here also told me their implementation is not quite the real "2of3"/"3of3" transaction yet.
But I suppose they will get it back online as soone as more wallets and maybe escrow services support it.
@_date: 2013-10-01 12:39:05
That's the fun thing about 2of3 transactions: if vendor and buyer are in agreement, both sign the transaction and it gets released. the escrow neither has access to the transaction, nor can he block it.
the only thing he can do is to decide who of them should get the funds in case they don't agree.
@_date: 2013-10-29 13:05:17
Closer to the truth, but doesn't explain much.
Also I think hearing "secured by" and "lottery" in the same sentence would scare me.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:06:12
Then there would be fractional (reserve) banking.
Also any serious wallet site already keeps most of their (users) coins in cold storage since this is more secure.
Since I suspect that most users want "real" bitcoins instead of fractional reserve backed ones, any wallet service doing fractional reserve would probably experience a bank/wallet run as soon as it would be found out that they don't back user balances 1:1 in real bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-08 17:35:52
It is very likely mining becomes centralized, we are already seeing the beginning of it. While it doesn't mean anything, Satoshi himself expected this. He probably didn't expect it to happen this fast with the advent of ASIC mining, but he did expect it. see 
In the most extreme scenario with just a few providers this would then become an arms race between them, in which the "honest" miners would try to stay ahead because an "attacker" would threaten their profits.
In the hypothetical scenario where the mining providers are nation states, they would probably not want any other country to be able to block their transactions.
Besides, it would be VERY costly, with the cost of an attack rising every day, it would be easy to detect, and it would be possible to defend against it see.

This is exactly the point: it is only really anonymous as long you got it anonymously, hold it, and do not exchange it for anything that can be traced back to you.
Therefore he simply could not spend it. Maybe a few bucks here and there, but without a huge laundering operation it was not possible.
And there might also have been other reasons, but Bitcoin NOT being anonymous as soon as you try to trade it is a big one.

You are right, although cavirtex is 1,5% + 5$ and coinbase 1%.
But nobody wants to hear that here.
@_date: 2013-09-22 12:43:13
I think it's a good idea.
I'd advise you to only take cash because of the danger of chargebacks.
Check at least the security features you can, like watermarks, hologram, maybe bring a checking pen or even small uv light (for currency with this feature).
Only meet in a public place with people, like a bar or restaurant.
Only release the funds when you have the money in your hands and checked it.
So far I always used the escrow feature, so the buyer only needs to bring a piece of paper with the confirmation code, I load up localbitcoins on my phone, check the money, press "release" and show the buyer the confirmation code. Release also works via SMS, but I have not tried it yet.
Sell with a slight premium to cover coinbase and lclbtc fees, and 1 or 2% for yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:37:01
Don't worry.
All the get-rich-quick people and daytraders ultimately help as well, since at least now they now know about it, and help "funding" it.
Also, what I found out works much better than talking is simply showing them!
The REAL interest always started the moment I told them how to set up a wallet and just sent them something.
The "That's it? You just sent me money within 3 seconds?" together with "I don't have to sign up anywhere to use it?" created an "Aha"-effect with a much bigger impact than anything I ever told them.
Anyway, now I mostly only talk to people showing interest, and keep giving them small amounts, which really helps A LOT to get anyone to grasp how revolutionary the technology is.
@_date: 2013-09-17 20:35:38
Yes, there is still the possibility of the escrow deciding incorrectly.
However, for the exact reason you are giving, they will have to work hard to establish and maintain trust, because switching to another escrow service would not impact your ability to do business, whereas ditching paypal means losing everyone else who uses it.

- Investing in Bitcoin itself. ROI unknown, risk unknown.
- Investing in mining hardware. currently negative ROI, high risk
- Investing in Bitcoin mining stocks (asicminer/cex.io), ROI unknown, incredibly high risk as these stocks are not traded on any legitimate stock exchange
- Investing in a legitimate Bitcoin-Startup. ROI unknown, risky but possibly less so than the other options (except maybe bitcoin itself).
It also depends on how you invest in them, if you can meet them, talk to them and verify their identity it might be less risky.
If you invest via an unregulated stock exchange, risk is, again, very high.
Some pages like justdice allow for investing directly, which works alright so far, but is also incredibly risky

Always these dramatic headlines.
One politician said he wants it banned, before that can happen they will first have to assess it.
And in the event they pass a law that bans it, it will still have to be accepted by the public, otherwise they can reverse it by a successful public referendum.
This will be fun to watch!
They really actually might try to ban it if they see it threatens the banks and with it the swiss franc.
On the other hand they just recently passed a law (decided via public referendum) which is supposed to limit excessive banker salaries, so the swiss seem to at least have a feeling that the banks should behave a bit more humble after (or during) the financial crisis.
Whatever the outcome will be, as one of the richest countries in the world their decision will have quite an impact.

Yeah that probably means 0-confirmation, meaning that the payment is accepted the moment it is broadcast to the network, instead of waiting until it is confirmed by a miner.

"Can't scam an honest man" is as true as it has always been.
Do not believe in promises of extreme returns, do not buy from or invest in companies without a product/business model/identifiable owners, and you will be fine.
Always check the reputation of who you are doing business with, and calculate the risks. You want to trade on an unregulated stock exchange, that's fine, but everyone knows that a business not following regulations has a good chance of being shut down.
Most current businesses are trying hard to provide security, transparency and compliance with regulation.
The weakest point right now is security, here you are correct.
You have to take very good care of the security of your computer and your online accounts, and have backups. 
These are all things you should be doing anyway, but hopefully there will soon be improvements to end-user security, like in the form of hardware wallets.
And finally, yes there is a high amount of fraud when you try to sell Bitcoins, which however is only because classical forms of payment are so prone to fraud. Bills can be counterfeit, paypal/bank transfers reversed. Bitcoin does not have these problems. Because of this, the safest thing to do is keeping your coins safe, and only exchange them for goods and services.
**tl;dr** don't be stupid and greedy and fall for scams, take good care of your security, always look who you are doing business with and apply common sense wherever you go, and you will be fine.

Only in the worst case scenario, in which all 3 keys are required to release the funds.
But I think "2 of 3" would be more common, and in this case one party becoming defunct or hacked would not pose a problem as long as the remaining two parties cooperate, since only 2 parties are needed to release the funds.
If the 3rd party becomes defunct while a transaction is still in escrow AND there is a dispute, it would probably end up in court with one party trying to get the other to sign the transaction. Then the funds would be locked up until the dispute is resolved.

If I'm with people in a bar and they ask what Bitcoin is, I'm not going to start with technical details, but rather provide something short and concise that's not wrong if left alone, but can be expanded if necessary.

Scam. But I like how it "solves mathematical puzzles to generate bitcoins", just like the real deal.
This significantly lowers the entry barrier for greedy scam victims, well done.

nearly complete, they only forgot public drinkers and jaywalkers.

"secured" is absolutely correct, as computing power goes into securing the blockchain. the mined coins are only the reward for providing this computational power.

wish I could come, too far away at the time though.
Hope it turns out well!

They are tokens that are marked, or inscribed, or "colored", to represent something and always make them uniquely identifiable. 
So one could be inscribed with "This coin represents 1 share of the company XY".
Since these can't be counterfeit, ownership of 100 "company XY stock"-coins means that you indeed own a hundred shares of company XY.

first backup your wallet:
- Open Finder
- Shift-CMD-G ( "Go to folder" )
- go to ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/
there you should find wallet.dat which you can now backup.
After you have triple-checked that your wallet.dat is backed up, move the /Bitcoin folder out of the Library folder to your Desktop, and try starting Bitcoin-QT again. It should now behave like a new installation and be empty. 
Close it.
Copy your wallet.dat backup back into the /Bitcoin folder.
Start Bitcoin-QT.
Everything should now work as before.
On a sidenote, I switched to Electrum because Bitcoin-QT used to hang, crash, and be generally slow all the time.
[edit: if this works I think you'll have to wait until it syncs again before you can move the coins. You could try and import the wallet.dat into Electrum, but I think it doesn't work.]

I'm just saying that this "trust" system is way too easy to be abused, as demonstrated by TradeFortress.
It is easy to get scammed, as soon as you trust someone they are now free to abuse this trust, and this will happen a lot.
Bitcoin was designed to eliminate this need for trust.
Besides, the trust system makes setting up Fractional Reserve Banking way too easy, and I do not see that as a good thing.

It is not cleared that fast, the payment processors do the fast transaction and settle with the banks later.
The same would be possible with Bitcoin, where you pay with your card, and the wallet site your card is connected to tells the merchant's POS that everything is alright. So you get the 15s confirmation time, and the wallet site can take the hour to do the actual transaction.

For now copying it to a safe location, like a USB stick (or 2), should suffice.
Be aware though that unless your wallet is encrypted, anyone getting access to your wallet.dat can spend your coins.
Since I am slightly paranoid about losing coins and data, 
I therefore created an encrypted Volume with the Truecrypt app, copied the wallet in there, and saved it on an external disk and on DropBox. 
It's good to have backups, but I would not store unencrypted wallet backups anywhere someone might find them.

Namecoin has other possible use cases besides distributed DNS, like providing secure login authentification or document timestamping.
These are really good things, that might be good to keep out of the BTC blockchain.
Unfortunately most people treat it more like another horrible altcoin instead of looking at the possible features.
Also looking at it like a currency AT ALL is wrong in my opinion, as it is more supposed to be used for these technical features rather than being used to pay for things (except domain/document/key registration).
Also really sad that they have so few developers right now. Let's hope development picks up after the fork in a few weeks, when the "deadly flaw" is fixed once and for all.

Great, thanks!
All wallets should support offline .bmp or . png export though.

And I am looking for the accurate analogy. For example calling the blockchain a ledger is not really wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:08:59
What is that?
 
- Decentralised Internet Money. Cash on the Internet. Can be sent with the speed of email at very low cost. Can not be counterfeit, does not require a bank. Can not be taken away from you if you are careful.
How is it secured? / Who creates it?
- It is secured and created by a large network of bookkeepers, people called "miners". I send you a coin, the transaction is broadcast to the internet, the miners donate computing power to write down the transaction into a ledger called the "blockchain", and are rewarded for doing that. Since everyone in the network has an identical copy of the blockchain, as soon as the tx is written into it, everyone knows I sent you 1 coin, and I can not spend the same coin again.
But I read it is anonymous?
- Not really, it can be anonymous, as all that is visible is a tx between two addresses without names. However, as soon as you change it to classical money or buy something, you probably have to state your name.
But it is computer stuff, it can probably be hacked.
- The Math / Cryptography / Code are all publicly available and tested, and the cryptography is secure for years to come. That being said, they can and are being stolen from from personal computers or shady websites. 
(Maybe include juicy story about million$-thefts from inputs or that chinese exchange, leading to "only store on own device, better paper")
What can I buy with it? I read drugs!
- Lots of things, mostly computer stuff (hosting, vpn etc.),  but also already some places accepting it where you can buy beer (in berlin, london, new york). Not many real life places accepting it, but it's growing every day. 
(depending on who you are talking to, tell the tale of SR)
ponzi/tulip/bubble/pyramid/no value
- Sort of looks like a pyramid game, yes, as the earliest people have most of them. However, the system itself enables you to send value nearly instantly nearly free securely around the world without a 3rd party (banks), which wasn't possible before. Since this is a useful functionality, it probably won't go to 0.
Who invented it?
- Noone knows, anonymous guy or group of people called SN. (tell the tale of SN)
Ohhh but then they can just change the system or shut it down! / Someone can hack it and award themselves more money / The people who made it just will make more!
- No they can not, as the rules are written into the software, and everyone has to follow the rules or else they are simply ignored by the network. Every change to the rules requires over half of the network agreeing on that change.
Who controls it?
- Noone, yet everyone. However, there already is a power structure in place. There are the main developers of the software, only they can implement a change. However, also very powerful are the miners, as no change will get through unless over 50% of the miners agree to use the new software version including the proposed change.
Should I buy some?
- Do not invest more than you are willing to lose completely, as it is fluctuating wildly, and the whole system is still very experimental. (You can then tell them whatever after that, I usually tell them that I think it is going to be successful and that they should buy a small amount that won't hurt too much if it is lost.)
What if the internet goes down globally?
- Does that come before or after the werewolf apocalypse? Serious answer: If that happens you'll have bigger problems than money, also 1 computer is enough to restart the network.

also "GLS Bank", I asked them directly and they said since Bitcoin is legal in Germany, they have no objection to customers using it.
They even included a very nice warning that I have to take good care of security because of all the theft.
I also asked comdirect, but they could not give an exact statement other than "as long as nothing illegal is going on it should be alright".

What exactly are the benefits of LTC over BTC?
Please tell me your arguments, I have not found one yet.
So far I only see 3 differences, shorter blocktime, 4x the coins, and LTC is accepted nowhere.
