Yes and with the proposed increase of 20 megs, that would mean the blockchain grows almost 3 gigs a day, can service a small fraction of what Visa does, and can't even service a single city in the United States without backing up the network for days.  If the block limit was raised to something like Visa's average capacity the chain would grow 100 gigs a day.  If it was able to service Visa's peak capacity it would grow 2.7 TB a day.  And that's just a single company.  Totally scales though, if you pretend hard enough.

Do you not realize that the people who wrote the wiki have every reason to lie to you in the world?  They directly financially benefit from you investing in bitcoin.  The fact is that if you scaled bitcoin to meet Visa's (just ONE company) peak volume, the blockchain would increase almost 3 TB a day.  If you increase it to meet their average demand it's 2.8 gigs a day.  Do some basic math, the wiki is just a flat out lie.  The wiki also says the network does 7 TPS a day when it can really only to 2.7.  
Hell didn't theymos, the person who stole millions in donations write the wiki?  Doesn't the wiki contain pages about scaling on mars and the moon?  LOL  yea that's a great place to rely on all your bitcoin info from, a fuckin place that talks about martian blockchains.

Yes because consumers will go through all the issues associated with multi sig and escrow to abandon a system in which they have a 0% chance of losing any money during a hack.  I see people moving towards bitcoin with open arms, adopting it in mass, all waiting to be the next victim of a hack or scam. 
I want to buy something with a credit card online, I input the number into a form.  Done.  There's no complication, security, or bullshit.  No multisig, no escrow, and no worries.  Card gets stolen and used in Russia?  Not my problem, a 15 minute phone call resolves it all.  Bitcoin gets stolen?  Shit out of luck!

It's not a contradiction you imbecile and I already spelled it out for you.  If I wanted to trade and I had $1000, I could only buy 1 bitcoin a year ago.  Now I can buy 4+.  Hence the BTC volume is up and the USD volume is the same as it was.  There's been no new money what so ever.  The same money just buys more bitcoin.  I don't know how I can explain it any clearer.

So we raise the block limit to 20mb.  Currently this beast of a network is capable of 2.7 TPS.  So multiply that by 20 and we get a whopping 54 transactions per second.  We can now we can handle the average Western Union (who just posted record profits because bitcoin is such severe competition) daily transactional volume of 29 TPS.  Except during peak where  the network will lag.  
So with the proposed block raise if everyone in the city of New York city sent one transaction, the network would be filled to maximum capacity and it would take 2 days to process the transactions.  On top of that, the blockchain would grow 2.8 gigabytes per day.
Don't worry though we'll be able to solve all this with side chains, reading of the wiki, and a few waves of the hand.

In any real economy if you spent your money, you could just sit back and let the person you sent it to re-spend it.  However the way bitcoin is setup when you spend money you really just sell it on an exchange - hence why you said "buy back".  It's precisely this reason why bitcoin is NOT a currency and NOT an economy, and exactly why it won't last.  There is no recirculation of money.  Let me repeat that, there is no money cycle.  You buy something, and the money is essentially sold on the open market which forces price down.  If bitcoin were ever to work, those half dozen retailers who "accept" bitcoin would actually need to accept bitcoin, pay their bills in bitcoin, and pay their employees in bitcoin.  And until that day comes, the price will continue its downward path to 0.

Lol, I love when you guys think the only thing people who dislike bitcoin analyze is the price.  We see the ecosystem for what it is.  Juniper just came out with a report that analyzed everything and their conclusion was that bitcoin was on the decline.  They noted that transaction numbers will increase through 2017, but the actual growth of the network is on the decline.  Every time an official report comes out about bitcoin, it's negative.  The world bank report that you guys claimed to have said bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme said bitcoin is not an INTENTIONAL ponzi scheme.  Federal reserve report said retail transactions are negligible.  Report after report cites the stagnation and or decline of bitcoin, and yet here we are repeating the same old mantra that bitcoin is alive and well citing the same misleading wallet numbers or transaction numbers.

Look on their home page.  It says right there how much money in tips they sent and received.  Like any dishonest bitcoin company, the numbers aren't what they appear because they use the current spot price USD for every tip that has been sent.
Anyways, shady numbers aside let's run some numbers.  Say they went with their original plan of charging 1% fee on every transaction.  That would mean even if they bring in a million a year in tips (a far cry from their current $88k in the year+ they have been operating) then we'd be left with total revenue of $10,000.  Assuming they have 0 employees, no office space, and absolutely no other costs associated with running their business (and do to their massive sock puppet army of spam we know that's not true!)...that means they can pay their VC back in 350 years.

Peak Visa peak capacity is 47,000 transactions a second.  If each transaction is 0.00056049887 megs, 47,000 * 0.00056049887 megs = 26.34344689 megs a second.  26.34 megs * 86400 (seconds in day) = 2276073 megs.  2276073 megs = 2.2 TB a day.  So I guess I exaggerated "almost 3", I guess it's "a bit over 2 terabytes".  Either way, 2 tb of data per day is not a reasonable outlook for a decentralized network.  Neither is 2 gigs a day.

If bitcoin's price fell to 0$ tomorrow, what would people have to show for the money they invested?  Think about this - if the price was $0 almost all miners would drop out making the security, relevance, and integrity of the network basically 0.  The network would be shutdown or 51% attacked.  So what would you as a consumer of bitcoin have to show for your investment?  With anything that has intrinsic value, I would still have something.  With bitcoin, you would have a number in a file which is no longer used anymore.  There's simply no intrinsic value.

That's sure a lot to deduce from a 6 day old account which has given nothing but facts.  But other than your "Woah what just happened here, 400 bitcoins!?!" you still haven't really addressed how this company can stay in business.

So you can get all snarky with me all you like, but can we both agree that being reasonably profitable off pennies is not working for them?  Their business model would have to do a complete 180 for them to succeed.  They need to become more of a Coinbase than what they are now to have any sort of chance at not failing.

Who cares if it's bitcoin or the services that run on it?  If a consumer loses 10k he's not going to say "WELL GEE IT WASNT BITCOINS FAULT".  No, he's going to exit the ecosystem permanently.
