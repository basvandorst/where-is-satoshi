hmmm... i think that they should enrich uranium and start producing the bomb.
Iran is at the edge of an unfair invation. And there is a FACT,
NO NUCLEAR COUNTRY HAS BEEN INVADED EVER.
I mean, it would be cool if they do what you say, turn nuclear into BTC, or even cooler solar power... but, let's face reality. If they are invaded then USA will control their economy.

the iranian government should mine btc.
i dont know why they dont do it.
Cheap energy to mine. Turn oil into BTC. 
And then use it to trade for whatever they need.

i live in Argentina and you can buy in Ripio and in Satoshitango , but i think you can buy anywhere if you use a credit card.
I use Ripio.
But it's true you can also use localbitcoins. But i never used it.

idk, imagine a Highly educated worker living in a hyperinflationary country like venezuela or any other.
He might demand his boss to pay him in BTC, he might find it usefull if more retailers (even late providers) accept BTC.
When you live in a country whose FIAT money is as useful as toilet paper, this kind of initiatives might work.
Or if you live in a country where the government is super vigilant, and your bussines is kinda shaddy, you might want a retailer accepting BTC.
I guess that if a huge international coorporation, like Starbucks, is willing to accept BTC it is because they found a demand for that payment system. Otherwise they wouldnt bother.

i'm argentinean and i disagree. We are far from venezuela and our economy is different. Also our economy is not tied to just one commodity (like venezuela and oil). It's true that the soy international price is important, but not that much.
I think that the only thing that would trigger hyperinflation is if Bolsonaro's hate to us triggers a block in mercosur.
If that happens, well, we are doomed. It's a trade war that our country cant afford and wont win.

Hello fellow argentinean neoliberal!

our wages went up (in dollars), GDP went up, there was a period with double surplus fiscal+comercial (the only one in 20 years), more welfare policies, last neoliberal dictatorship genocides went to jail, seniors can buy their medicine, more than 20 FREE universites were built, a space rocket to put satelites in space was made (Tronador II), scientist were fine and working hard.


Because Macri changed everything in just a month, no transition at all. He had a plan that failed. And even the timing was wrong.
There is no economy indicator that worked well for him.
He ruined our economy. 
My wage (in dollars) halved. Everybody wages halved.
**Do you know how does it feel? TO HAVE YOUR WAGE HALVED?**
Macri is the only one to blame for that, he made stupid desitions.
I agree that a Kirchnerism plan need a couple of tweaks and changes. Kirchnerism realized that themsevles and had a plan. But then came Macri with his neoliberal shitty policies and fail like any neoliberal in southamerica (and central america, and the caribbean, and africa).
To apply neoliberal policies that have to be done, there must be a safety net for poor people. I agree with some neoliberal policies, but first we need to feed, heal, and educate the poor.

**i'm argentinean and i've being accumulating BTC (and a few other crypto) since 2012.**
But it's not true that bitcoin is 30% more atractive for us than physical dollars.
Here, there is mass hysteria for buying dollars, but Bitcoin is almost unknown for the masses.
It is still not accepted by almost any vendor (there are only a few exceptions).
This last monday (neoliberal) president Macri announced a limit to buy dollars. We can just buy 200 usd per person, per month.
This will make btc very attractive. Our media is STARTING to pay attention to BTC, but we are far from mass awareness.
This limit will stand until december, when our new elected president Alberto Fernandez (center left) will define our monetary polices.
I think in december we are going to have more news about mass awareness depending on the decitions made by the new president.

true, bolsonaro is trying to undermine the integration of south america.
I hope he get's impeached for killing Marielle Franco and/or because of his enormous corruption government
The Intercept - New Evidence Ties Bolsonaro Family to Murder of Marielle Franco
 
The Guardian - Bolsonaro says he's fighting corruption. So why is he surrounded by scandal? 
 
Also remember that Brasil is under lawfare colonialism. Judicial system is corrupt and is just a puppet of brazilian alt right.
That's why former president Dilma Rouseff was impeached AND LATER FOUND INNOCENT.
And the judge that send Lula to prison was promoted as "justice minister" by Bolsonaro.
There has been a judicial coup.


true, but why would that happen?
perhaps if we dare to trade with Venezuela as a free country the US would boycott us some how because that "free country" label is just an illusion under US imperialist umbrella.
but i dont think that in the first year that would happen. The US leash is tight on us.


well in 1979 we were under a USA sponsored neoliberal dictatorship. The whole region was dealing with the same problem. 30.000 people "desapeared" just in Argentina.
Then... well... yes, democracy. Everything fine for a couple of years an while we were getting to the 90s, HYPERINFLATION.
Later came a neoliberal faction of peronism to power and there was artificial stability with a 1 peso 1 dolar policy.
That exploded in 2001.
Then came Kirchnerism, and saved the country, the debt was paid, there was surplus, stability, everything was ok.
Till neoliberal Macri came an changed everything for worse.
The point is that if we look 40 years to the past, i dont know where this is heading, because we had a lot of crazy destinations. So i dont know which destination it would be, or if it would be a new one.

she isnt she said several times **she is capitalist with keynesian leaning.**
Rule number one to be far left: Seize the means of production.
She never did that in 12 years, and she never planned to do it.
why do you say she is far left?


and neoliberal Macri is leaving his government with an inflation of 55 percent
