Was your cousin visited by his future self and told to invest in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:42:01
Still though how does Libra threaten bitcoin at all?
@_date: 2019-07-16 14:19:13
That is both true and false. Libra's value will basically be backed by multiple fiat currencies, along with the fact that it is still absolutely designed to maintain surveillance and control over the users, not to mention sell that surveillance to anyone who can afford it. It may be backed by "something" but the trade off is that, like social media, facebook could violate the rights of its users because it is not a government entity. 
Imagine buying your prescription drugs with Libra, then you come up with a great app that facebook wants to buy. But instead of offering fair value, they either threaten to "leak" your medical (which is illegal, but not enforceable) or they leak it without any warning causing your startup company to cut its market cap to a price that is a great value for a company that can give itself a loan of any amount because they produce the currency. Or they reduce the visibility of your marketing on their platform.
It is a government fiat, that isn't bound by the constitution.

My wife is the one I have to tell to calm down.  She just got into it. And I have been following it for about 5 years. She wants to tell everyone she can about it, but doesn't understand why I never even told her about it. I keep telling her that it is a solution to something that most people don't see as a problem yet, young people dont care because they dont make enough money or pay enough in taxes, and old people simply can't conceptualize the concept of hard money that you can touch.

Don't buy gold, buy this electronic piece of paper that says you bought gold, stay away from bitcoin because it is electronic currency.

Centralized alt-coins could have trouble with US regulators. But I could use the consolidation.

Depends on if you're counting on a bailout or not. They are Trumps largest creditor, I'm assuming he buys his debt at pennies on the dollar, then the Germans come bail them out.

The only thing that can beat the buying power of the USD, is the USD six months ago!
@_date: 2019-07-13 16:27:31
It boggles my mind that people are falling for this crap.
@_date: 2019-07-13 16:23:49
No, in 3-4 weeks it will crash, and they will all act like they were right all along, and continue bombing countries that choose not to support the USD.
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:53:46
Not until they have acquired.
@_date: 2019-11-13 02:14:18
I do, but it will have the buying power of about $600k of today's money. The next crash is going to be in currency, not in industry.
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:43:32
$100K is way short of actual life changing money, in the context he is talking about. It is the difference between getting out of debt, and paying cash on your third vacation home.

BTC needs to do more than exist for this to happen. IMO it needs not only mass adoption to create demand, but it also needs to streamline its value as a medium of exchange. But as technologies are created around it things will become easier, but we are, and will continue to see the downsides of a currency with massive deflation until its price is realized. Too many people are hoarding it, speculating it's future value, so companies that create an easy medium of exchange are not incentivized because their user base doesn't exist. 
If you really want to see bitcoin rise in value, contribute to the ecosystem, instead of hodling for your retirement plan.
Bitcoin is a valuable competitor to gold, but if you really want it to skyrocket in value, start making it a competitor to your debit card.

I can make a more accurate prediction and claim not only that it could happen again, but that it *will* happen again.

I like the end where he talks about how apparently everyone loves the idea of the TSA now? And how DUI checkpoints is something that was decided by us, as a society?
Obama was the very best at taking tyranny, and making it look like it was our idea.

Well hello! I am looking for a career change and the securities industry seems to have been calling me for quite some time. As someone that is serious about getting into the securities market, but also is a huge believer in the future of crypto, could you see those two things being at odds? Is there a pathway that could allow me to grow in the field without blindly swearing myself to the legacy system?

What a world we live In, where you are penalized for saving money.

And I am providing them liquidity that they can over leverage.

It doesn't push appreciation. It pushes inflation. Your assets aren't worth more, money is just worth less.
@_date: 2019-09-22 04:05:28
It is your fucking money you shouldn't be fined for not using it the way the state wants you too all so that giant corporations can take out more in debt, at rates lower than inflation.
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:30:16
That's because you are poor. But fortunes are made on leverage.
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:25:04
So inflating market bubbles by forcing people to speculate? And what does that do to income inequality when assets have appreciated out of reach of new people entering the market?
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:53:10
Should be exciting either way.
