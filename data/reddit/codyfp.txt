FYI I do know about dwolla.  After about 10 days of trying to fund, that account now has some cash.  Now I have to send that over so I can buy again.  I was just hoping to use okpay so I could buy LTC easier (w/o having to buy BTC at mtgox, transfer to btc-e, and then buy LTC)
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:43:21
Best way to fund campbx is just to mail money orders.  I have my manager mail $1k/day (their limit).  Though support said I could send a ton of $1k money orders and they'd fund them one a day.
Funding via other sources sucks because the other sources that campbx takes are a pain themselves to fund.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:57:49
SHIT!  I had a ton there.  This is pretty scary.   Bitfloor was the best since you could just go to a BofA and zap money right in.  That was the whole reason I started using bitcoin again (since the way back days when I got a few from mining)

How is he going to send back bitcoins?  And honestly, what motivation does he have to do so?
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:23:37
* Localbitcoins.com (anonymous, but normally more $ and often hard to find an actual seller)
* campbx.com (mail in money order. Not anonymous)
* coinbase.com (connects to your bank account. Not anonymous but easy)
* houstonBits.com (anonymous, mail in money order or visit in person if in Houston
* bitinstant (pay at CVS and other local places. Low limits but if you only want a little bit its easy. Fees are high for very small amounts)
I've used all four. I still use campbx and HoustonBits. Either should be easy enough to get started.

It's not that simple.  It's nice to say he didn't lose but while he has the same number of bitcoins, they'll buy less than 1/2 as much stuff since places price in bitcoins based on their rate in $usd.

Fuck all the 'rules' and regulations around someone deciding to depoly such a machine.  If I had the skills to make one, I'd do so and put them all around town.
Then again, I had the city come to shut off gas to one of my buildings and I literally had a manager sit on the gas meter so they couldn't take it off.

So yeah, sell me an ATM.  I'll bolt it down in front of my building and have someone guard it from thieves (those in uniforms and those not)

@_date: 2013-04-16 12:00:41
I just want a bit of stability.  I was talking to the HoustonBits.com guys and they are trying to keep their real-life 'bid/ask' price to 5% over/under mtgox.  That's fine as long as the price is stable but I believe yesterday they did a lot more buying than selling for the first time, so they woke up to quite the loss.
But hey, that's just part of the biz.
On a side note, with all the "big hitters" in the game, I'm surprised that the sell side would be stronger than the buy.  Especially considering most of the buyers are geek early adopters and true believers.  If the big VC guys don't see this as their chance to scoop up millions worth, then how much faith do they really have?

HoustonBits will buy them based on the price - a few % - at the time they were transfered.
Most of their business is local walk ins but they've bought and sold via mail before.  Last week someone sent them 50 BTC and they mailed out money orders.
When BUYING bitcoins, they offer the price on the time stamp of envelope.  So if someone sends them a money order, and bitcoins rocket up in the few days it takes to get to them, they still honor the price it was.
The process isn't instant as you're talking about 2-3 days via mail but it's pretty quick.  They'll also SEND payment via paypal (and will take payment via paypal for local/regular customers)
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:42:17
hehehe, yup :)    The only thing I think a clone could do "better" is make it easier to buy.  Stability would be good, but I don't see how a clone could do that unless they tied it to something (like gold, which I always thought was a good idea...  a commodity backed digital currency.  Like bitcoin but it would be "backed" by something which is what analysts keep bitching about bitcoin)
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:38:23
1% is nothing.  I've paid 5-10% in the past to buy in person.
For your small quantity buy, just pay the 1-2%.  Who cares.  It's a rounding error in the larger scheme of things.

Can you better explain the ATM project?  I don't follow the inside-baseball stuff enough to know who that might be, but as far as I know those machines have been built and one has already been installed?  And, I'd assume there are 1000 other companies looking to do the same thing, no?
That said, the guys in our office have been trying to contact the bitcoinatm guys for some time and have gotten no where.  Have they given up on the project?
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:17:15
Thanks all. If/when it funds I'll for sure give him his cash. I did this out of the office where houstonbits works and they buy and sell 100s (?) a day. I don't want to hurt their rep (and I'm not the type to scam someone anyway)
but noted: no person to person sales from coinbase. But even if he were to transfer them to another wallet first it would have taken a long time since we have to wait for THAT transaction. 
if someone calls me again I'll just tell them to transfer out of coinbase before showing up. 
side question: what's the easiest way to do person to person transactions?
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:08:00
You can't buy with credit card due to charge backs, but if someone was smart, they'd sell bitcoins the same way some gold and silver places sell.
You give them a CC# to "hold" the order and lock it in.  Then you have 1-2 days to send in and have your wire clear.  Then your coins are shipped.  If the market drops, and you try to cancel your order via not doing the wire, then your card is charged for the drop.
Sure in some cases I'm sure there is big drops and people cancel their order AND charge back the charge of the loss, but it's so rare that someone should be able to setup a system like this and still do well by charging ~2-5% over "market" for BTC to cover those instances.
Only when they're easier to buy will bitcoin take off.  Right now it's WAAAY too f'ing hard.  Most people end up in a dead end of countless shady sites.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:12:24
Isn't Safari a pretty good "app" for checking the price via any number of sites?  And aren't there already 1000 apps to check price, do calculations, etc?

@_date: 2013-06-13 13:20:41
Houstonbits or locabitcoins. Those are the only options for buying anonymous.  Bitfloor was better than both those options but they're gone.
 I'm willing to pay a big premium to buy easily and without having to show ID (which I can do when I buy anything else, so why not bitcoin?)
campbx is good if you don't mind giving out personal info.

I buy some items locally in Houston using paper wallets from a local place.
And while it's not a high %, we do accept RENT payments from tenants via bitcoin.  We've even setup our systems where when payment hits our account:
it puts the payment onto the tenants ledger just as if they paid via our "standard" ACH method.
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:48:10
Coinbase is "easy", I'll give you that.  I still don't like all the bullcrap of having to share all my details plus having only "money in the system" going to bitcoins.
What if someone has $5k in cash and wants bitcoins?  To get it to coinbase you have to open a bank account, explain where the money came from, have the IRS possibly on your nuts, etc.  And what if you have $10k to buy bitcoins?  $50k?
I loved bitfloor.   *THATS* what we need again.  Bitfloor was the best  :(
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:39:31
I feel you. We have HoustonBits in Houston where you can do 3-5k at a time (harder with bitfloor gone) but previously I had the exact same issue. Its a joke.

Transfer instantly? I find the time of transfer one of the biggest negatives. Try 30+ minutes. I transferred to an exchange to send to someone and after about 45 min it still said "pending" so I couldn't send coins from the exchange to the person I was trying to do business with. 
that needs to be fixed. Or at least acknowledged. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:34:53
The problem isn't one of the cost, the problem is the fees to cover the cost would have people all bent out of shape thinking they're being ripped off.
Just like the other currency converters.  They charge a fee and people don't like it.  But having physical space to rent, a person to pay, risk of holding costs, and need for profit have a cost that should equal the convenience provided.
A bitcoin ATM has different (perhaps lower) costs but they're still there.  If the ATM charged ~5% over/under mtgox on buys/sells I assume we'd be cool with that?  
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:28:41

Till bitcoin is universally accepted, you still need to get money in and out of the bitcoin economy.  If someone has $10k cash and they want to buy bitcoins (or $10k in bitcoins and want to cash out), doing so isn't all that easy.  Having a 'bitcoin friendly' bank would help a lot.

It's very possible that CloneCoin (not real) decides that their "catch" will be making their coins easier to buy.   And maybe that company will get the critical mass needed to become the standard.

Like fingers said, the million dollar question is: how do you fund the exchange? That's the weakness of all existing exchanges. They are hard to fund, or their options for funding are hard to fund. 
Fund like bitfloor did (minus the shutting down of course :) and you have a winner. Be just another exchange that's a pain to fund and you really have to work to explain what value you bring that other don't already provide. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 14:00:30
There are some places you can send $ to via money order and buy at/near mtgox pricing.
campbx will fund your account via money order and allow you to trade
houstonbits will sell you btc based on the price at the time money is sent (so if BTC goes up 20% while the check is in the mail, good for you.  If it goes down 20% while the check is in the mail, good for them)
+ I'm sure there are others.

I don't think people want to wait an hour to check out at Walmart.  And the blockchain would be even larger.
Till something is in place to 'auto prune' the blockchain (do we really need a record of EVERY transaction EVER?) and find a work around the confirmation time issue, Wallmart and companies like them won't touch it.  Maybe for online orders -- not in person.

I've seen the spread between BTC-e and mtgox even larger.  LIke $15+.  Try to get $usd into BTC-e so you can buy from them, then you'll see why it's cheaper.
The only way is okpay and my chase account literally got locked just for trying to fund okpay so I could fund btc-e.
btc-e is a joke and the lower pricing there reflects that.

ElGreat:  At this point offering a special is difficult as there is no benifit (in fact, there are several negatives) and the only special we could offer is a reductino in rent.  Given the other negatives, a reduction of rent would only compound the 'costs'.
So why bother?  Trying to spread the word.  Most tenants pay online (via ACH, which is built into the web based property management system) and we haven't been able to figure out how to plug in bitcoin into that system.  They'll continue to pay via ACH for a while.  However, the ones that pay cash we're basically allowing them to use HoustonBits to convert to bitcons and pay.  They get full value of their $USD towards rent so I guess the "special" is the offering of conversion of $usd to BTC at no cost.

"Having a way to pay wages anonymously is a pretty scary possibility."
Are you kidding?   More things should be anonymous as not everything is everyones business!
Employees and employers are free to enter whatever contract both find beneficial.  An employee has labor he's trying to sell and an employee has labor hes trying to buy.  What terms they come up with are only up to them (or should be).
If they agree on $usd, BTC, or water buffalo -- it's no one elses concern.
On new employees I hire, their wadges are still in $usd but *all bonuses are now in BTC* (though I'm half assing and paying bonuses in BTC based on their $uds value at the time vs. paying in BTC per event.  A "true" BTC believer would operate in BTC and not be as concerned with it's fiat conversion)

I like the idea of person-to-person transactions that don't require the blockchain.  Until small/easy/fast purchases are -- well -- easy and fast, then paper/coin versions of bitcoin are interesting to me.  They function as silver certificates used to before we moved to fiat.
Plus the paper wallet they sell has a taper proof private key so they would buy it back knowing I don't have the private key as it hasn't been tampered with.  And, of course, there is a bit of trust involved on both sides from the get-go.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:24:10

Sorry but I use companies that ignore those laws.  If I want to buy $5k in BTC that's my business.  I don't want to get onto some DHS, IRS, or other 'watch list' because I was reported to the US Govt via KYC/AML laws they followed.
Now I also wouldn't KEEP a ton of money in those exchanges because they might (sadly) get shut down.  But that doesn't mean I won't use them like they're the greatest thing ever so long as they do exist (bitfloor while it lasted, and the local shop in Houston I use now)
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:36:58
The guys in the office next to me took a $4k order from someone out of state. Price I'd locked to timestamp on mail. So I assume (unless they had the coins in "stock") they'll make a few bucks on the deal. Though I guess someone could mail in a money order, have the price shoot up, and the seller would be hosed. 
buying via delay of mailing has a bit of rate risk on both sides. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 00:56:25
They're a 'real life' store and I know the owner so I'm not worried.  They buy/sell tons every day -- I'd say  10% paper, 10% via mail [money orders], and 80% come-in-and-pay-cash.  It's not much more than I'd pay via an exchange and I don't have to deal with any BS.  And I can easily sell them the 'paper' right back if I want.  Or, in theory I could sell someone else the paper assuming they'd trust them.
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:10:45
HoustonBits.com will send you money order or wire to your account for any bitcoins sent. Price is locked at the time coins are transferred. They'll also sell them for money orders, price is locked based on time sent.

The absolute best system was bitloor. By MILES. But look what happened to them.

Closing the bank account so no more cash could come in or out shouldn't mean anyone with BTC in their bitfloor account should have that locked up to, no?
Edit:  Disregard, I see you can still get btc out.  Good luck to all those that had cash in your account.  Luckily we only had about $.30

All the "KYC" and "AML" laws sure make it hard to buy in any serious quantity.  I can get pretty sizable chunks from HoustonBits.com but even they're low on supply at times.
Need more places that ignore all the $UDS rules as the $UDS rules *ARE* regulating BTC (try to go and buy $5k worth today.  How would you do it?)

blah:  I understand that they thought something fishy was going on, however a few weeks ago I had to setup another forgin wire (for some other excahnge I was trying to get money to).
Normally they'd call/txt if they thought something was going on, not just shut it down and tell me to go into the branch.  Plus, I have a pretty large biz account with them.  I realize they are a big bank but how about calling me and saying "Hey Cody, is this legit or?"
But all that said, even after coming into the branch, they wouldn't "let" me wire to okpay?  That doesn't seem odd?
This is also the bank that made me wait 11 days to pull out some of my cash (granted, it was a good amount, but still).

Why not have the default bitcoin wallet just have a mining tab that once pressed starts mining in this type of pool. Credits are deposited right into the wallet
trying to figure out how to mine is a pain in the ass (for average Joe). If this pool was setup as a one button push default in the wallet app, most everyday users would join.

legallegends:  If you're worried about locking in a PRICE today but don't need to have coins in your account to SPEND today you can buy them from HoustonBits.com.  They sell you bitcoins based on the price the money order / cashiers check is SENT (based on time stamp).  If it doubles between the time you send the money and they get it, good for you.  However, if it goes down in the few days while you wait for the mail to arrive, then it's still sold to you at the price it was when sent.
While most of their customers are still walk ins (they are in my building), they're getting more and more mail-in money from people that want to lock in a price.
So anyway... While this isn't a solution to instant bitcoins in your wallet, if you don't need to spend them right away it's a good solution to locking in a price.
Check them out.  They're who I get my coins from.
@_date: 2013-06-13 00:21:42
I don't care if its from a credit check or not. This is disgusting. The amount of info you are required to fork over to do anything has gotten out of control. I'm sure BitInstant is just following some rule, but you know what? FUCK that rule. 
Oh how I miss bitfloor. Deposit cash at any BofA, have your exchange funded. Easy. In fact, it was so easy it got shut down. The closest thing we have to that is bitinstamt where you need to consent to a full cavity search and a $500 limit. 
I'd rather pay the extra and buy via localbitcoins. Or luckily I can go to Houstonbits and give them (almost) however much cash I want and get coins. They don't care who I am. Why should they?
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:34:00
The problem with CampBX is the same as the rest:  It's a pain to get money in for most people.  Wire?  days and not anonomous.  Cash?  You have to buy a money order, no more than $1k, and mail it to them.  Then they have a few of the other ways to get them money, but to get money into THOSE places requires the same hurdles.
Bitfloor was the only one where if someone had a pile of cash, they could convert to bitcoin super fast and easy.
I've been buying my coins locally from HoustonBits.com but they're not selling many because without bitfloor they can't sell more than they buy since other exchanges are hard to fund on large scales.

Thanks for the comments.  It was just an idea.  Something I'd thought I'd "offer" to someone that was really a believer.  If they thought bitcoins were the way to go then I'd be willing to take the risk with them and setup the lease where it was $x/month.  Maybe they get dinged, maybe we get dinged.
But I concede that it could be a very bad idea.  If they go way down (in $usd) then tenant is happy.  If they go way up in $usd then I'm sure there would be a way to get out of that type of lease payment arrangement.

I'm getting about 2000 kh/s on my machine w/ 4x 7970s.  Maybe switch to ltc instead and convert to btc.  To me, that is a better way to get btc.
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:45:05
I've always thought that THIS will be the main killer of bitcoin.  The idea is great, but there are too many other established companies and even governments that could come up with something that vendors start accepting in mass.  Then bitcoin goes down in history as the thing that started it all -- then faded out to the 2.0 version.
Right now there are already tons of others that people keep jumping on.  litecoin, ripple, etc.  As new ones come out, they cost pennies, so people buy them to jump in early, forgetting about the last one that just came out before.
@_date: 2013-06-13 14:11:47
Mail a money order to campbx is about as close to "cash" as you're going to get. Still need to identify yourself though. 
If you want cash-cash then localbitcoins and pay a bit of premium. 
There are a few half way versions where you can mail a money order anonymously and get coins. I use a local company that sells this way I just don't want to plug them again.

I don't like the fact that you can easily check the balance of a wallet.  I guess that's just the way the blockchain works since -- as I understand -- you don't really "hold" any coins.  Only a key that represents your ownership of part of the blockchain log for your coins.
Even if you have multiple wallets, you still need to transfer to a wallet for transactions.  And that transfer is recorded, so people can go and view that wallet.
I realize you can 'tumble' and work around this but it's a bit of a pain just to hide what you have.
* BTC is instant, but it takes a long time to confirm
* BTC is anonymous but all your wallet info/purchases are logged
* BTC is free to transfer, but after the expense of getting money into the 'system' (and $$ to get it out)
I'm a BTC fan, just saying there are a few real flaws...
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:27:13
Or we need people to just ignore all these stupid rules around KYC, FinCEN and other government BS.  Risky? Hell yes, but they can't go after everyone.
If I have $20k and want to buy bitcoins, I want to do it with no hassle.  If someone has $20k and wants to buy my bitcoins, that's my own damn business.
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:03:31
Can it?  YES, but it would take someone with a LOT of bitcoins and a large wallet to MAINTAIN the peg.  For example, right now it's $115 or so.  To drive it to $100, a group that wanted to hold a $100 peg would have to own a ton of BTC to sell into the market to drive the price down.  And if the price fell below $100, they'd have to be willing to keep buying until the price went back up.
So yes you COULD maintain a peg if you wanted to, but it wouldn't be cheap or easy.  It's a lot easier to keep a price of 'at least' $100 (by buying whenever it goes under) than 'no more than' $100 as that requires selling into the market.  And if the market is willing to pay more, eventually you run out of your ability to sell into it.
Plus a lot of people buy BTC because they think the $usd is going to go to shit.  SO if we hit any type of semi hyper-inflation, maintaining a peg would be impossible (or rather, extremely improbable)
@_date: 2013-05-01 11:49:39
My guess is that bitcoins will be "represent" by cards/bills the way dollars used to be represented by gold/silver for local every day use.  For in person transactions, I'd rather have the option of using coins/bills to transfer my bitcoins.  I'll save the digital wallet stuff for online payments/transfers.

lordlicorice, Sorry, I was adding all the various things various exchanges ask for (with some sarcasm at the end)
But to my point.  My bank user/password?.  So on a paper wallet product, while they COULD have the private key, I trust a local place I can walk into (but to be fair, also know the owner of) via sending my bank account USER/PASS to an online site.
It's just funny to hear people worry that these guys might be storing the private keys to steal my money but at the same time there is no fear in all the data we have to give exchanges?   That's not to say I'm worried about the exchanges robbing me.  I just don't like the fact I have to give them so much info to buy.  Which is why I buy local (and suggest others do the same -- IF they're concerned with the privacy aspect of BTC)

Tip   Easy way to get bitcoins.  This is a common complaint and the biggest drawback.  You can't expect people to use them and accept them if they're so hard to get.
Tip   The GUI for wallets/mining needs to improve.  Seriously, it's a joke.  Fine for (most of) us, but stupid for most people.
@_date: 2013-04-30 11:14:09
LetAnimalsLive:  The same reason you spend CASH today, even though that cash could buy BTC which you could hold onto.  So if you think BTC is going up and thus would be silly to spend, then then same thing could be said about spending cash (which is just BTC you haven't bought yet)
Edit:  People buy a new PC when they know next year it'll be cheaper (or better for the same price).  People buy new TV's when they know next year they'll be cheaper (or their dollar will have 'gone up in value' -- AT LEAST SO FAR AS WHAT TV YOU CAN BUY).   
We see some aspects of deflation all the time in technology but people still by 'today' when they know something better/cheaper is right around the corner.
This is why I don't buy the 'deflation is bad' argument.  Not sure how increase in purchase power is bad.

I sent my manager to buy some coins for me after putting the info into bitinstant.com, he didn't have my ID, couldn't buy.  I thought bitinstant would be anonymous. 
Bitinstant kinda sucks.  They get cash, give bitcoins.  Why the need for ID?  phone number?
Someone needs to come up with bitfloor 2.0.  Drop off $10k to BoA, shows up in your exchange account, buy bitcoins.  Best model ever for buying (sad they got shut down)

I bought a machine from HoustonBits that generates a good amount of LTC a day.  Though it'll be a while before it ever makes a profit (after electricity).  Best thing to do is mine on a high end game machine while otherwise idle.  If your electricity is cheap enough, you'll make a few bucks.
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:33:32
I'm all for low fees, but you have to remember these people are providing a service.  For your trade, they made a few bucks.  And also, they have their own costs of getting money "in the system" so THEY can buy the coins they sell to you.  And they have people, servers, and their own costs.  After all that, they made maybe a $1 for providing the service to you.

hyh: The problem is a big advantage touted by bitcoin fans is being anonymous.  With Campbx, not only do you have to "verify" yourself, but you have to wire, which requires you have cash in another verified account of a bank, who is obligated to ask a bunch of questions if you give them money to be used to send over to a place like campbx.  Again, I know this isn't a fault of campbx or bitcoin, they're just following the rules.
Perhaps bitfloor was closed precisely BECAUSE it was the best/simplest/most anonymous"?

(source:  I used to work for a server company that sold x86 based servers to ILM &amp; Disney for their render farms)
Up until at least 3-4 years ago, all sever farms were made up of "simple" dual proc Intel/AMD CPUs.  Basically a single frame in a movie could take 4-20 HOURS to render.  So the idea was the more servers, the faster you can render.  Split the frames out, or have each node work on 1/4 the frame, etc. This isn't only important for final output, but for in-progress viewing of work.  The more the better.
We also sold machines to oil and gas companies where they were used for scientific data processing.
I left before "GPGPU" became popular.  I believe most oil/gas companies have redone part of their code to take advantage of GPUs but most renderfarms have not.  (GPUs, while awesome at some things, suck at others.  CPUs have their place still)
As such, most render farms would be all CPU mining, which isn't really worth the power consumed.   And I'd imagine, that most compute farms w/ GPUs likely make more money doing the work they were bought to do (i.e., seismic data processing) than they would mining.  The sever rooms I've been in have MASSIVE costs for power/cooling, space and people.  They however make massive profits by doing the work they were designed to do.
While there is money to be made in mining on scale (at least till ASIC kills it for BTC), it's best to be done where the machines are configured specifically for mining (i.e., cheapest everything save ATI video cards). 
I bought a machine from HoustonBits.com and with the increase in cost of LTC it'll pay for itself faster than I thought (I still tell people it's more of a novelty than anything else, so don't buy one to get rich.  Think of it as a high end gaming machine that can make a few bucks when it's not being used for gaming)

Good to know that localbitcoins has a system to make the trade secure.  Needs to be other easier ways to do it for bitcoins to be able to be used for (easy ) local purchases.
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:20:47
The website operator (I assume) is buying at "spot" when an order is placed.  So you're right, if mtgox is $150, and my $150 USD buys me one BTC, I don't care if he paid $1 USD for it or $200 USD.
HOWEVER, what he is asking is what price is used TO DETERMINE the price that deposited cash will get converted into BTC?
That's what I liked about bitfloor.  You go to Bank of America, give them cash, and it shows up *in your exchange* as cash.  You can then buy as little or as much at market or and limit orders as you want. (or, rather, wantED :(
@_date: 2013-05-23 01:00:15
I buy them like that because I can just give them cash, get the wallet, put it away.  Just trying to make the process easier.  I've checked the ballances.  They're fine.  Could they have copied down all the private keys and jack the balances?  I guess.  But they could also rob me when I walk in.  Again, I nkow the owner and they're a real shop so I'm not worried.  And hell, people mail them money orders to buy BTC and people send them BTC (in exchange for getting money via money orders or paypal) so trusting them with a paper wallet seems easy.
Think about how much info you give to coinbase and others.  Bank details, user/passwords, all sorts of ID, social, etc.  I feel safer with a local place, even if they could have the priv key, then I do with all the online crap.

I work with Fat Property (the company in the post -- thus the "FP").  We're just over 1% that we've gotten to pay with bitcoins.  It's not easy since tenants either haven't heard of bitcoin or don't want to go through the hoops to buy them.  So we are using HoustonBits.com to do the exchange

All great in theory, but if you want to buy my widget that I could sell for $100 USD, how would that be priced in BTC?
So long as $usd ('fiat' in the more general sense) is the main way people think about the value of goods and services, then what BTC is worth in relation to $usd matters.  Even if you never plan to 'cash out' your BTC
It's also useful for getting cash into the system.  Sometimes there will be people that want to sell their BTC for cash and vice versa.  Having 'market data' of 100000s of people doing this all over the globe is a good way of discovering price supports.

That would be awesome.  I think people were selling their pre-orders on ebay because they lost faith (or could make $).  If they're actually shipping I bet people cancel their preorder ebay listings (or they go way up in price)

when I give someone a bag of cash for bitcoins, we are both breaking the laws re "KYC" and AML. But what-the-fuck-ever. Some laws are so dumb that doing business with someone that breaks them is more positive than negative.

Can you put this into context for those of us that are not "insiders"?
* What is this foundation?  Is it "official" or?
* What are these 'recent events' that have you all bent out of shape?
* What did you do as part of this foundation?
* Who is Gavin Andresen (yeah, I could google, but I mean in this context) and what fees does he have?
* I don't mean to sound like a dick with this last question but: Why should we care about this?

The ONLY option is via credit card?  I'm sitting in my home office and get this e-mail.  I actually enjoy my paper wired.  It's the only magazine I get and have since the start.
However I don't have my wallet on me and was surprised that credit card was the *ONLY* way to pay.  Of all companies, why not BTC?  If they accepted BTC I'd have paid and it would have been a done deal.  Now I'll have to remember to follow the e-mail link later when I have my wallet on me.
Weak Wired...  Weak...

You know, you had me till the lame jab at fox news?  I watch a lot of different news programs (including Fox! OMG!@ and I haven't found that Fox News gives bitcoin a bad name vs. other news outfits.
If you don't like Fox News, that's cool.  But must some people try to slam it in every unrelated context?

They can't offer a hard quote!  If BTC goes down, no one would then turn over their money.  They'd end up ONLY selling to people if the price went up after their quote.
You get the price that BTC is at when the funds are sent.  That's the way it works.   
The only other way is compaines that'll lock in the price at the time the money is SENT.  HoustonBits goes off of the time stamp on the evenlope when money is sent.  If BTC goes up $5, they eat it.  If it goes down, the customer eats it.
But again, all this is just funding.  BTC swings all over the place so a few % here or there to buy is meaningless in the long run -- even the short run.   If you are buying to day trade, your origional fiat -&gt; BTC is going to be expensive.  But after that you can get in and out of BTC easliy INSIDE of the exchange.

I'd rather pay cash and pay 10% more to just get them locally then deal with the 1000 online sites that all are a pain in the ass and take days.

I got some "way" back in the ~$1 days.  Sold at $40 before the giant pop.  When they hit $200 I felt pretty stupid.  Then they settled around $100.  I almost thought about getting more again but I just can't wrap my head around the "old" price to get myself to buy at the new price.
I just checked and they're at ~$70 now and falling it seems.
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:49:46
The guys in the office next to me (HoustonBits) bought $8,000 in BTC from a guy at ~$140'ish the day before the drop.  
It happens man....

You scoff but I always thought the one thing that would kill (rather devalue) bitcoin was a "bitcoin 2" that was more "official" (for lack of a better word) that the masses would adopt.  
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:06:02
thoughtcourier: send me their info. I don't see any ads that are not stale or crazy high.  Some are lower than mtgox but in most cases, people havent' been too responsive.
But really, I can get $5k worth for 5% over from HoustonBits (or maybe 2-3k).  .So my question was more in general. Not everyone lives in a major city.
@_date: 2013-05-17 15:32:12
That assumes bitcoin as we know it today lasts that long.  I think bitcoin will stay with us for many years, but I think something else will take it's place as the main crypt currency.  I don't see people in the future using bitcoin as some others on here do.  
Everyday Jane and Joe won't be paying for their starbucks with bitcoins ever IMO.

CampBX is good but still not quick and easy to get money TO them. Let me know when I can drop money off at a bank (ala bitfloor) to fund my exchange account.

Invalid question as it's not going anywhere.  This goofball can make whatever claim he wants.
Unless he makes a claim on the last piece of cake, I wouldn't worry.
@_date: 2013-05-23 01:15:51
My guess is by supplying the needs of someone that might need to buy/sell a LOT of them.  If you had $10k in BTC and wanted to cash out, how would you do it?  It raises red flags at exchanges (KYC/AML and the like).  What if you wanted to buy $10k?  Also a pain.
I don't think they're making much $ by selling a single BTC to a guy for $125 that they buy for $120.  But give someone the ability to liquidate 100's of them (or buy 100's of them) in cash and it becomes worth it.
For all the anonymity of BTC, it's not very anonymous when the exchanges ask for ID, SS# and a damn blood sample just to buy (and that's when buying in small qty)
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:30:21
If you were buying/selling BTC (or, to the point of what we hope people do -- accpeting it as payment), what "value" do you put on it?  Obviosuly for now you look at it's price in $usd (at least those who use $usd in their country).  So assuming you want to charge $50 for a service, you'd look to see how many bitcoins (partial) $50 would buy.  But what exchange do you use to give that number?  MtGox is the biggest, but with their issues and lag, is that the best?
I ask as I have some people wanting to buy (locally) bitcoins and I see $105 on mtGox and $87 on BTC-e.  That's quite a range.
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:34:43
In fairness Im sure you realize the opposite can happen. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:08:13
Coinbase is a joke. Low limits. Same pain to get them your $. Always out of coins. And you can't fund and buy with limit orders. Like bitinstant you can only convert from cash right to what they say btc costs at the moment. 
honestly bitfloor was by far the best. Seems there is a lot of $ to make by someone filling their shoes. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:02:47
I noticed on the site you can make a paper wallet but it only takes about 1/3 of the page.  Any way to make it so you can select to make 3 (?) wallets per piece of paper so it's full?
Edit:  Also, what about making a "page 2" that had the back info.  That way those of us with duplex printers could just print 'two' pages and have both front and back on there.
@_date: 2013-05-23 11:53:00
I've said in earlier posts that mentioned this company '*in full disclosure, I know these guys. They work out of my building'*.  I didn't think I needed to add that every time.
Beyond knowing the owner, I have no need to 'name drop'.  And given most of their business is local walk-in, I don't think they'll get much advantage of out a name drop here.
I just thought it was a funny thing that happened that reddit might enjoy.  But, for what it's worth, I've edited the name out so as not to change the topic to something so negative.

@_date: 2013-05-01 12:26:48
HoustonBits will buy via cashiers check using the mtgox -5% or so but you have to send them the coins first so there is that risk factor.  However they're a legit place with a real physical store.
(disclosure: They work in my building, and I've seen them do 1000 transactions including some for out of state people)

@_date: 2013-04-13 17:14:46
Totally agree. But you still have the fact that compaines are not charging x bitcoins for a shirt.  They're charging USD-&gt;BTC for a shirt.  
When you see prices in bitoins "firm" regardless of their USD-&gt;BTC conversion, then we'll have something.

Ill save you some time. These are the four everyone always suggests:
o Bitinstant: low limits (under $1k). Can't fund an exchange for trading, only "buy on the spot" (using mtgox price)
o Localbitcoins: way high price, who knows how many they have, "stranger risk", hard to get people to actually reply and meet. 
o Dwolla: good luck getting confirmed. Send them all your personal details, blood samples, wait. Wait. Wait. Then once confirmed wait for bank transfer. Which means all sorts of other limits due to "KYC" and other bullshit
o campbx: similar to dwalla but at least you can buy from them vs it just an account to fund in other to fund another exchange. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:04:41
Yeah, I have (personally) a dwolla account.  I sent them a chunk of cash on the 18th. Still pending.  doesn't solve the issue of anonymity that a lot of people might care about (and if you're really into bitcoins, that's one of the reasons).  Also doesn't do much for speed seeing as this was 3 days ago (given 2 of them were weekend days)

The company owns and manages 500 or so units with $300k/month of rent roll.  Doing an experiment with a few tenants just for the sake of experiment isn't going to crash the company.

Why doesn't SD just take BTC from a user to fund an account, then that amount is gambled with and their account goes up/down.  A user can then 'cash out' and put money back in their wallet, or add more.
That's the way I thought it worked.  Is literally EVERY bet from EVERY user recorded on the blockchain?  If so, why would they do that vs. just having accounts funded and used?
It would be like if I went to a poker site and EVERY hand won/loss was a credit/debit on my visa card.  That would be stupid.  Rather, my account on the poker site is funded, goes up/down depending on my activity, and then is cashed out.
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:39:01
But bitfloor was USD -&gt; an exchange where you could buy at market or however you wanted.   The rest ("Sugar Mama" [really???], Bitinstant) are $usd -&gt; bitcoin.  I liked being able to fund an exchange and buy when/how I wanted.
The HoustonBits guys would fund $8-10k chunks, but only convert from $usd to BTC as someone came in and wanted to buy them in person.  Now you have to go from USD -&gt; BTC instantly on funding which makes it hard to sell in real time as you have rate risk.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:12:43
Everyone can accept bitcoin, but they're really just accepting $usd.  The price someone will charge in bitcoins is directly related to how many dollars a bitcoin is worth.  And once you buy via bitcoin, most vendors convert to usd as that's how they pay suppliers, employees, etc.
Bitcoin (or something like it) will take off when bitcoins can be left in the system (for lack of better word).  Till then, the ability to pay via bitcoin (on sites like wordpress) are more gimicky than anything else.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:06:32
I gave the manager $20k to start in case we got a bunch of sellers off the bat.  Still got the $20k to buy.   No way to buy a large amount that I can see with the exception of a 3-5 day wire.
