Dumbest thing to do right now.

True, I used to be in this Subreddit everytime. Buying bitcoin left and right. Then shit happened where fees went too high. I cant even send my newly bought bitcoin to Exchanges to trade since I'll be slapped with 30usd tx fee. Lost my interest and liquidated all my bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:20:36
Can someone explain to me why people are so surprised with this? This is already available since like 5/6 months ago. Are there any changes whatsoever?
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:05:26
Ok. This is Out Of Topic. But damn. I just realized. Andreas is a lookalike of a "Person in every Dream". HOLY SHIT. It gave me goosebumps!! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:44:15
Moms spaghetti 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:21:00
Same here!! Thats the exact error im receiving. So now the emtire metwork is fucked? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:21:59
We dont need "Very close". We want "Now"!!

You can say all you want to me. I know that I'm not some paid shillers out here. My reddit account hasnt been bought. What else... Hmmm. Maybe if you manage to convince yourself that there is a problem that would be great. Else you are just a blind follower of a cult following. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:25:06
How can people fucking buy if the fee in coinbase is 40 dollars. And now multiple wallets are not working. Cant even send the transaction!  This is so fruatrating. All i wany is to liquidate all my bitcoin holdings. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:44:12
That's not the point. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:50:09
I can fucking set a custom fee on my current wallet but as you can see. It wont even allow me to send the transaction. There is a fucking error. Check the other post on (new) . Even tressor is having a problem sending right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:46:22
It just did. 15200 usd
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:41:32
Im quite confuse. This has already been availble for testing like 5 Months ago. What's new? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:53:49
If you are really holding til zero then you are delusional. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:35:57
This is so true!
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:04:35
I'm into bitcoin since last year. And I would say yes. For me. Ita kinda useless right now even for depositing on the exchange bcoz of high fee. And believe me when I say this. We have a facebook  group chat of all my friends that is into crypto and we all agree that Bitcoin right now is really not ideal for transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:48:36
I believe they push it back.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:45:04
But WHAT IF NOT?? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:30:18
Wow dude.  Dont you dare say that I'm a noob or shills. As an investor i want to hold coin that is currently working. That's why i want to trade it to other crypto. But dont fucking worry though, the Bitcoin Network now wont allow me to send my transaction and forcing me to hold this Godforsaken coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:46:29
So much for a "Free Country".
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:56:59
I also thought about this, either way, there is still time, the first future will go Live this December 10th amaright?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:25:51
So what if not? Please explain. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:23:21
Just dont buy this Godforsaken coin right now. Just fucking dont!
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:43:10
How would you know people will treat BCH as Shitcoin in Coinbase when they see a cheap ass fee? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:35:13
Alright. Cheap ass fee are not good sign for a coin. So crypto that has literal no fee is the worst? Lol yah ok. I rest my case. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:27:16
Umm. Because we dont want bitcoin anymore and want to jump ship to other crypto? 
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:57:47
Grow up mate. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:51:38
IKR. i dont know if this is a curse or a blessing in disguise. lol. But yeah, I always HODL and I always WIN. hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:34:58
Fucking disgusting people. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:06:01
This is the wallet that keeps getting hack/missing bitcoin right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:23:06
It will confirmed for sure so do t worry. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:58:50
I think this is much better than bitcoinfees.21.co because it already shows BTC/Kb which is the default unit that you need to input in most Android Wallet. The fact that I still need to convert BTC/byte -&gt; BTC/Kb is quite annoying.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:34:54
You said on your previous reply that you bought at 250 USD? Why so desperate?
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:59:19
lol. You could easily say that this subreddit is made up of meme.
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:51:17
What's the reason though?
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:39:52
Bitcoin "WILL" hit x5, then the next sentence, "IF" it really does. Quality Shitpost mate.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:21:10
Don't use that link mate. Use this.  - That might be their legacy site. And yes, Coins.ph is super legit. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:06:07
It is, but that is not the default unit most of the Android Wallet use. The only wallet that i knew that use sat/byte is Blockchain Android Wallet but I don't want to use that one. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:01:23
Ok, I'll be trying one of those later when I'm not very busy. Looking forward also for others here who might have already tried this 1sat/byte fee using Android Wallet. Please shed some light on me. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:52:40
Unfortunately, I do not have Hard Wallet but I'm planning to buy one once I got a significant amount invested. Anyway, are you saying that it is not possible to set my TX Fee to 1sat/byte when using (ANY) Android Wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:39:41
But how can I exactly do this using android wallet? I'm trying to set my default transaction fee to the cheapest possible but it's still saying my fee is $0.23 (22sat/byte).
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:12:41
No, There is no way you could access your wallet using your "BTC Wallet Address". You need to have the private key or in your case, the **wallet.dat** file to actually access it. If your laptop hard drive is still fine, I suggest that you don't bring your laptop for repair, you can just plug it to other computer, you can use hard drive enclosure or something, then search for wallet.dat file then use Bitcoin Wallet (PC) paste wallet.dat in main folder then hope for the best.
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:47:03
Wow nice. I never knew you could accelerate the tx. Thanks man ill try this! 
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:45:08
Its also very easy to cash out here in the Philippines. You only have to send Bitcoin to your coins.ph btc wallet -&gt; convert BTC to local currrency (PHP) -&gt; Withdraw the fiat using Security Bank ATM (Cardless Option) - You only need to input the code sent to your mobile in the ATM machine and the your done.
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:02:14
you forgot /s
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:32:04
OT. Everytime I see Andreas, I always thought of this. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:48:59
well this is awkward.
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:31:03
seriously though, that's one ugly UI. When I first got into Bitcoin, people suggested that I use Mycelium but after installing it I'm like nah, ugliest shit ever. Doesn't even follow the Android Material Design. I'm using Coinomi Wallet BTW.
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:31:08
Ok lets ban reddit now. lol.
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:43:07
Well I'll be damned.
