Yes, it will be very interesting. I don't know enough about the technicals of bitcoins, but is it possible, knowing the address, to know the balance of an address? 
That aside, however, I would suspect (or at least hope) that the suspect was smart enough to encrypt his wallet, which would effectively hide the address. So then the question becomes 'if the government knows that the bitcoins are stored in the wallet, do they need the addresses and private keys to make a case?"

Forgive my ignorance, but how would transaction fees help miners? Wouldn't that just be making money for the people making transactions?

ah, yeah - it's up to 9 or 10 GBs and growing, so I could understand that. I've never used anything else, so I couldn't tell you.

Ah, okay - that part makes sense then. BUUTTT - what happens many years from now when the hashing a block doesn't return any reward at all? Are people going to continue 'mining' out of the kindness of their heart?

The amount is irrelevant - what happens when the reward is so low miners stop mining? Doesn't that mean that the blocks will not get hashed, and the system falls apart?

Okay - so it seems that the transaction fees are an optional part on the senders end. So, three questions - 1, why would a sender choose to add in transaction fees? 2, could it get to a point in which people take bids to process these transactions? (i.e. - I'll hash the block for x amount), and 3, what happens if two people find the hash? How is it determined who found it first and who 'owns' the bitcoins? Wouldn't both miners have the private keys to that transaction fee?

Don't underestimate the ability of the prosecution to explain things. Why do you think some trials go on for months and month? And it's not *that* hard of a concept to explain, even without going into the technical details. 
"It's a form of digital currency - sorta like Disney fun bucks, but for the internet. But, the difference is, you have to know the 'password' for the 'fun bucks' to be able to spend them - and we know this guy has the password for the bitcoins because of xyz... we just don't know what the password is."

I've never trying what you are doing - but bitcoin-qt allows multiple keys and addresses, so I don't see why it wouldn't do what you want. Maybe I misunderstood your question.

Okay - that's what I figured. But, they would need to know that this guy 'owed' those addresses, though, right? I mean, other than looking into the guys bitcoin wallet, there really isn't a way to say "this guy owns this address?"
Side question, if you find a private key but *don't* know the address - it's pretty much useless, right? You have to know the address AND the private key, right?
