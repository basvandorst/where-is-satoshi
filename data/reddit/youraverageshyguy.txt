(verified level 2 here) They've since updated it, you will now get stopped from performing the instant buy.
After ticking the agreement box and clicking buy you get the following message:
"Sorry, the maximum number of purchases on Coinbase has been reached. This is a 24 hour rolling limit with no specific start time. Please try again later. We'll continue raising this limit over time."

There's a pretty good chance it's the address you enter in step one that is the issue.
If your address ends in "Road", "Court", or etc...
You need to enter it in as "Rd.", "Ct.", etc...
The emphasis is on the Capitalization and the punctuation.
That's what did the trick for me after trying for 14 days straight.

I shall give this method a try. I'm going on 2 weeks straight of trying every day...sigh. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:55:53
Holy fucking shit, haha! That worked! I'm absolutely ecstatic! Thank you for the idea.

14 days here... :\

Interesting. Well, I did say in my experience. I honestly have never had this level of trouble with an identity verification before. They must be using a system that is flawed or seriously picky.

I just tried idea from below and it worked for me. My address ends with "court", and I was entering it in as "court", "Court", "ct", "Ct".
This time around I entered "Ct." and it worked, so give that a try if you have a similar address ending.

Time to shut her down Hancock. It’s been a nice run.
Oh we are all gonna surely miss you, but it is time for you to move on.

Worth a shot. I literally entered the info in part 1 exactly the same every time and was tracking how I answered the questions. Then another user (check my history) mentioned this was what got him through and that it could be the issue. Tried it an hour later, and I was in too.

And here I sit hoping to buy some more after my first transaction clears today (maybe), well I guess there's always tomorrow...if the price doesn't skyrocket that is.

It might have something to do with being able to make a purchase via the app without apple getting a cut. I could very well be wrong though.

No issues here. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:22:58
It will take you to the 2nd stage regardless of entering the address correct or not in my experience.

I think you might be right. The format of the license plates on the cars in the reflection look very American.
EDIT: the one on the white suv looks similar to that of plates from Pennsylvania.

In the same boat. I've tried every day for 2 weeks and no dice. Even pulled my 3 credit reports to see if anything was off and still no luck. :\
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:31:25
Well, there's always

Must be trolling.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:23:14
Believe me, you and I are not the only ones. ;)

Coinbase is not an exchange though.
