I read the article. I am not sure who claimed that this was not a mutual cooperation.
I see no "aversion to government in the whole" in what I said. Surely the intelligence community (which could not possibly be described to be opposed to the concept of government) would not propose a different, less material method of assessment if it were their data which would have been breached in the frame of some local authority. As a general rule, there is no place for idealism in the evaluation of privacy, neither pro or contra government, state, etc.

But local laws etc. are not really relevant as far as privacy is concerned. It's still a huge breach of trust and another example of their random power grabs.

If a companies data is leaked there is (from a privacy perspective) no structural difference between it being leaked by accident, law or adversaries. It being caused by some local law does not reduce the breachs severity. (At best its consequences are somehow mitigated by local administrative constrains.)
You might have some point if you wanted to say that local laws are relevant for the overall assessment of the privacy value of a specific legislation or county. However, ex post, this has no relevance.
Regarding the random power grabs: I was cynical. They are of course not random. A power grab is when you enter a specific social dynamic in which your relative power was formerly very small and (by your behaviour) your relative power suddenly becomes very big. I did somehow expect the concept to be self explainatory.
