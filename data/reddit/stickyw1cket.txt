Only in Lightning though, rounding will be introduced if a channel balance goes to more than 8 decimal places. To get the core client to work lower than that a (hard?) fork is required.

Anonymity isn't a worry, it's my private key being stored in the cloud which is the issue.

Is it not a security risk to run it on an AWS session? I'm very interested in setting a Lightning Node up but I'm abroad for the next few months so this would suit me well.
