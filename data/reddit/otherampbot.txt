AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google]( and [hurts everyone else](
It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.
It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation.
It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.
