This isn't something to brag about to be honest....
I mean this is one of the dark sides of bitcoin.

"Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days." Is a lie....
Huh? Bitcoin is UP right now

A wild comment appeared!

hmm...So One issue I have with that. Your saying they are refunding. But are they going to cover your overdraft fees? :D Which can be anywhere from a simple $20 to $300+.. (Not saying you got overdrafted. But I imagine some people may)

Yeah. I know they are under no obligation to do so. But even if they refund what they took. They still made people lose money :D
Because I had it happen to me (my fault, Not someone else) overdrafted my account. And every TX after that was another $35 fee. It adds up....

Here is a quote from one of my old tickets with circle.
"Thanks for reaching out!
Circle does not currently support reloadable cards. While for all intents and purposes, PayPal cards seem to work like a standard debit card to the end user, the way that transactions are processed on these types of cards can lead to some major issues when linked to our system. In particular, many of our customers that have attempted to withdraw funds from Circle to their PayPal accounts have found that this will freeze their PayPal account. The process of unfreezing your PayPal funds can be laborious, and we highly recommend that you do not use such a card with Circle.
In the meantime, all US issued VISA and MasterCard credit or debit cards and most bank checking accounts are fully supported. Please let us know if you have any additional questions about this, or if there is anything else we can do to help.
Bernard, Team Circle"
