Fiat has no intrinsic value either unless you count burning it for heat. 
The only things with intrinsic value are commodities like gold, silver, etc. Everything else including stock are only worth what people will give unless you can own enough stock to actually change the company. 
99% of us don't have that kind of money, so to us stock and btc are the same; it is just an investment vehicle. However, stock is incredibly difficult to trade for goods while btc can be traded fairly easily (high fees though atm though).
My point is that we use USD as a baseline but it isn't required to give BTC or any other coin value. Without fiat it would still hold value, we would probably compare it to gold though.

No. Everything has value based on what you can get for it. I can go trade btc for real goods therefore it has value independent of the dollar or euro. Fiat currency is not required to give btc value, people willing to take btc in exchange for stuff is required. 
If all fiat currencies disappeared, other things would still have value. We simply use the dollar as baseline because it is the most common currency. Btc is just another currency and it has value independent of other currencies.

Is there anything inherently wrong with him pumping as long as he isn't dumping? The insider trading stuff is a different conversation if he were involved, but I'm not sure him publicly and financially supporting any single coin is wrong. We are all entitled to our opinions. 
I haven't kept up with the climate in the past few years so I'm genuinely curious on most of these people. I lost a bit on the mtgox fiasco and it soured me to where I stopped paying attention.
