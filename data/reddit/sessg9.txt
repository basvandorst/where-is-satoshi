I did get rich fairly quick. I got rich fairly quick by analyzing what this block chain was becoming over time while everyone else was spending and trading their commodities.

I can? what exactly "can" I?

And I am sure those who have used bitcoin as cash in the past for simple goods and services are happy with their spending? Multi million dollar pizza's and outdated video cards? Satoshi is not God.

It's akin to calling Namecoin, Bitcoin.

Fred Ehrsam is too busy cooking breakfast for Ethereum after a long night of back door attacks.

I like the idea of BTC and NMC as leaders in the developing economic and information spheres.

I suppose if they merged, the supply would double? I just don't think there is enough bits to act as both commerce and registry if allowed on the current bitcoin protocol. It cost NMC to register data through the blockchain.

This truly reminds me of the Red Dawn movie; where the immature and impatient American little boy runs and joins the North Korean incursion.

This is a Perfect example of a delusion.

I am Palestinian. I had nothing to do with any agreement, nor did I ever vote for Hamas. Back when we were running several family owned businesses, no schools were named after anyone violent. You come off as a fool and it'd be best if you shut your mouth.

Here we go...long winded posts to try to cover up who you actually are and what you really stand for.

You don't have to be a Jew to support the ones who stole my land. I'm not going to argue with you, but clearly you are the moral idiot.
