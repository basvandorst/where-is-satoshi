Good list, but it's missing a few people who's contributions are much closer to bitcoin itself than most of the people included.
Ralph Merkle: invented cryptographic hashing, and merkle trees, and an early asymmetric cryptosystem
Leslie Lamport: distributed systems pioneer, you may know him from Lamport timestamps ("Time, clocks, and the ordering of events in a distributed system"), or his 1982 paper "The Byzantine Generals' Problem". Also invented Lamport signatures (hash-based post-quantum awesomeness *in 1979*; see  for today's state-of-the-art in this area).
Neal Koblitz: one of the people who (independently) invented elliptic curve cryptography. The "k" in the name of the curve bitcoin uses (secp256k1) stands for Koblitz; it is actually one of the curves he designed/specified/discovered himself.

I don't think we're there yet :)
What em-an-re-su meant by "only" is that beer will be the only thing you can buy at the bar with bitcoin, rather than that bitcoin would be the only way to buy beer.

pesco got it first, but to summarize their comments: the correct answer is "the outputs which are the same size as the dirty inputs are still dirty, and the outputs which are the same size as the clean inputs are still clean".
The key phrases in the riddle are "K different Bitcoin accounts i = [0 .. K), each with a **different** value stored in it, V_i" and "pay V_i value from the X account to **the** i'th new account". If there are the same number of input accounts as output accounts, and they're all unique sizes, it is trivial to correlate them.

Absolutely **do not** use this service! The fact that they have the word "Tor" in their company name when they have nothing to do with The Tor Project establishes beyond any doubt that they're unscrupulous scammers.
The real [Tor]( is a free multi-hop proxy which provides privacy-by-design (meaning: you're trusting that their peer-reviewed free open-source software does what it says it will) whereas TorGuard.net is a single-hop for-pay proxy which offers privacy-by-policy (meaning: you trust that their shady company is doing what they say they will).
Paying for a proxy service isn't crazy, as there are lots of premium services which are much faster than Tor, but you should go with a reputable company if you're going to do that.

After winning four blocks in an hour (!), they appear to have stopped a little over 3 hours ago. There has only been one empty block mined since then, and it was reported from mining pool btcmp.com: 
Here are the last four blocks from mystery miner 85.214.124.168:
* 
* 
* 
* 
Note the out-of-order timestamps!
Here is another thread about it: 
edit: they've actually gone this long or longer without winning a block several times in the last couple days, as should be expected probabilisticly. It really doesn't indicate they've stopped until we don't see them for much much longer. Here are their recent blocks:

and if this bitcoin thing doesn't pan out, they can always fall back on total information awareness

Bitcoin might be *part* of the "foundation for web payment", but it isn't going to cut it by itself. Even with blocks many times the current size bitcoin won't scale to anywhere near the transaction volume needed for even individual business sectors much less the entire internet economy.
Not that I'm endorsing this interledger proposal (i haven't read the whole thing yet) but we obviously do need payment systems other than bitcoin.

They clearly said that they're on the motherfucker.
