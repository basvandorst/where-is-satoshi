Im not sure how investing into a technology early is a ‘scheme’... but whatever bud. See you in a few years.

Looking back just a couple of months, you can see those dips make no real difference in the big picture. It’s important to just get those coins as soon as possible and forget about the small margins. In a few months, these dips will hardly register on the scale.

Well, actually bitcoin.com (and the wallet they provide) supports both BTC and BCH.  It's of course a scam to trick newbies into buying Bitcoin Cash instead of "Bitcoin Core", but its a totally legit wallet and the website is a legit source for basic information about BTC.

All crypto currencies are in their infancy.  Most businesses realize that Bitcoin has been around the longest and can innovate solutions to meet the global markets needs.  Brand awareness is about the most important thing at this stage. Companies want to back the thing that is soon going to be a household name.

You don’t thank the attacker for causing harm. You thank the community for helping the victim.

BTC was at this price like less than 2 weeks ago dude.  Don't freak out!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:05:08
I bought different amounts on different days, because it was rising literally daily, but the lowest I bought at was at 10k. 
In total I have put in $19k worth of USD and it is currently worth $29k if I was to sell now.

The amount of BTC you buy is locked in. No matter how long it takes to process, you will get the amount of bitcoin you wanted for the price you agreed to pay. You won’t be charged more USD or get less BTC just cause the value went up during processing.

Bitcoin is still in its infancy right now. It’s not a great medium of a currency until new layers like Lightning Network are released. 
Right now, you should only use it as a store of value, assuming you believe in the technology and its future.  That means don’t use it for small amounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:02:38
The fees you are seeing are the market demand that people are paying to get their tx processed. It’s based on the mempool size. 
The Bitcoin devs are working to reduce that size, but that will take time. Your best bet is to see the potential in bitcoins future and to invest in it early, like others are doing. Stop worrying about the fees today, and start looking ahead.

I’ve never used coinbase’s USD wallet but I would imagine that yes it should be near instant.  They may wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the block before posting the usd, so maybe an hour or two depending on the network load.

Easiest explanation:
Public key is like your email address. It’s public and how coins are sent to/from you. 
Private key is like the password to your public key. Never reveal this to anyone. It is necessary for wallets to have the private key in order to withdraw coins.  Anyone can send you coins with just your Public key, just like anyone can send you emails with just your email address. But they can’t send coins *from* you without your Private key, just like they can’t send emails from you without your password. 
Seed is a human-readable version of your private key. It’s a series of 12 (or more) words that can be used to recover your private and public key, should you lose them or need to set up a wallet all over again. It’s like a recovery email or recovery password.

Any history on this address? How do we know someone doesn’t secretly own the private key?
Edit: Never mind I just realized the public key is a vanity address that is nearly impossible to have been generated in our lifetime. So basically we just need to send to any random valid address.

Anything is possible. Imagine if you were to tell people “You’ll be able to stream 4K across the internet wirelessly.” back in 1992.  They would think you were crazy. 
The question isn’t really whether it will be possible or not, cause it most definitely will be. The question is will Bitcoin be the winner or another altcoin.

I tried to follow the “paper trail” from the account that sent it to him, which lead to another account... and another account... I can’t make heads or tails of these accounts but it ended up coming from an account that has had hundreds of bitcoins moving through it in just the last 24 hours. 
I guess it’s possible it’s just one of the exchanges’ addresses, which maybe the sender used to sent to AA?  Those exchanges are like banks, so that kind of money might not be unusual.

Your transaction amount is locked in at the time you submit it, regardless of how long it takes to process. You will get the same amount you purchased even if the value changes by the time your transaction completes. 
It takes about a week for the banks to verify your USD transaction and for coinbase to validate it.

Please please make a backup for them and keep it safe on *your own.*  They will most likely lose it by the time Bitcoin is a household name.

Never ever try and explain the block chain to your family. They don’t need to understand it to get the concept of internet money. 
Just tell them that it’s money for the internet and everyone is going to end up using Bitcoin instead of dollars in the future because it’s global and has no inflation. So they better grab some now while they are cheap. Nuff said.

In the long run, no it isn’t too late. People are speculating that a single bitcoin will be worth $100k-$1m. 
I bought at $10k just a few weeks ago thinking I was too late.  Now we’re almost to $17k. It’s never too late if you simply plan on holding it for a few years at least.

You can avoid fees by keeping some coins on the exchange. GDAX even lets you transfer your coins to your personal wallet for free. However, once they are in your personal wallet, you will have to pay up in fees to get them sent out. 
My best suggestion is to only put coins in your personal wallet that you are willing to keep in there long term. However, don’t keep too much on the exchange either, in case they fall under suddenly.

Is there any downside to using a BIP49 SegWit address, versus a bech32 address?  I'm wondering what the difference between a "full-SegWit" address and a "backwards-compatible friendly" address is, so I can decide when to switch to bech32.

This is exactly why government officials *dont* embrace it.

1.	Download and install Electrum
2.	Copy the bitcoin address Electrum created for you.  The address can be found in the “Receive” tab. 
3.	On GDAX, “Withdraw” your bitcoins to the bitcoin address you copied. 
4.	Sit and wait. It may take a few hours for it to show up in Electrum because of all the delays happening.  Just be patient.  If you are worried about this process, you can simply transfer a small amount of bitcoin the your wallet as a test to get a feel for the process. It’s free on Gdax to withdraw. 
Read up on how to keep your wallet secure. Electrum is just one wallet program among many out there, but it is the most compatible and updated one I’ve found.

Well, the problem with that idea is that you now only control 1 signature out of the required minimum of 2.  Obviously, you don't want to rely on the third party for the 2nd signature, and so you'll have to rely on your family to approve it.
That's not really a good thing.  You don't want your family having control over your money *before* you die.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:15:04
For this kind of service to be possible, one would have to reveal their private key to a third party.  No one in their right mind would do that.

Right now bitcoin is rising so fast that you basically should only be putting in money for the long haul.  You should be willing to lose any money you put into bitcoin, because A) it could fail or B) you'll only cash out years from now when it is worth way more.
