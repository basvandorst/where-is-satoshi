We were just at 6.5k in November. The run from there to 19k took under 2 months. Hopefully it just corrects back to the trend.

If your theory is true, then how does the tech industry sell ANY product at launch? We all know when the new iPhone comes out the previous year's will drop in price. Why doesn't everybody wait until the new one comes out to buy the old one? In bitcoin we only think the USD value will be higher tomorrow, it is not certain, but with tech, we know for a fact it will be cheaper in the future.

I knew what everybody else was paying, and I set the fee myself. I just didn't want to pay more than $5 to move it, but at this point it seems like $10-$20 depending on the mempool is the amount you'll have to pay to move it in a reasonable amount of time.

Hello (insert recipient of email), my name is (your name) and I attend your church on a regular basis. I know the church accepts donations in the form of cash and credt/debit cards, but there is a third way with these things called bitcoin. To accept bitcoin, you simply download an app called BitPay, print out a QR code, and allow those in the congregation who own bitcoin to scan it with their phones. When they scan it and send bitcoin, they will go to your bitcoin wallet (a digital wallet where bitcoins are held). This bitcoin can be converted to US Dollars that help the church in its funding. I hope you take this recommendation into consideration. Thank you, and have a nice day.

You can choose if you want the money to go into your USD wallet on coinbase or if it goes back to your bank account. If you want it go to your bank account then you gave to link your bank account.

There may be more buyers/sellers on one exchange compared to another.
There are multiple exchanges because multiple people/groups thought they could make money by starting a cryptocurrency exchange.

They need to make a service that works like a CD but instead of gaining interest, you gain nothing, but they charge you a substantial fee to pull your BTC out early so it makes you less likely to panic sell. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:26:38
For Coinbase, if you link your bank account directly you have a $5000 limit per day. Also, Kraken is the best exchange and is usually pretty quick. It may take a few days to get you a high enough tier (tier 3, which requires you to send them a photo ID and proof of residency) so you can fund your account directly with USD. After you get tier 3 verified then you are good to go.

My thinking on Trump affecting bitcoin is his policy. If he implements his $1 trillion infrastructure plan, then it could put inflationary pressures on the dollar causing the Fed to raise interest rates faster thus strengthening the dollar against the Yuan further driving the Chinese into bitcoin. Then again he could tweet Bitcoin sucks and i'm banning working with Congress to ban it and it the price would take. It's Trump. You never know.
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:06:29
innopoll.com is legit. You take surveys worth between $1 and $5 and they pay in bitcoin if you choose that option. They will email and text you a link when a new survey is available and they don't take long to fill out. If you don't qualify for 3 surveys they give you a $2 credit as a "loyalty" bonus. I've used it for over a year now and never had a problem and made roughly $60 in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:21:33
If Trump implements his desired infrastructure plans and it puts inflationary pressure on the USD, the Fed will raise rates faster than expected further strengthening the USD against the Yuan.

For everybody saying you have to have an inflationary currency for growth, how do you explain between about 1840-1900 (minus the civil war) where we had constant moderate deflation and one of the greatest periods of advancement in the standard of living of the average man in human history?
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:35:33
I am not saying deflation was why there was such growth. I'm talking about the people that act like if the there is a deflation rate of 0.1% that the economy will grind to halt and we will be thrown into a second Great Depression. I'm just pointing out the economy can grow in either condition and deflation isn't inherently bad for the economy as expressed by people such as Bernanke and many other Keynesians.
