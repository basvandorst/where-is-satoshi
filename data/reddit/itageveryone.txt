Even people that are "here for the tech" could be incentivized to sell now. Just because people like the innovation doenst mean they dont want to make money.

Why is everyone acting like all the altcoins are up right now?
Basically all crypto (except ripple) is in the dumps recently.

What real-world value does BTC have that BCH doesn't?
Genuine question, I'm a noob here.

For me, coinbase charges $2 for a $100 purchase, and $3 for a $200 purchase. Above $200 it is a straight 1.5% but it seems like they scale down to that.

I'm an 18 y/o college student. Growing up poor, I've had little to no experience with managing my money. I got some extra scholarship money (more than tuition actually costed), so I decided to invest it. Last week I bought the dip and I'm almost in tears now seeing what this short term investment has already become.
