Here's simplified answers from someone who's a technologist and long time bitcoin user and trader
1) I want to purchase bitcoins and start using them. What is currently the best method for doing so?
Currently, I'd say Coinbase is the best exchange to use. Although there are some limitations on how much you can buy "instantly", but they're by far the most trusted and secure exchange in the US. Your other option is localbitcoins.com and buying via cash deposit, just make sure the seller has a good reputation. However, you'll pay slightly higher on localbitcoins.com since you're dealing directly with sellers as opposed to the exchange itself.
2) Should I store them on my computer? (keyloggers, hard drive crashes, malware) Should I store them on an online wallet? (giving up control of my bitcoins to a third party). What measures should I take to secure my ownership? (BitGo, USB key etc.)
To be honest, I wouldn't be too concerned about storing them online. I've been using BTC for years and have kept them in my online wallets since day 1. Coinbase is definitely secure, and they are constantly enhancing their security. Just make sure you enable two-factor authentication, and don't leave your computer logged in to Coinbase when you're not around. 
3) Can someone convince me that entering a Bitcoin exchange is safe?
Coinbase is a hugely profitable, transparent, VC-backed Bitcoin exchange. They've worked with some of the biggest US companies to implementation BTC payment processing for them, and I've been using them for two years now. Paypal is even working with Coinbase. 
4) How easily can I convert bitcoins back into USD in the US?
With Coinbase, you can literally convert back to dollars in an instant.
 
Hope I kept it as clear and straight forward as possible for you.
