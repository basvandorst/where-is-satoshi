You can have a Traditional or Roth IRA and 401k. 


Cute. I'll try to remember that when I'm getting wallet raped every month by FICA and Income taxes.


Oh, okay, excuse me - 18 years left to live. Lol.

Lol try narrowing your focus to large major cities where the dynamic you originally described is actually happening.

Yeah but the worldwide adoption rate of Uber or other ride sharing tech doesn’t cause the change of behavior you originally outlined, local market adoption does. That’s the point. Your comparing behavior changes that are motivated by completely different things. 
Also, hodling bitcoin on Coinbase is hardly adoption.

Lol this isn’t true. That’s just market volatility they have to account for in market orders. Make limit orders and that one happen.

Adoption of a currency is holding? Lol ok.

What an awful comparison. Crypto adoption rates are nothing compared to Uber and lyft adoption rates.

Guy: I have $1 million in my 401k/IRA.
Girl: Wanna buy us drinks?
Guy: Oh, no sorry I cant get my money without paying a arbitrarily massive penalty until a predetermined Age set by a government controlled by corporate lobbyists. Also, that date happens to be when I have less than 10 years of average life expectancy left. Maybe I can buy y'all an extra OJ in the nursing home in 45 years?
