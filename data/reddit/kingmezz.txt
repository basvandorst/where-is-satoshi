Bitcoin isn't meant to be an investment it's meant to be used as a currency.

He spoke so well, what a great spokesperson for Bitcoin. BTW the older lady looked so lost throughout the whole thing.  She had the same look this cashier at walmart had when I asked her about Bitcoin, she thought it was a cookie!  To be fair however, I am relatively young looking and I do like cookies...

Thank you very much! Do you personally use coinbase's vault? Would you trust it with a decent amount of bitcoin?  Andreas said (scroll on the page) not to keep money on any exchange after what happened with that other one. So I was only going to use the exchange as a way to convert or purchase coins, but not keep them on there?

I'm new here, this week was my first week on this sub so I guess im an anomaly to the statistics :p
Edit: 
I don't exactly have 400,000 grand laying around so I guess I'm out of this auction, no chance for the average man to take part in this..

  So, what I'm getting from everyone is it is safe to use an exchange like coinbase but then once I have accumulated some bitcoin, do not keep the bitcoin on the coinbase account move them to mycelium (on my phone) or electrum (on my desktop) and store them that way (unless they are large sums which I should use a paper wallet or hardware wallet)?  
  I'd like to create a paper wallet since hardware wallets like TREZOR seem to cost money, can I create a paper wallet on electrum, coinbase, or mycelium?  Or do most people just use bitaddress.org to create paper wallets? I'm confused as to what the benefit of using mycelium and electrum is if I were to just purchase bitcoins off an exchange like coinbase and then stored them on a paper wallet from bitaddress.org?  Are mycelium and electrum used primarily for trading and making purchases? 
Also is the 12 words I wrote down on mycelium my private key or are these two different things? sry if these questions are basic.

thanks alot man appreciate it
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:42:26
Yes I did see that sub and this seems alot more appropriate for it but there hardly seemed to be anyone there? 
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:46:10
Hello I am new to the sub am I too late for this? I'm trying to learn thanks
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:41:04
Thank you so much for the information. I think I just need to as you said experiment and get my feet wet, I still have alot to learn.  Also just wanted to say I thought you were great on Morgan Spurlock.  I've been a fan of his since the Supersize Me days and I find his topics interesting on "Inside Man". Thanks again

is the vault on coinbase a viable option to store bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-02-28 21:00:45
 Thanks a lot for your help I really do appreciate it.  If I could ask one more thing whats your opinion on this Andreas Antonopoulos guy?  He seems to be the spokesperson for bitcoin and is who originally turned me onto bitcoin and using blockchain.  Is he only recommending people to use blockchain because he is directly involved in that company or does his opinion hold merit?  Any distinct differences between using blockchain or using Mycelium? 
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:55:04
im new to bitcoin is there anywhere someone can refer me to in which I will understand what exactly the grand exchange is? thanks

Why does China's government regulate their internet use so much?  Why aren't their citizens in frenzy mode about this?  When any form of internet regulation was introduced i.e. SOPA/PIPA in the states, there was a giant uproar and it didn't pass. explainlikeimfive

Dont you have to account for thousands of bitcoin that will never be recovered? i.e. all the stories of the lost hard-drives, not to mention the people who just simply lose their private keys?  I imagine there will be a certain number of bitcoin that are lost forever.
@_date: 2015-02-28 21:02:57
thanks a lot, all great information!
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:44:24
Whoa is that really you lol? I wish you were my neighbor or something so you could help me set this up.  I'm probably making it a lot more confusing that it is, it just seems as if there are alot of options in terms of which wallet to use and how to go about buying bitcoins.  Because this is real money we are talking about, I am just trying to be safe. Thanks
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:55:12
yes I have been looking paper wallets as well, thank you for the information.
@_date: 2015-02-28 20:33:29
Wow I'm just a bit overwhelmed.  Everyone is suggesting different apps or wallets to download.  I am surprised there just isn't one universal wallet that the overwhelming majority of people use.  I just don't want to get burned and lose any bitcoin so I'm trying to make the best decision possible.  Thanks
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:54:31
Oh this is interesting to me, so if I just want to buy a few bitcoins but not necessarily spend or trade them all I would need is a public address with a private key?  How would I obtain this without downloading a wallet first and are there any particular security measures you would recommend to protect myself? thanks  
@_date: 2015-02-28 20:08:56
Ok great and if I wanted to buy other alt coins do I need a specific address for each individual type of alt coin or does any such address exist were I can put multiple types of alt coins on a single address? thanks
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:02:36
sry lol, I meant the "exchange".  You said "my BTC have never sat on an exchange over 1 day" and I just didn't understand.  I'm trying to learn but runescape was on my mind and so I accidentally put a grand in front of the exchange.
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:18:36
Today I actually binge watched the 3 podcasts you did with Joe Rogan which was about 9 hours lol so I learned a lot from those as well.  I just downloaded Mycelium on my android but I was also considering using the exchange service on coinbase.com? Is it safe to use my debit card on coinbase in order to exchange money for bitcoin, or is this a bad idea?  Also, if I delete the blockchain app will that account/pubic address I created that was associated with the app just disappear or do I need to manually delete that address? My email was linked to that as a security measure.
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:21:47
Sounds sensible to me.  Did you delete your blockchain account before removing the app?  How did you make that transfer? Because I have like my email attached to that and everything.
