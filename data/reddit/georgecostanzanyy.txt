The problem is that the US controls the entire global economic order and only allows free passage and trade as a courtesy to compliant nations.
If you don't want to the bend the knee and follow the rules you WILL lose. There is only one global superpower.

Yeah he made up like 80% of the story if the criticisms of him are valid. Never read it, seemed like stupid self-help nonsense to me.
Some of the lessons in there are like: "education and debt are scams, cash rules everything."

This isn't true.
In an above post I suggested they could let customers buy and sell bitcoin while acting as a market maker connected to other exchanges.
I don't think they will do this because making the market for bitcoin probably isn't one of the goals of their payment processing/fintech business.
@_date: 2018-08-05 13:04:57
I have a feeling you are right.
If they REALLY wanted to make it a cash cow they would let you buy and sell while acting as a market maker. But at that point they would be getting a little far off from their goals of payment processing/fintech.

Common sense is that unproductive debt is bad. Productive debt is great.
If you didn't know you can defer capital gains when reinvesting in "like" properties than you shouldn't even be thinking about buying real estate - you should be studying the laws and the market.
If you don't know the difference between an asset and a liability then no self-help book is going to make you rich. You should read a business textbook because chances are there are a lot more vocab words where that came from!

What do you think has more processing power, bitcoin network or the totality of Amazon Web Services?
Amazon is worth almost $1T but the bitcoin network is only worth $121B. Why?
Imagine if all the processing power for bitcoin was solving practical problems instead of generating random hashes...
To the replies:
I know I know I know!
I just want to IMAGINE what it could actually do. It is, in all likelihood, the largest and most valuable botnet ever to exist.
I was just imagining, for a minute, what if the processing power was focused on (idk, let's say) drug discovery. Or some other hard problem that faces humanity that could be solved with the processing power. 
I was just thinking that the coordinated processing alone could be worth multiple trillions if it were doing SOMETHING in addition to securing the blockchain. 
(This may be blasphemy here, but: we all know you can run dapps on top of a blockchain.)
I'm suggesting that bitcoin could be more valuable, if on top of its current uses, it also generated tangible IP for its owners.
Food for thought.

Cause him and his son were funneling oil from ISIS through Turkey into Europe and cash back into Syria. 
He spent all of his countries military resources killing Kurds and shooting down Russian Jets rather than fighting ISIS.
Then we can get to the staged coup he set up and blamed on a cleric in rural Pennsylvannia. 
Or maybe the corruption scandal in which his buddies from his ruling "Justice and Development Party" got busted for gold smuggling, bribery, corruption, money laundering and fraud.
In the beginning (early to mid 2000s) it looked like Erdogan was a good guy and Turkey could enter the fold of Western countries. This changed in the last ~~8-10~~ 6 years.
Dictators and despots can be democratically elected.

If you don't make good decisions then anything will ruin you, education and debt are no different.
Debt's great if you know how to use it properly. For the last decade it has been basically free money to buy assets and amplify your returns.
Acting like dropping out of school and not getting a mortgage are the secrets to being rich are just deceptive nonsense he uses to sell his books. 
Every good decision/bet that he made would have been better if he used debt. He might have known some of this if he ever got an actual education in business.

People are much more afraid of losing something they already have than they desire gaining more. It is simple psychology.
The fact that you doubled your money over the last X amount of time has a much less significant emotional connection than the fact that you lost 70% of your money over the last X/4 amount of time.
Loss aversion is stronger than desire to make gains. Massive gains and losses like this in such a short period of time can reasonably be expected to make people on the internet salty.

Well BitTorrent based around the concept of illegally sharing someone else's content - not making micropayments to utilize legitimate dapps - so I don't think that's a good example at all.

This hypothetical attack would be far cheaper because the value of the network would be far less. The price of an attack (as well as the potential profits from an attack) is directly proportional to the value of the network as determined by the price of BTC.
While a lower price might make an attack easier in theory it would also reduce the incentive for an attack proportionally.

Look at pictures of Tehran from the 60s and look at pictures of Tehran from now.
I'd be shocked if the majority of Iranians enjoy living in a dark ages type society with limited education, crumbling infrastructure and no access to global markets.
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:29:06
So the perfect time to attack is when the market deems the network not valuable enough to secure?
I'm not buying it.

First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

But in order to dump bitcoin and crash the price you need to have bought it.
So you are going to buy bitcoin, short bitcoin, dump bitcoin to crash the price and then try to take over the network that you just manipulated downwards? In what world does this make sense?

And there won't be one point in the future where that happens either.
The "cost" of a bitcoin is always calculated using the average cost of electricity. The $0.12/kWh that determines mining profitability? That is an estimate of the average. 
Some people get free electricity, some people pay less than $0.06/kWh, etc. Mining bitcoin will always be profitable for someone and some others will continue to operate at a loss for some period of time.
The mining cost of bitcoin is a sunk cost. It has nothing to do with the price.

Banks don't give loans to people who can't repay unless the government tells them to...which they did.
The banks weren't evil for using CDOs and Credit Default Swaps and buying insurance from AIG. They were trying to protect themselves from the risk caused by the government insisting that everyone should be able to own a home regardless of ability to afford it.
"We can put light where there's darkness, and hope where there's despondency in this country. And part of it is working together as a nation to encourage folks to own their own home."
- President George W. Bush, Oct. 15, 2002
"The goal of this strategy is ambitious: to generate up to 8 million additional homeowners from 1995 through the year 2000. The strategy recommends a series of concerted actions to help middle-income and low-income families, racial and ethnic minorities, families with children and young adults overcome current barriers to homeownership.”
-Henry Cisneros, HUD Secretary under Bill Clinton, May 2nd 1995
"Working together we can add as many as eight million new families to America's homeownership rolls by the year 2000. Expanding homeownership will strengthen our nation's families and communities, strengthen our economy, and expand this country's great middle class."
- Bill Clinton, May 2nd 1995
Government interference distorted the pricing of risk in the housing market. 
Did it go out of control because of the demand for AAA-rated junk mortgages? 
Yes, in the end greed did everyone in. But the risk was initially mispriced due to government interference.
