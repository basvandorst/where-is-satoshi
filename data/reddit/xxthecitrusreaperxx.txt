Hahahah the y’all thing cracks me up. That’s really funny to me. I use it when I type Reddit comments, but I don’t think I find myself saying a lot in person. But I will check out Gemini, thank you!

I think the tweet is interesting. But if you examine it, I think at the moment, Uncle Sam is less concerned about crypto as a whole, and short term will be more focused on companies (JP Morgan, Facebook, Amazon) trying to create their own.

Gotcha. Well after checking out that sub, they don’t seem good at all. But do you know why coinbase prices are different from others?

I’m sorry, what are whales? Someone in a different thread uses that term but I thought they were just trying to be humorously insulting. But I’m seeing it in a few places now.

Isn’t most humor at someone else’s expense?

Oh I know what it is. He’s still a loser with nothing to do but tweet dumb shit all day at trump with him and his brother.

This is that loser who has nothing but all the time in the world to tweet at trump all day long. What an idiot. I’m not clicking on this link. Ed and whatever this guy’s name is. Ryan I think but I don’t give enough shits to want to look it up. In fact, I give so many zero shits, I’m actually giving a negative shit about this guy.

What am I looking at? This has 10,000 points but it’s just a screenshot. Can someone help me understand

It says bitcoin explorer and has bcash and core. I don’t understand what this thing is I’m looking at and what everyone is talking about

Out of curiosity, I feel like this is essentially paying twice for your bitcoin interactions. Correct me if I’m wrong, but the average Joe isn’t mining bitcoin at his house, he’s not mining at all. He’s buying when it’s low and the using that to buy other things with it. So you spend your bitcoin, but you have to keep buying more in order to actually spend it—whereas in a fiat system you are paid via your employer, vendor, customer and then spend that money. 
But you earn that money regularly. With crypto, you are paying for crypto, the $100 you put in a couple weeks ago isn’t worth the same as it is now as the price has decreased significantly, whereas your fiat currency hasn’t really changed its value that significantly over the course of a year. 
It’s almost as if, me as an American, invested in Euros vis Forex and as that moves up and down, my investment is the amount of Euros I own. But when I’m paid for my work performed (let’s say $10/ hour just for round numbers) that $10 is still $10 no matter what, a day, a week a year from now. It has not changed that much, even if the dollar itself on the Forex market has fluctuated more.

I’ve never liked this guy. I see him fairly often in hearings and he’s a sleaze ball.
