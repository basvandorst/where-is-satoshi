Its kinda terryfing that you guys are so blinded by stupid memes and so called easy gains. Most of you are not in here for the technology. You just checked the charts and thought u will earn shitload of money. You cant pay for anything via bitcoin due to sick fees. People are leaving this currency and switching to another alts. Dont stuff yourselves with memes and experts saying that bitcoin will reach xxx in zzz.  Be rational.

Spending bitcoin costs twice as paying in fiat

It is not. Not even close. Thats a terribld currency. Face it
@_date: 2018-10-22 20:05:51
It will slowly fade away. No way it can be used as everyday currency. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:09:04
Yeah because some dude said so on reddit. Btc is the most miserable currency. Useless and impractical. Only stock value
