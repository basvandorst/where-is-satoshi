Fellow Binancians,
We are noticing an increase in the number of users attempting to resell their accounts on Bianance.  Binance would like to reiterate that the selling of accounts poses a significant security risk that can potentially cause a loss of funds and/or accounts being stolen. Binance will not be responsible for any losses related to such activities.
Thank you for your support.

They publicly claim they are not doing it because its crypto but to prevent possible fraudulent activity. That customer service rep was not supposed to tell you that, they were supposed to say "we saw an international transaction that raised a red flag "by our system" Our fraud department will be in contact to clarify if its an authentic transaction" or some shit.
Open an account with a bank that isnt one of the big4, Apply for  a new credit card. Once approved, close your ANZ credit accounts, transfer the balance if any to the new card with your new bank.  I recently left CBA (more due to their money laundering and coal investment) its quite easy but takes some time.

I have never used LBC but found this interesting, so. From 2014 
it seems asking the buyer for branch/bank info so you can contact the bank directly makes the forger stop claiming they paid (this would be done before releasing escrow coins). Same would be done the other way, Dispute team would need proof you sent the BTC to the correct wallet as provided by the buyer (which if its the LBC wallet linked to buyers account they can easily verify)
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:11:17
it is unconfirmed? please provide txid from blockchain explorer?
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:12:29
seems if they arent re-broadcast, they will drop. but any node can hold it for any length of time and re-broadcast. So if I have my full node mempool set to a large enough number, I may have been responsible for keeping it stuck. More likely blockchain.info keeps trying to send the tx until it goes through (which works for reasonable fees at the time, but sucks if you have a large transfer stuck for months - did you custom set the fee?) btw im just spit balling, I have no real idea why. Would be interesting to see longest time stuck in mempool as a data point. over 1month? done. over 6 months?

as opposed to BTC being called a ponzi scheme in itself. Bitconnect actually takes your BTC and issues BCC which you lend to others and make "interest" on. The more you lend (leave with them) the more interest you receive. it (and this is the ponzi part) "guarantees" returns of 91.25% a year depending on how much you invest, with no risk of loss!

And thats exactly what the government and banks have been gunning for. Wages paid via EFT lets the banks report income if the employer doesnt, EFTPOS/Visa etc provide the banks (and govt) with the info to know exactly WHAT you spend your money on. Cash is the only true anonymous currency and governments hate it.We have a concerted effort to destroy the cash economy in this country. Next year starts single touch payroll, every employer MUST declare income paid to employees (on a per person basis every week, not as a whole every three months as was the previous system)
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:44:11
who is your "provider"?
go here:
input your BTC address and you will see something like this: (if your "provider gave you a transaction id, use this instead)
Click on your outgoing Transaction for 0.005 btc and you will see a  page like this:
Find the size and fee size (right hand side half way down - in shown tx it was 229 bytes at 200 sat/B) 
Note these figures and go here:
look for the corresponding sat/B bar and that will give you an idea of how low you are in the mempool. (note when you move cursor, it tells you number of tx per fee range at that time)
Napkin math. 
1.5% of 80 is $1.20, at 11000 usd/btc $1.20 = 0.0001090909 btc fee. Assuming average 250 byte tx = 0.00000043636 btc/B = 43.63 sat/B 
As of right now there is approx 300MB above you in the mempool, so approx 1MB/block every 10 minutes = 60 MB/Hour = 50 Hours to clear = 2.08 days to confirm. 
BUT, this relies on nobody in the world making another bitcoin transaction for 2-3 days AND your "provider" putting your full fee paid to the actual transaction. Both HIGHLY unlikely.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:59:53

FIRST: DO NOT PUT IN MORE THAN YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE. Bitcoin is highly speculative, there is no guaranteed profit. the price could drop 90% by the time your tuition is due.
you can purchase from an exchange but you will need to verify your identity on most of them, this takes time. Find one you like (dont use coinbase) and start the registration process.
OR purchase P2P using 
Trends? you mean technical analysis of the price? everyone is a genius in this area. Its all over the internet. Take it all with a grain of salt as no one knows for sure what the price will do. 
Which app to keep your money safe? you will need a wallet. Its tempting to take the easy route and leave the coins on an exchange but "not your keys, not your coins"
Which wallet you want to use depends on your circumstances and preferences. 
Think long and hard before buying, do more research. The amount of info is overwhelming but it is VERY important to understand what you are putting your money into and why.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:31:48
If it gets down to 110 s/b, how are the transactions ordered? eg: is it first in first out at 110.375 or largest size at that fee (which means largest fee) that will be picked up. Or is it just completely random at each fee level?

lower the block reward and lower the difficulty lower the block time but same daily reward.
Okay, BUT. Lower difficulty = easier to exploit 51% attack. Faster block time at same block size = larger block chain. Might as well just increase block size and there are many explanations as to why that is a bad idea.

I see this mentioned a bit, but people forget, he wrote the program. He ran the program the most because he wrote it. Every 10 minutes for the first days/weeks before anyone else downloaded, installed and ran the program, he was receiving 50btc. If he was running it 24/7 (which I would have to try to find bugs as it was expected to run 24/7 as it proliferates) he was getting 7200 btc. It wasnt premining, it was the result of him being the first and only person in the world mining for some time.

I really like the idea BUT, there are 693580 subscribers of this sub so I think it would need to be an all out social media campaign to get everyone that uses bitcoin on board.

30+ sats/B will get you in the next block (10 minutes) right now. so average 250 bytes = 7500 sats = .000075 btc = less than 1 USD to move as many dollars as you want, to ANYONE worldwide, in 10 minutes. It is the most widely accepted by merchants of all the cryptocurrencies.

@_date: 2018-01-21 23:12:52
Im still learning but my understanding is:
The block difficulty controls block timing which is tied to the block reward (rate of inflation) so averaging out to 10 minutes per block means that in this halvening we mint 1800 new bitcoins created per day. This keeps the rate of inflation steady. We wont hit  a truly deflationary currency until all bitcoins have been mined.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:10:42
a ponzi scheme by definition has to have an "operator" that controls the funds and is paying early investors returns from new deposits (as there is no actual investment paying the returns promised).  OR we are all creating a pyramid scheme ourselves that relies on FOMO to bring in the new money. No one is "running" this beast, it is the most interesting social/financial experiment of our time.

They charged you .003 btc to withdraw to your wallet? shit.
what coinbase charged you isnt what they paid to move the tx.
40 minutes for 6 conf? then you were in the first block available (and confirmed by the 5 after that) You have never had 6 confirmations in under 40 minutes before. 
Sent out of your personal wallet you could have set the fee to 30sats/b and had it in the next block, but exchanges are reaping profit off the tx fees again. BTW i hear sending to GDax and then your wallet is fee free, maybe look into that for next time.

The arguments against shown here are correct and sound. 
I think a change to the DA algorithm to allow adjustment if hash power decreases dramatically straight after an adjustment (eg greater than 90% reduction under 100 blocks from last adjustment = current hashpower calculation and difficulty adjustment accordingly) could be a good fail safe against the idea the network can be ground to a halt. This would make "the flippening" an impossibility. Im sure its not as easy as that though and I respect the tech knowledge of all developers contributing/reviewing the code.

They REALLY wanted it in the next block? follow the 17A...GX address it has a transaction confirmed in almost every block. I think maybe they set it really high so it will ALWAYS be in the next block and doesnt fuck up the timing of all the following transactions. Just a guess.

yeah, OR you bumped the fee so they thought "welp, we can use a lot more inputs for this one and it will still get confirmed, so lets use some of our change addresses" The fees are measured in sats/Byte so the more sats you gave them to use, the more bytes they could make the tx. Seems they overshot it though and left you with 94 s/B and 103 s/b tx's. Check here:
from top graph your transactions would be in the top two yellow bars. (80-100 and 100-120)
from bottom graph there is 60MB above your lower fee tx So Im guessing at least 10 - 12 hours (6 blocks processed per hour) if your lucky. Im still really new at this though so I am often wrong on estimated time to process.
God speed little tx, god speed!

A full (non validating) node does not create blocks, therefore it does not process money transactions. It merely keeps a current copy of the blockchain. 
Should the US government make that illegal (very doubtful) then yes, you could be arrested. It would be far more likely that they would make mining illegal first as it actually facilitates in transmitting money. You would know well ahead of time if the US Government was going down this path.

This comes to about 13.888 repeating.
When using a drawing program that rounds the rotation angle to the closest full percent, the angle becomes 14°.
The angle represents the blockchain progressing into the future forever.

Theres a big difference between being sold unloaded and DIY. Unloaded means the creator generated the keys but didnt load it, DIY means another owner bought the coin and created the keys before it was sold again.

Buy on coinbase with ID, send to electrum, send to darknet vendor. That is all traceable. It doesnt matter how you connect to the vendor, they follow the money.

If you were a miner, You have no incentive to include the tx except altruism? There are a few that might do it for the lulz/love. The rest of them see it as a business now.
Many blocks arent full but the 0-1 sat/byte still dont get picked up.
Non mining mempools are generally dropping txs with 0 fees but for those that arent.
click on the 0-1 in the left hand side of the bottom graph, it shows a grey area that doesnt move down even though there has been many blocks that are less than 1MB in the last 24 hours.
edit: I think Betterhash might give a way for individual pool miners to choose which tx's get in the block. This would help move 0 sat txs when the mempools are empty. I havent read enough though.

Libra cant provide this because they will be subservient to US legislation because they are centralised. BTC is not and can not be regulated. If you read enough history, Libra is the current version of liberty reserve or others pre BTC.

edit: from the Instagram help centre:
What are the requirements to apply for a verified badge?
We look at a number of factors when evaluating Instagram accounts to determine if they're in the public interest and meet our verification criteria.
In addition to following Instagram's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines, your account also needs to be:
Authentic: Your account must represent a real person, registered business or entity.
Unique: Your account must be the unique presence of the person or business it represents. Only one account per person or business may be verified, with exceptions for language-specific accounts. We don't verify general interest accounts (example: 
    
Complete: Your account must be public and have a bio, profile photo and at least one post. Your profile can't contain "add me" links to other social media services.
  
Notable: Your account must represent a well-known, highly searched for person, brand or entity. We review accounts that are featured in multiple news sources, and we don't consider paid or promotional content as sources for review.
Keep in mind that if you provide false or misleading information during the verification process, we will remove your verified badge and may take additional action to delete your account.

Only download electrum from original source, verify PGP keys.
When you create a HD wallet with electrum (or many others) you will be given a set of 12/24 words.
THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. write them down, twice. Also note down what is called a derivation path, looks something like m/49/0/0  and any password you applied.
You can then generate a receiving address and send to that address from the exchange. Start with a small tx. Play with the wallet. Uninstall the wallet, Reinstall the wallet and create a new one with those seed words. Your Bitcoin are showing? Cool. 
Generate a couple more receiving addresses, write down or print the public keys. Send the rest from exchange. Uninstall the wallet. Stash the seed words somewhere safe in two different geographical locations.
When you want to spend, download a new wallet, create with seed words and all your BTC is there to be sent wherever you want. 
You do not need to have a copy of the digital wallet file, you only need three things to restore.
SEED WORDS. DERIVATION PATH.  PASSWORD.

to clarify. The BTC is never in your wallet. The wallet only holds the private keys required to spend the BTC. The seed words allow you to recreate those keys using a standard many wallet programs support.
@_date: 2019-07-14 03:29:49
people sell unloaded ones all the time. Especially Americans, Its how they get around FinCEN. You load the BTC yourself. Edit: It would have been sold with a complete address that corresponds to the first bits.
If the address had ever been loaded, it would be on the blockchain and show in an explorer from the first bits, even if it had been emptied. If it doesnt show, it was never loaded.

no probs. Follow the instructions through to the end just to learn. That sat/B figure is really important. especially when you start taking control of your coin with your own wallet because you can set the fee for each tx. Too high and you pay too much, too low and they get stuck for days. Also be good to know how much your provider actually paid in fee.

ALL Aust exchanges are KYC and will want your ID attached to an account.
If you want anon purchases BISQ (theres little to no AUD traders on there though) or a few ATMs do no ID for small purchases. Find a monthly BTC Meetup near you and ask some one to sell to you for cash is a good option depending on if youre rural or not.
@_date: 2019-07-26 09:03:15
some of these answers are VERY misleading OP.
You dont need an accountant if you have good records.
1. Have you sold  BTC in 18/19 (even swapping for other crypto is taxable)
2. Did you use a regulated aus exchange?
3. Do you have good records of when you bought the BTC for real cost base inc fees.
4. can you use excel or similar spreadsheet software.
feel free to PM me, I am not an accountant but I can definitely help guide you on this subject. The rules are all on the ATO website.

No! They had far more risk. 
BTC is now proven as unstoppable. It is accepted by so many more online businesses, its in the social vernacular, they talk about it on MSM finance shit as a good way to hedge your portfolio.
Early adopters bought (or mined) a magical internet coin no one else in the world gave a shit about. $0 was far more likely than $100, let alone 19K.
OGs did the research at the time and saw the promise (and held it which is no mean feat). Dont be jelly.

anecdotal but I would put it at 2-5%

yes, they can. Its easy, the names and addresses of the operators are public knowledge. Send a cease and desist.

Income doesnt increase at the rate of inflation. I just provided a graph that showed the St Louis Fed has data that shows it doesnt keep pace.
No, you can purchase approx 97% of a meal with the same amount of money 1 year later. Most businesses prices increase yearly to keep up with inflation. The only way they can continue to operate as their costs increase is 1. Increase prices or 2. not increase wages.
I didnt mention housing, If that was included in CPI it would be a much bigger number.

it is already in a wallet. A "cold storage" paper wallet. the public key (address) will show you the funds if you type it in here: 
The private key allows you to import it into another "hot" wallet so you can send it somewhere else like an exchange (cant send from a paper "cold" wallet without importing to a "hot wallet"
If you REALLY need the money, or dont believe in bitcoin technology (read up at  import and send to an exchange to swap for FIAT. If you think this might be interesting, hold it for a year or two. Only problem is your boss also knows the private key and could empty the funds if you leave them where they are (unlikely since they gave it to you). If you quit your job, sweep the wallet first (import to a new hot one)

as it hasnt been mentioned.
The fee is related to a few things. 
Your time preference (this governs the sat/byte you set)
The size of your transaction (in Bytes, NOT BTC) the more inputs/outputs, the more Bytes = the higher the total fee.
Its possible you had many small inputs, therefore your tx was quite large in size, then Mycelium defaulted to a very high sat/byte fee = $13 fee.
Without the txID we cant be more specific.

I have a bad feeling we would be lucky if any current ones become the dominant cryptocurrency in the distant future. At least you can run your own full node to verify. It will probably be central bank owned and operated shit coins that the majority of people transact with every day. Look at email, how many average users run their own software instead of centralised gmail etc. It will be a small community of people that really care enough to continue to use anything not sponsored by the ruling powers (governments corporations and banks) 20 years from now.

are you being sarcastic (I cant tell anymore). if not:
You either deposit your btc to an exchange and then put in a sell order, or you had it stored with them already (bad idea). Your exchange account is credited the USD you sold BTC for and then you withdraw the USD to your bank account. 
At max its 3 steps. If you want FIAT: Deposit BTC, sell BTC, withdraw USD. If you want BTC: its Deposit USD, Buy BTC, Withdraw BTC to a wallet you control.

income of 7btc per year. govt takes 1 of it as income tax (uses that for health care and public services). At the moment and for the next couple of decades it will still all be fiat based, so there is no income tax on mining rewards. CGT is calculated on your profit 50% of your gain is added to your income. Here we have GST - goods and services tax, its pretty simple. If you buy a good or service, 10% of that purchase price is tax. the business pays 10% of the .0001 btc (so .00001 btc) to the government every quarter and receives 10% of what they have spent running their business.

treat anyone wanting to do p2p transactions for less than exchange rate as VERY suspect. The reason LBC sellers (and ATMs) charge a premium is because you dont need to provide ID etc, This means that they are dealing with people that REALLY want to put money into bitcoin anonymously.

If you purchased prior to August this year and kept the coins in your own wallet you control (not an online wallet) Yes, you do, there would also be 2 BCash.
If you have already sold their share but kept yours in the same address, you can transfer out the bitcoin to a new address, then import the Bcash to a supported wallet and sell or hold as you choose. BCash is about $1700 each. I suggest you read as much as you can about the process first before moving your coins.

more people trying to sell than buy, sellers lower ask price to be first to sell. Next seller lowers their ask price to be first to sell and on and on. People who thought they would hold for years see price dropping fast and decide to cash out too.

the same way the government can tell how much I have earned. Businesses would have to declare it (time_wasted works for me, I paid him 7 btc this year and withheld 1 btc as income tax), maybe they will legislate that we are only allowed one address, like a TFN or SS number - this would be the holy grail for governments. They can see everything we have earned and spent, it is all public. Governments despise cash, thats where the black market economy lives.

what? you put a fee of over 500 sats/Byte (depends on your tx size as to how much this is in USD) you will probably confirm within 1-2 blocks. The amount transferred is irrelevant. If you were legit, then drop 10000 sats/B to move your 333 btc and transfer it in the next block guaranteed. But I really doubt you are.

its approx 180GB for the blockchain (took a week to download) the last 24 hours has used 8GB down and 64 GB up (from the network traffic tab) Thats with 76 peers (68 in/8 out) Current Memory usage 300MB. this is on an old core2duo tower with the blockchain stored on an external 1TB HDD. your usage may vary.
edit: that was setting the slider to show the last day of traffic, but bandwidth usage is probably since last reboot (as it didnt change from 15 minutes or 1 day on the slider). so? assuming 1MB per block 6 blocks per hour = 144MB per day DOWN, so 8192/144 = 56.8 days? that seems a bit long since our last blackout though.

sorry, not enough experience to be helpful. 
Electrum is a highly recommended wallet though so if its preinstalled, use that. You might want to read here about the persistent volume:  
I would also make sure you write down the seed and private keys of any public key you send BTC to, before shutting down tails. Then if the wallet disappears, you can still restore.

Hey Mr Clean Face, I think you might misunderstand. No one in their right mind (or who has done any reading) would think the distribution of coins is decentralised. They are overwhelmingly in the hands of early adopters.
The ability for anyone to mine and/or run your own full node is what makes it decentralised. 
The thousands of nodes situated around the planet makes it geographically decentralised.
Me verifying the ledger and reporting that a transaction by one of these "whales" or a block produced by Bitmain is invalid is what makes it decentralised.
The inability for governments to take out a single entity and shut this shit down is what makes it decentralised.

Its all very hypothetical though, but common law would follow that the estate was finalized, and the beneficiaries can do whatever they see fit with their proceeds including return them to their relative that first obtained them when/if he is reanimated.
Its a fundamental principal that whoever controls the private keys can send those BTC to who/whatever they want. Censorship resistance is very important. You are advocating censorship by consensus and you will not find much support for that within the bitcoin community.

bitcoin(dot)com ios wallet for BTC (bitcoin) as opposed to the BCH (bitcoin cash) wallet they also provide within the same app.

you declare your gains. you choose not to declare your gain. Its up to you, but you know you are supposed to. Not sure ofthe IRS rules but my country, sees a sell as a sell and a buy as a buy, doesnt matter if its taken off exchange. eg: buy 5K, sell 10K (5000 gain added to your income and taxed accordingly) Buy 8k (new cost price) sell 18K (10K gain added to your income and taxed accordingly) buy 15K etc etc. Just keep good records and see an accountant if you want to abide by the law.

never used exodus. Possible the partial address was enough to point to the correct one. 
If you go here:
and start putting in an address, you'll see its only about 8 characters before it finds only 1 address that starts with that. As you only used a partial, and not complete address (which would return if it didnt exist) maybe it matched to the only one that exists with those leading characters. 
I dont know enough to tell you why exactly, but it worked out well for you.
edit: it looks like coinbase used to use an auto-suggest feature that was disabled as it referenced all blockchain addresses that started with whatever you type. maybe they have fine tuned that to auto suggest addresses you have sent to before. Login to coinbase and see where it was sent (partial or full address)

cli commands
Fees (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for transaction creation (default: 0.00001) 
So the default is 1 sat/byte.
Then you have 
Fee (in BTC/kB) to add to transactions you send (default: 0.00) 
or did you adjust this command to 50?
If paytxfee is not set, include enough fee so transactions begin confirmation on average within n blocks (default: 6) 
If you set txconfirmtarget to 50 then it should be 1 sat/b but you sent the tx at a time the mempool was large and just starting to empty again.

BUT, if it was a state actor that created it, they dont need to spend the coins, they are prepping the world for the next step which will destroy the black markets and provide maximum financial surveillance on a global scale.

It sets up a coinme online account for you, issues a temporary password and sends the BTC to the coinme wallet account.
read the user guide for what to expect. Seems like a pretty shitty ATM. FULL KYC (Pic and ID), and only sends to your coinme web wallet account, you then need to pay extra miner fees to send to your own wallet where you control the keys.
From the terms of sales:  "custodial virtual currency wallet that is managed by Coinme.  Coinme holds the private key that is associated with this wallet"

the fee per byte down the bottom of the blockchain page. That tx is 254 sat/B so you are also in the green section of the mempool along with OP. that transaction is huge, so at 2293 bytes, the fee for that one transaction is 582422 sats or 0.00582422 btc. Miners would want to fit lots of small transactions with high fees into a block though, not a few large ones with low(er) fees. I am still pretty new here but thats how I understand it.

&lt;200 sats for a standard 1 in 2 out tx (approx 250 byte ?) would also fall into this area. 
I think if enough txs use a flat rate value, miners will eventually follow it. The users of BTC set the fee, if we all go lower than 1 sat/b miners either mine empty blocks just for the reward, or include the low fee tx's to get (a small amount of) extra BTC.
Problem is, the first pool to accept these tx's is setting a precedent that no other pool want set.

correct. The current hashrate is the result of a "gold rush" to  mine while you can get big chunks of BTC (currently 12.5 * 6000 USD = 75K every 10 minutes on average). Once there is only little bits of BTC (fees) to be collected by mining, many miners will abandon the practice. The difficulty will adjust down until the fees will be more profitable than the energy required to mine a block.

I think it depends on the time frame of that drop. 99% drop in less than 2016 blocks, sure a shit load of miners MIGHT turn off and the network is at a crawl. If it takes over 2016 blocks, some will turn off and the difficulty adjusts down. The DA algorithm means if the drop is slow enough, there will always be someone left to keep it chugging along until every single ASIC is turned off and BOOM. GPU mining is back on the menu.

150 - 100 = $50 profit.

I think 2016 was used to get a good average of the difficulty that smooths out the probability (luck) differences between blocks. A miner found a block in 4 minutes, oh its way too easy, up the difficulty. Next block took an hour, now its way too hard, drop the difficulty. You adjust it every block and it will jump all over the place and be no better off. Block time is 10 minutes ON AVERAGE over 2016 blocks.

My understanding is miners fill a block with valid transactions from the mempool while they work on the header trying to get the hash of the next block. If they succeed, GREAT, they win the block reward. 
If they dont they keep trying for the next hash while filling their block again with different valid transactions. 
Sometimes they can solve the hash before they have filled a block with valid transactions, this results in empty blocks as they are mining on just the header. 
Why would you ignore the transactions, the fees are an extra reward.


it doesnt take time to fill the block in the human sense, ASICS process so fast it is done within a second
Again, just my newb understanding, someone please correct me where im wrong.

Yup already have.
They are very specific about personal use. You need to basically buy the btc to use straight away as a payment for X.
If you bought and held btc for any length of time and it appreciates in value before you spend it, its not a personal use asset its an investment. "The longer it is held, the less likely it is personal use"
if you made a gain, they want some of it. Whether you choose to tell them about it is up to you.

The ATO is already targeting Cash heavy small buinesses with letters explaining the "benefits" of using electronic payment systems. But you better make sure those payment systems are owned by the banks. Dont be accepting crypto, or your speculating on an asset.

Took the car and had to remind the seller every day it was coming (I sent them screenshots and transfer receipts) but not to expect the payment to be in their account until next tuesday (bought on friday)

do you really think "I will be able to buy more wine next week than I can now, so I should wait?" Maybe its because Im an Alcoholic, I will buy a bottle of whiskey today, and I will buy another one next week. We will still spend BTC on things we really want no matter the USD price of BTC. 
edit: this is creating a case for the "need" everyone has something different they need/want. They will spend BTC on whatever they need/want. The idea of BTC being deflationary as a bad thing has not played out in the real world.

you should complain to the exchange that if you know it needed a higher fee, they should too. Give them a link to a decent fee estimator, tell them to get their shit together and once your tx confirms never use them again.
edit: to play devils advocate, the mempool was empty 4 hours ago but just filled up real quick. You need 10 sats/b for next block right now.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:52:14

Mining Bitcoin? have to use recent ASIC machines and have cheap electricity to turn a profit.
0.2 BTC for the miner and assuming 10c/KWh heres the calculator
Assuming no difficulty increases (DO NOT assume this as it has been increasing rapidly) it would take 6 months to pay off the miner.
There are many other coins you can mine with GPU rigs. Bitcoin is not one of them.

so buy one, bit by bit. Strip all the expenses you can do without and put that into bitcoin. at 10k it will take 2 years of $100/week to obtain 1 bitcoin. If you really want it, you gotta sacrifice.

its not a "deflationary currency" at this point in time.
"Once   a   predetermined   number   of   coins   have   entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free."
This predetermined number is 21 Million. It is currently inflationary at  3.93%, there will be another $11B (at current value) added to the supply before the next halving when it drops to 1.8%
Current USD inflation from 2016 (last halving) is 4.4%

"This entity is responsible for taking orders from customers and matching up buys and sells. It takes a cut of the trade for doing this work. It’s doing stuff “off-chain” "

it is simple and easy. Its actually more difficult to use in person than online. If both people have and use it its the easiest online currency there is. If not, its easier to install a wallet than open a paypal or bank  account, or even install an app that then needs to then be linked to one of those.

It depends on how much USD and how much risk you want to take. Leaving on Binance is an option, but then it is just an IOU from Binance. 
For a hardware wallet, a lot of ERC20 coins are supported on a Ledger Nano. 
Some coins have their own wallets for you to use, best to research and choose the ones you want, then check out their subs on reddit for great info by their communities
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:23:38
Did they give you a tx id or did they just tell you it was sent? Dont trust, verify. You need a txid or it didnt happen.
Unconfirmed transactions still show up in a block explorer. The moment they broadcast the TX it has an ID. You need that ID to verify they did what they say they did.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:45:00
its looks more like government approval is just acceptance that btc cant be stopped. participation is the realisation it is not going away, so the incumbents want to figure out a way to co-opt it.

its a bit off according to johoe's page
1 sat/b will get the next block. this site is recommending 6 sats/byte. I guess that allows for mempool growth before next block is mined.

You can send it to anyone, they dont need a cc or eftpos machine, just a mobile phone connected to the internet.
When youre receiving, those txs arent "free and instant" they cost fees, rental of the machines and they can be reversed any time in the next few weeks. EFT ACH or SEPA deposits take days to clear for the receiver
you receive "rewards" but you are also open to have your funds frozen (if not straight up removed), your transaction blocked, your deposits denied.
You are protected from fraud to a certain extent but with freedom comes great responsibility.
Dont get me wrong, third party financial institutions have a place, but its not in peer to peer transactions and it doesnt need to be in customer to merchant transactions either.


Thats cool, keep doing that then but BTC is not useless.

agree with the last part of your comment, but most people in AUS are banked (we get accounts in primary school) and dont give a shit about censorship resistance. I think BTC is better, but i feel the banks are working hard to negate its main benefits to many Australians with OSKO/NPP.
@_date: 2018-05-15 00:25:08
true, but the government and elites dont need to use the blockchain (right now). IF the NSA invented this, it would have been about illuminating the cash economy by moving it to an electronic medium that is easy to observe. Im not saying I think the NSA invented it, but its a tidy answer to the cash black hole from a government perspective. 
Im Australian and as you may have read, our government is pushing for electronic payments for businesses so hard, they banned cash transactions over 10K AUD (7.5K USD).
Bitcoin will help move those that want to stay "off the books" to electronic payments that the user probably doesnt realise are fully observable by the ATO, especially when the ATO hires a company like Chainalysis

edit: you can check on a block explorer what fee they actually paid. chuck your txid in here: 
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:05:32
you didnt do anything wrong. The error was in the wallets fee estimator because the default fee was too low. This is common with wallets and was just unlucky timing. The wallet was estimating a fee based on the previous blocks and mempool, it didnt (and cant possibly) predict that a wall of txs would be broadcast at higher fees.
@_date: 2019-03-14 02:48:43


there is an argument for that. Its about resetting a broken system so it cant happen again. 
The GFC was definitely something that had to happen and was just part of the boom bust business cycle that is in no way controlled by interest rates set by the central banks to keep people spending as a way to keep the economy "thriving".

This same experience was something that convinced me BTC is P2P commerce perfected (both in person and online).
2 years ago I bought a second hand car, and the seller contacted me every day stressing I hadnt paid them (she had given me the keys based on the email of the bank transfer receipt but money wasnt in her account yet). It took 3-5 business days for a bank transfer to clear, I bought the car on a Saturday Morning.

oh okay. Dont think of your fee as a total amount eg 0.01BTC. Look at it as an amount per byte eg 3 sats per byte.  The fee can be much more as a total if the tx is larger (more inputs used, not from a segwit address etc) but still be lower as a sat/byte value.
The sat/byte value is whats important.

not centralised, just early days.
You can run your own node and accept that 5 sats if you already have a channel open, but its not as easy. Closing channels to receive it in a BTC wallet requires an on chain tx, so 5 sats aint gonna cut it.

We're going around in circles buddy. Just admit youre not going to get the answer you're looking for. "Oh wow, you're right. Bitcoin should have increased the block size in 2017", (some people did btw, its called Bitcoin Cash) The math shows it would be untenable.

you could import your private key to a different wallet. Is it a seed (12-24 words) or key (string of letters/numbers)
the fact privatekey.txt even exists is slightly disconcerting.
As this is a wallet that primarily supports bitcoin cash, you would be better off posting to r/btc (I know it doesnt make sense that the sub for BCH is called BTC, but it is what it is)

I dont know but there will be a big disagreement over this.
exchanges will say "we cant accept anonymous BTC that cant be traced, we have to abide by regulations" governments will say "anonymous BTC helps fund terrorism and pedo's (much like they did before they realised they could track the funds) users will say "we want privacy and fungibility, its digital cash"
where this ends up is anyones guess.

the higher the hashrate, the less likely someone can 51% it.
so, yes. 
Will BTC still work if not using all that energy? sure. Will someone be able to doublespend and roll back the chain if they have more than the network hashrate? yes.
I prefer security of the chain over energy reduction. All the miners should be using renewables any way. Wind/Solar/Hydro and there is no issue with energy consumption.

your wallet holds private keys that allow you to spend specific Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO'S) stored on the block chain.
There is not really such a thing as 1 whole Bitcoin, but you could have the keys to spend a UTXO that is 1.00000000 BTC.
your wallet stores your keys, and tallies up all the UTXOs you have the private keys for, giving you a nice "overall" balance.

we dont need to hope. Its inevitable. Every company in the world could buy into bitcoin. you cant stop it at its grass roots which is a mighty middle finger to the financial system.
the one thing that could change things significantly is BTC devs (which I do not see happening), but if we all know how to read the code, we dont upgrade to the new version and we run our own chain instead. its win win.

But Johnny Mainstream doesnt need to know or care about it. Same as I dont care if my Bank account balance of $5.00 is made up of 50x10c payments. 
Although, I would care if it meant it cost me more to send that $5.00 because it was made up of 50x10c payments than 1x$5.00 payment and I could make it cheaper to transact by consolidating the payments to myself for 1c when the network isnt busy.

simplified: finding a correct nonce is chance. Could be 1 second could be 1 day (unlikely). Each miner is trying millions of numbers, 1 after the other to see if it has more 0s at the start than required difficulty. As soon as 1 finds it, broadcast the block and the race starts again.
Difficulty changes every 2016 blocks (approx 2 weeks) to ensure 10 minute blocks **on average** for the next 2016 blocks .

No. Supply is set at 12.5 BTC per block, regardless of how difficult it is to find a block. This will reduce to 6.25 some time in 2020. 2009 - 2012 it was 50 BTC per block. 2012 - 2016 was 25 BTC per block. 
Difficulty has no real relevance to supply. The difficulty is adjusted using the total time to find the previous 2016 blocks to maintain a 10 minute average block time over the next 2016 blocks. Its really quite elegant.

It will show you the amount of BTC secured by the private key.
Then follow d3vrandom, you can also use electrum to create a new address and give that to coinspot to withdraw the BTC they owe you to a wallet you control (electrum)

Like I have said. You have been given an answer, but you disagree with it and you dont want to hear it.


assuming full blocks since then (which might happen if there was no fee/wait incentive) the blockchain added 10MB per block.
SO,  well use block 500000 found 19/12/17 - 569006 = 69006 x 10 MB = 690060 MB = 690 GB added to the blockchain since December 2017 = current blockchain of 0.95 TB (3x current size added in last 18 months) 
Does this seem feasible to keep this up for the next 5-10 years?
You cant prove X+Y = Z without doing X+Y so youre request is bullshit. We can think X+Y = Z and If Z is undesirable, then dont add Y to X.
If you really want to see how this plays out, use a big block coin and max out its blocks, then try to keep up with the hardware requirements for running a full node. But you cant because the rest of the market chose not to use a big block coin.
How about you prove big blocks DONT lead to centralisation when processing the same number of TXs? Thats a much easier task, Except no one is using it!

Do not buy a stock which you have failed to investigate thoroughly. EG. If a railroad stock, how about impeading? wage or freight inreases or decreases? How a man can sweat! and with the thermometer at zero when he sells short and it goes up and stays strong. There is no relief or consolation, just haggard waiting and beady brow and weak legs.The long side is **so much better** if you know you have picked a feeder and a 10% earner. A drop means little unless you bought it in a boom, and if you did it likley was not earning 8 or 10%. There are so many pitfalls for corporations. One should anticipate depressions about every 7 yrs and liquidate his stocks into **cash.**
Do not buy anything (oil leases, a car or a whatnot) when a salesman or owner tries to hurry you. for a good, legitimate deal, the seller will want you to take necessary time to investigate. However, if not, let 'er skip -
There will be other opportunities. Dont hurry but move smoothly forward a step or two at a time according to your "business legs"
Don't ignore real estate!! I have noticed during this tragic depression that the men who bought good business property before it came and had it paid for didnt event feel a depression. But it should be chosen with judgement + foresight

Banks caused lots of the hunger if you ask me, and fluent commerce is the only decent remedy for unemployment. Feeding the hungry should be done by cities and states to make it snappy.

Usually, Faster Payments will be received by the payee almost immediately after leaving your account, but can sometimes take up to 2 hours

Fastest: ATM
Lowest Fees: An Exchange
Bovada are recommending Blockchain as a stepping stone to avoid the fact Coinbase doesnt play well with gambling sites.
You can withdraw from Bovada to a wallet you control (Mobile or Desktop) and then you send the BTC to coinbase (setting your own fee), sell and withdraw to your Bank account.
You could also use a different exchange, you dont need to use blockchain OR coinbase, these are just suggestions - and quite shitty ones at that.
edit: Better yet, dont cash out the BTC. Withdraw it to your wallet and then send it back to Bovada when you inevitably have another "guaranteed winning tip"  :)

look at the bottom graph and hover your cursor to the very right. 4.32MB next to the 3+ means there is 4.32MB of TXs that are paying a higher fee.

10 min to find a nonce, the block is already prepared and ready to broadcast. If there are double spends in a block, it will not be validated, so they need to prepare a new block and risk someone else finding a nonce. This is all in the milliseconds due to ASICs.
orphaned blocks:
These are people that found blocks, but the next block was built on the other one found around the same time which makes the longest chain. Longest chain wins.

everyone here knows that the BTC/USD dropped A LOT in 2018. No one will get mad if you state a fact.
-17K = 2.7K per BTC, not really fact (-16K) but close enough.
yeah, it sucks. The fact it landed after this last crash at 3.5K is pretty good though. 
1/1/2017 - 1/1/2018 - 1/1/2019
996.00 - 15004.00 - 3784.00
= +1406% pa for 17/18 and -74% pa for 18/19 If you bought in Jan 17 and held through the bubble its still  +279% for two years = 139.5% per annum (Please name something else that increases in value 139% pa). 
Shit still looks pretty good when you start using math.

Because it is more beneficial to that user to just mine BTC with the hashpower they have unless their sole objective is to destroy it.
If thats their objective and their willing to spend that much money to do it, it will be destroyed. Value will drop to almost nothing as panic sets in, devs will hardfork to rollback the mined blocks, enact a different algo and we all start again at the beginning as peers mining with CPUs and GPUs.

no. IF youre running a full node, it has all the UTXOs in a database, with a record of which ones changed each block and references that to see if your keys are unspent.
IF youre using a mobile/desktop wallet that doesnt hold the ledger, the wallet is referencing some other copy of the blockchain.
Dont think of it as data written to a HDD as we are used to. It doesnt need to be sequential. It seems youre really interested in the detailed "how" BTC works. I suggest you subscribe to the dev mailing list and start reading further. Books like Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos   OR if you want a hard copy  would be a good start.
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:42:10


thats presumptuous. If it was 51% we would all know. If you werent transacting in the reorg depth you wouldnt lose anything. youre talking about extremes so if youre transacting without paying attention to the space then your tx will get ignored because the attacker doesnt have your private key.
no one said anything about phones. the moment BTC difficulty (and algo) dropped to GPU levels every other coin will lose its hashpower as most miners switch to BTC.
Its a no brainer. If BTC goes down (edit: physically due to 51%, not if it goes down in USD value), all others are dead and BTC will rise from the ashes like a phoenix.

not sure if you have withholding tax in your Jurisdiction but here your employer deducts tax from your wage and sends it to the government every quarter. There is no reason why BTC as a global money standard would be any different. Any employer not declaring or paying your withheld tax to the government will be guilty of a crime. 
The government Garnishing wages will be a different story. I imagine by that time BTC will only be allowed to be paid to an employees account held by a third party that will work with the government. 
It will be an interesting transition if/when it happens. BTC will possibly be regulated into something vastly different that will allow government controls that already exist in FIAT.

fourth result from investopedia.
What Is an Asset?
An asset is a resource with economic value that an individual, corporation or country owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide a future benefit.
So is USD/EUR/CNY an asset? I guess so, the definition of "future benefit" might be debatable for currencies. 
BTC is first and foremost a native internet currency. Speculation is secondary.

Yes, It SHOULD go to a new address within the same wallet (Best Practice). Depends how your chosen wallet handles change.
Not the full 0.00001 I sent you because there isnt enough in that UTXO to cover the fee as well. Your address is legacy (not segwit) so generally 1 input 2 output (recipient and change) would be about 256 sats at 1 sat/byte.
2 input (both 0.00001 UTXOs) 2 output would be around 600 sats. So you could send around 0.000019400 at 1 sat/byte.
edit: read up about change addresses here if youre interested.

good point, but as someone working in a small business that has to send documents by post, seeing the annual cost of postage go up 40% and the delivery time drop to 5 days its still shit service.
The worst is the debt collection notices that give people 14 days to respond, but it took 5 days to get to us and another 5 days to get to them. Which leaves them 4 days from the date it was originally sent to contact the issuing party and organise a payment arrangement.

sort of. If you had transacted then yes, your transaction no longer existed. Bear in mind no one had bought goods or services with BTC at that point, it was merely "here have some of my internet tokens that have no USD value"
Did it make the bitcoin people had mined disappear? for the rolled back blocks yes, but they were all on board as the exploit gave the miner of that block 92 billion bitcoin (or something ridiculous like that) and they were all mining with CPUs so could just continue on the new chain. It was seen as an attack on the community, they decided the best answer was to roll it back and continue from the exploited block after their software was patched to prevent it happening again.
The rest of the blockchain prior to the rolled back block 
 (74638) was unaffected. As it should be.
Im sure there was someone that complained Alice had sent them 100 BTC and now she doesnt want to send it again (Bloody Bob, always complaining)

Your best bet is to actually use it. BTC is amazing and you learn so much by spending it, managing your own keys and generally just playing with the tech.

the related BTC/month earnings for the 3 devices shown would no longer be accurate due to increasing difficulty. 
In fact this shows 1x s9 miner is only profitable mining BTC if you pay &lt; 10c/kwh for your electricity. If difficulty stays the same, (it wont) it takes over 2100 days (almost 6 years) to mine 1 btc with a single S9 antminer.

It is thought its a way of linking HD wallet addresses to other ones owned by the same user. next TX out, your wallet might include that input and then that means any other inputs used in that tx must have been yours too which widens the net of ownership.

interesting question. I dont know the answer but I think it would have to do with if Bitcoin Core is reading the entire blockchain every new block to make sure its valid? which means reading every memory address every 10 min (on avg). 
But, I think SSDs are constrained more by write cycles, I would think the software is never writing over a memory address, so it should last longer than "normal use"

Nothing makes you pay attention and want to learn like "Skin in the game" Learning more will usually make people want to buy more. Using BTC and being comfortable controlling your keys, creating wallets, making your transactions etc will put you a couple of steps ahead of most people if this experiment truly takes off.
About USD value, Lets say you buy $300 worth @ 6K. If BTC goes to 12K your $300 is now 600. If BTC goes to 3K your 300 is now 150. You will not be "Rich" from $300, its too late for easy riches from a couple of hundred dollars. Those days are gone.

@_date: 2019-11-04 04:36:07
"Use a bitcoin address once and only once" is already pretty ELI5.
But, it means NEVER spend from an address more than once. NEVER return change to a used address. Generate a new address for each and every transaction. Spending some coin? Generate a new receiving address to receive the change.
Multiple deposits to an address that has never been spent from is fine, but ALWAYS Spend the entire amount and send the change to a new address. Once you have spent from an address consider it compromised.
Spending puts a hash of your private key on the blockchain and this means the address is now vulnerable to hypothetical QC attacks that can break the hash and get the private key.

I think 2 weeks was seen as a happy medium to ensure the adjustments were not too drastic.
Have a look at a block explorer, blocks are NEVER found exactly 10 minutes apart. So real-time difficulty adjustment would have the difficulty swinging wildly due to the probabilistic nature of POW. Which would cause more issues due to profit seeking miners.
eg: a block is found in 2 minutes, difficulty ramps way up to compensate, Miners leave for other SHA256 chains as BTC is now so difficult. Less miners means even longer for the next block. The next one takes 2 hours to find, difficulty drops very low, miners come back and find a block in 7 seconds. repeat.

I agree. A lot of people, especially those who dont think of BTC as internet money, will sell their most speculative assets first. BTC is going to be top of that list to sell when times get tough.
BUT...Hodlers of last resort will be buying it DCA like they always do which may mean theres a quicker turn around as other "investors" see its not losing percentage like the rest of their portfolio. Thats a big butt!

not necessarily an attack, just a bit shit. there is a reason to mine empty blocks due to timing but that wasnt the case.
yes empty blocks reduce the bandwidth needed to upload them but those txs will make it into the first miners block that isnt being a cunt so overall, there is no benefit to the cost of running a full node.

new change address is still part of your wallet balance. Can then be spent on any value less than the UTXO or merged with other addresses to create a larger spend amount.
When merging UTXOs you really need to start understanding Coin Control to retain any privacy. - Read (and understand) DarthCoinMaster's link above by nopara73 (creator of Wasabi).

you are spending from an unconfirmed TX.
it goes back to this one:
which has a fee of 1sat/byte. The previous tx's need to be confirmed before the utxo is spendable, JAXX really shouldnt have let you try to spend them.
edit: It goes to this one:   then  then you try to spend.
Youre not getting a conf until the 1 sat/byte txs are confirmed, no matter what fee you set.
edit2: your parent just got confirmed! and now your TX is confirmed. Looks like a miner included them all in the same block to pick up your high fee of 17 sat/byte

DDG'd it and seems to be an electrum codec issue
I would install bitcoin core if thats the software that created the wallet. You dont need to sync the blockchain to run a "dumpwallet" command. Then use an explorer to find the keys that still hold BTC.
There is a way to export only keys that have BTC, but I think that needs a synced chain.

At the risk of destroying your faith in their knowledge, with this particular subject your Uni prof is wrong. 
1 Antminer s9 runs 16 TH/s so one machine tries to find a correct nonce 16000000000000 times per second. There is no THE correct nonce, just A correct nonce, there is many. 
All THE correct nonce is, is the FIRST broadcast block with A correct nonce. The first with A correct nonce wins the race. There is no "remaining time" blocks are found randomly and difficulty adjustments keep the block times **on average** every ten minutes.  Watch a block explorer for a while to see its not ten minutes per block.  . (2 mins ago, 16 mins ago 25 mins ago, 29 mins ago)

People dont accept payapl because its easily reversible.
if you are using core node/wallet that is fully synced to the blockchain, it will work. There is no need to test the address.
Just take the plunge and withdraw the lot from slushpool. If you are planning to sell immediately on an exchange then get verified and send it straight to your exchange address from slushpool to sell for AUD. This will eliminate the fee for the second tx from the core wallet to exchange address.

heres a direct overlay of 1 year June 29 - June 29 2013/14 and 2017/18. (red is 2017/18) Looks like things are moving quicker this time around but the patterns are pretty similar. IF history repeats, we have started the longer downtrend and IF it moves more quickly could bottom out around late November 2018. (previous Bottomed out mid Jan 2015) So that would make a new ATH late 2019 early 2020.
But what the hell do I know. Charts can say whatever you want them to.

NEVER part with the goods until the buyers tx has at least 3 confirmations unless you really trust them. The first one may take some time, the next 2 will be an extra 20 minutes on average.
If you give them the items while the tx is unconfirmed, they can broadcast a new tx using those inputs at a higher fee back to themselves. This tx will be included in a block first and your SOL.

the btc went there then sent 12 hours later to 2 more addresses.
3BJASyASXNXKSvcXxHfQLpVUuoB4qyVA3R (still there)
and  37ipUcR14gWk43mUZ3QmLnGUbPMwFDexMT  which moved to 2 more and so on. you can follow the transactions on a block explorer.

@_date: 2018-06-21 23:23:26
sort of. A miner creates the block (by solving the hash first), then fills it with transactions and broadcasts it to the network. Any transaction that cannot be verified creates an invalid block and the process needs to be done again. Miners make sure they dont include invalid transactions by having the entire blockchain to compare UTXO's with (Unspent Transaction Outputs). Full nodes (and other miners) also compare the new block with all previous UTXOs to make sure it is valid. If it is invalid, the network rejects it and it becomes an orphaned block, the network then takes the next available block and checks if it is valid. It is! this is now included in the blockchain and the miner that created it gets the reward.
The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks (approx 2 weeks) based on total hashrate to keep the average time of block production at ten minutes. see how it moves in steps.

Its a cloud mining service. 
At best its an expensive way to get BTC, at worst its a straight up scam.
There isnt enough info without registering to see what the ROI will be. 2 years min contract Min 1Terahash. no info on electricity costs, they say no maintenance fee.
So you pay them $X now to mine with 1 TH of their ASIC farm for the next two years. You will receive a partial payment from any blocks they find.
eg: you rent 1 th, they have 500 th pointed at a pool. The pool finds a block and pays gmining their portion of the reward. they subtract rent and electricity then gmining divide what they received by 500 to pay you your portion.
Difficulty and hashrate will rise exponentially within 2 years (look at the last two years) so your payout will decrease over that time.
You would be better off either buying BTC outright and holding for 2 years or buying your own miner to run and pointing it at a pool yourself.

the 0.0005 fee is not the complete picture. The fee is priced in sats/byte.  Thats what determines your place in the mempools and therefore the time until confirmation.

It can be stressful in the beginning, but be patient.
Wait for the blockchain to complete downloading. approx 250GB
Wait for Coindirect to give you a txID for the transaction.
Then use that to look up the transaction in a block explorer.
Once the blockchain has downloaded, back up your wallet.
It gets a little less stressful with experience, but never get complacent. Always check and double check addresses, never BTC drunk.

read the abstract of the whitepaper.
A  purely   peer-to-peer   version   of   electronic   cash   would   allow   online payments   to   be   sent   directly   from   one   party   to   another   without   going   through   a financial institution.   Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.The   network   timestamps   transactions   by   hashing   them   into   an   ongoing   chain   of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.   The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.   As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network,  they'll  generate the  longest  chain  and  outpace attackers.   The network itself requires minimal structure.   Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis,   and   nodes   can   leave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

if you can break SHA256 you can break the internet. "Unix and Linux vendors are moving to using 256- and 512-bit SHA-2 for secure password hashing.[18]" 
I dont think Bitcoin will be the first network attacked. Theres a lot more money to be made finding and breaking hashed passwords of multiple UHNW individuals. Once that happens, there will be standardised publicly available upgrade options like SHA-3. Bitcoin will hard fork, your bits will be safe.
Remember, its likely all the devs working on code have significant amounts of bitcoin. Its to their benefit to make sure it remains secure.
edit: also, dont reuse addresses. address reuse leaves the public key on the blockchain, this is what quantum computers will need to break the private key.

If you have enough hashpower to seriously affect the DAA (eg 16%), you could turn off after block 1000, the next 1016 would take more than 10 min on average and you would see a drop in difficulty at block 2017, then turn it all on again and mine the next 1000 blocks.
But. You need A LOT more hashpower to make 16% and affect the BTC chain over alts, you would be spending 1016 BTC blocks mining an alt worth far less USD than just competing for BTC rewards for the entire 2016.

Im just going by what is reported to coinatmradar which is no limits, no kyc. I have never been there. Seems to me that a no KYC no limit BTC ATM could easily move 10K a week if the locals get a lot of pounds and want to use it to convert to BTC. "No limit" withdrawals would obviously be stifled by how much the machine has in it at the time.

1st up, I never give advise to anyone about if they should or shouldnt buy BTC. I dont know what btc/usd is gonna do and I say that all the time.  I have never told anyone to buy bitcoin. I dont think BTC is an investment. I think it is money and I buy it every week and spend it at least once a month.
2nd, I didnt buy for too high, I buy some every week with money I would otherwise waste on shit that would now be worth 0. every time my DCA is coming up, it makes me happy if BTC/USD is lower than before because I get more of it.
I also feel sorry for anyone that is "influenced" by my reddit comments. Make your own decisions, why the fuck would you follow someone named time_wasted?

QC as a miner will be able to double spend and then increase the longest tip for 2016 blocks max. Difficulty will adjust up and then they stop mining. That will cause a very long next 2016 blocks until it adjusts back down.
The most beneficial for any bad actor that has access to a QC would be to crack all the passwords of bank accounts and transfer the funds. BTC is a small fish in a giant ocean when referring to QC being used to break SHA256.

the first command unlocks your wallet. &lt;YOUR PASSWORD&gt; is whatever your password is. 600 is the amount of time before you need to do it again (600 seconds)
the second command will output a list of all the addresses that have ever received BTC
The third command outputs the private key of any address you type instead of &lt;address&gt; (use ones shown in previous step)
You then have a list of public and private keys for the addresses in the Bitcoin Core wallet.
As dooglus said, use the command "listunspent" instead of "listreceivedbyaddress" as this shows all the addresses with unspent BTC.

DCA. Its currently recognised as a bear market.
Keep buying the same small(ish) amounts every day/week/month, maybe a bit extra if you see a double digit % drop. If you see a massive run up like late 2017 (again 10% + per day) then fomo some more than normal but not everything.
Better yet, Buy some and use it as a currency to buy other things you would normally buy with fiat and learn as much as you can. 
You will be 9 steps ahead of most of the population if you can safely control your keys, create transactions, verify they have been received, calculate the best fees etc.

Firstly, sorry for your loss. This person has left you  a very good leg up in life. Dont waste it. Dont trust any advice via PM. Dont tell any more info.
sign up to a reputable exchange based in your country and complete all the ID verification, connect a bank account. While youre waiting to be approved start reading:
Figure out how your BTC is already stored (what type of wallet etc), look at explorers to see how its broken up.
Send 1 BTC to your account. Set a limit order just above the current price. Wait.
While youre waiting keep reading.
once the BTC is sold, withdraw the fiat to your bank account. 
Book an appointment with a tax accountant, lawyer and financial adviser.
Good luck.

A lot of people are expecting a price jump in "othercoin" after halving. Gains will be then taken and flow back to BTC.

BTC Addresses (what are generated by ledger, you would give the exchange to send to) look like these:
Legacy: 1G47mSr3oANXMafVrR8UC4pzV7FEAzo3r9
Nested Segwit: 3Dh2Eab3gRecASgnY9MZv7rpKUs5ZzLwJS
Native Segwit: bc1quyzm8y3jtzetxpr0u75s0kf62g447htjww7c2y
Yes you should double check every letter and number when giving someone an address to send to. It is money they are sending, treat it as such.
No you dont need to be logged in for the transaction to complete. Tell the exchange to send to the address you generated, they should make you double check and confirm it. Then you will see the coin in your ledger wallet next time you login.

USD is determined by Supply and demand. The demand is determined by FOREX traders and their opinion of its worth relative to other currencies, the supply is determined by the FED.

You and I can agree if the supply rate is allowed to change via consensus (which we wont)

@_date: 2019-02-25 08:33:30
yes. Its probably because the Tx had "Replace By Fee" or "Child Pays for Parent" enabled. Which wallet were you sending from?
BTW, neither of those functions allow the sender to spend the inputs again after it has been confirmed ONCE. 3 confirmations is for good measure to avoid a possible orphan block inclusion and is basically irreversible. 14 confirmations is overkill.
Again, If youre using blockchain as your wallet, stop it. You can easily secure it safely and still have full control over your BTC.

I have never said the IMF should be scared of Bitcoin (or "My Shitcoin" as you so eloquently put it) I think there is a place for both sovereign fiat currencies and a currency of the internet that I can control.
My comment was to point out that they acknowledged people may use cryptocurrencies as a way to subvert negative interest rates imposed on both bank deposits AND cash. Their only response to that admission was that they need to educate people as to why their system of a dual floating local currency (electronic and physical) is the best way forward so not to erode trust in the banks. That coupled with new laws that ensure that the sovereign  e-currency is the only legal tender.
you can think cryptocurrencies suck. You can trust the governments and central banks of the world to do the right thing for you, thats fine. Bitcoin is an option you dont need to use and no one is forcing you. 
edit: and to address your strange piracy analogy. the majority of pirates were people that literally couldnt obtain that content legally in a time frame or way they wanted.

but, the crypto exchanges arent regulated. I was wondering this today, if the futures are regulated, surely they will want to regulate the underlying asset (BTC) because what stops a CME "associate" from whaling in with massive buy orders and raising the price to collect the short orders. It seems that a couple of exchanges control the global price trend.

I think the "global mainstream" as YOU called it, in regards to BTC usage is those that buy shit over the internet. eCommerce has increased rapidly over the last 10 years. BTC is a far superior platform to VISA/Paypal/EFT etc.

that is your wallets fee estimator along with a slight congestion that happens every day. Your wallet underestimated the required fee to be in the next block.
If you want to be in the next block, you have to pay appropriately. learn to read the mempool and use custom fees. It makes you consider how fast you NEED the tx, as it saves you sats if you can wait.

math.  amount of BTC * USD Value of BTC
eg: you have 0.2786 BTC, 1 BTC is worth 3800 USD. Therefore 0.2768 * (multiplied by) 3800 = 1051.84  so you have $1051.84 USD worth of BTC. Apps like Blockfolio will let you monitor this conversion rate.
If you want to sell your BTC for FIAT, then you send to any exchange you are verified to sell at, any ATM that buys BTC or to anyone that pays you for it. Your wallet doesnt care who the recipient is.

The government has seen people make very large sums of fiat buying crypto and selling it at a later date. They want their cut. 
I think the CGT event on spending is a misguided way of closing the loophole "I didnt sell it for fiat when I bought that $10,000 item directly with BTC that I bought for $100, so no CGT". 
It also has the bonus effect of reducing the chance BTC will become a widely used Currency and pose any real threat to the government Dollar. win/win for them.

1 block extra per 100 was due to 1% advantage. (it was actually 49 v 51 so 2% advantage? im sure im missing something here) 85 v 15 is 70% advantage so lets use 145 blocks back as he did.
-145 v 0, -75 v 30, -5 v 60, 65 v 90, 135 v 120! so the 1 day roll back would take somewhere between 4-5 days to catch up with 85% of hashrate pointed at would could possibly be a failed attempt.
The rest of the miners on the original chain (15% of what was there at same difficulty) are CLEANING UP in this time as theres fewer miners competing to find a block, they are all receiving many more block rewards than they normally would even though finding a block takes more time, theres less miners competing for the reward.
20% of those in pools that are trying the reorg say "fuck it, thats easy pickings. im switching to a pool that isnt doing this roll back shit" Roll back chain is going to take longer now.

yes. As  you said, most of the money moving around our economy is digital already.
when retail banks are charged negative interest rates by central banks, how do they pass that on to their customers without losing their margin? They cant. eUSD means that its "trapped" and you cant withdraw cash. Cash creates the zero lower bound. eliminate cash over time with an eUSD and you have no zero lower bound.
Central Banks around the world are flirting with neg rates right now. They know cash is restricting the implementation of it to the end user. eDollars are the next step.

1. Because you think BTC has a bigger upside and you realise you will be unable to time the "bottom"
2. The USD value may well collapse if governments make fiat/BTC exchanges illegal, so what. They cant stop it, see the war on drugs. In fact prohibition seems to increase the price of things, not the other way around.
3. If you think they offer anything original. Thats your decision to make.
4. Anyone can fork the code and create a new version with different parameters. Not anyone can convince the 45 exahash currently on BTC to mine their chain. BCH and others exist because there is a market for them, people want to buy and use it.

youre right. 
I would not be surprised by $59K/BTC within 7 years. If you can liquidate 50K now, your holding at least 5 so better to take the loan and pay it down with fiat.  
Worst case scenario you lose your job in a couple of years and need to sell some of your BTC to clear the loan.

left is the number and prices of buy orders eg 500 BTC wanted to buy between 5K and 10K AUD each, right is the sell orders 200 BTC for sale between 10K and 15K AUD each. These orders may be sell 0.01 @ $10001 and sell 54 @ 12000. 
the order book shows more detail, this gives an overview of the current market. BUT a lot could be faked. eg on btcmarkets.net (this pic) there is a large order to buy   and a large order to sell  These "walls" tend to move as the actual price gets close, so they arent real orders.

blockchain.info lets you put the BTC address into a search bar and shows how much BTC is in that address eg:    (an empty one I just created)
You need to find the wallet that contains the address that matches the one the site sent to. Then you could use core to get the key for that address. 
If your backup wallet does not contain that address (which it should if thats where you got the address from) your SOL. sorry, they are zombie coins now and gone forever.

I wanted to edit my other comment, but I feel an edit will be overlooked.
The real reason to separate euro/dollar and eEuro/eDollar is to move the entire economy to a secondary currency that has no physical version. This will prevent the ability to withdraw all your eEuro when banks start applying negative interest rates on depositors accounts.
Currently when the banks go "we give you -.1% interest" you can go "fuck that Ill withdraw my cash and put it under my mattress" once its all eUSD, you cant do that. You can only buy bitcoin and BYOB.

with Bitcoin you could sign a message from your cold wallet that irrefutably shows you have enough reserve when tallied against your current "balance" eg: This is the Coinbase cold wallet 1st Feb 2019. and the balance is 12345 BTC. I can then verify it on any block explorer. Then they release a balance sheet showing amount of BTC in each users wallet (psuedonymous addresses, not names). If they dont match, we all know something is not right.

BTC is not a scam, it is a currency that saw another exponential price rise and you exchanged USD for some when it was very expensive.

what is it that BTC is missing?
UX is  - 
Install the wallet (just like a bank app)
write down your recovery seed (I admit the banks dont give you this option because they control your money and dont want you to install a different banks app) so +1 for Bitcoin as its interchangeable
Generate a receive address (your bank account for each tx)
Give receive address to payees. (same for BTC and banks)
Receive money when confirmed. (BTC over banks on this one)
Send money (BTC over banks on this one too)
What is so confusing with the BTC UX that isnt the same in various bank transfers? The banks have done well reducing transfer times to "instant" but its still censorable and relying on a third party.

if miners leave BTC for another coin, others will take their place as long as profitability is high. 12.5 BTC per block is currently around 100K usd. every 10 minutes if they mine it. 
thats a big carrot. Satoshi mentioned that it would be more beneficial for miners to work with the system than attack it, and thats what we are seeing time and time again.

if you want to trade, Its easiest to keep them on the exchange as you dont have deposit delays. if you want to keep some in your possession there are lots to choose from. 
I dont know about Coinbase "switching to" bitcoin cash.

didnt really "cost" you $3k though. You still got the 12k the cheque was worth. You missed out on a dip, like everyone else that didnt have funds in an exchange that day. 
The time taken to clear a cheque is bullshit though, we all know they dont literally post it to the other bank to have it confirmed anymore. Its now a scam so the banks can use your money for short term trading while its "being cleared"

admittedly I dont understand futures, isnt he saying that it is too volatile and may threaten the entire exchange. eg: "if you have to keep paying the crypto bets because it keeps rising, you cant pay my bet on toilet paper. separate them and I can continue to bet on the price of toilet paper without fear your entire exchange will crumble"

Obviously you didnt notice the "airbnb" emails were coming from long-term-offer.com (domain was registered 3 months ago with namecheap)
Why would he be emailing you an airbnb offer? why isnt it already listed there? why didnt you go to airbnb.com direct and search for the listing?
In his email he has mentioned he prefers Bitcoin as "they have a more thorough verification process" - There is no "they" in bitcoin, bitcoin doesnt verify if youre using stolen funds.
Anytime someone pushes you to use BTC for purchase over other methods especially if they advise you to use an ATM to get it, treat them skeptically because your payment is irreversible. Take your time and look at everything closely. Legit sellers would be offering BTC as an OPTION, not pushing you to use it.
This is all hindsight, and you realise you fucked up. SFYL hopefully you learn from it.
There is nothing you can do short of getting Lawyers and Law enforcement involved. If it brings you any solace, youre not the only one they have scammed and your payment is still there.

As Marcion said.
Start with a desktop or mobile wallet, then realise why you might want a hardware wallet.
That first learning curve is steep but it helps a lot. the hardware wallet you might need depends on a few things.
Any altcoins you want to have (some dont support certain alts) 
is open source software important to you?
is an online interface important to you?
will you pair it with a full node or desktop wallet or neither?
Do you wish for coin control when you spend?
Do you wish for native segwit (Bech32) adresses?
if you answered all of these with a "huh?" then you should start with a desktop wallet like electrum  and keep reading while you stack sats and learn.

Its the US government and its allies trying to figure out a way to stop p2p currency **with no middle man**. With no centralised entity to attack, its got to be aimed at the centralised companies that help the serfs opt out of fiat.

but arent BCH fees only low compared to BTC because there is less transactions in the block. The upper limit has no relevance if the block hasnt exceeded 1.2MB anyway. 
the latest BCH block was 83KB but the avg transaction fee was 38c. an 83KB BTC block from november 2012, the avg fee was 3c. I dont think the argument for big blocks (that it keeps fees low) stands up to scrutiny. transaction confirmation time and throughput is a different matter that we havent seen tested on the BCH fork yet.

you would be paying the bank to hold your deposits, your balance will shrink the longer it stays in the bank. "why would I do that if I can just withdraw it all in cash and hold it myself" Because they will set dual currency economies, one for cash, one for e-money. cash is valued at e-money -1% (or whatever the neg interest rate is)
So you can buy a donut for $1 e-money or $1.10 cash. "so I would use the e-money because its cheaper" No. You already lost that 10c, the bank took it.

Up until then they wont allow their users to trade Bitcoin Cash on their service. Coinbase WAS going to name the most accumulated difficulty chain Bitcoin after the segwit 2x fork. SW2x didnt happen.
I wouldnt think they would "switch" to cash and not trade bitcoin as these are two separate coins now, both recognised by a lot of other exchanges. Most likely they will allow trading of bitcoin cash alongside bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin.

why use market cap when you can just use spot price to show overall value of 1 BTC, which is what you described.
People incorrectly assume marketcap means that there has been $100 Billion USD used to purchase bitcoin (or 0.4 trillion USD I think it reached at its peak). There hasnt. Millions were mined for the USD equivalent of electricity costs running a PC.
MC is pointless except for those from a trading background that use it to the same way they do for stocks. The value of BTC at any point in time is the spot market price.

It doesnt matter how many BTC you own. In the event of a contentious hard fork (like Bitcoin Cash) the users decide for themselves which chain they choose to use by running that version of the software. If they hold 0.001 or 1000 BTC is irrelevant.

Hello people. I have owned BTC for a while however I have placed my hardware wallet in my butt because i was told that was the hardcore thing to do on 4chan. 
I agree BTC may be the currency of the future and I have bought a lot of it, but I might have spent more than I am willing to lose. I hope the USD value goes higher, and I think all the weak hands should just sell.
I really hope I have made the right decision, I feel like I am part of the group that might move this currency forward.

dont believe that. Its true that "money makes money" so the more you have to play with the more you make. eg 100k in January is 1M now. BUT, anything higher than the interest rate on your savings account is a better choice (riskier, but higher returns). Assuming its 2% a year, BTC went up 62% in a month. so your 25 euro invested 30 days ago is now 40. 25 euro invested in December 2016 with your bank is 30 euro. even if BTC only went up 5% over the next year its still better than your savings account.
Rule 1: Never put in more than you are willing to lose. Rule 2: Not your keys, not your bitcoin.

It specifically means dont panic sell to day traders. As you said, spend and replace is key to making this an accepted alternative economy. We need merchants to want BTC and users to want to spend them.

Its fascinating to me as a late person to read about historical BTC drama. The "Tulip Trust" (google it) was a trust set up by CSW and Dave Kleinman claiming ownership over 1 million BTC BUT no single trustee could move them before Jan 2020. (essentially a timelock in legalese)
although CSW could spend them for various purposes? (I would think proving he had ownership would fall inside these clauses)

if the US government repeals net neutrality laws it means the ISP (providers of your internet) can and will choose what you can access. Do you run a node? They can block all traffic on port 8333 (so you move to an ISP who doesnt) Can they stop you sending or receiving BTC peer to peer? Not really. They could shut down the nodes that THEIR users run, they cant shut down the rest of the world. The network is safe because it is decentralised across many countries and thousands of users with different ISPs.
edit: the one viable concern is if your country makes it illegal to hold cryptocurrency because it means you must be a terrorist. Then your fucked and the price will crash hard.

@_date: 2019-04-29 11:09:16
lets look at a block.
No 1 with most outputs at 98 uses 4 inputs (2 are native segwit, 2 are legacy) At a glance half the outputs are nested segwit, half are legacy. (the receivers choice)
One of those is a legacy address with 100BTC so, Ill guess they didnt want to move it if not needed, when needed its combined with the addresses theyre making now (the native segwit ones) but its still not a segwit tx (I may be mistaken about this, please correct me if I am)

NP. I like this wallet, but I have a problem with the fact it isnt open source. 
remember to set the the change address as well. You can just hit any field and it becomes "settable" as u/dalebewan said, the change going back to sending address is a problem, you should choose a new one manually. It actually makes you feel more in control of your txs setting all the intricacies. Hopefully they will recognise native segwit soon.
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:54:12
no, it did.heres a 1 sat/byte fee in the last block.

@_date: 2019-04-13 02:39:48
All your wallet addresses are legacy addresses. The tx was sent to a nested segwit address. How did you obtain the other addresses shown in the wallet? Was it different to how you obtained the missing one?

Unless you have access to electricity below 10c /Kwh it is not profitable *at the current BTC/USD exchange rate.
Math doesnt care what your agenda is.
edit: s17 pro is 53TH/s (sold out BTW)  makes you $11 a day 
at 10c/Kwh and one s17 uses  2kw/h = $4.80 per day in electricity costs. It costs you $2500 to buy one. So the other $6 per day is ROI. It takes you 2500/6 = 416 days (over a year to ROI on the equipment) and actually start making $6 a day.
NB (This is really important) it assumes the difficulty doesnt go up, or the price of BTC doesnt drop.
So, can it be profitable, yeah sure, if you have electricity under 10c/Kwh and you think the BTC/USD exchange will go up in the next year and you have $3K to outlay now.Better hope theres not too many other people doing this though, or the difficulty rises and your margins shrink.

Dont apologise, I like discussion.
The original idea was a p2p virtual currency that does not require permission from any third party to use. It still works just as well for that today as it did in 2010 when it was spent on a pizza.
Anyone pushing (or buying) bitcoin as a "simple way to get a lambo" is missing the point completely. We cant control what others think and do.
regarding "real value" I think the word youre looking for is "intrinsic" and its a common misconception about money. None of it has any intrinsic value, the value is whatever the users ascribe to it. The difference with BTC and why it stands alone as the hardest money is that the amount in circulation and the inflation rate are set in the code. It cannot be increased on a whim by anyone.
Either way, its all good. BTC now exists as an optional digital currency, you dont have to use it if you dont want to.

"Burn your bitcoin to get my coin" Looks like alts are realising their own blockchain wont work because it can be attacked so easily. Dont know if many users want to burn bitcoin to get stacks. And I hope these "burn addresses are known to be unaccessible.

but you can charge interest if you choose to (which I think is shit but thats beside the point). Why is the need for interest opposite to a finite supply? I can lend you 1 btc at 10% you have to earn 1.1 btc to pay me back in full. 
where does the extra .1 come from? from you earning it by providing goods and/or services to someone else that has btc. 
What I cant do is have 0.1 btc and loan you 1 btc to buy a house (with 1.1 to be repaid) This makes far more sense than a bank lending 450k it doesnt have to someone and using that "equity" (which it never had in the first place an still doesnt) to then create a line of credit for someone else.

its a normal calculator (you have one in iOS). You just need the current price.
eg price is 833000 JPY and you have 750 JPY to spend
750 divided by 833000  = 0.00090036 BTC
to find how much JPY needed to buy a set amount of BTC
833000 times 0.02 BTC = 16660 JPY
To find the price needed to get how much BTC you want (say 0.25btc) for how much JPY you have (say 150000) :

Watching the price daily is only good for those that want to trade. If you want to take profit and have a ball park figure, then once every couple of months is going to catch that. If your profit taking figure is high enough, you will hear about it from other sources anyway.

the term "Dont try to catch a falling knife" only applies to large lump sum purchases of something that is going down in price. "I have $5000, i think this is the bottom, Im buying $5000 worth right now" then it drops further. You tried to "catch" it and it cut you.
DCA is a way of spreading the purchase and minimising the risk of volatile markets by buying the same (smaller) amount on a regular basis regardless of the price. When it drops you are just lowering your average cost per unit. 
I see where youre coming from though "Buy the dip" is a falling knife strategy. You would want to see a confirmed reversal first, but im not a trader so I just DCA.

re the BTC you earned "If you receive cryptocurrency for goods or services you provide as part of your business, you need to include the value of the cryptocurrency in Australian dollars as part of your ordinary income. This is the same process as receiving any other non-cash consideration under a barter transaction." - from ATO website.
re the BTC you bought, the defining point is why you bought it. If it is spent straight away then "personal use asset" and not reportable. If it is held for some time and appreciated/depreciated in AUD value it is considered CGT relevant and needs to be calculated (spent or sold for AUD)
Record keeping is just a "best attempt" the ATO is well aware of the murky situation and will give leniency if it looks like you tried eg: spreadsheet of ins and outs, dates, what you deemed them as and why with calculations for CGT.
It a relatively simple but time consuming process so youve got some bookkeeping to do before providing info to your accountant, if you provide a spreadsheet with transactions, reasoning and AUD vaues, then it shouldnt cost you too much more than a normal sole trader return.

ICO "investors" were buying Auscoins, the ability to possibly sell said Auscoins later for profit, and membership to the HODL Club that gives a slight discount on the outrageous mark up at these BTMs.

because they want to help a fellow human? Because they believe in the idea/product that person wants to make happen? I dont know, why do I lend my friend $50 when he needs it to buy some beers at the pub? Because I have the money and he can/will pay me back later. Loans do not require interest to be applied, that is a construct of people that want to make money by having money.
edit: you need a car so you can get a job right? you ask me to borrow some btc to buy a car. I think you having a job is a benefit to everyone (because you can now provide a service) so I give you a loan to buy the car and you pay me back in the btc you earned. You can include interest if I want you to, but that means you have to earn 10% more than what I loaned before it is repaid. The finite supply does not stop interest on loans, it stops fractional reserve lending. I cant loan you more than I have.

So you need half a million i7's to equal one s9.

Buy from an exchange using your verified account and charge them slightly less than ATM prices. eg: you buy .1 for $1000, but they buy .09 from you for $1000.

@_date: 2018-11-30 06:42:42
Your right, that is the most confusing fee structure I have ever read.
Coinbase (not Pro) will charge +0.5% over market rate and **the greater of** a sliding flat fee using $ amount categories OR a sliding variable fee depending on how you funded your wallet.
eg: $100 deposited to buy with ACH to buy when market says $5000. so youre actually buying at price of $5025. The flat fee for $100 buy is $2.99, the sliding fee for ACH is FREE, so you pay $2.99 in fees. 
This means your $100 is now $97.01 to buy at $5025 which means for $100 you would receive 0.01930547 BTC. Seems you cannot know the withdrawal fee (in BTC) until you withdraw as it is based on network congestion?
This all looks shady as fuck and designed to fleece people that dont want to crunch the numbers. 
Use Coinbase Pro (if you HAVE to use coinbase) and use maker orders where you place an order under the lowest sell order on the books and wait for someone to sell to you (or vice versa). This is a maker order and has no fee. Deposit and withdraw USD via ACH and there is no fee, withdraw BTC is fee free.
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:47:31
is that an exchange with a dynamic withdrawal fee?
Sick of the flat rate of 0.001 or 0.0005 btc per withdrawal. At 10k thats $10 and $5

Doesnt matter if its legal. Coinbase are a bank, they will decide what you can and cant spend your money on, like all other banks. They also dont allow you to send to legal marijuana dispensaries along with a whole list of other prohibited businesses.
If you must use Coinbase (which you dont really, you just think you do) Withdraw to your own wallet FIRST. Then you control your keys and you decide what you can spend it on, they cant stop you sending BTC to fucking ISIS if you wanted to do such a stupid thing.

If I send to you from my wallet its "instantly" in the mempool and shows on your wallet as unconfirmed. If I send from an exchange, they can delay making the actual transaction until it suits them.
Exchanges that batch transactions will wait some time, it will show on your account as processing. Then completed with a txid that may not even be confirmed yet.

ease of use and quickest, find a bitcoin ATM near you.
cheapest rates, sign up to an exchange.
truly P2P, find a bitcoin meetup near you and ask someone to sell you some bitcoin for cash. 
 
edit: depending on the seller there is really no minimum. You can own 0.00000001 BTC. Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places, 10 (I think) if you use Lightning Network.

Open the Windows command prompt (Win+R, enter cmd, hit Enter), navigate to the bitcoin directory (for me, it's on drive D:, check in Windows Explorer) and create the new directory bitcoin_mainnet. Then calculate the checksum of the already downloaded program.

If youre selling BTC that you just bought in your name from an exchange, youre probably a mule.
Why cant the buyer use an exchange themselves? why are they paying a premium to avoid more rigorous KYC/AML and reporting of major exchanges. If I am laundering money, am I cool with that? 
These are questions you need to ask yourself.


I dont know, Im not a lawyer. The law I linked says you need to use due diligence. Chapter 2 article 3 spells out what that means.
IF you choose to do this. Money first. Dont send BTC until a wire transfer is cleared in your account. Make sure you call your bank and discuss that they are positive there is no way it can be reversed.
Tread carefully man, good luck.

Did you own all those inputs? Were the BTC spread across different addresses on your Trezor? If so, someone got your seed (or pin and access to Trezor) if they didnt know your PIN but had access, they had 16 attempts to guess it before it wiped itself. was your PIN truly random?

as much as I love Lightning and think it is the future of BTC as a payment method, you havent done your research. It is none of the things you mentioned.
 Instant (if you want the tx on the base layer, you have to close the channel and wait for the next block)
free (it still costs, might be less than a sat, but there is still a fee)
anonymous (your IP is leaked with every transaction. the receiver doesnt know where it came from but txs are not anonymous)

@_date: 2019-01-04 06:39:52
Please correct me if Im wrong. Older software sees 1MB and valid blocks because the blocks are still "seen as" 1MB, its just using segwit, you have some of the data stripped out for older versions, (discounted WU) yet block explorers are showing blocks over 1MB because they are counting all the data, not including the discount?
Ive read a lot and Im still very confused on how nodes with a 1MB hard limit are validating segwit filled blocks. I should read some more.

its a sign of low liquidity, not manipulation
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:32:32
How would it do that? OTC trades dont affect the market price (directly) but there isnt an infinite pool of liquidity available to these trades. It could dry up the exchange liquidity as its all sold OTC which will drive up the market price, then OTC traders will sell through exchanges due to the price disparity and it will return to equilibrium.
Bitcoin itself will not be affected at all.
Let them play their "big boy" games.

I already respect your opinion diydude (assuming diydude2 is the same user), can you point me to any evidence of this? a 1000BTC sale on market that didnt affect the price? maybe im only watching less liquid exchanges that arent really moving more than 100 BTC in a 24 hour period.

no one is forcing you to use BTC, if you dont like it, you have many others to choose from. 
You did not share the fee that coinbase paid on your tx. At the time you posted this the mempool was exploding and you needed 10 sat/b for guaranteed next block. Im guessing they paid less than that. 
If you controlled the tx and wanted it in the next block, you would have set the fee appropriately. Or you would have to wait.

works fine when someone issues an invoice in BTC and I pay it. when merchant and buyer are thinking in BTC and agree over the price, its brilliant. Its only people thinking in fiat that fuck the transaction up.

It was mentioned that some of the conf transaction techniques create incredibly boated tx size compared to BTC. Which is fine for coin used by less people but would be devastating to the Bitcoin Blockchain.

It might happen eventually, but its not an easy task.

fair call. they really should mention this isnt safe for significant amounts of BTC. also, that you need to back up your keys through a lot of "settings options"

every early coinbase went to a new address, as they should. new transaction new address is the preferred method.
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:37:26
no, they sell amounts periodically when it benefits them (eg at highs like december 2017) they wouldnt be selling now if they sold then. they would have cashflow for the next 12 months because they sold in late 2017.

because ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) for SHA256 were invented. They made CPU and GPU mining finding a block so unlikely that now it would be considered a waste of CPU cycles trying.

good find.
Im still new to all this so eager to learn more. They are talking about using the dumpprivkey command to expose the private keys of a wallet when the blockchain hasnt been downloaded. apparently (according to Meni Rosenfeld) you can.
If you know the address the bitcoin are in, give it a go. (this would only work of you have replaced the new wallet created on install for the backup with btc in it)
Open the debug window console
Enter walletpassphrase &lt;my passphrase&gt; 600
Enter dumpprivkey &lt;my address with all the bitcoins&gt;
edit: and to get your addresses use:
getaccountaddress ""
getaddressesbyaccount ""

yes.  12.5BTC / block until next halving regardless of the price, difficulty or number of miners. 
When price is low and difficulty is too high, miners might switch off and there may be less BTC produced per day as blocks are found greater than 10 minutes apart on average. After 2016 blocks, difficulty adjusts down to ensure 10 minute blocks on average over next 2016 blocks.

looks like u/AbsolutPower81 is the only one that gets it. The vertical lines that have become part of whats known as the Bart Pattern are caused by low liquidity. 
Exchanges arent really trading as much as they show are. This is caused by wash trading (people selling to themselves) and HFT Bots that have Buy/Sell orders up, but the orders move split seconds before they are filled.
When someone places an authentic large order at market value on an exchange the price changes a lot instantly as there isnt enough BTC (or buyers) to fill it at current market price. Arbitrage bots then near instantly level the price across other exchanges.

kashmirbtc has the answer. December was a huge spike in transactions to and from exchanges (coincided with price)
All 3 graphs follow a similar pattern. High transaction count = high mempool size = high transaction fee to be in the next block. Lightning and segwit will improve this over time, more offchain transactions, smaller onchain transactions (in size not amount) = lower mempool size = lower fees for all.
That said, there are 4 transactions right now paying 1000+ sats/byte fee. People are still overpaying.
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:17:44
but your "some or all" could also be none.
I know there is no guarantees, but I think the majority of recently added hashpower (bought when BTC was &gt;10K) isnt selling rewards now. 
We have no idea what the business plan is for miners but its not likely they are all selling their daily rewards just to cover daily costs. The notion of $12 million daily added into the market implies they are all selling everything they earn. There would be a lot of miners that arent selling anything because they already made enough profit to operate for the next year or two.
@_date: 2018-11-27 04:15:37

depends which wallet you use.
The standard for HD wallets like greenaddress and samourai is to create a 24 word "passphrase" or "seed" when you create the wallet as well as a PIN so if you lose the phone the wallet cant be opened by others as they dont know the PIN. 
If the phone breaks, is lost or stolen, you install the app on a new phone and restore the wallet using your 24 word seed. All addresses and balances are now on your new phone. For extra safety, create a new wallet (with new seed) and move everything to that one.
Its far more important to safely secure your seed than your phone.

np. Im sure theres an easier way to write the relationship. 
x = y * z
(when x = amount of JPY, y = price of BTC in JPY, z = amount of BTC)
remember that using transposition
(x = y*z) is the same as (y = x/z) and (z = x/y)

A friend who regularly buys machinery worth 100k+ is heavily involved in purchases with foreign currencies for over that amount, he was telling me it takes a minimum of 100 days to get his purchases cleared and transferred. He also claimed it will take the same amount of time for me to sell my bitcoin, and im an idiot for buying magical money off of geeks.

r/BTC are dead eyed supporters of bitcoin cash and think bitcoin has been overthrown by blockstream/Core devs and their supporters. They also have a bone to pick with censorship on this sub.
I really see no point to BCC, the speed and fee for transactions is matched or bettered by LiteCoin. The only thing making BTC more expensive to transact with is the FIAT price of each coin. (sat/b fees are lower than BCC at the moment.)

Not that I know of. I dont understand why you would want to preorder  bitcoin. If you want some, just buy it. A bitcoin mined in the future is the same as one on the current market. (fiat price will be different, but 1 btc = 1 btc)

lets do the math for the worlds money, we'll use billion as the base.
Silver 17
Crypto 500 = 517
Companies 900 = 1.4 trillion
Rich MFers  2  = 3.4 trillion
California GDP 3 = 6.4 trillion
Fed 5 = 11.4 trillion
FIAT 8 = 19.4 Trillion
Gold 8 = 27.4 Trillion
stocks 73 = 100.4 Trillion
Debt 215000 = 215.1 Trillion
Real Estate 217000 = 432.1 trillion
Derivatives 544000 = 976.1 trillion
And thats the low end?
so if bitcoin takes over full global money markets (which it never will) 1 quadrillion/21million = 41.6K per bitcoin.
Someone please correct me if the math is wrong.

but you are not buying shares in the company and you get no dividends from their profit. You most definitely do not get an ATM and split the profits. You are buying a token that an ATM company is releasing and hoping either it goes up in value or you can use it to purchase things. BTC cant be used to purchase things at most stores, what hope does AUScoin have of being accepted anywhere except sams souvlaki shop. They arent shares as specifically mentioned in the whitepaper. 
"AUSCOIN and other products set out in this Whitepaper do not constitute securities, managed investment schemes or financial products."

okay. He was sending between exchanges, they set the fee. There is no way 8 hours was waiting for the next block. merchant support is irrelevant as he was sending between exchanges. 
I agree with your low fee however as 1 sat in BCH is worth so much less USD than 1 sat in BTC. Its easy to keep fees low when the coin is worth 100x less USD and txs are fast because the blocks are empty. Even if you kept 1MB limit, they arent reaching it.

It is only the "from" address that matters, so true, this is not a segwit tx. But, Segwit reduces the size of the transaction, not the fee chosen. So even if it was a segwit tx, they still chose (or had chosen for them) 5,235.602 sat/B.
That number is real specific and multiplies so exactly, im guessing they set the fee at 0.01 BTC regardless of the size of the tx. Seems like something a shitty exchange/service might do. 
"Customer is charged 0.01 BTC to withdraw, so put that as the fee"
edit: which goes back to: The sender wasnt paying the fee, the receiver was, so who cares if it could be cheaper. Bad business practice though. Sender could have retained .009 BTC as part of the fee charged.

Make sure you get someone who is an electrician to check your circuits and upgrade if necessary. Those things run at over 1300 Watts and P = I*V so 1300 = I*240v (in Aust) so I = 1300/240 = 5.4 amps. Each. 
In Australia standard household circuit breakers are 10 amps, so you shouldnt be running more than 2 per circuit (and only those two miners, no other appliances.)

I think you mean "Bull trap" A Bear Trap traps the bears. The bears think it will go down (bears attack by swiping paws down) So a bear trap is a dip prompting bears to sell or short BTC followed by a further rise. A bull trap is a small rise (bulls attack by throwing horns up) prompting bulls to buy or long BTC followed a further downward trend.

best believe they are coming for our data, KYC/AML, purchases and sales reported straight to the ATO like interest on your bank accounts and cgt on real estate. AUSTRAC and the fed cyber crime division are working hard to put names to wallet addressess (which as we know are all public) under the guise of "terrorism and criminal money laundering"
good side of that though is that your accountant will be able to access that info without you figuring it out. eg: Jo Bogan made $xxx gains in 2019 so software will prefill items G, M A, H, V and X of the CGT worksheet.

the volatility just needs a good piece of code to answer it though. eg, prices in btc are tied to the fiat exchange rate. buying via the internet lets the price fluctuate as much as it needs to on a second by second basis and its all connected. im pretty sure coders can fix this problem when were all buying things in the digital sphere

Average Fee was 192 sats. It comes down to the USD value of the coin.
 192 sats in BTC = 5500/100000000 * 192 = 1.056 cents
192 sats in BCH = 394/100000000 * 192 = 0.075648 cents
You can send BTC using segwit for approx 160 sats. If BCH had the same USD value as BTC the fees would be higher. The cheaper tx argument is solely based on the USD value of the coin. Of course a coin with less USD value will cost less USD to use. It costs more bitcoin cash to transact with though.

Like all good modern trends, “When Lambo” started as an ironic meme. For those in the know, it meant: “Do you have enough bitcoins to buy a Lamborghini yet?”
That’s how much money is swilling about in the cryptocurrency gold rush. Bitcoin made the early running, but it’s gone way past that now — in January, the total cryptocurrency market was valued at £600bn. There are more than 1,500 currencies out there, all underpinned by a transaction technology called Blockchain, which eliminates the need for a central bank.
The hoarders of this leprechaun gold are almost all men, usually between 25 and 40. There’s a fair chance the whole thing will collapse in a heap at any moment, but in the meantime lots of people who aren’t me have got disgustingly rich, while simultaneously claiming that they are building a brilliant new future for mankind.
Yet beneath the world-saving veneer, this new breed of financiers seem to behave a lot like their predecessors. A slew of stories has illustrated what this clubby, self-congratulatory world actually looks like.
The When Lambo thing started as a joke — a new generation of traders mocking the tacky predilections of the last. But irony, of course, is just a protective cloak for something you actually want to say or do. So now there are bitcoin-bought Lamborghinis everywhere in crypto world. At the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami last month, the car parks were full of them. Lambos for lolz, went the joke.
After listening to each other extol the virtues of hash rates and hard forks, the gang decamped to E11even, a giant strip club nearby that is said to have a “permissive attitude” towards touching.
“We’re a bunch of dudes with a lot of money in our twenties,” Jeff Scott, an attendee, told Bloomberg. “We like naked girls.”
These “dudes” are everywhere now: bitcoin bros and Blockchain bores smugly patting themselves on the back for having seemingly conjured a fortune out of thin air. Pretty much every party I’ve been to in the past six months has involved a long period of nodding mutely, while some dreary chump in a fedora tells me how much money he’s made from arbitraging ethereum.
Crypto is a 21st-century tulip fever, so it is attracting all the people you might expect it to: desperadoes, crooks, chancers and zealots. Men such as the dreaded Winkelvoss twins, who lost out on Facebook, but now claim to be bitcoin billionaires. Or John McAfee, the software pioneer and all-round whack job, who said last summer that the price of bitcoin would rise above $500,000 within three years or he would “eat my dick on national television”. (The price is currently around the $8,000 mark.)
These cloud-dwelling bros don’t really make or even do anything much, so they’ll jump at any excuse for a rager. When the second annual Blockchain Cruise launched from Singapore last month, the bottomless drinks came in handy, as the price of bitcoin had dropped 25% by the time they got to Thailand two days later, costing the passengers millions.
In truth, though, I don’t begrudge these guys their sunshine and sangrias. I don’t even begrudge them their unearned wealth. What I really object to is the relentless virtue signalling. We went through this with social media. Facebook and Snapchat and Twitter and their hoodie-wearing founder wizards were going to lead us to the promised land. They’ve done some good things, but mostly we’re more distracted and distrustful and disconnected than we ever were before.
Blockchain will also have some very real benefits, but spare us the utopian elevator pitch. Just take a look at the way its proponents conduct themselves — this is not the road to salvation.

spreadsheet that shit.
you buy 0.005 @ 9000 = $45
you buy 0.01 @ 8000 = $80
you buy 0.02 @ 8500 = $170
total BTC = 0.035  Total spend = 170 + 80 + 45 = $295
BTC is now 10K so 0.035 = $350
You have profited 350 - 295 = $55 (if you sell it all at $10K)
watch out for fees. Check your countries tax laws re buying selling trading.

the idea of "sweep or import" was quite confusing to me at first.
Sweep - you move the BTC from the paper wallet to your software wallet by sending it to a new address that was generated by your software wallet. Cons: This will cost a miners fee.
Import - Your software wallet will now use the private key and address as if it was its own. Pros: no fee. Cons: see below.
Importing Private Keys means those funds WILL NOT be available should your software fail and you need to restore the wallet from the seed. They are only there while your current wallet is working, and should be spent ASAP with the change going to a new address generated by your software wallet.

Received is the total of the 2 txs in to the address,
Spent is the 1 big tx out
Confirmed balance is the difference. (whats left in the address)
Unconfirmed Balance is 0 as all txs have been confirmed by the blockchain (they have been included in a block)
edit: this is irrefutable proof they received the full amount, you cant control what they did after that or why they did not transfer the small amount out as well. They would most definitely have seen the full (both tx) amount on their end as the inputs were included in the same block

your looking at blockchain, not my preferred explorer by w/e.
1, last tx was today so YES, someone still has control of the private key to this address. Without the private key, nothing can move the btc associated with the address.
2, Final Balance 	0.00181612 BTC 	That is the amount currently associated with that address. 
3, Batching. They COULD all be owned by the same individual/group/entity but it looks more like an address that moves BTC from cold storage to hot wallet then disseminates to multiple people in 1 tx. Common for exchanges and mining pools.

for non-custodial wallets (not your keys, not your coin) customer service isnt a thing. 
TX's and reliability is pretty vague.
If you have more than 0.1 or want long term storage (with occasional spending) you should probably get a hardware wallet. Trezor and Ledger are both very reliable and come highly recommended.
for less than 0.1 (which is basically spending money) use a mobile wallet. Depends on your OS for the best recommended. 
Electrum or Blockstream Green are great choices.
You want to have Custom fee selection and native segwit (bech32) support.

My understanding is they access the public keys stored on your device (not private) and display balances by querying a blockchain explorer. Its standard practice.
Have a read of the user manual and FAQ to help understand how it works and why it is recommended so highly. The device is the only thing that ever has access to your private keys, even when spending, it accesses the private key, signs the transaction and pushes only the signed tx to the PC its connected to.

no. Trezor (and ledger) dont hold your keys or your seed. They are generated by the device when you first set it up. Only buy from the official websites. Start with a small amount and use it to receive/send, reset the device etc so you are comfortable before putting large amounts on there for cold storage.

Assuming you went for the S9i from bitmain at $654USD
Approx 10 for them $8k (inc shipping)  = 140 TH/s and 13200w
You would earn about .007 btc per day = 143 days. you would be paying approx $4700 in electricity for one bitcoin. This is not including rent, power upgrades, cooling, soundproofing, difficulty increase over next 5 months, etc. 
So it is cheaper than buying it assuming your electricity is less than 10c/kwh and you have good connections with an electrician, space to stack them and ways to cool them. You cant know what the future brings as far as difficulty increases go but it will probably go up.
Hell of a lot easier to buy btc with that $8k but whats the fun in that.

Youre not trying hard enough. BTC IS Money so you can spend it or save it. You can spend it P2P for goods and services over the internet. You can spend it P2P with IRL friends for that round they bought you at the pub last night.
You can spend it anywhere someone accepts it as payment.

btcmarkets.net is very reputable and fees arent too bad (0.85%). You will need to provide them ID and verify etc. I use them weekly, never had an issue.
Dont leave coins on an exchange. DCA in and withdraw to your own wallet when you have enough to justify the 0.0001 withdraw fee. 
If you want to stay truly anonymous use an ATM or join a BTC meetup and try to buy direct from a new friend.

Some miners may stop mining as it is not deemed economical to mine for fees alone. Some will start mining as the difficulty drops because the fees are worth it to them. If the difficulty drops low enough, everyone that wants to use BTC could fire up mining software for their CPUs again.

People are told dont keep it on the exchange, and if all the exchanges batched and sent from segwit addresses, the mempool would be smaller = less fees for all.

wallets are free to download with no real money making method except for donations. This means the people that make them arent doing so as a business. its the F2P v P2P model all tech struggles with.
It will take personal adoption by graphic designers and app developers to go: "Shit, im really interested in this and I want an awesome easy UX for myself.

The idea that fees will eventually replace block rewards is true. Without fees anyone can flood the network with spam transactions for free. Segwit actually reduced the fee size required per transaction (from average 225 to 168 if using 1 sat/vbyte) by reducing the v size of the tx.
The mania of December is over, tx with fees of &lt; 2 cents are regularly being mined. If you are paying more than 1 or 2 sats/vbyte you are paying too much.

If you have more than the cost of a hardware wallet in BTC, general consensus is you should buy one.
@_date: 2019-09-25 21:15:51
sort of, but not exactly. The bet isnt with CME, its a contract with another user. CME is cash settled, so the other user (the long) doesnt actually buy the BTC at 9K, they pay the difference between the spot price and the contract price in USD.
If the contract was set 3 months ago for 20BTC at 10K the short just walked away with 200K + the proceeds of selling their own BTC down to 8K.
Short turns long, enters a contract for 20BTC at 10K and starts buying on the open market to increase the price to 12K by the expiry date. Walks away with another 200K and the BTC they have bought to increase the price.
Rinse and repeat.
This is a really basic explanation and it doesnt quite work like that in the real world.

"fill the gap" means it was crashed to hit a final price close to the CME closing price of their contract. eg: 6 month short on CME closing at 8500? Shit, better fill the gap so I dont have to pay for 100 BTC at $10K.
Its whales playing games where they can move the market with the BTC they already own to collect much more USD on their shorts/longs. Sell it down in real BTC or buy it up to equal the closing price of the USD gamble you made when you opened the contract.
The actual BTC market is so illiquid it doesnt take much BTC/USD to move it down/up. especially when you add panic sellers and fomo buyers.

lightning network is a 2nd layer off chain network for bitcoin transactions. You establish a node and fund it with btc, then you make payments through other nodes to your intended recipient. Fees are substantially smaller than on chain btc transactions, the transferred amounts are recorded on the blockchain when the channel is closed.
It is the future of small payments with btc. It is still beta though and will only improve from here.
edit: people want to take it down because it makes BCH redundant. BCH increased block size for on chain small payments with minimal fees. BTC went to 2nd layer.

If you read the article, they did VERY well after realising what happened. The incident was caused by API users.
"Binance halted all trading and withdrawals and also removed all API keys until the situation could be resolved." "This irregularity prompted Binance to offer a 70% rebate on the trading fees received between July 5th and July 14th to all Binance users"
The fact they called the new cold wallet system "safu" as a nod to the bizonacci meme is awesome.

Why do you want into alts?
If you want them priced in USD, then you want to sell them for USD in the future. You might be feeling that as the initial USD price is low, theres more upside than BTC because you can buy more of them. Thats not exactly true.
You should look for percentage gains. 
There are some fast pumps in alts far beyond BTC but they dump just as quick. 
Good luck man, chasing alts is a straight up grind that more often than not loses you money. If you want to fuck with alts, look for the few good projects that might still be used 5+ years from now.

If its a concern to you, then you probably shouldnt use Bitcoin.
Its an opt in system, no one is forcing you. No one cares if you dont want to use it.
edit: I will just add this bit of subtitles from the first link. 
"Bitcoin has achieved a level of computing that no single nation state can overthrow through computation alone. 
The effort to do so would require a massive covert operation of chip fabrication. Then the coordinated assault that would give them dominance over the next block for 10 minutes, until we kick those bastards off the network, rework the protocol around them. 
They would be revealed they would have lost a billion dollars doing this and all they got to do was one double spend."
That is a legit argument against china buying up chip manufacturers and trying to destroy BTC with a 51% attack..

You can use bitcoin core as your wallet or point your mobile wallet to use your own node. If nothing else, installing and running your own full node helps you learn and makes you want to learn more. Try installing it on both and see which you prefer
It is best to run it 24/7 (my server is on all the time anyway) but if you shut it down periodically for a day or two, it takes a little while to catch up when restarted as it needs to download and verify all the recent blocks added to the chain.

to be fair, the two coins can co-exist. One has a larger block size and is accepted by less merchants, still has the 10 minute average block time, doesnt have segwit to reduce tx size, doesnt support lightning network. Bitcoin Cash is inferior in every way, this may change during another mass adoption like last december where fees and wait times for BTC rise, but right now, anything (and more) you can do with BCH you can do with BTC.

I dont think so, but the implication you control the keys to over a million bitcoin might be worth something. If Satoshi showed up and said "the current bitcoin is not what I intended" that might lead some to follow "his true vision".
I thought the duality might be plausible, but we have to wait and see what the book says. If the book isnt free to all who want to read it, then its probably not written by Satoshi. emails/posts/code that are written by him/her/it show someone of the "give it to the people" ethos

Agreed, The Bitcoin wiki shows it as a posthumous softfork that rejected that specific block (and only that tx in the block) and started building the forked chain from there until it overtook the other one. 
This was not a rollback of the original 53 block difference. Thanks.
edit* but isnt that the same as a re-org? All other txs would be continued as was, one specific one would be redirected.

 &gt;They used to be excited about tech, seems to be everyone fixated on price and adoption 
still are, anyone that is concerned with the tech has no concern for price. Adoption is a good metric though, so it should be mentioned, not for possible price increase of my (small amount of) BTC but for actual adoption. I love the idea that my local supermarket accepts BTC, not because its makes my BTC worth more USD, but because I can spend it at my local supermarket.

It also has many disadvantages as mentioned.
You need to remember where you buried it, hope no one else finds it, hope it doesnt corrode etc. Might want to do 2 in separate locations but that doubles the chance it will be compromised.
Cold storage is great for resisting the temptation to sell in a rising market because its a lot of effort to get the seed, restore the wallet, send to exchange, sell, transfer to bank account.
Make sure you mark down the BIP Derivation path your HD wallet uses along with the seed eg: BIP49/0/0 as this will help years down the line to restore if your chosen wallet no longer exists.

these are both valid arguments against these coins V BTC. But I think they have their place right now.
I would Add that LTC has value because of the reduced average block time. 2.5 min v 10 min. Quicker conf has its place but youre right by saying a "testnet of sorts."
XMR is truly fungible, so is the best crypto "cash" at the moment. I have issues with the anonymity of tx's on this chain but I dont know enough about how consensus ensures the cap isnt increased by miners if the amounts are anon. I need to read up more.
I really hope improvements in BTC fungibility in the near future will prevent the need to mix/tumble/join for an extra fee to retain anonymity of sender,receiver and amount. This is what internet cash needs to achieve.
This should all be attempted while keeping tx and block size as small as practical to ensure decentralisation is maintained along with low fees which Im sure is not an easy task. Time will tell if its even possible but the future of BTC is very exciting.
Your health is the most important thing, fix that first and then worry about silly internet comments! Good luck.

c. They took out a long position with 10x+ leverage and benefited even more on that by the price rise.

1. the article wasnt about buying bitcoin as an investment (which a lot of adults dont seem to understand), it was posing a question about the possible future of money in a digital world.
2. no one lost "thousands in only a few days" unless they bought 2+ BTC a week ago or prior to every dip. Is a week "a few days", you could argue "a few" is anything &lt;10 but more than 2, but when you mention days, I would say a few is &lt;6.
Is a 4th grader throwing $8000+ at BTC. Not unless they are Richie Rich.
what amount of money do you think a 4th grader is willing to lose? Im guessing $1. If timmy sent Amy BTC yesterday he probably sent it for some fortnite skins, pokemon cards or some other shit their both into.In which case, he is quite happy (except he could have gotten more skins/cards today.)

What is digital currency? We take a look at this complicated concept.
Last spring, we asked readers what they were saving for. Most said things like video games and phones. But Tyler, a 9-year-old from Los Angeles, California, said he was saving for a Bitcoin. If you’ve been reading the headlines, you know he’s not alone. Bitcoin is an example of a new type of electronic money called cryptocurrency. There are more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the best-known.
Unlike paper money or coins, crypto (for short) isn’t something you can hold. And it isn’t printed, like dollars, or minted, like quarters. It’s created using computer programs and exists only in computer files. But it works like real money. To spend Bitcoin, you need a digital wallet, which is like a bank account installed on your computer or smartphone. You can use your digital wallet to spend Bitcoin at various websites and stores around the world.
To understand crypto, it helps to know about the history of money. U.S. currency was once backed by “the gold standard.” For every dollar issued, a similar amount of gold was kept in a vault. Today, money has value because the government says it does, and people believe in the government.
Cryptocurrency, too, has value because people believe in it. Users can buy Bitcoin. But they can also get paid in Bitcoin for helping process transactions for others. This involves using computers to perform complex equations and solve math problems.
A Little Like A Library Book
One of the reasons people trust Bitcoin is that there is a traceable record of every transaction. Think about the last time you checked out a library book. There was a record of everyone who had ever checked out that book before you. That’s similar to the record, or ledger, that’s kept for Bitcoin. A technology called blockchain creates a list of the transactions made for each Bitcoin. It uses cryptography, a secret code, to keep transactions secure.
Is it safe?
One reason people got interested in Bitcoin is they saw a way to make a lot of money, fast. In September 2015, a single Bitcoin was worth $230. By December 2017, the price had risen to $17,000. But people lost a lot of money fast, too. The price of one Bitcoin is now about $6,500. Why? It’s like the excitement that increases the price of a popular toy. The price falls once the excitement dies down.
This instability in price is one reason experts say Bitcoin is risky. But many believe that cryptography and blockchain are going to change our world, just like the Internet did. “Thirty years ago, you could send a letter to someone in India, and it would take a month to get there,” says Edward Stringham, an economist. “Today, email allows people to communicate instantly. Cryptocurrency is doing the same thing for money. It’s letting people [around the world] buy and sell with one another, and that’s revolutionary.”
Family Challenge
The difference between paper money and cryptocurrency is similar to the difference between snail mail and email. Talk to your family to find examples of other technologies that have completely changed the way we do something.

Doesnt really specify if the data obtained was from their system or user systems. More likely "a large number of...." would have to have been accessed on the server system. Otherwise an entity has phished, installed viruses etc on many individual systems around the world, then held that info to use in one hit.
Seems more likely they were compromised through phishing, a virus "and other attacks" but I agree the statement is quite vague.

KYC/AML means you will have to provide ID. Most major exchanges require it. 
If you had some you could download and use BISQ (a decentralised P2P exchange) as they require a security deposit of BTC before purchasing. 
If you dont mind paying higher rates Bitcoin ATMs are an option.
Best option is from someone you know that already has some as then you dont need to do KYC/AML and can get it at market rate.
Its a steep learning curve which requires trade offs for each different on-ramp but it is quite easy once you get started. People can be rude in all different communities, if you want to start using BTC dont let that stop you. Keep reading and youll feel more comfortable soon. welcome to Bitcoin.

It depends on the mempools and number of incoming tx's. 
Heres a graph of one. 
This shows 10MB above your fee so approx 8 Blocks away. 
Heres another one:  
Shows your not going to be in the next 3 blocks at that fee. Right now 100sats/byte should get you next block.
To answer your question, there is no way to know for sure 6 hours out. You can make more educated guesses though. I would guess 20 will easily get you confirmed within 6 hours (from now) but that can all change if tx's start flooding in again.

depends on how you received them with the trezor, they may be sent from more than one address. check the transaction details to see which addresses hold an amount of BTC first.

so Alice opens a channel and so do you (all automated in the app). you send alice some lunch money (through timmy and dave who also have channels open for their lunch money)  Alice sends the lunch money you just gave her to the canteen and buys lunch.
at the end of the day the canteen closes its channel which puts your tx, timmys tx, daves tx etc on chain.

Ive discussed this with what I consider intelligent people but they still believe the dollar is backed by gold (in Aus that ended in 1932) or cash deposits in the private banks.
edit: the shit storm that is brewing is going to cause a depression the likes of which the world has never seen.

The following are his tweets. My following comments have been deleted and added to this to make it all readable to a non twitter user.
pros: 
1 we could "revenge" the hackers by "moving" the fees to miners; 
2 deter future hacking attempts in the process. 
3 explore the possibility of how bitcoin network would deal with situations like these.
cons: 
1 we may damage credibility of BTC, 
2 we may cause a split in both the bitcoin network and community. Both of these damages seems to out-weight $40m revenge. 
3 the hackers did demonstrate certain weak points in our design and user confusion, that was not obvious before.
4 While it is a very expensive lesson for us, it is nevertheless a lesson. it was our responsibility to safe guard user funds. We should own up it. We will learn and improve.

@_date: 2019-05-17 22:00:17


The hash and the transactions are separate but together they make the block. there is no "right combo" miners race to find a hash that wins (could be any hash with enough leading 0's to satisfy the difficulty) then apply it to a block of their chosen txs that they decide on, usually the highest fee ones but could be any. 
An Altruistic miner might decide to fill their block with all the oldest tx's but most miners are trying to make as much BTC as possible so they choose the highest fee txs.

1. It is the currency of the internet. It is useful for buying goods and services over the internet. It is better than normal money because your transaction is not dependent on any third party approval.
2. Blockchain is the global distributed ledger that lets you know which keys can spend which bitcoins. It works by miners trying to find a hash below the difficulty level, and once found they create a block of transactions and add it to the chain.
3. Supply and demand, more sellers v buyers and vice versa.
4. You dont store the BTC offline, you store the keys offline that let you spend the BTC
5. You do A LOT of reading.  r/Bitcoinbeginners      
6. Every time a miner solves the hash and forms a block, they get a reward. ATM its 12.5 BTC/Block next year that drops to 6.25 then every 4 years it halves again.

thats problem number 1. Anyone who told these people its a get rich quick scheme is an arsehole. 
I had many friends ask me if they should chuck in all their savings when I was talking about bitcoin (bear in mind, I only learned about this last year) to which I said "FUCK NO!" Its a speculative asset, throw in what youre prepared to lose. and any that did, have.


who is they? the people I buy BTC from? If I buy BTC on a regular basis, is there any one entity taking my money? no. Its individual owners selling their BTC to me at an agreed price they are happy and so am I. I was happy buying .06BTC for $100 AUD and Im even more happy buying 0.2BTC for $100 AUD. There is no global conspiracy of people trying to drain my money day by day.

it could.
using the bottom link I posted
Scroll down to the bottom graph, hover your cursor at the right hand side of it and a popup shows you sats/byte then number of MB  eg:  70+ : 1.2MB
This means 1.2MB of tx's at or above 70 sats/b. Average 1MB per block means that should clear in the next block or 2.
10+ shows 24.376MB are at or above that value. so approx 24 blocks. then average 10 min per block means approx 240 minutes = 3 hours. Its not precise because there is so many variables.
Block time is never 10 minutes exactly. Could be 1 minute, could be 1 hour or more (Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks to maintain a 10 minute average over the next 2016) 
Block size is never 1MB exactly (depends on how many tx's a miner puts in the block) 
New tx's coming in at a higher sat/byte value fee push yours lower down the list.

any reputable exchange is running KYC/AML as they want to be a "legit" business in the eyes of the government. find a person that wants to do it for you, but you will pay premium. try bisq and create a relationship with a seller, they could send to you every month after an auto deposit to their bank account.

I can withdraw $100K/day AND $250K in crypto and im a very small regular purchaser. You either arent verified, Dont purchase often enough or your chosen exchange is not very liquid and doesnt hold the cash reserves for higher payouts.

I care, you care. We should probably vote accordingly. Try to put someone that shares our views on this into both the senate and House of Reps on the 18th May. 
Ask the question of every one of your possible representatives "Do you support the proposed budget measure for a $10,000 cash limit on purchases from Businesses? Yes or No?"

the general consensus is:
As much USD worth as you are comfortable carrying in your wallet - Hot wallet like a mobile phone or full node
The rest is kept offline - If you have more than the cost of a hardware wallet and are uncomfortable securing your coin in other ways, then you should probably buy one.
Do not use a web wallet to hold your coin, never keep coin an exchange unless you plan to be trading it in the very near future.


You control it, you can send it to anyone at anytime and dont have to worry that coinbase might say "No" or worse, that they dont actually have access to it when you want it.

Cryptojacking is real and can also be in the form of exploited browser extensions.
 
However, Lolli claims it works on kickbacks they receive from their preferred partner stores which they then pay you in bitcoin.
You still cant withdraw your kickbacks in $ or BTC... yet :)

1 criticism would be your "ad" at the bottom but I understand why you would put it there, shows the use of BTC as a currency. I would suggest a link to a merchant aggregate site.

you cant tell. if its in an exchange address, they hold the keys not him. They control the bitcoin.
edit: exchanges will regularly use your deposit to "your address" to pay out someone elses withdrawal. Once you ask for your bitcoin, they will use some other coin they control to pay you. Thats why Jan 3 everyone should pull all their bitcoin balances off exchanges to a wallet they control, we will see which exchanges have been running less than 100% reserve (they dont hold as many bitcoin as they actually owe to people)

this is one of the only reasons BTC should be on exchanges. Also can be left on there until X amount (or time frame) to reduce any withdrawal fees.

youve been scammed and theyre trying for more.


they dont need to report a $500 purchase under any Aust law except income. Aust law does not require any proof you received BTC for goods, you just say you did. CGT has nothing to do with this.


WTF? So they want you to send more money, which they will then refund? for what purpose? to trick their system into showing you paid it? Bullshit
OKAY. Go here:  put in the transaction ID or the address you sent it to, or from. This will show if it has been confirmed and they are full of shit. If they have your money, they owe you the product. DO NOT SEND THEM ANY MORE BTC.

You lost a friendship but learned a very valuable lesson (Your "mate" was actually a fucking dog cunt)
Sorry this happened to you.
If you EVER control a wallet with someone else it has to be multisig. It shouldnt have been possible for him to ever move or sell them without your approval. 
Also, most exchanges wont let two people sign up to the same account. Whos name was the account in? If it was him, quick anon call to the ato will fuck him come tax time, he will lose approx $40K of that to the tax man. If it was you, youre in even more shit because the registered exchanges are now sharing this data with the ATO.

The ATO and the Australian government are not trying to rid the country of cash (yet). The money supply of currency is increasing
This was a proposal in a budget, If the Govt said they will raise newstart in the next budget, It doesnt actually happen until it passes parliament.
It is their eventual aim, but this is not law and its really much ado about nothing.

I was discussing this video the other day, my GF (who doesnt GAF about BTC and just tunes out)  said "but its always higher after the crash" No shit Sherlock.
The next wave will bring these people in too. "Come for the gain, stay for the tech". You only need 1% of the gain chasers to use it and realise its the future of money. They become new hodlers of last resort and start accumulating.

TDAmeritrade currently offers futures but have invested in ErisX to allow users to trade actual BTC. No timeline.

Would be interesting to hear what that would add to the cost and if you would be better off buying that amount each week DCA. 8K in 2017 (depends which end you started mining) could have bought more than 2 BTC.
