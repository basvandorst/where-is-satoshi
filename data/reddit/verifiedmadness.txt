They can still spend bitcoin

How else do you trade for other currencies?
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:47:49
Well you don't need them to be in China

I refuse to pay current transaction fees. I don't care if my 0.01 BTC takes 6 months to confirm.

Thats when the property loss protection team handcuffs you and you end up charged with vandalism.

Post a transaction and wallet address or this is meaningless.

Yes :(

The key is to buy in bulk. Buy 500 cups of coffee and transactions fees will be cheaper per cup.

Dumbass, sell half of it and let the rests ride until whatever certain number lets you be rich.

So there are 36,000,000 millionaires but the next 34,000,000 goes all the way down to $32,400? no. Also, income and net worth are not the same. The top 1% have so much net worth they don't need an income.

Your math is off. 70,000,000 people are in the 1% out of 7 billion people. 36,000,000 worldwide millionaires. I'm not in the next 34,000,000

When bitcoin becomes the world currency I'll be in the 1%.. for now... not.

Phew, Luckily I'm under the cut and didn't keep any, I used it like currency instantly! I would much prefer to have my name go to IRS and have 20k worth of bitcoin at 2013-2015 average price :(

One suggestion: Keep your pictures updated with somewhat current prices. In 4 months it will look stupid if your screenshots, etc have prices that are way off
