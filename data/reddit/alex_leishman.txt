Assuming you're in the US:
1. Unfortunately it's the law. Talk to your congressional representative or donate to Coin Center if you want to change things.
2. Unless you are paying via cash or bank wire, the company will go broke if they don't do some identity verification. Credit cards and ACH payments both hold the merchant liable for any fraudulent charges. If someone is buying bitcoin from a company online, the company needs to know with certainty that the user has the right to spend from the card or account they're using or they will be taken advantage of by criminals using stolen accounts.

Do not lend them. If you give them to someone else, you don't have any way to get them back. Getting back USD from borrowers is difficult enough. I can't even imagine lending BTC ending well.
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:46:01


That's a non-argument, because it applies to a system with only one currency that people use. Bitcoin is meant to be part of a voluntary system where people can use other currencies as they wish.
Bitcoin deflation will be specific to bitcoin only. If the market desires to use other currencies alongside bitcoin, they have every right to do so. These simplistic statements on inflation and deflation do not hold water in a multi-currency environment where the money supply is not centrally controlled.

At that point you're trusting multi-bit to use coinjoin. I guess you could argue you are already trusting them by using their software. It's a potential solution.

I can say from experience that Bitcoin is garnering a lot of interest in academia. I'm a Comp. Sci. grad student at Stanford and just finished working as a Teaching Assistant last quarter for the [Bitcoin course offered here]( There was a lot of interest in the course and the students loved it! I'm very excited for the future.
I heard that the Law School will offer a course next quarter that will touch on Bitcoin from a legal perspective. I don't think the course is 100% about Bitcoin though.

Even then it's still not very private. If i am a MultiBit HD wallet user, I can collect a list of my MultiBit fee addresses. If MultiBit spends the fees i pay by combining them with UTXOs from fees sitting at their other addresses, they have just revealed that those addresses also belong to MultiBit.
I can then see that anyone who sent BTC to those addresses very likely had a MultiBit HD wallet.
I see some privacy issues here. An alternative solution would be to have one fee address assigned to a wallet. Fees must be paid there, but they need not be paid from the wallet itself. The wallet just checks that this address received the necessary payments. Or they could just charge to use the software.

I think going with an API at first would be a great way to get started. Once you are comfortable with the business logic and structure of your application, you can swap out the API with your own service.
Don't overwhelm yourself with something very complicated. Get one simple app up and running and then add more complex features once you've learned the lessons from your first iteration.

I don't fault you at all for wanting to charge for this software. You deserve to earn money for the hard work you put in and I am looking forward to trying it out.
BUT, I'm worried that the fee system you currently have in place (as I understand it) may not be ideal because it will leak information about your wallet users to the network.
Can you address this privacy concern? and I discussed this issue here:

You guys are doing an awesome job! Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2015-12-08 16:41:08
But won't the network have to wait for this signature data to validate the block? How will this reduce block propagation times if the same amount of data needs to be propagated? Or is this not meant to reduce block propagation times?

I work at [MaiCoin]( We offer both Buy and Sell through our platform.
The easiest solution for you would be to have the manufacturer set up a MaiCoin account with their bank/user information. When you send them the Bitcoin, they can sell it after 6 confirmations and the funds will be deposited to their bank account a short time later. Easy peasy.

Sync time takes a few weeks. I set mine up last weekend and it's still syncing. I haven't had time to try to speed it up, so I'm not sure if it's possible.
If you're just looking to parse the blockchain and do analysis, something like blockparser might be better. But blockparser looks more like a utility, whereas Toshi is a full node built to integrate with web apps. So it just depends on your needs and preferences. I know Ruby a lot better than C++, which is another reason I like Toshi.
As for costs:  ~$30-40 / month
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:26:37
Well, "Is it a good idea?" is a tough question to answer because it depends on what your needs are. If you just want a wallet and basic bitcoin features, then Toshi is definitely overkill.
Toshi is built for building scalable web apps, blockchain analysis, and other uses where having a well indexed, highly queryable blockchain has value. As for storage, I'm not sure of the exact prices but even 1TB is pretty cheap these days.
The great thing about disposable cloud computing is that you can get Toshi up and running/syncing to see if it's something you even want to bother with. If not, you can just destroy your instance and you'll have only paid less than a few dollars.

Yeah, it will be interesting to see how it all evolves. I think Ripple is a very clever idea, but I'm still on the fence as to how useful it really is. I think it may serve as a good complement to Bitcoin. Too early to tell.
If Ripple does succeed in getting banks to build on top of their network then it may be a good thing for Bitcoin.

Well it's basically been disproven that the function is collision resistant, which is a core property necessary for a hash function to be used in cryptographic protocols. It's still really hard to find a collision, but if you use SHA1 in something now, chances are in 5-10 years it will be even easier to find a collision and you just wouldn't be safe anymore.

@_date: 2017-02-23 16:46:11
No. The bounty was a few grand, which is nothing to Google. Google probably spent over a million dollars to find this collision. The bounty was probably claimed by someone who just saw their blog post and used the published collisions to generate the claiming tx.
Edit: I heard cost was in hundred(s) of thousands.
@_date: 2015-05-18 23:51:09
Plus the TX fee, which is a lot of satoshis. Unless the 21 pool includes all of its own transactions for zero fees. Which is a distinct possibility. They just won't be guaranteed to be confirmed quickly.

@_date: 2015-01-27 05:35:25
Mt. Gox only existed because the government made it nearly impossible for any competent group of people to start an exchange within US. It took over 5 years and VC funding of over $100 million before we had a viable bitcoin exchange (which is still only serving 25 states) purely because of onerous regulation.

Well fees would be lower, but more transactions would be in a block. Additionally this will open up more use-cases for Bitcoin and hopefully drive up the price. Seems like a win-win to me.
@_date: 2017-02-10 03:58:46

Theoretical question: If all of this craziness is true and Karpeles is found guilty of running Silk Road, is it possible that the Silk Road Bitcoin could be handed out to people who had coins on Mt. Gox?
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:11:56
Not only that! From what I can tell, Gavin is suggesting allowing the max block size to double every 2 years starting at ~16.8MB (anticipating continued advances in technology) until ~~2025~~ 2035, where the max block size will be capped at  **16 GB**.
This is 16,000 times larger than the current limit of 1 MB. Today's block size limit allows for a theoretical transaction rate of 7 tx/s, so theoretically (assuming average tx size stays the same) the network could *theoretically* be capable of handling **~110,000 tx/s** by 2035. There may be other limitations here with bandwidth and CPU speed, but I don't know enough to estimate the impact of that.
To put this in perspective, I'll quote the [Bitcoin Wiki](




Of course the features of the protocol will change before 2035 and I'm sure Bitcoin will look a lot different by then, so this is just an over-simplified, although interesting back of the envelope calculation.
Edit: Thanks for the clarifications. I misread some details. It looks like the chart stops at 2025, that was my oversight.
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:00:24
Haha not sure about that!
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:46:08
This assumes that a transaction has an average size in the ballpark of ~240 bytes. If you assume a block can hold ~1MB of transactions, then 1 block can hold about ~4200 (again total estimate) transactions. Then if you use the fact that on average a block is found every 10 minutes (600s), you can ballpark the theoretical limit (4200tx / 600s) = 7tx/s.
These numbers are total estimates. Not sure the exact calculations, but 7tx/s is the quoted ballpark estimate.
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:13:19
lol. I think that math is a bit off.
@_date: 2015-01-21 02:39:58

This is a marketplace allowing anyone to purchase computational services for Bitcoin micropayments. This is basically a marketplace for machine payable APIs. The APIs offered here will provide some computational service in return for Bitcoin. This incentivizes people to provide easily-accessible APIs that require no sign up or authentication.

Blockstream has specifically structured their incentives to align with the success of Bitcoin. They have legal clauses allowing devs to leave with full pay if they are forced to do something detrimental to the success of Bitcoin. They are also given time-locked bitcoin as part of their compensation.
To claim that the Blockstream guys are dangerous to bitcoin is absolutely ridiculous. Should we place absolute trust in them, no. But they deserve a huge amount of respect and credit for what they have accomplished so far. Without Greg Maxwell and Peter Wuille, especially, Bitcoin would not be what it is today. If we alienate these guys, it would be the single biggest loss the Bitcoin community has faced. It's a shame that so many people here fail to see this.

Let you spend money you don't have.
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:15:41
You should research the technology heavily. If you have a lot of disposable income, toss a few hundred or thousand bucks in right now and make the big decision later once you are more knowledgeable. If you can't afford to lose money, tread cautiously. Asking people on if you should invest in bitcoin is not a great way to make your decision.
To be honest, the most valuable thing Bitcoin has given me is a passion to learn about cryptography and software engineering. So there's that to consider as well.
@_date: 2016-06-04 23:44:14
Why? The minute it becomes a widely held currency, banks will allow people to deposit it, hold fractional reserves, lend it out and pay depositors interest, and continue business as they always have.

Thanks for the response. Right, I don't mean relative to the Bitcoin network. I'm just wondering about LN Node operators and how much work finding a path will require. I need to do some more reading on it.

Is that a joke? If not, what makes you think Craig Wright did this?
@_date: 2016-06-03 00:53:54
Well comparing the path finding scalability of LN to the Bitcoin Network doesn't feel right. In Bitcoin everyone sees all transactions, which in some ways is more efficient. We do not need to find paths between nodes because we know at the end of the day all nodes see the blockchain. My question was specifically about path finding, which is a problem pure Bitcoin doesn't really face.
@_date: 2018-10-13 02:18:11
No, it was never any of those things. Bitcoin has never been anything but marginally confidential. Chainalysis is still very effective and zero confs were never guaranteed. People were doing double spends to trick instant conf payment processors since they launched. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:03:59
Then we need segwit and off-chain methods to keep small transactions like that cheap and easy. There's no quick fix here. A decentralized system is inherently more expensive than a centralized one.
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:36:14
Lol that's ridiculous. The block size has no bearing on Liquid's value to exchanges. Liquid is much faster, predictable and confidential due to its properties that have almost nothing to do with block size.
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:08:56
Well for one, the people who did the study are not core devs. Secondly, the study said AT MOST 4MB which they qualify by saying the limit should probably be even less than that because they don't account for various other factors in their study. Segwit brings the max theoretical block size to about 2-3 MB so it does seem in line with the study

Well they still haven't really figured out how to make money, which goes for pretty much all non-gambling bitcoin companies.
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:45:46
Yeah they have fees, but I would be very surprised if that covered fraud, legal, engineering and all the other costs they have. Fraud is a very non-negligible cost for these companies. That's why CC fees are so high too. Base CC fee is ~2.5% anyways so Coinbase loses that off the bat. Then on top of that is fraud.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:42:21

@_date: 2015-08-02 00:32:49
We will look at user behavior to determine how to improve our site. Popular graphs, addresses and transactions can be cached to improve speed. Looking at user behavior also allows us to determine which features users like most and which features users don't use.
Users can also tag addresses and add notes to transactions. Unless you are a paid user, these tags will be public so other users benefit from the additional information.
Does this answer your question?
Edit: I see the question was updated to include a question about IP addresses. We currently don't use a user's IP address for anything like this. That said, if protecting your privacy is a concern you should use a VPN or some other method of obfuscation for any site you visit.
@_date: 2015-08-02 00:10:14

If this is the case, I'd guess hundreds of thousands of BTC are being dumped in this selloff by Roger and a few other whales he's working with.
The silver lining here is that BTC will be at least somewhat free of control by the whales who support BCH. However, the two chains and economies will remain inextricably linked through the miners.
Best case IMO is that BCH fails and these guys lose a large chunk their fortunes and control over the market.

I disagree. I do not think the benefits of a decentralized Uber would outweigh the costs. Uber has deep pockets, can give promotions, market themselves and most importantly pay lawyers.
Uber has an uphill regulatory battle. If a driver gets fined, Uber will pay. If a driver gets arrested, Uber will help them out. What happens if Joe Schmoe gets arrested or fined while driving for a decentralized service? You think the cops aren't going to be requesting rides and arresting drivers?
Filesharing is easy to anonymize and stay hidden. The dynamics are much different for operating a vehicle.
Decentralized Uber would be cool. But I don't see it ever becoming mainstream.

For the record, i don't own any ethereum.
May I suggest making an ethereum mega-thread and deleting all the others so we can at least have some way to share our thoughts about how it squares up with bitcoin or how the 2 chains can work together?
Ethereum is not just some bitcoin-fork scam coin. Ethereum is a new cryptocurrency built from the ground up by a reputable team of talented engineers.
It is relevant to Bitcoin because Bitcoin stands to gain a lot from either creating an Ethereum sidechain or building a compatibility layer between the chains in Ethereum. Ethereum could also potentially be a direct threat to Bitcoin.
Almost any person involved in the Bitcoin space would find Ethereum interesting and relevant to the discussions here.
We discuss other things that bitcoin competes with - banks, payment processors, etc.. Why can't we discuss how Bitcoin and Ethereum square up or how they can work together?
I think it's ridiculous that you are censoring ethereum posts. I want to see what the core devs have to say and see the insight that the people in this community want to share. You're not allowing that discussion to happen even though people on this subreddit want it to. If they didn't want to discuss this, they'd downvote the ethereum posts.

Great question:
1. Convenience - with our platform you can automate your purchases and not think at all about it. 
2. Taxes &amp; Performance - in a week we will be rolling out our performance reporting functionality, followed by our tax lot specific selection feature allowing you to optimize your realized gains and losses.
3. Human Support - we have human phone, chat and email support. I think you'll notice a difference if you interact with our service team.
4. Bitcoin-specific features - we have features many exchanges do not: Lightning Network support, native segwit, etc.
However, our service is not for everyone. If you are comfortable with an active trader interface, that may be more suitable for you. We offer an easier alternative with very convenient features for the non-trader. Happy to answer any more questions if you have them.

Hey Bob. Yes, there is a legend that can be seen by clicking the "?" icon on the graph.
On a high level, squares can be expanded by double clicking, circles cannot.
By double clicking a node, you are expanding "direct outgoing transactions." This means that you are expanding/displaying the transactions sent from that node's addresses which spend the outputs sent to those addresses from the incoming transactions displayed. These transactions can also be expanded individually in the sidebar. Double clicking a node expands all of them.
This node's addresses could have sent out many other transactions using funds it received from incoming transactions that aren't displayed. These transactions can be expanded by expanding "Associated Outgoing Transactions" on the sidebar.
"Direct Incoming Transactions" are transactions that have sent outputs to a node's addresses that were later sent out from the node. There is an additional condition that these incoming transaction's outputs were used as inputs in an outgoing transaction together with outputs from the displayed incoming transactions. Said another way, a direct incoming transaction has had one or more of it's outputs spent from the node's addresses together with outputs that originated from the displayed incoming transactions.
"Indirect Incoming Transactions" are any other transactions that have sent funds to a node's addresses but the outputs from those transactions have not been sent out of the node by any displayed transactions on the graph.
Edit: It is also important to note that we do limit the amount of related transactions displayed for performance reasons. The satoshi dice cluster, for example, will not show the option to expand all transactions ever sent out of it.
This is a lot to take in. It's difficult to boil down the complexities of the Bitcoin transaction graph into an easy to use GUI. We would greatly appreciate any suggestions or feedback you have with regards to how to make the tool easier to use, more intuitive, suggested features, etc.
We don't yet have a comprehensive documentation section. We hope to create that, along with more explanatory video tutorials.

We're in the process of building this, but it is a challenging design space and there are many edge cases to consider. The biggest risk is continually sending to a hardware wallet that someone has lost access to and didn't realize it. Ways to mitigate this risk include periodically forcing the user to confirm they have access to the keys, or something like that.

A public ledger and anonymity are not mutually exclusive. With modern cryptographic techniques we can prove that a transaction is valid without revealing the sender or the recipient. Implementing these techniques in a scalable, effective way is a big challenge, but I don't think it's an insurmountable challenge.

We're making progress. It will just take time. The confidential transactions work Greg Maxwell has done will hopefully be a big step forward. As our knowledge of cryptography progresses we will hopefully get closer to full anonymity.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:12:21


I replied to Greg on this matter. The vast majority of the validation is not actually moved to the critical path. A pairing must be calculated for each tx signature, but these pairings can be calculated and cached when a tx is first seen. Validating a block requires calculating one pairing e(g, sigma*) on the aggregate signature (sigma*) and a fixed point (g). This pairing is faster to compute than an arbitrary pairing because of the fixed point. The only other required calculation for block signature validation is a multiplication of all of the individual cached-pairings (assuming no unseen transactions). 
So we do have some issue if a block contains a lot of new transactions, but even then there are optimizations that can be made to make the pairing speed more comparable to ECDSA verify. I'm currently working on implementing a library that performs these signatures and implements certain new optimizations.
@_date: 2016-02-26 22:44:51
Bandwidth isn't the only constraint on block size. Validation time is also a bottleneck. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:15:55
The individual pairings can actually be cached and need-not be computed when a block is received. Validation of a block is actually very fast if all of the transactions have been previously seen. See my reply to @_date: 2019-12-17 18:00:39

In all fairness, the chart doesn't show any new banks that were started in that time period.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:34:19
Completely agree. There are multiple optimizations that can be made on the pairing calculations that have yet to be implemented. This is something I am currently exploring. My point was that it is unfair to compare BLS aggregate sigs assuming no-caching to ECDSA with caching.

I don't think it will ever be 10x better for everyday consumer transactions. However, in many ways it is 10x better than gold as a fixed-supply store of wealth. Like others said, it is also potentially 10x better than existing systems for micro-payments once we get all of the LN stuff figured out.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:23:27
Yeah the performance of existing pairing implementations, as we discussed before, is significantly slower than our ECDSA verify. However, there are optimizations (especially regarding calculating the products of pairings) that have not been implemented and can potentially speed things up significantly. Still exploring that...

Even if 21 has the hash power to include their device's transactions in blocks, a few questions arise.
1) How does 21 know if a micro-payment transaction is from one of their devices?
2) How do these device owners deal with the fact that they will have to potentially wait a significant amount of time before their transaction is confirmed (when 21.co gets a block)?
3) If all of these people are making micropayments directly on-chain, as opposed to using the Lightning Network, how will 21 include these transactions in a block capped at 1MB (or even 8MB)? On chain micropayments is difficult to scale.
I'd like to see some demos and specs of the software on the device. I have yet to form an opinion about this.

That just seems like a really inefficient way to build a distributed system. What can they do with a blockchain in this instance that they could not do using existing technologies and cryptographic techniques for transaction validation in a multi-user system? If identities of the parties (banks) involved are known and the actors in the network are legally bound to abide by the rules, what is the point of a blockchain?
Why even use a distributed system and not a centralized system they all participate in developing?
A private blockchain requires trust. If you require trust in a system, I don't see why a blockchain would have any benefit over traditional systems.

I don't think you can say that is the point of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an asset just like any other. If Bitcoin holders want to deposit their assets in a fractional reserve institution, they will do so for the right price. 
Banks don't "do nothing". They provide loans and credit to parties who need them and pay their depositors a return. Now, a bitcoin bank would need to charge higher interest rates than banks today because there is no cheap source of money and a lender of last resort, but the market will decide what those rates will be. I look forward to this actually.

I think that ASIC does not necessarily apply to mining. ASIC is not a Bitcoin-centric term. They are likely not only working on mining hardware.
They could very-likely be working on consumer hardware to make bitcoin easier and safer to use. See their analogy to the first internet modems.

I think Banks provide a lot of useful services. A lot of people will not be capable/comfortable with securely storing all of their BTC and will want a Bank (like Coinbase) to do this for them. For this they'd probably be willing to pay a fee if the deposit was insured (I definitely would). This same logic applies to cash, gold, etc. Almost nobody would be comfortable storing all of their cash in their house and we rely on third parties to secure our assets.
If Bitcoin succeeds we will see an emergence of a financial system on top of the currency and that will be a sign of maturity.

Most people simply use software and don't care how it works or what it is even called.
I see a lot of people here suggesting that everyone store their own private keys and manage their funds. While this is a good solution for many in this subreddit, we have to accept that 99% of people in the world will probably never even know what a private key is.
@_date: 2015-03-04 14:44:53
First, Google Authenticator has nothing to do with Google other than the fact that they maintain the app. It does not send your info to google.
For Authy, it is not this simple. A company does not have to work with Authy for a user to use the Authy app. Authy provides a service to companies that will take the burden off of them for dealing with all of the issues that come with TOTP. But Authy also provides a TOTP application that a user can choose to use when setting up their TOTP on a bitcoin site. Authy will backup an encrypted copy of their keys for them. The company has no control over this.
But TOTP and all of the intricacies that come with it, along with handling support for the not insignificant number of users who will lose their secrets makes it very tempting for companies to use Authy. Authy is undoubtedly a better user experience and makes life easier for both the company and the users. Of course, as you say, this does have a cost. But some would say the cost is worth it.
One of the biggest problems with TOTP is that users will inevitably lose their phones or get new ones. If they just use google auth or some other TOTP app, then they need to have saved a copy of their TOTP secret when they set it up (which is potentially dangerous). Some companies allow you to download a set of backup codes ahead of time, anticipating this scenario. You can then use your backup codes to login and change your settings. But implementing all of these things properly and supporting them can be a pain. Especially for a small company with time and budget constraints.
Even then you will still have some users who lose their backups and their codes. So you need to have some manual process to allow customer service to reset a user's 2FA through manual verification. This puts humans in the loop and introduces another set of vulnerabilities.
There is no perfect solution. It is easy to bash something like Authy, but much more difficult to actually implement a better alternative.

99% of people won't care. The vast majority of people use the same password on every site, including their banking site. They're not going to bother to learn how to manage private keys. It's just not going to happen.

I really don't see this as a possibility actually. Could it happen in theory? Yes. Would it ever actually happen? If Satoshi lost the private keys to any of his addresses I'd be very, very surprised and I think of all of the explanations, this is the least likely.
Additionally, if Satoshi did in fact lose his keys then we can use that to explain anyone's inability to create the valid genesis signature. In that case I will also declare that I am Satoshi and my excuse for my inability to produce a signature is that I just lost the keys.

If you're smart enough to understand Bitcoin, you're smart enough to understand Ethereum. In fact, in some ways it is easier to understand because each address has an actual balance in the blockchain, as opposed to a balance being a sum of unspent outputs.
I don't have any Ether, but I do find the project interesting. At the very least it illustrates alternative decisions one can make when designing a blockchain. It is definitely worth reading the white paper and wiki on github once or twice, just to expand how you think about these systems.
But there may be some truth to what you are saying in that the average joe will have a harder time understanding it. However, Ethereum is built with the intention of being a platform on which developer build. So it is designed so that most people will not need to understand how it works.

Sure, but a trezor can break (like mine did). You back it up, but you need a secure backup. There is no legal recourse if somehow your private key was lost or leaked.

Hey Mike. Thanks for your response! You make some good points, especially about the funding models.
I do share your belief that someday, with enough progress we will be able to make decentralized wallet software easy to use for the average person. I see the potential for a hybrid future where people maintain sole responsibility of their spending money, but perhaps rely on established centralized or sudo-centralized services like key custodians or escrow providers for transacting and storing large amounts of wealth.
I didn't mean to imply that centralization is the only way to go for our industry. I certainly hope not. But, we are competing against centralized institutions and the level of service and hand-holding they offer. My goal with this post was to re-remind people of the mindset of the mainstream market and the usability hurdles we must overcome before Bitcoin can really work in the mainstream.
For the record, thank you for all of the great work that you have done and continue to do in moving the industry forward :) Lighthouse is an awesome project.

Not sure why this graph keeps getting posted because it's really misleading. $1.8 trillion is just the sum of all transaction values but most of that is probably change being "sent back" to the tx sender.

The exponential growth trend is probably accurate, but not the absolute amount.

That doesn't make sense to me. You need ASICs AND electricity for mining. Having extra electricity without ASICs isn't useful. Having ASICs sitting around that aren't used unless there is an oversupply of power does not sound viable. Maybe I'm misunderstanding your point?
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:29:55
I don't see why a blockchain or mining would be at all necessary if a system has a bounded number of trusted parties who can have access to the data. It would be very inefficient to store the records at every single one of these locations. Distributed, centralized systems that virtually prevent any chance of data loss have been effectively implemented for a while now. Just look at any well run IT department at a large corporation. Blockchains would just add complexity and cost without any real benefit.

I think that is problematic. If I have something sensitive in my inbox that I want deleted permanently right away, I should have the ability to remove it without delay.
Not being able to delete email immediately is a security risk. If somebody hacks your email and you still have pending deletions that are sensitive, then you're out of luck.
Perhaps the way around this is to require 2FA for immediate deletion. That would also incentivize people to set up 2FA.

Great! You could also consider factoring inflation into the costs.
Additionally, have you done any analysis on theoretical vs practical numbers. For example, I see that it says this year it takes 0.04 days to download the blockchain. However, we all know that the actual time is orders of magnitude higher if you are downloading the blockchain from other peers.
Great start to the analysis though. It would be cool to see the model become more sophisticated.

@_date: 2016-05-03 16:51:36
Well if you mean brute forcing a private key for an address, then it would take more time than we have left until the heat death of the universe.
