Yeah, I do think most university libraries require a log in, but this one didn't. It wasn't exactly anything they advertised though. But we definitely had a lot of community users in that library. The only thing you had to sign on for, was the use of any Microsoft products. It was strange. If you wanted to open up a Word document or make a PowerPoint presentation, you had to enter your student info. This is a pretty big university too, with 5 different libraries on campus.

We have ban lists too, but those are for patrons that have violated specific library rules - like looking at porn or downloading illegally. We don't have a list of criminals that are banned from the internet. Is that specifically what you had - a list you were given from law enforcement?

Even with smart phones? How do they know they aren't using the internet at a library? Not all libraries require you to sign in/use your library card to get online. I just find this so baffling.

Gotcha - I see your point now.

Ah, I could see that for the phone companies for sure. I have worked in one public library, one university library, and currently work in a community college library. I know, at least in my area (they are all in the same county), that they don't have a list they give to libraries. 
edited to say this: Libraries are massive advocates for patron privacy and open access to everyone. There are probably reasons involving the American Library Association that would not allow for this to be enforced in any library, actually.

And, libraries are not allowed to ban sex offenders from the premises, which would obviously ban them from using the computers there. [Appeals Court Finds Library Sex Offender Ban Unconstitutional](

You're kidding, right? This barely deserves a response. There is SO MUCH that the ALA and libraries in general have done to NOT cooperate with the Patriot Act, it's ridiculous. Did you actually read any of the stuff on their website? It's not "a whole section bitching about it." 
If I were to write a full response to this detailing everything that has been done by the ALA regarding the Patriot Act, it would be ridiculously long. When I was in school for my Master's degree in Library Science, I wrote two papers on this very topic. One 15 page paper for a class and the other was a 20 page essay as a requirement for graduation - part of the final test for the entire Master's degree.

Obviously it's not being enforced, because *he's on the internet*...
*edit: I looked it up, he was only banned from the internet until 2003.

No problem - I figured that's what you meant. Just wanted to be sure. :)

Yes, most do require a library card, but not all do. The university library I worked at - any one could walk in and get on a computer - no login info required.
