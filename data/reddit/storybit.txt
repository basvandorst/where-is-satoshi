Based on the objective information, such us transaction volume and market cap, it is doing fantastically, considering it did not exist before 2009. 
It IS peer-to-peer, I don't need middlemen to send bitcoin. Middlemen, however, do help with education and improving user experience, and, most importantly with on-boarding users from centuries old fiat system to the new decentralized digital one.
China can mine more bitcoin, partially due to subsidized electricity rates and cheap labour, great, if these favourable conditions ever change the majority of mining will shift elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-04-16 21:32:41

I am not religious but to call people stupid for believing is very short sighted.
@_date: 2015-12-16 18:39:05
1.	Fintech Revolution: The future seems paved with fintech gold. Hailed as “disrupters,” small fintech firms offering products and solutions ranging from mobile payments to crowd funding are cropping up. Fintech firms will diversify the finance industry, and innovative banks will also benefit by incorporating new and cutting-edge ideas for customers. With the hype of fintech reaching deafening levels in 2015, and investments in the space witnessing 2-3X increases, the sector will become much more competitive in 2016.
2.	Corporate Social Responsibility as a Differentiator: When a company is near the top of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index one week and then caught with software to flaunt environmental regulations the next, the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is challenged. The impact on VW and spotlight on regulation aside, 2016 will bring a new meaning to CSR, and many companies will use it to set themselves apart.
3.	Augmented Reality Goes Mainstream: 2016 will be a year of major content development for augmented and virtual reality. We will see many launches and announcements of Oculus Rift-type products and their applications. I am told it will change the gaming industry and will become a money spinner once it is used in the porn industry
4.	Millennial Power: Millennials have come of age and are big business. As global Millennials enter the 16-35 age range, they are entering a new phase of purchasing power. At the low end, the traditional first buys, such as cars, are slowly being replaced by Uber; at the high end, they are now considering buying a house or a car.
5.	The Dragon Stumbles and the Elephant Runs: In 2016, China will enter its slowest growth phase in two decades as GDP growth forecasts in China fall below 7%. India is on a strong growth path, benefitting from recent policy reforms, its “Made in India” campaign, a consequent pickup in investment, and lower commodity prices. The Indian domestic demand is set to remain bullish and inflation is expected to fall. In 2016, India is expected to register 7.5% growth and cross that of China.
6.	Everything is ‘Uberised’: Businesses will follow consumers into the sharing economy. Corporate car- and home-sharing will lead the way, with Uber, Skype, and Airbnb set to launch corporate services. Companies will leverage each other’s assets to avoid diseconomies of scale, with an aim to operate at 100% capacity and 0% idle time.
7.	Women as the Next Frontier of Growth: Countries, organizations and industries are looking to capitalize on the gender dividend. Next year will see an increase in aggressive policies by governments and boards to raise their diversity ranking in a bid to boost both GDP and the bottom line. 2016 will throw up examples of gender diversity as a profit booster and at the same time help change corporate culture, like at VW.
8.	Blockchain Experts for Hire: Pioneers in the financial services industry are experimenting with how blockchains (a digital ledger) could be used for transaction clearing, back-office functions and cross-border payments. Blockchains could replace existing systems and streamline banking processes. The risk is having to speak to the new in-house blockchain expert at next year’s Christmas party.
9.	The Next 11: Recent turmoil across the BRICS regions is shifting companies’ focus to newly emerging hotspots such as Mexico, Vietnam, and Nigeria. Those economies have started to exhibit strong economic, technological, and social growth and are likely to contribute 20% more to the global GDP than in the past. Apart from these countries, I would put my money on Indonesia, Romania, Algeria, and some other selected countries in Asia and Africa.
10.	China-Russian Alliance: This new friendship could disrupt the current world trade order through currency swaps and possible gas lines. A challenge to existing superpowers, the world waits to see exactly how this agreement will manifest in formal policy. Europe could be most affected as the recession in Russia brings these two nations closer to each other and China finances some critical infrastructure routes like the old silk route and the Trans-Siberian railroad link.
11.	There is no App for That: Intelligent solutions such as Siri and Cortana leveraging artificial intelligence are quelling our past hunger for apps on our connected devices. 2016 will see businesses increasingly adapt these platforms for B2C and B2B marketing purposes.
12.	Cyber Battle Good vs. Evil: Next year will see a major showdown between the global community of cyber criminals and a rapidly forming team of big business and governments. Crime has been focused on the financial services sector, where the prize is high, but as more industries become connected – such as healthcare – an attack is more likely. The good news is policymakers will draft new cyber security and data protections laws, with the US expected to lead in development of cyber laws and Europe on data protection.
13.	What’s my incentive? Consumers will accept incentives to purchase certain items or exhibit certain behaviours. Examples include paying consumers $500 per month to choose cheaper pharmacy options, rewarding consumers for using specific search engines, or entering account holders into a lottery based on how much money they save (in a bid to increase liquidity in banks).
14.	Online Marketplaces outpace Traditional Retail: Big data and mobile-based apps and platforms present myriad opportunities for marketplace deliveries and solutions. 2016 will see the growth of marketplace-as-a-service in more industries, such as logistics and healthcare, where traditional supplier networks once dominated.
15.	A Jobless Future? Hollowing out of the middle class as a result of mechanization will be a key topic for governments as they become concerned about the impact of cognitive technologies on our society. Focus on automation will initiate a polarizing shift in employment from the standpoint of job standards and wage distribution.

@_date: 2015-06-15 15:47:38
What they should be doing is offering on-ramp services for bitcoin. One should be able to walk into a brunch or use an ATM to convert fiat to bitcoin. Banks should be offering safekeeping and insurance of bitocin deposits for those who prefer centralized services. There will be many. They can extend their relevancy for a while this way. Yes, one can dream.
@_date: 2015-12-08 12:58:27
Is this a bad translation or something? 
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:29:49
My experience is different. When talking to people about bitcoin I find them receptive to the idea, but hesitant, or simply lacking motivation to give it a try. With the price down and no speculative fever the first world population needs time and bitcoin unique user cases to get on board. I think it's coming as the changetip, get gems, la zooz, fold app, Purse.io application gaining ground.

The equality lies at the basis of the religious dogma. Bitcoin helps people by giving all equal opportunity to participate in the market. I realize we are not near that ideal, but with bitcoin there is an unprecedented opportunity to bring it closer. BTW, I am not religious at all, but reading about the Pope in the news and his down-to-earth persona makes me think he would "get" bitcoin.

Fascinating it is, and rings true. My personal observation of passengers on a suburban commute kinda confirms it. People entering a nearly empty train often hesitate and keep walking through the car as if choosing the best seat, even though they are practically identical. But when only a few sets left, the choice is easy.
McYak recently scaled down their menu choices probably for the same reason.

I don't understand you point of too much time. Let your mom use some BTC now, ask her to open an account so she can buy her own later. 
Another point to think about is:
the reason it's still not super easy to get BTC is that it is a new tech and your are an early adopter. By the time everyone can get anywhere, the price will be very different from now.

The piece is bad, I agree. However, like in your example with Dorian, I seriously doubt acceptance of new tech is as age dependent as some might believe. I was at a dinner recently where people over 50 and even an 86 y.o lady were quite interested in btc and did some reading about it. 
It comes down to imagination, open-mindedness, IQ, past experiences, and type of education  more than the age in how people see bitcoin.

The fact that bitcoin value is based on speculation that its utility will increase is not new neither surprising. Most of the assets, think stock market, are valued on expectation of future returns. For bitcoin price to rise 100 fold all is required is for certain proportion of population to believe that it will be responsible for 1% of world trade. When bitcoin will actually be facilitating 1% of trade its speculative value will be much higher than 1% of world trade.

Don't forget the school kids who could have defended themselves ...with ?semiautomatic rifles, quick, start making smaller guns. 
Why people think guns=freedom is beyond me, especially here in btc community.
BTC is about economic freedom, community pulling resources together for a greater good of humanity.
 
To our american friends. What are you so afraid of that you think you need a gun for you, your wife, you kids? Government? 
You are actually sacrificing your freedom to live in a civilized world where people are not afraid to go to the movies without a gun for the fear that someone who is having a bad day decides to kill you or your loved one.
@_date: 2014-04-01 19:30:46
How about offering the government to take a concrete measure i.e., for BTC transactions up to ...say $10K per year no capital gain tax applies? 
This will allow BTC to continue to be used as currency, but gov still gets to collect tax on large capital movements.

Lets look at the facts. BitCoin is 5 years old. It's not worthless (or not without intrinsic value), it worth $630 on the open market, therefore backed by demand. People continue to invest in it. More vendors accept it. Development and improvements are ongoing. Non of it is a mirage. This we know.
Bubble? Sure we had bubbles, but it continues to go up. Real estate bubble burst, it went down, than it started to go up, because there is a demand for it, same with bitcoin.
I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, but what we know now is no mirage.

That was my line of thinking as well. 
Is there a way to track how "new" the BTC that's used for the purchases? In other words can we tell if the BTC used to buy ptoducts now on Overstock.com was bought (for fiat) recently or 6 months ago?

This example describes a random search followed by an opportunistic seizure of property.

On the discussion of the BTC being a Libertarian idea. 
While this might be true, the society generally swings from right to left, depending on where it is in history. The creation on Bitcoin nicely coincided with the 2008 crash, plus internet and increased mobility of people set the stage for something like Bitcoin to flourish. 
In my mind it was just a matter of time before digital currency takes over.

Purse.io works (and I am a one happy customer) because there are  billions of dollars of unused amazon gift cards. People get paid in amazon gift cards then exchange them for bitcoin at 10-20% loss.
When sites like Amazon or Alibaba decide to  accept bitcoin it will quickly become a de facto international currency. People will probably use their local currency pricing with bitcoin network used for transactions. At this point the word remittance will become obsolete, which will happen in the next 5-10 years.

"The taxation through a threat of violence" is repeated by libertarians ad nauseum.

Economic freedom as defined by the heritage.org hardly applies to the early US. "Economic freedom is the fundamental right of every human to control his or her own labor and property. In an economically free society, individuals are free to work, produce, consume, and invest in any way they please. In economically free societies, governments allow labor, capital, and goods to move freely, and refrain from coercion or constraint of liberty beyond the extent necessary to protect and maintain liberty itself."
Early United States. Who was it good for, the natives whose land was taken away and natural resources used to enrich a few or the slaves whose free labour was used build it? 


Here is interesting piece of information I found for you to consider:
"Adam Smith is considered the father of Capitalism.  He considered excessive Government  a threat to  free markets.  But he saw the bigger threat to free markets to be feudalism.  What is feudalism?  It's when the people who own the resources use those resources to prevent anyone from gaining enough resources to compete with them.   Smith observed that free markets are inherently unstable because power/wealth once concentrates in the hands of a few people, they use that power/wealth to stay on top.  The solution to feudalism (according to the guy who coined the phrase 'invisible hand') is **Government regulation and redistribution of wealth.**
**Government regulation to prevent collusion and externalities.  Redistribution of wealth to ensure that the non-wealthy could become educated and have the opportunity to compete with the wealthy."**
Also this quote by Churchill:
"Churchill said it (House of Commons, 11 November 1947)—but he was quoting an unknown predecessor. From Churchill by Himself, page 574:
Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. **Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.…**
I rest my case. 
While I don't agree with your positions, I appreciate the discussion.
Live long and prosper.

If I understand this correctly, currently, the 'road' is only serving passenger car traffic, and each vehicle is charged a fee to use the road. But the communities living along the road want to have busses on the road as well. The road owners fear that if buses transport more people, the number of vehicles on the road will decrease hence reducing their income. In fact, the busses will increase the movement amongst the people living along the road resulting in new economic opportunities with more traffic on the road and exponential income growth for the road owners, which they fail to see, for now.

Sorry, but your position is idiotic. 1 Btc that's worth less in fiat terms is still 1 Btc, but the point is its purchasing power is decreased and you can no longer pay rent, for example, if your coin is worth $800, while your rent is $1100.

I don't feel this is a right answer at all. This looks like a typical altcoin pump exploiting uncertainty surrounding bitcoin scaling issues. The only difference being which altcoin is being used. Previously Ether and Litecoin were the beneficiaries of money flowing out of bitcoin during a perceived crisis, today it's BCH.
This is not to say that any of these altcoins don't have characteristics that make them potentialy attractive for some investors. However, this rapid price increases are not related to the alts' technical characteristic, it's a pump and getting out at the top is the hard part if you are a BCH holder.

Judging by the price growth, many  have been buying for the last few years, also the quality of people, who invest into bitcoin and bitcoon-related business and the fact that it's been around since 2009 puts it into a category of investments worthy of serious consideration.

Have you seen a night time host ask people on the street who their vice-president was? Most didn't know. Average person cares mostly about their immediate needs. For those, whose money is relatively safe, bitcoin presents little interest, and whoever is iterested is bitcoin needs to have knowledge, tools and risk tolerance to use it. There're still very few of these people relative to the general population, but the number is growing.

I wish there was some sort of lottery for node hosts. If a host had one in a thousand chance to win 1 coin a day, for instance, it would be a great motivation to run full nodes.  Do you think big miners would go for something like that, reward a random node a day or a week? Or would it be against trustless philosophy of bitcoin since we would have to trust miners?

Wire transfers are not immediate and require a third party. Depending on a bank and country you are dealing with, it can be incredibly difficult. 
People using conventional remittance service will switch to bitcoin just like they switched from mailing letters to emailing, texting and using viber. It takes time to overcome technical barriers, learning curves and gain trust of the users.

There are still legal ways to buy btc in NY (coinsetter), the bitlicence made it more expensive, not the same as illegal.

Money must have utility such as store of value and ability to pay for goods and services. Bitcoin does that without a need for trusted third party. Before Satoshi it was thought impossible. 
Peer to peer transactions outside the traditional banking system opens new  possibilities such as avoiding currencies one cannot trust.

Putin spoke specifically about "electronic currency", not electronic payments. Peskov seemed to try to downplay Putin's apparent awareness of Bitcoin and his acknowledgment that despite the fact that it is not backed by anything it can be used for payment in some segments.

Conspiracy theories or not, there is an obvious perceived controversy that is worth discussing. Specifically, there are many positive developments such as rising number of transactions, remittance business seems to be growing (anecdotal evidence only), large VC investment in Bitcoin businesses spurring positive news coverage, to name a few while price continues to tank.

One of the reasons it's still not as easy as PayPal or Venmo is because it's decentralized. There's no single person or board who can decide and implement changes as they require consensus of the participants. This slows down the changes needed to improve functionality.

Michael Lewis is one of my favorite authors, can't help but think that he will publish a bitcoin book sooner or later.

They should get into bitcoin and offer buy and sell service for moderate amounts, it would be extremely beneficial to USPS  and the public.

Oh, the burden of intellect. Many can relate here, I am sure. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:17:13
Oh, I was wondering why i don't see him these days. So, he no longer  visits this sub?
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:33:47
He has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, but failed to provide irrefutable evidence. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 01:13:11
Absolutely, I've been thinking exactly the same. Hope they listen. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:58:24
Well, the press did not indicate he *was* Satoshi, they said he claimed to be. Wikileaks is sensationalizing the issue, just like the organization they are criticizing.

Not a bad report, great that Vitalik could say a few words in Russian, the fact that he is internationally recognized  cryptocurrency authority puts a positive spin on the whole idea.

Netflix is just one potential use for bitcoin, but as utility grows and people see that bitcoin can be used to buy things online, pay bills, etc. it will be very compelling to start using btc.

Would reiterate, Wright sounds like he has a mental health issue. Delusions of grandeur anyone?

@_date: 2016-10-27 17:10:29
In bitcoin we are building an alternative to the established world financial system, not just another service. If you think about it, it makes sense to take things slow and test each change to the protocol very carefully. We cannot afford oops moments a la Ethereum hack and hard fork, that's what the alt coins are for.

I find it strange that somebody who claims to have been using bitcoin since 2011 hasn't grasped the difference between the broadcasting and confirmation of bitcoin transactions.

@_date: 2016-05-03 00:04:52

@_date: 2016-05-16 17:20:50
Another point to bring home, when they ask about bitcoin facilitating terrorism/crime, is to emphasize the positive change it brings, specifically ease and efficiency of value movement for business and individuals and allowing so many new people to enter local and global economy, to name a few.

Really interesting development, the bitcoin tide appears to be hard to resist. Governments will realize that resisting bitcoin might be more more expensive then joining the revolution.
@_date: 2015-10-06 12:10:03
I don't think anyone was "giving some guy a bunch of money because he wanted to sell his coins, and they did so in order to keep the price propped up". 
Buyers bought because buyers buy.

People always complain about multibit and yet this wallet is frequently recommended on this sub. Just use Mycelium. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 21:59:23
If he is ok using a wallet like mycelium than it's easy to just download the app and start accepting btc. If he wants a proper payment processor, I hear bitpay is one of the widely used ones.

How is Bitcoin perceived in Russia among those who have heard about it? Considering even in the West with free access to information it is still largely an uphill battle to show people that it's a legitimate substitute to fiat.

What an idiocy. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 03:20:50
Bitcoin begins to undermine the dominance of USD as a reserve currency, could be a strategic move by the Chinese to help it along. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:29:11
You will get pragmatic responses here, but we understand your pain and sympathize. You will recover, tomorrow is another day, you still have your family and friends.

My point is the buyers bought because that was the price they were willing to pay at the time of bearwhale drama, not to "prop" up the bitcoin price. 
Hardly anyone believes their actions can influence the price trend direction. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 17:36:09

Excellent idea. Can't upvote enough. This is good for bitcoin and the environment.

It doesn't have to be a totally new idea, they might be developing a product that will be competing with coinbase or other established business.

Your parallel is absurd. Even in the developed world there are huge segments of population who prefer and use cash only. Bitcoin represents a huge psychological shift that makes it surprising it even  grows the way it does.

Theft of bitcoin from online wallets is not common, theft of fiat is probably much more prevalent. The fact that incidents of bitcoin theft are discussed here may make it appear like a wide spread occurrence. Sort of like hearing about airline crashes on TV make air travel look dangerous, while the amount of people dying in car crashes is much higher, but it's not covered in the news as much.

Nevertheless, it will help to migrate fiat and other established schemes such as points and air miles to the bitcoin blockchain, since it's the only blockchain that really matters.

Good for him. But at this point Bitcoin doesn't need celebrity endorsements. It's quite the opposite, people want to be associated with Bitcoin to show how progressive they are.

Bottom line is btc needs to grow to stimulate adoption. Purists will argue that using existing banking infrastructure is against bitcoin founding philosophy, but banking industry is not shy about using btc tech to seemingly improve their bottom line. 
Bitcoin cause will not suffer if general public finds it easier to use credit card-like service to help bridge the temporary gap between bitcoin and ability to perform to day shopping.

I think very few people invest in bitcoin because they understand its socioeconomic potential, but rather for speculation only. So it's great that bitcoin is attractive as a speculative tool. 
Another important point is that people deserve their leaders. We complain about government, but we are also painfully aware about general public's poor awareness of history, economics, law, etc. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:26:28
