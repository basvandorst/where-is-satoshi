would it be possible to invest in the company if you are neither a customer, nor an official "investor"?
maybe you should think about equity crowdfunding like [crowdcube.com]( does
@_date: 2016-08-07 09:07:00

which is good since (I assume) there's no surprise KYC when you want to cash out

We need to bump up their support tickets.

@_date: 2018-01-23 16:13:59
bank wires are already public so it doens't matter if they hand them over again, what I'm saying is they don't block transactions after you made them, do they?
for example when you want to cash out a big amount, bitstamp will block everything until you provide additional KYC information, on top of the verification that you've already done
on bitcoin.de, it's a p2p bank wire, so they can't block it, they could block the BTC, but then it is the other party that is blocked, not you

I believe banks have an account at their respective central banks, and here the German central bank charges banks 0.5% to hold the money, so it passes on this rate to their customers.
So the bank basically either deposits at the central bank and "earns" interest at -0.5%, or takes a loan from the central bank at -0.5%.

A meme is an idea or an art piece that spreads within a sub-culture and sometimes beyond. Memes are essential for creating new social constructs around the technology (hodl, honeybadger, vegeta over 9000, roller coaster &amp; welcome to f show, etc). Memes are kind of a social programming, an outer layer to Bitcoin’s code.

Most people are in it for the money and that's fine. Self-interest is built-in the game theory of Bitcoin. Adoption and price will go hand in hand. 
Two or three halvenings more and Bitcoin will be truly deflationary. Then the hyperbitcoinization process will be obvious to everybody (borrowing fiat to buy BTC).

If mining was a competitive market, miners would have tight margins like most businesses do, therefore they would need to sell most of their revenue to pay for wages, energy, hardware, rent and taxes. I can’t be certain of course but I assume their profit is an order of magnitude lower than their revenue.

It's not useless, it could even be good for society since we are better off now than we were in the past.
However at individual level, it is not in your best interest to have such inflation, so individual and collective interests don't align, there is a flaw in game theory. That's why when Bitcoin becomes truly deflationary, the flaw will be apparent, the theory of hyperbitcoinization says that money will move from one currency to another, with people taking loans to buy bitcoin because bitcoin appreciates faster than interest rates.

It could be good for the economy (arguably), but at individual level, your own interest does not align with it, as you would lose wealth. So the game theory behind it is incomplete.
So the capital flight will continue towards finite assets (real estate, Bitcoin) and the stock market, as it's already the case of course.

Why Bitcoin Matters More Than Blockchain
Brian Kelly , Contributor
I write about bitcoin and other digital currencies.
Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.
Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the Post Office and Amazon did to retail. Understandably those at the center of the financial system are concerned.
The banker’s mantra of “blockchain not bitcoin” has caught fire on Wall Street – everybody loves blockchain, they may not know what it is, but they love it!  Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, hates Bitcoin, but loves blockchain, Goldman Sachs CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, has embraced blockchain while he is warming to Bitcoin.  Admittedly, I used to suffer from the same love affair with blockchain.  As an early adopter of Bitcoin I still had feelings for the currency, but for a period of time I was infatuated with blockchain.
Perhaps I should begin with the journey that lead me to Bitcoin.  For more than two decades I was a part of  Jamie Dimon and Lloyd Blankfein's world of traditional finance.  I began my career as an equities trader and then spent most of the internet bubble trading merger arbitrage - for those old enough to remember the halcyon days of "Merger Monday" I was the guy placing bets on whether the deal would go through and who would be next.  After the internet bubble popped and in the throws of a recession, I started a brokerage firm that catered to mutual funds and other institutional investors.  My clients were the old guard of the financial world. We did well, but I didn't find it very exciting.
Then I began to trade ADR's (American Depository Receipts) - these stocks represented shares in foreign companies and traded on the NYSE and NASDAQ.  The trick with this type of trading was to watch the foreign currency markets for unusual moves - when currencies moved and the ADR's did not there was money to be made.  These markets were much more exciting than stodgy blue chip stocks.  After a few years playing around in the currency markets I made the leap to global macro investing.
As a global macro investor I could make big bets on macro-economic trends in the global financial markets.  I became quite adept at reading central bankers' cryptic messages...with this insight I would place bets on the world's currencies markets twenty-four hours a day.  For a financial markets nerd like me this was exhilarating  - the interplay between central bank policy, geopolitics and financial markets was a playground.  Then I stumbled onto Bitcoin.
Truth be told, I was a doubter at first - I even publicly declared it wouldn't work.
When I first dipped my toe into Bitcoin, I was timid  - I didn't really want my friends in the traditional finance world thinking I had gone crazy.  However the more I researched, the more I realized I was wrong to dismiss Bitcoin.  Bitcoin was a game changer - it was going to challenge everything I knew about financial markets.
I was hooked. But I still couldn't bring myself to talk about Bitcoin publicly.
Blockchain was easier to talk about – it made me appear to be on the cutting edge and allowed me to avoid the dirty looks and the hushed whispers that followed any mention of Bitcoin.  When I talked about blockchain, friends and colleagues would listen intently and engage me with questions about this wondrous new technology.  However, once I mentioned Bitcoin they would pull me aside and ask how I was feeling, not so subtly questioning my mental clarity.
Blockchain made me feel good, but there was something missing; there was something hollow about blockchain without Bitcoin. I went back and re-examined my first encounter with Bitcoin in an attempt to discover where we had gone wrong.
My journey backward started with the problem of clarity, there was not a simple definition of Bitcoin. Defining Bitcoin as a decentralized crypto-currency, elicited angered responses at worst and glazed eyes at best.  Bitcoin needed an elevator pitch – the one sentence that every entrepreneur develops to describe their business in anticipation of meeting the perfect investor while riding in the elevator.
Bitcoin is a lot of things to a lot of people, but to me it’s easiest to think of it as software. Bitcoin is a software program that allows people to securely transfer money over the internet without a bank. It does this by replacing the function of a bank with a network of computers running the software that verifies and transfers the money.  These computers, known as miners, maintain a global ledger of transactions that is used to validate, verify and transfer money.
Prior to Bitcoin, the process for maintaining the transaction ledger remained effectively unchanged since the Medici developed double entry accounting in the 14th century.  The Medici process of accounting required banks (conveniently owned by the Medici family) to maintain a ledger of debits and credits that was held at the bank.  The modern financial system is simply a network of these ledgers held at each bank.
Bitcoin takes the global ledger of transactions out of the control of the banking system and distributes it onto every computer that is connected to the Bitcoin network.  Financials behemoths no longer control the system, with Bitcoin the users of the financial system are in control.
If I told you that I developed a mobile app that was able to use computers to modernize the 600-year-old process for transferring value, you might think I was crazy or you might ask how to invest.  Bitcoin is this app, and the disruption of the 600-year-old double entry accounting system is why I have called Bitcoin one of the most important innovations in the history of finance.
Bitcoin accomplishes this disruption not just with blockchain technology but also with the global decentralized currency also called Bitcoin.  The currency "Bitcoin" is the incentive for anyone in the world to run the software that changes the way the financial system works.  Banks love blockchain because they get to continue to maintain the ledger of transactions by running the software on their-own computers.  But Bitcoin creates competition for the banks in the form of anyone with a computer and an internet connection.

You know the lowest point, it's zero.
If a stock goes to zero, it means the company is bankrupt, it's game over.
If BTC goes to zero, there's a problem but it's not over, devs will figure it out and it can only bounce from there.

I think what it means is that most altcoins would be rendered useless, all 'altcoining' would occur inside bitcoin as anyone would be able to create an altcoin, and seperate blockchain/mining would not be needed. 
The network effect would make bitcoin even more dominant compared to the other altcoins.

I don't get that, why would the initial price not start at $0 like other altcoins, and then go from there. In your scenario, you assume there will be buyers at a high price at first, why is that?
@_date: 2016-05-29 12:21:00
It's a bit hard to understand the causes and effects in your message, 
uncertainty about halvening -&gt; stop buying new ASIC -&gt; drop in expenses -&gt; need to lower profit (due to taxes?) -&gt; selling less BTC and holding the rest -&gt; less BTC on the market -&gt; rise in price BTC
Is it really obvious that miners buy new gear all the time? I don't know, just asking.

@_date: 2019-05-15 08:08:08
The amount is so small (assuming you're in the US) that you could just buy that amount and hodl, that would be less risky and you wouldn't pay interests
And no, it's not a dumb strategy, it's called leverage, it's just more risky than buying  and hodling. However if you don't have 10k in the bank then yes it's a pretty dumb strategy.

I hope cellphones will become so powerful that you will be able to run a full node on them, as well as connect to the network by wifi/bluetooth mesh network.
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:55:46
you're assuming they only accept the inflationary coin, so it's the forced-to case
I am assuming you have the right to get payed in deflationary or inflationary coin. And the right to buy stuff and pay taxes with any of them. Then in those conditions, you have no reason to ever hold/use the inflationary coin.
That's a paradigm shift that not many people can project themselves in.
Right now Bitcoin is assumed to be inflationary, but after the next 2 or 3 halvenings, the consensus will be that there is more bitcoin lost yearly than mined.

The value of Bitcoin comes from combining social and technological mechanisms, which is what creates real decentralisation. The value is in the technology AND in the people who make the network. The fork threats? A feature, not a bug.
Enterprise blockchains only have the technology without the social aspect. They bring little additional value compared to existing solutions. In some cases, they are worse than existing solutions.

The Foundation has been launched by Gavin, the head developer. Developers regulate the blockchain. When new forks are made when there is a bug, Gavin and the other developers are cancelling transactions, they are "transmitting" money. They are the de-facto regulators of Bitcoin because the community follow them.
The Foundation is the lighting rod above Gavin, it makes itself official, so it becomes the target.

only the UK Euro accounts are part of SEPA, not the GPB accounts which everybody has.
and it only says that the price will be the same as domestic Euro transfers, so in the UK, Euro domestic transfer could be expensive since nobody has a Euro account there

Yeah but that day you lost 12K$ worth of Bitcoin, you can't declare anything but  dollars (assuming you're from the US) so it makes sense that you convert it to USD. Ask a real accountant or the tax people directly.

I see, the script is encoded, interesting, thanks
@_date: 2013-01-28 10:12:41
if you get rich hoarding, you will rather spend those bitcoins in the bitcoin economy. if you convert them to $€£ it will raise flags and you will have to pay taxes on the profit you made buying/selling bitcoins
of course, that doesn't work for everything, like buying a house for example..
@_date: 2013-06-08 17:14:50
I thought this was common knowledge

you are right, you can do SEPA transfers from a GPB account apparently (SEPA transfers are always in Euro)
the fact that Barclays charges £15 for SEPA transfers means that it charges £15 for all Euro transfers even those within the UK which is outrageous considering the prices within the Eurozone (usually free)

Forking the blockchain means cancelling the transactions made by the attacker, it is the same as regulating the currency. One could argue that nobody has to follow the "official" client developers and one can run the old versions, but in my opinion, there is always a consensus and the most used client and its developers become the de-facto regulators, especially since they own the original domain name and run the official website, which opens a whole can of worms IMO.
I know Bitcoin developpers have forked before to cancel transactions and so far the US government has not gone after them.
