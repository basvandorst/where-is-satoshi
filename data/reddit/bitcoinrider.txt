I will answer your question more directly later but i want you to bookmark 
for later reference. i will be working on maintaining a wiki for merchants to stay up to date
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:17:50
improve the layout :-D i am also guilty of this often times but this template look is just horrible
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:03:01
actually you are the only one complaining so far. if you look at some of the other submissions mine got at least a few upvotes...
i let the up or down votes decide what people want. not the opinion of one person
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:33:03
speaking for myself i definitely want to keep the coins under my control and diversify the risk...
i dont want to keep coins on paper.. too much hassle for me and i want to use multiple wallets
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:04:12
there is no project id since it wasnt saved
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:06:42
thats pretty smart thinking... taxing land...
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:12:50
its a solution but its definitely not the most economic in terms of resources...
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:19:15
the reason we decided for bitcoin is for lack of chargebacks with Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:32:16
okay.. watched the video.. its explained.. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:01:11
right in the middle of it
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:20:32
dont be a dick.. i can understand trezor perfectly... 
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:56:21
whats your url?
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:59:36
thats a great bet... i think 2015 :-) not before
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:30:59
lol.. i love the question :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:03:47
danieltravolto is my skype
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:46:09
it has a maximum cap of course...  i think anything beyond 10 billion is risky unless governments communicate a clear position 
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:28:56
fantastic video but the music fucked it up
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:55:20
the dollar has very little to do with their influence.. it has to do with their huge consumer demand within the country... almost everybody needs the U.S. for import export.. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:37:06
i forgot about that too.. just downloaded google auth and did it
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:57:53
possible.. anyway its good to know about company policy... that small trade is not so important
@_date: 2013-10-09 13:16:53
i disagree.. anonymity and the possibility of massive increase in value... top reasons
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:49:49
there is one thing that people forget... at this stage of bitcoin it didnt meet its basic intrinsic value yet because its not widely adopted.
meaning the price could go to $150,000 per btc before it settles
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:48:58
"The safest way to store your Bitcoins." i disagree obviously now... my bitcoins are on my computer and on a backup.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:48:10
interesting info... i havent had much luck with okcupid... 
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:41:23
the real global market deals in trillions.
as to bitcoin being undervalued in case it finds widespread adoption. yes you are right
@_date: 2013-10-23 08:57:03
so you mean like an alibaba for bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:32:42
i am running coincrunch.com just started yesterday and bitcoinlocate.com also launching mailbtc.com soon. you can add my skype: danieltravolto if you want. i will blog you once you are up :-D
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:05:16
well thats what i was asking for .. instead of shitty downvoting people should state their opinions instead. i agree in that way that the reddit system is broken. a lot of people are disgruntled by that.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:21:22
thats if the state has enough money left to enforce this :-D
@_date: 2013-03-31 21:45:59
as for problem 2 . there are enough ways to solve this technically down the road
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:55:26
i am kind of thinking the same thing
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:07:59
nobody knows exactly... but as long as people are willing to buy its all good
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:49:51
lol true :-D
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:40:26
thats also true
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:17:18
same here
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:47:41
thats also a great idea :-)
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:32:08
this explains all your options:
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:18:16
lol... :-D true
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:52:33
that assumes that the encryption of your wallet is not enough?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:20:08
thats what i will be doing... i am just reshuffling to buy more on dips like these...
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:05:50
thats not such a bad idea... one thing that i was thinking of as well is a bitcoin insurance against losing money.. but that could be easily tricked
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:19:22
julian.. great comment. thank you :-)
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:16:01
there is no bitcoin insurance. that is true. bitcoin is still in its infancy.. worldwide ATMs are really needed
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:09:00
yeah... bill gates foundation would be really kicking if he burned his money... you are an idiot... but it doesnt matter anyway... life is an illusion... 
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:48:40
smart.. any smart trader would do the same
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:46:44
i did as well.. and the simple answer is liquidity... a lot of big investors even have trouble doing stock transactions in not very liquid companies.
and even if they did buy... that wouldnt make them more powerful because there is no way to print more of it
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:17:18
yeah go sell to me ! :-D if you think this is parabolic wait until 100 million people try to get 500k bitcoins
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:16:13
its encryption not encrypition,
registered not registred
 :-)
"they was nothing troublesome." is also no english sentence :-D
@_date: 2013-03-31 09:29:56
working on it 
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:39:41
assuming they were really dumb use this:
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:06:17
thats a smart way to think :-)
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:43:33
enable the 2 factor auth on bitcoin.de going to do it myself right now
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:23:51
i think its actually pretty good... the more simple it looks the better
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:25:04
i will try to keep a track of all new ones here:
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:35:55
yes. thats true... i hope i get it down... some people just have an eye for these things
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:26:16
i wouldnt be surprised if big boys used tiny orders to push this up ...then trigger some selling and are now loading up big time
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:25:04
i didn't say that... but people who have no money at the end of the month are not interested in bitcoin. i talked to a lot of people about this
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:21:38
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:35:01
bitcoin-24.com polish exchange. works perfect
 german exchange. kinda slow to get transactions done but works reliably
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:34:56
lol.. i think you make more holding on to your bitcoin for now
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:14:09
bitcoin.de  works europe wide
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:46:10
thats really bad advertising for bitcoinstarter
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:10:07
lol "maximum profit to the insiders.." there are no insiders
@_date: 2013-03-25 08:04:44
there is none... the blog reads that he intends to do it.. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:07:40
7% is a lot...
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:20:07
how does the current one sound to you 
"Receive unforgettable dating offers"
much simpler and makes it available to both guys &amp; girls
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:07:42
100% agree... i consider this a dip... not even a correction or crash.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:23:32
lol.. dont be pissed if it is up there within a few days and you forgot to buy back :-D
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:14:58
thx... i will do some research and add them :-)
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:30:19
no wonder you like it :-D
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:46:06
you load the card online trading bitcoins for dollars and then you can spend them
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:09:11
yeah i know... will update the blog layout in the next days... tried to get everything online as fast as possible :-D thx for the info though
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:37:04
nasdaq and NYSE together are like $20 trillion or something.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:03:37
danieltravolto is my skype
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:29:26
thats what i was saying you retard.. i dont and i dont need to :-D
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:13:11
enjoy your bitcoins.. ignore the price :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:30:10
i agree actually
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:44:26
oh i just answered but misread it. well that can truly be a problem. but its the name of the game for anything... the average person should not trade in it. what a lot of people doing right now is as if they opened a bank account with their local bank and started buying and selling their dollars. instead they should just be happy they have dollars and use them for regular business
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:24:23
i agree.. every comparison is nonsense :-D
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:24:24
its more than it seems... because SR was adding lots of liquidity... so if lets say 80% of bitcoins is frozen in some non-used accounts. than 20% is left from the liquid stack that changes hands.. if you suddenly remove 1% from 20% it makes up 5% already
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:12:32
when you put it in percentage terms and scale it correctly then the chart looks completely different... i could try something in photoshop for you :-)
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:35:55
one of the fundamental problems with something so entirely new people compare their bitcoins constantly to other currencies... most normal people don't think of the $$ fluctuating against some african inflated currency for example... you could go nuts doing the same thing. a bitcoin is a bitcoin and its limited. i collect them :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:24:55
makes sense
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:58:27
this is really sick.. some people downvote faster than they can read the blog... really sick
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:59:00
cavirtex is already in the list :-) yes.. lets work together.
my skype is: danieltravolto
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:01:14
bitcoin defends itself basically... you vote with your money and if you are a merchant you vote with adding bitcoin as a payment option
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:29:16
i send you a PM ... when and where is the Muinch meetup?
do you have a twitter link for yourself?
@_date: 2013-11-13 13:33:18
very cool idea ... it would be a good way to get rid of all those coins in piggy banks :-D
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:02:43
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:09:43
lol.... you know what your mistake was... talking serious when everybody else was talking bullshit...
thats like trying to talk about computer games to a chick in a bar
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:47:39
250k is not much for investing in cool ideas :-D better to keep it for personal fun pleasure... i have a really really good idea but i need a front end and back end developer rather than money :-D
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:28:47
yes a contract with ID card... thats enough 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:06:38
its about communication not about what they are doing...
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:59:34
i know what you did there :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:15:23
yeah its true... platforms are just being build for institutional trading
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:21:36
true.. fair distribution is important
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:57:15
mike adams is full time idiot
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:30:24
lol....  not really
@_date: 2013-10-23 08:58:37
cause sending a cup of something all across the world is not cheap. unless you do importing and then you have to deal with import tariffs etc.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:00:55
i didnt think about that... i just thought the waste of processing power by bitcoin is immense
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:53:13
i have done 14 years of stock trading... my advice is to buy and hold.. i have done everything from daytrading to swingtrading to longterm.
bitcoin has too much upside potential to be wasting time on trading it i think and it frees you to do more fun things in life :-D
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:33:45
FIY ... bitcoin is already a real currency
@_date: 2013-11-13 13:43:33
no ... havent had that... seems like an API exploit
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:00:18
i agree... this is still early adoption.. people think we are in mature phase already
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:15:36
funny :-D
@_date: 2013-03-24 21:55:10
good idea :-D thinking about that too
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:56:03
no... i studied marketing and international marketing... + an mba with marketing.. you basically make a bell curve on user adoption &amp; through experience you figure out those numbers.. similar as to the 80/20 principle. when you have a statistic that seems to work almost all the time or very close to it you start to use it to predict market adoption. so its pretty valid and accurate most of the time. the 34% is an assumed rate of adoption by the early majority through experience collected in the past. you need innovators and early adopters so as to move into the early majority. innovators and early adopters are always only very few no matter what new tech comes out.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:55:12
no one understands the exact economics and supply demand here...
one thing is for sure... new money is constantly being added to the system so the upside is still there at least for a few days...
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:58:34
if he owes more money than he has because of a technical error ... he has some tough times ahead
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:12:40
yes be very very very worried.. sarcasm :-D
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:20:22
time to get that lambo with the bear in it :-D
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:15:43
mt gox insider trading lol... mods are buying :-D
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:14:05
lol.. thats a funny story.. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:44:42
disagree.. 
the U.S. forces other countries to adopt their regulations...
The FinCEN director testified on this just yesterday
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:54:06
right now most people dont know how to handle their computer security enough.. so i tell everyone about bitcoin but i dont give it to them. too unsecure
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:03:18
yes... get one
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:38:03
they do.. but i am having problems with saving the cookie part. i might just store the options in the database if i cant figure out whats wrong with the cookie setting.
it used to work up until yesterday and since today i am trying to solve it. 
everything else on the site works though. i should have the search options finished today.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:27:46
they are just a part of a necessary ecosystem. get used to it.. if there were no market makers most people would need days to buy stocks. same goes with bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:06:00
no... it takes away the freedom to choose what is best for you... 
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:04:04
your link is marked red on mywot... either get that fixed or i am not using your site :-D
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:32:20
scroll down:
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:58:14
i am working on a website for buying &amp; selling domains for bitcoins :-D
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:03:53
my image was 200x200 px gif
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:40:47
bitcoin.de works very well but in germany you will raise red flags for Dubai pakistan link
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:49:32
loll... funny :-D 
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:52:34
and they are a direct banking institution which is also pretty cool. their stock increased 30% already just 2 weeks after supporting bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:27:53
congrats.. awesome purchase
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:48:08
yesterday someone posted a reddit of a twitter account screenshot of one of your moderators (apparently) to have sold just before the crash. the screenshot was legit. personally, not sure if it was your employee.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:51:30
lol :-D yeah whatever... come down from your horse soldier and walk in the mud! :-D
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:34:42
lol... if you sell bitcoin on anything other than its technological advantages you are fucked.. thats like giving stock tips... i stopped doing that at some point
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:06:32
thats what i wanted to do.. i didnt think the "dip" would come this week... need to load up my exchange account with $$ for the next correction... excellent move
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:39:32
software will win :-) software rules over corporations :-) i remember when netscape mozilla made its way into companies and the IT departments had to adopt it then :-D it became de facto standard
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:11:40
bitcoin.de circumvents this problem because you transfer the money directly to peoples accounts rather than to the exchange.
just as risky 
@_date: 2013-05-17 06:49:11
yes..but i had like 50 transactions all buying and no problem with any of them
@_date: 2013-04-01 05:33:06
really cool idea
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:49:54
god i hate his voice.. cannot listen to it :-D and its boring as hell
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:27:30
yes.. its a bot and it was done to artificially raise the price as they went through as market orders not limit orders
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:04:37
lol... simple solution.. use only platforms with a trust rating.. thats what ebay is there for... i am launching  today
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:10:44
that would make sense to use peer and litecoin to diversify then... it will keep changing anyway i guess but it would be good to focus on those in the beginning
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:39:29
thats if you compare it to stocks and options... for bitcoin thats fairly normal
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:08:50
reddit is starting to be shit the more i use it... lots of idiots here
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:14:12
hey.. i am interested.
i was thinking of creating a bitcoin ad network too...
PHP/MYSQL guy...
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:18:20
valid points there.. i am thinking more along the lines of kiva.org ... that seems to work really well for 3rd world countries.
bitcoin can only make that even better.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:42:05
ebay will ban it... i am confident on that move (just like they kept increasing sellers fees)
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:38:25
yeah.. i remember telling a guy juniper networks was a bad investment because it wasn't fundamentally sound at the time... he listened to me and then thought i was responsible for his decision :-D i learned to ignore people.. most people are really dumb :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:35:45
yeah.. definitely the wrong place for you if you don't want to fight with old school alphas... 
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:08:08
to compare a currency which you cannot manipulate to the derivatives market is nonsense. you can compare it to online transactions maybe
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:35:48
rule  ... don't have friends with drug problems or the like
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:44:13
sounds plausible..  I will add you to  once your first issue is out
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:43:07
not just U.S. people on this subreddit ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:40:38
are employees daytrading ahead of any events at Mt Gox?
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:43:18
you need to set your IMG meta tags ....
if you don't set them the spiders grab the first large image
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:09:13
yeah people misunderstand it ..  i had a friend over explaining it to her and she immediately compared it to another currency and said dont exaggerate. then i started thinking about it and realized i am maybe underestimating that even. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:11:31
i was just surfing on that... will get right on it :-) thx
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:35:51
how come it was approved so fast?
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:46:49
we would welcome you.. the local brewery and grill restaurant is also accepting Bitcoins soon
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:26:00
just added it to 
:-)) thx for posting
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:55:33
you would fail every IQ test out there :-D
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:23:05
thx :-)
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:14:40
stop socializing with bitcoin millionaires... keep it to yourself and spend your coins wisely.. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:54:28
i think the only problem could be liquidity... there would have to be a percentage of new coins being created throughout the year. kind of like fixed inflation.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:28:20
i would still prefer a paper wallet
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:42:08
yes i read it... thx
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:41:48
i think trust issues and similarly will be resolved in the future... just like early cryptographers predicted. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:40:50
where did you sell it? on bitmit?
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:45:57
that sounds much more humane :-D i totally agree with you...
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:35:13
thx for the tip...
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:38:20
i pointed that out in my blogpost .. altcoins are trading not merchant coins... seems like nobody reads it...
you are absolutely right though
@_date: 2013-04-07 06:28:51
bank money is insured... completely stupid comparison
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:45:21
20 billion by end of 2013 realistic
100 billion by end of 2014
and if nothing is in its way 1 trillion end of 2015
7 billion people. if 1 million of those try to get $10,000 worth of bitcoin you do the math
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:04:38
thats what i have mostly in my mind right now
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:31:49
sounds like you got a good plan. i wish you lots of luck with it. i dont know anything about mining except that people are saying its not worth it unless you have an ASIC
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:52:03
i am working on 
will add auctions soon
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:17:11
well it depends how you define the versus... if you show it in full percentages without skewing the chart Bitcoin looks like a hurricane and the dollar like a pond.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:22:58
awesome.. nice name
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:37:48
no wall... some obvious reasons:
* more and more people living on this planet.
* more stuff being created all the time which people think is valuable
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:17:40
and since its superdivisible you could just keep on trading anyway
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:35:59
so an advanced trading platform... makes sense... :-) 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:38:15
i was thinking of doing that with paypal.. selling my coins for paypal at twice the price :-D
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:47:24
too much new money entering to go that low..but its clear that there is enough time to pick a bottom
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:37:40
one thing i would add... cash out something now (10-20%) 
and enjoy the money... spend it on things you really love.
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:31:03
thats a good question. i will do some research
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:29:08
i would suggest against a webwallet if i were you... could become major bad publicity if it gets broken.. just stick to hardware wallet
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:59:18
 also accepts bitcoin... since about a week ago
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:51:23
i do think that a lot of people are still extremely skeptical.. they dont trust the whole thing...
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:02:54
thats dumbshit.. worldcom, enron... just to name a few... you don't know anything about whats really going on ...
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:48:25
thats not a bad idea...   market makers or big buyers in stocks put in large orders below the current price so others get more confident. it works... so why not :-D it works on forums and exchanges equally well
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:31:29
do i need to repost it so it appears there?
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:05:44
i like your thinking :-D
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:26:48
nice site.. the last submit after adding project info doesnt work
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:41:53
if you have debt then definitely pay that off... if you can buy a house then do that as well... i thought you are selling because you cannot take it emotionally
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:21:40
because the server is seized and the bitcoins held as evidence. in case they are on a different server .. they will just die a slow death there :-D
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:39:33
1% bitpay commission is to high. but i will look into that
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:52:55
everybody has different reasons... 
how about international transfer of funds without undue waiting times.
say somebody in USA or europe sends money back to their family in asia or africa
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:22:54
your real you is in your awareness.. not in what is in your mind and not even your body... dont know if you are spiritual but that helps me ... ALL the time 
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:07:28
there sound is okay... NIN was better... but still a very cool promotion
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:39:21
that would upset people even more
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:18:32
yeah that makes sense... but some girls are also interested in making offers so i am thinking about removing the sole focus on guys paying.
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:41:29
bitcoin ATMs will arrive shortly.. that would be better then :-)
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:07:31
1700 is a lot to get a feel :-)
i just bought $50 of BTC to get a feel. took me 15 minutes to make the transaction, buy the coin and wire the coins out to my wallet. there system is flawless
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:13:37
too soon... i will post when its up
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:16:04
that money is entering of course as well... offering bitcoin business to crooks.. that would be huge business :-D
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:20:41
product perspective.. i learned about implementation yesterday
@_date: 2013-03-31 11:36:47
haha.. i think it makes it even less anonymous because you are funneling it through one server who basically has all your info
@_date: 2013-10-23 10:32:12
yeah some of my introduction sucks.. i will have to rewrite it.. thx though for the feedback.
2008: Bitcoin project registered at SourceForge.net
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:58:15
yes exactly.. i bought bitcoin today and my bank told me no transactions until the 2nd of april
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:43:03
depends entirely how many new accounts are loaded with $$$ if they didnt approve new accounts then it will be mostly selling
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:18:36
thats me :-D
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:10:12
you have around 500 million people in the eurozone alone. all scared shitless of what could happen to their money in their bank accounts
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:28:11
nice observation... ! thx for that
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:14:39
2 here
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:50:54
well you fixed something for me ... so that was good :-D
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:31:33
might have been because i didnt add a youtube video... i just added an image.. still it didnt work
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:56:40
if people are wondering where the price will go.
watch the european bond market. if bonds become more expensive people will look for places like bitcoins to put it. i am sure wealthy individuals are starting to look into it to put at least part of their portfolios into bitcoins just to do some risk hedging
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:51:36
maybe you are one :-D
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:08:14
using gmail... what did he expect? shows that drugs really fuck up your brain :-D
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:40:07
aha.. so you dont rape people because you respect their wishes.. you are a sick bastard :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:26:58
thats too soon... you will lose your shirt
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:51:29
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooollllllllllllll :-)
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:47:22
pure genius
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:40:21
i agree... not with the flush part but with shaking off unexperienced traders
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:00:05
yes but its leaving specific countries... 
imagine this escalates even further
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:36:59
do it differently.. pretend that you didnt see your account and come back  2 years later... this is not the time to sell... 
learn to be a man.. get rid of your addiction and start meditating if nothing else works :-D
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:51:21
maybe you are even responsible for it you di**head*
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:19:22
the correlation of the bitcoins strength when U.S. govt was about to default is no coincidence though. the rest is coincidence
@_date: 2013-10-09 05:17:22
true :-)
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:44:32
i added your charity to  :-)
and the news as well.. congratulations :-D
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:43:11
and bitcoin.de offers two factor auth... btw
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:01:38
rt news is the only news tv worth watching
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:26:17
i am wondering the same thing.. upvote
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:33:57
lol.. nobody would use them.. why accept a fee when you can do it directly without fee
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:46:42
silkroad is probably already full of serious criminals aside from small scale drug usage
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:01:31
the question is if its encrypted on their site... so the login might be 2 passwords but if someone gets their database and starts to try to hack the hashes
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:30:58
yeah.. good move!
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:16:18
hey.. would love if you post this on  ... i am programming on it right now.. should be either ready a bit later or tommorrow for first posts
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:53:30
i cannot find the link on it.. hopefully the guy who posted the screenshot will watch this thread. i didnt use the word mod. he did. he seemed to know what he was talking about though. he talked to someone working for mt gox apparently and then he pulled up that guys twitter and saw he bragged about the trade
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:11:15
lets hope so :-D
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:36:10
yes :-) which is bad for betting everything on bitcoin but its good for the economy
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:38:04
there is nothing to say... watch when crypto-currencies take over all currency trading and online transactions. i give it 2 years max.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:00:08
another old school business man not understanding bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:52:15
he got scared after being listed on this anonymous assassination market thing
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:49:18
lol.. you really thought a new currency changes the way people behave? its about bitcoin not about the people... ignore the price, ignore the people.. use your bitcoins as a medium of exchange
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:51:20
excellent! good edit!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:06:44
its absolutely incredible.. thank you
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:48:38
lol... wait, wait wait... if he is clear what he wants and he is happy he doesnt need to wait for a specific price... i am not emotionally invested at all... i misunderstood his original post. any large position should be sold slowly
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:55:38
i was just googling some more charities .. seems there are some lists out there already
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:37:12
nice idea!
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:08:56
daytrader learning curve.. good you learned from it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:19:22
lol.. i am still the one who is truely laughing :-D i know how empty your life is as a currency trader... you dont need to convince me :-D
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:11:01
thats a very good question. i think you have to take the realtime price.. because if you dont people will wonder about it maybe.. or you could just take yesterdays closing price.. thats what most systems use
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:31:50
you are the only one i recognize as being constantly in a bad mood :-D 
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:53:24
mhh... maybe i will come up with an idea to send bitcoin without actually having to send bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:27:09
thats what i am guessing too...
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:39:03
basically the way it works is that you set the countries and when you click on the search you only see those countries. i did it because i am mostly interested in girls only coming from specific countries
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:00:07
i know some very relatively poor pople on the internet in 3rd world countries that have over 300k+ followers on facebook. when they post something they receive 5,000 to 10,000 visitors easily daily. that traffic is worth something. but the way the infrastructure is handled they cannot make money off of this and take it out and spend it easily. that would be one tiny example of how bitcoin would work when they have local ATMs. there are many other examples i could come up with
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:57:36
loll.. you just got hacked probably :-D
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:30:35
u got it right
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:21:01
yeah.. anybody who understands the real value of money doesnt give tips like that
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:32:59
clear assholes... the game is finished.. banks are done with
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:02:41
shady customer in 2011 
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:21:28
me personally... just one strategy...
call it jamaica strategy... checka ma style! :-D
buy bitcoin.. lie on the beach for as long as you can until you run out of food...
then starve for a couple more years... when people start running to me and say "hey.. weren't you one of the guys who was in bitcoin early on" thats when i start to buy stuff for my bitcoin :-D
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:15:54
privacy for the people is my super major concern there. most people with money or hot girls want a lot of privacy. especially since i advertise on facebook friend networks. so i don't want people to recognize their friends there unless they are interested in it themselves. thx for your input anyway.. the header is updated. i really enjoy reddit for getting feedback
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:20:11
we set the pricing depending on availability &amp; demand ... you can mail us info if you like
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:54:23
oh yeah the link is 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:30:18
lol.. you figured that all out today :-D you are fast :-D
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:58:41
i dont believe that theory .. if that was true there would be so much more new money coming in we would be above $100 already
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:03:35
perfect :-D
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:07:09
and encrypt your wallet.dat and store it offline
@_date: 2013-11-13 13:30:34
just added bitstamp.net too
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:32:42
thats why i am pushing it.. i just want the name to be out there... 
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:04:07
"CBP intercepted a package... part of routine border search" sounds to me like they open all mails going in... stasi.. eastern germany tactics :-) i for one don't care about silk-road and its future but its interesting to see how the U.S. operates after 9/11 &amp; with NSA
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:25:49
if you were looking out for yourself you wouldnt have invested in bitcoin at all since you put in more than you can actually afford... if you need 200 bucks or whatever desperately now then you shouldnt be in bitcoin at all
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:50:59
lol.. we dont need satoshi to calm anyone...
a P2P trading exchange by someone would be nice though :-D
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:50:36
that is exactly what i have been thinking when i started with bitcoin
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:11:09
unless you want to use that application to do swingtrading of bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:44:49
yeah... thats true
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:06:23
unless its build into the OS
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:35:08
guys.. nice service but i would superstrongly advise you to change the name ... amazon is not going to be happy with that :-)
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:21:52
if you think of your bitcoin as a bitcoin and not as a something that is worth a dollar than you get closer to understanding what bitcoin is i think
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:30:01
i think that will come soon. cavirtex seems to be the closest to that so far as i understand it
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:40:22
 
criminal index switzerland 
 germany... so i am right... 
the only reason you think its down because more people are put in jail in the U.S.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:33:25
bring it on :-D
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:35:17
fee is some euro + 2% i think..
they ask to transfer in USD when i read it correctly.
and ask them.. not us :-D
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:00:29
good you mentioned btctrip.. i have to add it to  :-D
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:38:35
theoretically question... what makes you not want to move to another country where when you cash out you don't pay anything?
if you can convince those people to give you citizenship? :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:45
yes.. but who cares... within a few weeks we are back up to the highs
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:51:20
their account seems to be frozen for withdrawal only..
so with enough time i think everybody will get their money
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:58:16
yes... better create a new sub or go to a bitcoin classifieds site
@_date: 2013-03-31 10:40:42
makes sense
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:09:29
i am moving to bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:25:41
i understand...so basically as a longterm holder you need to plan ahead that this lag will occur again and take advantage of it
@_date: 2013-10-23 10:52:58
i added this here:
feel free to edit your wikis :-)
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:50:12
that sounds like a fun idea... i could make up fortunes by other users writing them even and people could vote on the fortune :-D
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:52:47
we should start the bitcoin graveyard
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:27:56
i am taking a look... i moved Virtex to the "Bitcoin Exchange" page of CoinCrunch... i have to confirm their debit card for myself first..
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:47:36
i would love if you could help me right that wiki on  :-)
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:39:46
very true... but judging from the way he managed the operations i don't think he had an accomplice he entrusted with keys
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:34:34
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:50:34
add yourself to  too :-)
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:28:56
well with Bitcoin the other countries will multiply their peasants ;-)
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:10:40
not sure what it is.. maybe it needs more boldness
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:57:13
you know .. i am not a proponent of crime at all but i remember when an Italian family had those gold bars stashed in their car and drove through the Swiss border control and got stopped and the gold confiscated. It makes me think of Bitcoin and i realize that the currency is here to stay no matter what governments do.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:41:09
so true
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:36:57
you got a pretty cool graph software :-D
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:11:15
i completely agree. this was the same reason why i started coincrunch.com
journalists are herd people.. if they hear another news outlet covering something they don't want to miss the boat. thats why i also started 
but its all very new :-)
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:05:27
when i clicked on my projects i didnt see anything
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:27:02
yes.. agree.. i got about 1.5% now in altcoins.. just to watch the space.. big fund managers do the same just to keep a track of whats performing... ;-)
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:24:38
i just signed up there yesterday... seems to work well... 
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:08:49
i agree.. even if they take just about 1 trillion... this would blast into the stratosphere like crazy
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:25:22
lol.. check netbook prices... you can get them for $200...  or just setup a virtual machine
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:14:48
we counted much more than just that... i never said anywhere that its just based on that.
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:22:46
i read that somewhere.. seems extremely plausible
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:59:48
i am really creating an alternate version of reddit.. this downvoting is annoying as hell... if you dont comment and just downvote you are an idiot. so many people are upset about the senseless downvoting on reddit and i am myself included now.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:37:49
absolutely... and it has a network effect. so every node that joins, be it a merchant, trader, investor or just normal account holder, will give it over proportionally more value. i think if it were a social network it would be maybe even as fast growing as facebook.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:51:52
bill is an idiot... rambling so much nonsense
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:41:18
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:12:13
i had the same situation... i think the best way would be to find someone local to trade it with you who accepts paypal who has a high trust worthiness.. thats why i created bitcoinlocate.com but its far from being usable... i was busy the last days with other stuff.. need to get it running fully ASAP 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:57:29
wir werden Bitcoin annehmen.. erstmal muss der rest stehen :-) 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:05:13
and that assumes that all 21 million are available for purchase.
by that time only maybe 3 million will be available
@_date: 2013-03-24 15:35:06
i like the system but honestly.. i use bitcoin because i want to hold bitcoin... but maybe there is an application for this that i dont see yet
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:33:26
we slipped above it :-D
@_date: 2013-03-30 06:06:15
customer requested if he could pay with bitcoin
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:20:18
copy &amp; paste :-D wallet.dat
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:37:53
just added two more:
 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:15:44
i will do it differently... i just get out the country and start a new life... :-D everything is an illusion... so get over it :-D
get the stuff you really really love... not luxury... 
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:05:51
yeah.. i own the 95% ... rookie
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:55:19
very true :-D i like your thinking...
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:16:51
well one obvious problem with bitcoin is not so much bitcoin itself as it has no traction yet.. instead a lot of money leaving USA,Germany, Spain, UK etc. because they don't have exchanges themselves
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:11:24
makes sense.. thx for the explanation. upvoted
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:45:08
lol :-D nubee
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:15:29
i am pretty sure its a profit making tactic... all i am saying is there are enough people pretty satisfied with coinbase.. its somewhat unfortunate that when the price goes up so much people don't get their delivered coins
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:00:39
cities with most millionaires.. so richest cities in the world kind of
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:02:02
lol... no because they can only talk about the crash... nothing else... 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:16:52
tiny bit of advice... sell enough BTC ... you dont want to be home without a job and some worthless coins :-D
btw, about friendship.... go on a spiritual path first. then you realize the need for friends is gone and you can be even happier then with friends
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:07:10
well thats definitely possible... i thought the ride was quiet fun... i think i am detaching myself from bitcoin for now and come back a year later :-D
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:08:51
i am assuming that people will see the advantages in bitcoin and start to leave the old currencies every more quickly.
i agree.. we need more infrastructure.
@_date: 2013-10-23 09:31:31
it would get its BTC from selling the solar power on your roof ! :-D obvious lol
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:42:21
then good luck ':-D nice idea for sure... especially from reputable developers
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:45:31
you are off... bitcoin will be massively used for that. watch when prostitutes etc. take bitcoin
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:43:44
cause i like cookies ... :-D
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:44:11
if they were trying to get rich of it there would be much more selling pressure when it started dropping. most people hold it like you would buy some jewelry and put it in a safe. asset protection
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:36:38
encryption is the answer to all.. make encryption on personal computers widespread... 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:57:35
yeah.. in that regard max keiser is a genius
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:29:25
yes. just make sure you encrypt it from within the bitcoin software with a password
@_date: 2013-03-30 10:46:51
some of the code within the Satoshi Bitcoin code leads to a programmer of SecondLife related to linden dollars
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:00:39
and that assumes that all 21m are available for purchase.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:18:38
i think 10% is not good enough... unless you are selling those 10% when it bounces back.. i think 40-50% is a better limit order
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:13:29
thats like worrying about the price of icecream going up and down after you bought it :-D
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:25:50
i meant like every $10,000
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:25:24
i remember one kid selling me 2 bitcoins a while ago said he lost some dollars because he was trying to trade them... bought high sold low trying to time the market... well he got fed up with it ... i am the happy holder of those 2 coins :-D
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:00:15
i run coincrunch.com and also telling everyone personally about it..  i am not trying to sell it .. just repeating the message :-D
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:42:07
yes encrypted and cloud storaged
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:22:16
that would be like monopoly money that you earned while playing with your friends be taxed... thats what i think at least for now until a vast majority of employers pay with bitcoin.. then its different for the IRS i think
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:30:40
from what i understand you have to trade your coins into CAD first and then you can withdraw them
@_date: 2013-08-28 05:13:30
definitely..google do it! :-D
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:03:43
it was mentioned a few times here... there is enough cloud services and robust ones to scale perfectly with much less cost. i am surprised.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:06:24
i dont think it will ever be worthless... the legitimacy for crypto-currency remains.. and one platform build for BTC can easily switch to another cryptocoin based on similar protocol
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:07:16
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:59:19
i am not sure that would work... most modern concepts involve some sort of flat fee tax. especially since guaranteed basic income is something that will be implemented sooner or later and that needs to be financed somehow
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:24:17
nice try to get bidders for the domain :-D
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:23:56
thats sounds like a good idea...
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:11:18
so midnight yesterday
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:19:49
i am not an american... i have totally different reasoning for my post.. but since you can only think inside the box you cannot understand what i am talking about.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:59:24
its to their own disadvantage ... they must realize that once there is a good alternative... people do remember...
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:03:52
trust... there will be soon as a system for trust laid on top of bitcoin software. point of sale will take care of that. enough people working on it already..  i am a also on a project like this
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:26:08
lol.. you know what i do? i laugh at you guys because while i am enjoying my coins .. you are sitting behind a desk all day :-D
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:32:53
yeah.. alexa.com told me the same thing
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:27:37
by the way.. there is a massive difference between being right because its the law and being morally right... my morals say you supported a humble business by making a purchase of something that nobody knows how it will turn out... now a day later you want to back out of it although they committed that money already to planning and production.
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:38:41
bitcoin.de SEPA transactions. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:51:26
true :-D
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:49:04
the advice i heard the most is never keep bitcoins somewhere else than your computer or encrypted on a cloud drive
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:34:46
interesting you say that.. i googled this yesterday and there is an escrow service already.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:02:01
i am a hoarder too actually... :-D i thought about tipping.. but didnt see the point of tipping some comments :-D
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:29:37
my order was up 70% after buy.. no problem for me.. happen twice... delivered on time. i bought bitcoins in the round numbers no decimals... also both transactions above 4 figures.
@_date: 2013-10-16 09:13:58
anybody doing large transactions converting bitcoins to cash is stupid as fuck...
just wait it out until bitcoins are everywhere
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:07:57
the inflation of the dollar to debt... its an ever increasing bubble
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:09:50
in my opinion move them to an offline wallet
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:22:46
prices are not dependent on liquidity.. they are dependent on demand and supply.. if there is demand and low supply price goes up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:02:33
yes.. awesome time.. will be back to 180 in no time

@_date: 2013-04-10 19:11:50
wait a little bit more... never catch a falling knife...
it drops because people are afraid...
i am waiting for the right moment to purchase more.. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:46:32
will look into it
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:14:32
thats normal trading on every exchange in the world.. especially long weekends like you say
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:23:08
excellent move.. i think next time we can place limits orders even lower.. seems like there is ample room for volatility
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:37:38
I explained it here. seems a good service:
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:54:40
theoretically you could buy a server in brazil... load it up with a wallet and send it there.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:09:46
i am working on a platform like this ... just started yesterday
@_date: 2013-04-07 06:32:55
stocks bear tremendous risk which is dependent on one or two individuals running the company. as in dilution of shares or other self-interests of the corporation...bitcoin in itself doesnt have selfinterest
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:59:18
i have known some of the best investors get fucked over by fraud in public companies.. i take BTC over shady CEOs anytime
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:51:58
lol.. got a big laugh :-D
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:39:55
i am on that.. just bought  to start a blog

drug addicts holding off drug purchases because the value might go up... new way to stop addiction :-D lol
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:38:54
the price is artificial being held low so someone can make a large buy order... complete 100% market manipulation. we are back over 150 in no time... somebody is having a great time right now...  i dont have money on an exchange right now otherwise i would buy like crazy
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:32:22
ah okay :-)

time to read Antoine de Saint-Exupery "little prince" and dump people who cannot see with their heart :-D
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:33:26
me too :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:01:47
lol. i love this one :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:20:33
that's totally normal... it was just the wrong topic for these guys.. they are already settled in life.. they probably drive porsche caymans and are having a pretty nice life... most of them are probably pretty unhappy within themselves but their egos are too big to realize it. 
your job in this situation is just ignore it and be focused on your present moment. the more you strategize about it the worse it gets... take it like a man basically. so being mad is a reaction you dont need
it happened to me as well by the way... trying to sell gold to someone who already has enough of it is pointless
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:01:18
good it doesnt say i sold my daughter for BTC :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:35:14
thats not how you sell big stakes.. its enough to look at the individual orders... its tiny traders tripping over each other
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:46:05
i always wondered about that part.. i am not good enough with reading code but is it possible someone is actually mining in the background and others not being aware of it? like a parallel coin system built into the software? what i am asking is .. is there part of the software which is kind of encrypted that people might not understand or is it already fully understood?
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:04:34
there will be transactions that are anonymous and then there will be transactions based on user credentials.. it will be two worlds
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:51:36
not impressive sorry... :-D i was expecting a startrek like control room
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:46:11
lol then your marriage wasnt worth it...
if your woman can't stand behind your mistakes she is not worth it.
forget the money... good times will come
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:38:31
but then again.. i love bitcoins more than the tiny profit :-D
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:09:52

@_date: 2013-04-03 18:04:33
its not strictly a for profit idea that i have :-D i will try both blockchain and bitpay APIs
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:06:21
i'd rather make my own mistakes then let an exchange handle that for me
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:41:28
i agree actually... i am just curious if i can find out... being able to research these things is one thing i am extremely good at... i surprised many people what i could find out over my life so far :-D
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:08:10
too early stage. i list only working things on CoinCrunch
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:31:11
just fix the submit.. its really annoying to have to add all the text and stuff again :-D
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:53:43
what a shitty statement...
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:40:24
lol... kiddo :-D nice mindgames... not working
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:15:24
the last 5 years the dollar index has had a much lower beta than bitcoin
the dollar index moved up or down 10-15% 
while bitcoin moved from 0.04951 to 216.78
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:21:54
that would be a nice simple application and useful for many.. i am not trading in bitcoin just holding it but it would be good with an email notifier... a smartphone app would be even better for android so that when the price falls below a certain level i know to buy more
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:20:55
i agree $1 billion seems very high since there is no equal dollars that were traded in for to buy bitcoins... but i think thats missing the point. a currency just like a stock is worth what people are willing to trade it for... so i think if people decide tommorrow it should have the worth of all gold then it will reach that price point and people will happily use their bitcoins at that current price. i think its necessary to take it out of old economic thinking
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:08:46
lol... yeah whatever :-D
pure market manipulation going on... 
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:15:29
i might give him then the option to keep his identity for BTC :-D lol... i dont think that is legal though ... no seriously.. i will keep a lid on it until i figure out what to do with  that info... i think i got a lead though...
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:09:17
i just found out about them today.. i am waiting for the bank verification.. also pushing my ref link in other places.
i will purchase 1 or 2 coins.. play with it a bit and then go big if it seems good.. the guy behind bitcoin.de is a successful serial german entrepreneur and also in the VC/finance field
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:41:52
lol.... ddos happens everywhere.. not just here.
i never said i wanted unregulated chaos... i am surprised firewalls cant deal with this on a tech level

telegraph is a sensationalist newspaper,,, but in all honesty.. this is possible anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:53:14
i am glad somebody sees that as well.. i am surprised by all the negativity of people here in the bitcoin subreddit. i think its a positive development and i think it will create a better world.
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:10:45
mhh.. i still dont get it... if i wanted to do that i dont get bitcoin at all... additionally bitcoins are going to go up :-D
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:38:33
with every uptick the amount you can make becomes less.. thats kind of obvious.. i would wait for a major correction. i was thinking of buying more as well but there are just too many unknowns... so instead i sold all my stocks and go short on them if North Korea attacks... thats right now the better bet of those two.. bitcoin has massive upside potential but i think its not going to go there as fast as it has been the last days
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:53:32
why? just send it to different wallets in different countries. nobody can trace it
@_date: 2013-10-08 10:47:46
bait... nothing really there... 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:20:23
i think its pretty shitty that people downvoted before even reading what i had to write.. that makes reddit a very shitty platform.
but yes you are right
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:44:01
percentage of people known to be in that specific group when a new technology comes along.
so 34% of all people are known to be in the early majority
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:49:37
your assumption is that a currency is really safe.. my assumption is where all currencies go bust. you mention the yen... you know about japanese debt right? all currencies will go bust... standing on another spot of a sinking ship doesnt make the ship not sink... its all a question of time horizon.. but the current system is broken. thats why everybody should switch. you can still go into gold and you can still go into CHF.. but in the end nobody will want to trade them anymore... bitcoin has many more advantages than just its current market value
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:59:16
thats why i started blogging about it.. because there will be a huge laymans audience

with 25 you can make a lot of financial mistakes... one of the REALLY worst is spending it on luxury.. house is a good idea but get someone to help you who you trust. your dad maybe etc. i would put it in lendingclub.com you get +6% there
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:03:09
i am not saying its good or bad.. i am saying its also connected to criminals
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:48:11
it took me 2 days
in the end the entire process of buying and selling is slower than other exchanges but it seems safer. i did maybe 30 transactions in total and all went through
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:19:43

@_date: 2013-04-03 16:51:42
food of course.. i agree
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:12:45
can you share your thoughts as to why?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:50:27
yes... it was truly "epic" to be so lousy

i think the most important part about it is solid POS systems that integrate all payment systems seemingly. i am trying to maintain an up to date list. I am consulting a restaurant on this as well
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:35:52
i am too lazy to read it but i am supportive of such an idea
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:09:40
actually it doesn't say anything... 
but i am hugely bullish on bitcoin :-D
the dollar and the bitcoin are incomparable because bitcoin has to find its value still while the dollar already found its value against many assets &amp; currencies
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:21:13
ebay is heavily betting on paypal .. i heard it said more than once by insiders. if they take paypal out of the equation they will have a hard time. not saying it will bankrupt them. just saying they will be in decline for some time
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:50:24
i am curious where did you put the ad?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:45:49
well he is young... thats kind of normal...
one golden rule if you made a lot and you feel good about it is to take 50% of the table
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:52:55
i got a bit of bitcoin in 2011 when a customer requested it.. i didnt open my wallet for 2 years. luckily i keep all my computers. never sell them :-D
i dont think we can really know what is driving the price. But one thing is for sure.. the app downloads in spain is solid evidence of a young tech crowd adopting the idea.. i just sold the idea to my parents and they asked me to buy bitcoin as well. my dad will open a wallet and i will send some of my bitcoin to him.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:06:39
that acts more like deflation... and its only good for some time.. until liquity is gone
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:05:56
if thats true its a major conflict of interest
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:16:30
i am using multiple tactics here... one i learned from the crocodile dundee movies :-D
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:13:02
that makes perfect sense.. thank you for clarifying this :-) i know some c++ but i am not in the know enough to understand most of the parts in the program
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:50:43
definitely ddos attack. no question about it. even bitcoin.de is down
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:02:15
compare that to the idiotic guy who posted about a cyprus ATM which doesnt even exist. people just get upvoted for fake headlines... congratulations
@_date: 2013-03-24 21:57:08
especially revealing was the use of GMX and GMT 0000 +0100 timezones.. the rest i found out i will post soon.

then they would have to combat NSA! :-D very criminal stuff going on there :-D
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:55:23
if there is a spread they can make money off most certainly.. its a very simple calculation... if there are enough suckers who will buy or sell bitcoin on a big markup then there will be market makers to give that liquidity.

its funny how you guys know nothing about trading... this is profit taking from the $100 lows.. some people made fucking 100% in a couple of hours.. this is not a storm
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:13:45
reminds me of when mark zuckerberg extrapolated the sharing of content on facebook as if people would multiply by the hour
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:42:26
will you get a decent PR guy? your public posts are lousy.. there is a sense of that you dont take your responsibility seriously from what you publicly say
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:29:35
okay.. will check it out.. thx a lot :-D
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:26:25
its never to late.. think ahead 10 years. if it replaces all major currencies by the end of 2014 we are in the trillions... right now the market cap is 1 billion

@_date: 2013-04-11 16:00:33

@_date: 2013-04-10 21:44:14
pretty smart in 2 weeks :-D
@_date: 2013-10-14 06:40:11
Same thing...i wasnt aware... :-)

@_date: 2013-03-27 10:38:51
actually bitcoin.de seems to offer IBAN transactions worldwide and i see some NL and ES transactions
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:30:26
ja natürlich ... moment.. kommt gleich
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:54:32
at least my nick is way cooler than yours you frustrated chump :-)
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:38:02
i am also using bitcoin.de ..  i am surprised this happened... i think your computer is infected... contact bitcoin.de immediately their support is fantastic.
btw, i keep telling people not to keep their coins on any exchange.. transfer it out immediately
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:07:49
that doesnt look serious at all.. cannot list it sorry
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:23:54
i was doing PUA 4 years ago and decided against it. i am totally against your viewpoint.. sorry. i did lots of spiritual work on myself and i rather trust my inner energies than superficial ego desire. i am going to upvote though just for being helpful :-D
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:25:06
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:44:19
couldnt they just steal the bitcoins themselves? that would make great business :-D
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:50:23
i would run a completely new wallet and new system for every few thousand USD worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:07
yes... and i have seen this the last days... classic market manipulation
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:51:31
i like it :-D
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:32:21
a quarterly publication on something that moves as rapidly as bitcoin seems not enough to bring it to the masses :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:30:42
lol true
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:29:20
why not just a smartphone leather thingy :-D
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:31:32
lol.. i speak 5 languages and raised in 3... so i confuse myself quiet often :-D i even think in different languages .. and sometimes people think i am strange because i have a word in my mind in a different language and i pause for several seconds in the middle of a sentence trying to translate it in my head :-D i am about to learn more languages. cause i can learn them really quickly but i never got around to just looking at other languages :-D
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:28:15
worst video ever
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:46:20
yes.. just got that 5 minutes ago
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:49:55
i also started with a list... :-)
lets share data :-)
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:57:57
i agree.. they would spend money they dont have for one cryptocurrency after the next... until there is a fork of a bitcoin thats bulletproof.. kicking the can down the road wouldnt make sense 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:40:14
i love that one :-D
@_date: 2013-11-13 13:24:38
i just got into it.. i think i will get into some heavy reading and coding now :-) Bitcoin reignited my interest :-)
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:30:29
this for the first time explains the rational behind what most smart investors are doing right now with bitcoin.
its an extremely smart gambling risk
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:21:24
i read up on it and see if i can find a solution :-D i am pretty good in that ;-) 
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:49:09
there will be bitcoin banks taking care of everything.. the average person doesnt need to understand it
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:59:56
work definitely is not the way to make huge sums of cash nowadays
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:35:53
peer to peer not person to person :-D
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:40:55
very true.. which increases the likelyhood they won't ever be sold.. maybe its the best thing that ever happened to him.. he will have duplicates and when he comes out of jail he will be one of the richest people in the world :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:43:41
the candlestick is not a real confirmation of a reversal yet. its possible though
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:19:40
i think it will happen faster than you think
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:26:09
great to hear.. i checked out the site twice but didnt get into it yet.. its too soon.. i use lendingclub.com though.. so i mightget into btcjam.com to at some later time. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:18:10
too bad it cannot be used for scientific discovery :-D
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:56:48
never.. not even on IPOs.... because here people just sit on their treasure chest which just gets bigger by itself.. whereas people doing IPOs.. worked insanely hard for years to get there
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:35:45
imagine i got a domain like  get my point
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:20:15
would welcome any help... more than criticism :-)
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:13:21
lol.. and you are saying that while all other exchanges go belly up... just wait for mt gox to do the same
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:10:52
looks like i need to improve my design skills a lot :-D
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:47:48
bitcoin-24.com.. better than bitcoin.de...
but both work
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:35:13
i don't think there is legal basis to just convert them into cash. any precedent?
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:28:46
just after reading the title i was looking forward to the comments to this clown :-D
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:11:12
i have thought about this a lot. the problem is you lose anonymity mostly... but i have an idea about that
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:04:34
armory is nice but still in beta as far as i understand.. i am waiting when they are finished.
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:03:13

@_date: 2013-03-24 14:06:10
hey.. a lot of people misunderstand the site... its not really for golddiggers and i know some people there personally who also dont see it that way.
but thx for pointing out the error.. i am fixing it right away.
some people love the concept others hate it. the ones who hate it have a prejudice without understanding what the basic idea behind it is. most classic dating websites have the problem that the best women get bombarded with offers. here it just weeds out the men who can financially take care of a woman and most women really want that. i know many
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:14:34
so agree
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:28:30
$30 for a significant amount of bitcoin... harddrive recovery professionals dont start below $1000 per incident.. but i believe in the reddit community that you will find someone... if not... up your price 
@_date: 2013-03-31 09:37:54
hey.. i am working on  will offer that kind of feature as well... will probably build it into budu.com as well. just needs some time.
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:31:33
i don't know which world you live in but its already at + $2 billion market cap... and survived the SR takedown.. see you at $10 billion... 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:05:01
i really like bitcoin-24.com transaction was really fast for money in and bitcoins out
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:08:01
they probably cannot login the normal way but they can see your data aside from your password i am pretty sure.
if they lose the database then who knows. only they do. i think its best to have it on your own computer if its significant amount of BTC
