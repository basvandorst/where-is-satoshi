Yet. The last several months have seen a huge increase in crypto on-ramps. If and when the next bull run starts watch out when those FOMO thrusters kick in

5k to 19k in a couple months right before that - what's your point? The people in on the scam managed to raise the market cap by a few hundred billion and pull the rug out? And this is hardly the first time people have tried to manipulate the market. It will be even tougher in the future.

Wrong and misleading. You know nothing of what went down during the election.

I'm confused. Is this basically saying he lied, he ain't Satoshi, but also pay 50% of the btc you claim to have as Satoshi? Something's fucked here...

I see what you mean but coinbase has never censored any of my transactions, I don't need permission for regular transfers, and of course it's still borderless - wallets don't have a physical location, I could access my coinbase from anywhere and anything I transferred out could be accessed anywhere. 
The whole permisionless, censorship resistance thing just does not come into play for most people, and just because Coinbase could conceivably do those things is not enough of a deterrent. Many people will take those tradeoffs without a second thought.

I was able to easily receive money in the wallet, but I keep getting a "fee estimation failed" error when I try to send money, no matter the amount - ideas?

I'm not too well versed on the specifics of the NN news but couldn't it allow ISP's to fuck with exchanges, their websites, and their ability to serve their customers in timely and reliable fashion? Could they throttle exchanges ability to process transactions?

Neo: Are you trying to tell me some day I can cash out for tons of $$?
Morpheus: No Neo, I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready - you won't have to.

Lee has many segments refuting this "argument". Open your mind a little, hear what people have to say and make decisions based on merit, not "I heard someone say RT is state propaganda so I'm gonna stick my fingers in my ears because there's an RT logo in the corner."
Lee says it well himself in this video "The corporatocracy doesn't have any logical or convincing arguments about what we're saying - so they just attack where we're saying it."
And all the people brushing off anything with an RT logo have played right into this narrow minded ignorance.
