They seized his laptop when it was open and unencrypted. The laptop had his private keys.
You could memorize a wallet seed or even a private key if you were dedicated enough and worried about a seizure. Then bury an encrypted USB drive as a backup.

Sure, rubber hose cryptography. But the point is it’s unprovable if you’ve given everything you know. 
For example if you were under pressure you could give up information for another wallet with less funds. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:52:48
Have you tried recovering any of the data?
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:32:19
I thought we were originally talking about Ross - his criminal proceeds and whether they are easily seized. 
Chinese miners are a different story.

Great post, solid words for everyone to hear. Curious your issues with ETH?
@_date: 2015-12-23 23:37:48
Awesome, with the changing banking privacy laws there, Bitcoin is ideal. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:30:51
Are there any mobile wallets that support coinjoin or any form of mixing?
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:29:06
I agree the extra 20 percent to uber is worth it for safety, but the market will have a place for people that don't agree that value is worth it. 
Or solutions may exist for drivers creating the account on the dApp to link with some sort of API with a good quality background check service at the cost of the driver. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 07:28:25
Cool idea! 
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:43:28
Yeah maidsafe looks promising. The more options in the space the better IMO.
@_date: 2015-06-26 04:59:42
Interesting concept - I would be worried about a ponzi scenario if not opting for the delivery of physical gold option.
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:56:38
Good point. The diamond market is also heavily manipulated but still exposed in ETFs
@_date: 2015-06-26 05:06:18
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:36:10
No the diamond market is only exposed in ETFs, there’s not a diamond ETF I am aware of 
@_date: 2015-12-04 18:42:45
I imagine that someone could create a dApp using Ethereum to essentially copy uber/lyfts system for matching drivers with passengers and essentially cutting out uber's cut of the fare.
Of course this would remove the value added by uber performing background checks and vehicle inspections.

The thing was all the stuff he "stole" was all public domain research believe it or not, no IP content. JSTOR was simply a gatekeeper charging for access. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:41:41
Awesome thanks for posting!
@_date: 2016-03-21 18:14:25
Yep, he launched a measure to split California into 6 states
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:01:33
No worries :)
@_date: 2016-01-31 18:59:18
Seems correlated with the price. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:18:25
He resisted the current system by building on the idea that information/knowledge should be free flowing and not centralized by authorities. 
He killed himself after being retained in solitary confinement and then facing potentially years in prison. This was a result of his resistance. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 07:24:08
Congrats on the release. Looks like a cool project!
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:22:28
I would check it out for sure. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 00:45:47
Yes please. If you can curate the most interesting posts on Chinese forums and translate them for a post weekly here I would gladly tip.
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:38:12
Lol I don't know the extent that Aaron spoke core devs or wrote on the subject if that's what you're looking for, but you have to keep in mind how far back this is. Before a lot of us even heard the term Bitcoin. 
I think a lot of his ideas and work are complimentary to why we think Bitcoin is a good idea and that is why I posted it here. Apologies for any offense. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 07:48:42
The speaker, [Charlie Cooper]( goes on to hypothize that bitcoin as a currency isn't suitable for financial transactions because it's not scalable or suitable for the complexity of wallstreet - he doesn't state any reasoning behind this.
And if bitcoin isn't suitable then how can the blockchain be?
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:13:16
He was relevant to the Bitcoin community. 
Here is one of his old blog posts I remember reading years ago: 
@_date: 2016-06-30 00:49:45
What about oculus/vr and their other investments? 
@_date: 2017-01-23 21:03:32
They would state that the asset is inherently used for crime. Sure my bag of pot is private property in my eyes, but in the eyes of the law that doesn't matter and I can't sell it or buy it according to federal law. 
They would pass a new law making the buying or sale of specifically any "crypto-currency" illegal and would drive it underground just like the NY bitlicense has done for traders in that state. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:34:58
Is anyone in your group a u.s citizen? If so, set up a coinbase, or circle account :) 
Thanks for your work! 
@_date: 2017-01-20 06:42:25
coinbase processed your first 1,000,000 for free as well, not sure if they still do. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:01:19
I know, I'm a huge supporter of Bitcoin as I hold the majority of my saving in BTC. 
I agree that banning it would be impossible to enforce on many fronts, but moving an arbitrary file, and transferring something of value on the blockchain can be seen any very different lights by a corrupt government. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:55:23
Estonia e-residency will allow you to open an account there, compare the tax rates between the UK and there, could be favorable :)
@_date: 2016-12-24 17:08:43
Thanks, yeah I understand what the market cap is and how it's calculated. My question was more: why is market cap a more important metric than price/btc, when it's based off of price/btc? In what way is it "better" as OP stated?
@_date: 2016-11-30 13:10:16
Thanks! Is there anyway to check volume on large cities rather than countries?
@_date: 2016-12-26 22:31:46
Off topic, but is there a good GUI for coinjoins at the moment or is it all terminal based?
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:58:13
Can you please explain the differences in comparing the two for analytics; honestly curious?
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:54:34
Just curious how do you find demand for different areas on lbc?
Edit: sales volume I guess I should say
@_date: 2019-08-26 18:31:16
That's where development comes in though right? Making wallets easier to use and restore, the option of using fingerprints or biometrics in place of passwords.
Essentially things need to be made idiot proof in order for wide spread adoption to occur. Some intermediary crypto holding companies may play a role, but I think development can also come a long way to stream line things for those that want to control their own private keys.
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:08:29
Payment processors require confirmation before converting BTC to fiat for the merchant.
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:41:12
Can these cards be used at an atm?
Edit: oops they are virtual 
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:44:57
Yep literally just tried to get a card from them and tried anx. Both aren't working in the states.
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:01:53
If only it was available in the states.

Good points. I guess it depends on how a user goes about generating the random words - are they truly random. 
I am attending the talk and will post on the subreddit any other information the speaker provides.

Not sure why you got downvoted, I love bitwallet
@_date: 2015-07-31 05:38:37
True, I didn't consider that. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:25:19
That would an awesome podcast. Perhaps suggest it on his board; I'm sure she would be interested to get support for the appeal. And he knows of the case after speaking with Alex winter.
@_date: 2015-07-19 01:37:11
What if Adblock was unnecessary if microtransactions could fund a media site rather than ad revenue? Obviously this would be in the future when Bitcoin could be more mainstream, just brainstorming.
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:05:18
Yeah the article said people were using Afrikaans and still brute forced. Given words were from a poem.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:31:51
I'm worried about trying to withdraw them if the same thing happens. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:17:57
Easy to counterfeit yes, but they also verify with the patient registry and cross reference it with your id.
If you had an image of someone's drivers license in the area and were able to put them on the patient database somehow I suppose you could pull off stealing the drone and product. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 06:02:18
It's the only video I could find from the event. I figured some information on the subject is better than none. 
If someone does know where to find the full interview please share.

A security researcher has showed the ability to crack brain wallets - he is speaking this year at Defcon. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 00:01:51
Will this effect localbitcoins traders? 
@_date: 2016-02-27 01:45:29
Test trading locally first to see if there is a high demand. If you have, then I would recommend a lamassu.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:38:29
Awesome idea, I'll do some searching 
@_date: 2015-07-19 01:38:56
Can't content creators on YouTube set their channel's profile picture to a QR code. This would allow them to update it.

Anybody remember how much they made on their indiegogo campaign + Bitcoin donations? Kind of messed up they would drop the project after everyone pitched in to support them.

He should post the BTC address the guy was asking the funds to be sent to.
