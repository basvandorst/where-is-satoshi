I usually buy on coinbase where can I buy now??
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:22:38
What did coinbase do? I saw something about insider trading 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:39:36
How do they know if the money im taking out is short or long term? 
Let's say I've been buying for over a year but like every month and then I send it to different wallets and move it around etc
Then when I sell I don't really know if that amount is from this year or the year before 
How do I know how much I'm supposed to pay on it?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:55:52
Oh wow. I know they have rules against that inside the company but I don't see how they'd enforce those rules on their employees since they could anonymously buy at other exchanges anticipating the rise

How is not letting him use PayPal suppressing speech or censoring him? If McDonald’s doesn’t let you eat there anymore is it censorship?

Don't watch CNN, I can still confirm that he is a monumental fool

How can I sell my BCH so that I can get more BTC? 
I had it in breadwallet over August first and now I transferred to keepkey but I think the BCH might still be in breadwallet then?
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:21:48
If I'm jailbroken is it not safe to use breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:39:01
damn it asks for the last digits of your ssn nvm
@_date: 2016-12-28 06:24:49
and then he goes on to say its the same as a credit card lmao
@_date: 2017-07-04 23:16:41
i already have hardware wallets like laptops as cold storage i just want one for the connivence and size 
Edit: and do you like keepkey more or trezor? I'm stuck between the two 
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:40:19
Since my hardware wallet isn't coming in until it's too late, where should I move my coins to? I'd use a phone wallet but it's jailbroken and paper wallets seem a little complicated 
@_date: 2017-07-04 23:05:27
where is the correlation? just cause I have more money doesn't mean I want to spend more 
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:27:57
I've been tryna get a trezor for months but they've been out of stock unless if I pay like 20$ more smh 
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:41:02
What makes you like trezor the best over the others, such as Keepkey?
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:20:40
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:08:59
How does it having more coins make it a scam?
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:43:20
How do you like it so far and does it support watch only wallets like can you see your balance without actually using the device?
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:47:15
What lol, which is uglier to you? They both look clean to me 
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:14:31
I see, you make a good point about buying a new one every few years. 
Do you have one? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:26:55
I heard Keepkey is a similar wallet to you guys, do they support this as well?
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:15:04
So you need to have it connected to know the balance? damn I wonder if any of the other wallets tell you on the device 
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:34:10
Are you 12 years old 
@_date: 2017-06-09 09:37:33
Im not really sure which one I should support 
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:56:02
oh they use the exact same code? so they'll probably add this in next time?
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:40:09
What makes trezor better than a keepkey?
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:58:27
Oh I saw it when I was on this subreddit looking for which wallet to get and it seemed similar to a Trezor I think. I'm not sure if I can put links in this sub but the site is keepkey .com
I'm stuck between the two right now 
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:14:48
is there iPhone support?
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:42:35
Also, does anyone know when Keepkey should be back in stock?
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:26:52
lol really?
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:17:37
I did through the search before making this post but I wanted more opinions and answers to the questions 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:17:58
