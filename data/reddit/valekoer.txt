Why can’t you just help gramps and make an account for him, or just buy it with your account on any exchange and transfer to a hardware wallet that could be kept at any banks safety deposit box?

You’re thinking about it and probably will do it eventually. Buy it and maybe you’ll see your investment go into minuses for a week or month at some point and then it’ll go back up and further.

I doubt it, they are comparing every comment to some analogy.
The thorough explanation above got shortened to a lizards tail by them.
This either isn’t serious or they are trying to teach bitcoin to third graders.

But that’s bitcoin, why not just own actual bitcoin if he trusts bitcoin? That’s how this specific asset just is intended to work and be stored.

It hurts when it goes up because you didn’t get more when it was low

I mean coinbase is great and all and probably the best option in Europe but if you’ll be putting in 5 dollars every time and the flat fee starts at 99 then you’re losing a lot compared to when you’d put in let’s say 20 dollars every time.

Pyramids have someone on the top. Bitcoin doesn’t and banks do.

The most expensive lambo.

Just make sure that whatever you’ll use to buy doesn’t have a flat starting fee like coinbase with 99 cents if I remember correctly.

Bitcoin in some people’s eyes is big enough of a gamble. The last thing that should be advertised here are literal roulette sites.

But the hard limit of bitcoin tokens is 21 million. If im already holding several and you are holding several full 1 bitcoins and some investors are holding 100k bitcoin tokens that’s already less supply, minus the millions that are lost or held in the first wallets. My question is, ifi it’s possible for all the full bitcoin tokens to be at some point being held by investors and people who will hold on for longer amounts of time?
