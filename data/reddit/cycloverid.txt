The current market is driven purely by exuberance and speculation. There is no way to know the worth of any of these so-called 'coins' and they could eventually be worth zero. If you think you might enjoy speculating and investing just trade derivatives or equities on a regulated exchange like NYSE.

That makes two uses! Now if only we can find a use for bitcoin!

I believe many people have been complaining about 'frozen assets' in crypto exchanges. The crypto exchanges aren't regulated either with protection mechanisms like halts and there are no valuation metrics.

Trade one group of financial elite for another, from bankers to bitcoin early adopters? No thanks! Notify me when the currency of the future arrives!

Out of curiosity, have you ever looked up the definition of "coin"?

Really? And this is the best we can come up with to replace fiat currencies? I see this exact behavior out of the goons pumping low float penny stocks on NYSE, daily.

Aren't you an average joe?

That is the point of a scam isnt it?

Odd that you say that. There's more parroting on this subreddit than most places. Some of it works against the success of algorithmic currencies too - like this very tired holding meme that everyone keeps repeating. Is bitcoin an asset or a currency? If it's an asset, why is everyone calling it a crypto-'currency'? If it's a currency, why is it being held tight like an investment? It's also not a coin; It's not a flat metal object and it's not a designated denomination of a currency, yet the term 'coin' is pervasive around this 'asset class'. As an outsider, the buyers of this technology do not seem to have a competent grasp of what exactly has been purchased, or what it is excels at being used for. And that's precisely what keeps more conservative, logical people away - perhaps not unlike those people described at the pub.
