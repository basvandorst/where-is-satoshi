You are not including all the BTC lost on shady trading sites, hacks, etc. though ;)

Hopefully by that time, the US will have joined the developed countries and the bill should be 0 ;)

I wonder how much energy is wasted mining in the world today because of the rise in difficulty...

I am currently working on a project to - hopefully - do a lot of good in developing regions by bringing low cost e-learning/exercises to even the poorest schools.  Currently, I am paying for everything myself - but hoping to get some donations or sponsors.  My current problem with many of these services that *do* offer free versions for non-profits is that all I have found require that you are "a registered 501(c) non-profit organization" to be eligible.  As a Dane in Europe, that seems a bit out of reach.  Maybe some other criteria could be introduced, that would include more parts of the world?

Actually, when asking a friend who has been fiddling with BTC for much longer than me, he suggested that I just made an address specifically for donations and would share that for direct donations - and not even bother with the current online solutions.
I also found a new website dedicated to bitcoin donation requests, where I listed mine:    (no donations yet though - maybe no one is looking ;)).
(Slightly off-topic): In the longer run, I also think bitcoins can really help communities in developing regions controlled by organized crime and unstable governments as the mafia will not have the same power by having people in the banks leaking info on everyone's accounts (to be used for extortion, etc.) as they do now.
