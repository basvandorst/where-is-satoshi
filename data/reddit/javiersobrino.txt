You can forget about the money. As MTGox and other exchanges before, they just have stolen it from you and are saying that the robery is external. Don't be a foolish.

Who are you to change the ads of a page for another of your convenience. Who are you to impose webmasters a new monopoly in ads. Who are you to impose your prices, your criterium,and your rules over them.
And I think that can be interpreted as ilegal. It is not like adblock that is free and requires user intervention to install and activate, and nobody except the user wins. Your system comes activated and not only delete ads, it substitute them by your own, which can be considered a commercial robery.

The interesting thing here is how all institutional bankters &amp; associates are all saying exactly the same thing, that bitocin is not a currency
That means that soon they are going to impose new regulations in consonance with what they have just said.

Actually you can pretty much pack all purchases into one payment in alipay, but normal people buy 4 or 5 times every single day. Sometimes more. And companies usually do from dozens to thousands of tx per day to other companies.
So pretty much a big city would need 1TB block.

No, the opendimes can be reflashed with custom code. It may not pass the test downloaded from the webpage, but could pass the test inside of itself becasuse the hacker can change the trustme·py file.
With tools, you can also hack the secure chip, but you don't need to, because as they state, the private key is not in the secure chip but in the main chip which most probably is dumpable. Anyway 10BTC is a big enough quantity to acquire the tools and knowledge to hack it and then scam you.

Excuse me, but I think you confuse "Web 3" with "Tor 2". Your idea is great as a substitute for Tor, as it is an OSI4 level. Actually, the web, which includes OSI 5 to 7, is the database, the presentation and the application level.
For real redistribution of data you need a distributed application, running on top of a distributed mutable database, and you must ensure that it is grid based, so individual organizations can create grids on top of the technology, ensuring a free market, quality, and incentive for its maintance.
Please have a look at Bitcloud:  and read our white paper here: 
We are searching an OSI4 transport layer for future versions, and your idea is fantastic. Perhaps you could collaborate with us.

While I would agree about competence being a good thing, there is absolutely no reason to have 516 coins which are mostly copies one from the other, with a different name and a different guy behind it.
It may be good to have BTC (sha) and LTC (scrypt), and probably another one that allows fast confirmations, or things like that, but... 516???
I guess at least 510 out of those 516 are created just because of greed.

Hi, we are not having this problem in Bitcloud because the existance of grids. In Bitcloud a company like Google could create its own grid, but it is independent of any other grid, so they cannot interfere.
In bitcloud the configuration of grids is audited by humans (it is not automatic), so you can choose who influences and who create nodes in your grid. If somebody who is anti-Google creates a grid mainly to talk bad about Google, there is nothing that Google can do because they are not in control of the grid at all.
Even better, we use publishers that can contract many grids at the same time, making all efforts of Google trying to control the offending grids almost impossible.
After all this time, Bitcloud is still the best solution, but unfortunatelly the one with less resources. You should try to help us, I think our model is right now the only one that can work.

You may be interested in Bitcloud, it is in need of a lot of help, and reddit distributed is just the PERFECT application that could run on top of it.

And there was a time in which everybody wanted to go to America... now they want to exit!
This is just a demonstration that you don't have a real democracy. Most people are against most of these regulatory stupidities, but they go on because the people are not the owners of the country. America is not your home anymore, the real owners of it just rent it (and all what is inside) to you, at a convenient price. The real owners are, of course, the banks.

But this has two problems:
1. Copying the data to a netbook is an operation that takes 2 minutes. You may not have enough time to transfer funds to other addresses.
2. Malware in the phone could copy the wallet and send it to a hacker without you noticing anything.
Having a password with a virtual keyboard which is not the standard in the system (like you have now for inserting seed words) would prevent those two kind of attacks or really delay them.

I see an outstanding support for Core with aprox. $1200 per BTC and nearly %80 of nodes flagging segwit.

If they have 75% hash, 25% is going to attack the original Bitcoin chain, and the other 50% to their fake chain. That way they can attack us while creating their chain.
As you can see, that is the level of malevolence they are already planning. Absolute criminals.

miners need a change in their software for a HF to happen, so they need to change their software for BU and then activate it. Nodes supporting Core will continue to run the same, only just a bit slower because many miners went away and difficulty must be adjusted again.

@_date: 2016-11-23 12:46:16
Nodes cannot be imposed to accept BU blocks. Software running in the nodes (wallets) cannot accept something incompatible with their software. That is how consensus works.
The BU they are running now is not really BU, as the unlimited functions are not activated. If they do activate, automatically 94% of the nodes will reject them, so their mining becomes worthless.
Convincing miners is just not enough. You need to convince the entire economy, which I doubt it is going to happen.

SegWit + Lightning will make Bitcoin much more scalable even with the size of the block that Segwit allows.
But the important thing is that if we optimize using Segwit right now, future increases of the blocksize will be already optimized and would be more effective than if segwit was not activated.
So segwit must be first, then if we really run out of space, we can HF to 2Mb.
