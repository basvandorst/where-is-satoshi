During his trial where he was convicted, evidence for 5 hits was shown and the defense did not argue against it but instead tried to convince the jury that Ulbricht wasn't DPR.  We saw further evidence that corroborated it was him.  In this latest indictment of Force and Bridges, we see evidence of a 6th hit.  If you read all of the subject matter, you would know this.

I originally thought they may have had a case for entrapment too.  But it turns out that it may not fit the definition.
  
"In criminal law, entrapment is a practice whereby a law enforcement agent induces a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would have otherwise been unlikely to commit."
  
Talking to my lawyer friend, having tried to issue hits for 6 people at different times makes it impossible to successfully argue entrapment.

That is how it works in the eyes of the law.  I am not the eyes of the law.  I am a citizen who does not support people who try to kill other people to protect their criminal enterprise.  I am free to make up my own mind based on the evidence and there is plenty of evidence should you choose to review it.

Evidence that Ulbricht hired a hitman was presented at his trial.  His trial led to his conviction.  He is scheduled to be sentenced tomorrow.  What part of that don't you understand?
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:02:48
That's not what framing means.  Framing would be if they made it look like DPR issued the hit when he didn't.  In the example above, they were trying to instigate DPR to issue a hit.  It's still DPR(Ulbricht) issuing the hit.
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:00:52
I didn't arrive at my position quickly.  I waited and reviewed the evidence for myself as it was made available.  This is not an assumption on my part, it is a conclusion I have arrived at after reviewing the evidence.  
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:02:56
How is the evidence introduced at a trial that led to a conviction moot?  That makes no sense.  If the case had been thrown out or the defense won, I would agree that the evidence becomes moot, but when the trial results in a conviction, it absolutely is not moot.

@_date: 2015-05-28 20:11:43
You should learn about the Ulbricht case, read all of the transcripts, review the evidence yourself and learn the Silk Road timeline.  It doesn't really matter at this point who Ulbricht was talking to, whether it was an actual hitman or a federal agent posing as one.  Ulbricht issued the hits and because of that, people like me will not support him.

I didn't say to hand over customer data.  You're ignoring an important detail and I hope it's not on purpose for the sake of arguing.  In order to put out a hit on someone, you have to know their identity.  So why not hand that over to law enforcement instead of trying to have them killed?

His statement about "poisoning the well of support" here makes me feel like there is some selective moderation happening.  It's not like they don't have the ability to drag their feet on things until they are already off of /new or to be slow to approve comments they disagree with.  I had to message all of the moderators to get some of my submissions approved in a timely manner.
  
I am not saying I am ungrateful for the work they do either, I doubt they are paid for their work, but it does make me question when a submission that is essentialy a witch hunt is allowed to persist all day and results in a vote brigade against a voice that at least one moderator has stated goes against their desires(in so many words).  I am not saying they aren't allowed to have their own opinions either.

How about we stop trying to incentivize development with money?  There was no clear monetary incentive in the early days and look at where we are.  We still have core devs who care and will fix problems if they arise, and they do it because they care.  Let's not corrupt the system with money.

In your example, It sounds like your friend is a reseller and he isn't selling bitcoins.  If he was selling bitcoins, he would have extra regulations to adhere to depending on what country and state he lived in.  In addition, there are many sellers on eBay that are not complying with their laws.  The bottom line is that [FinCEN has classified bitcoin and virtual money or a substitute for real currency](
  
As for your question, there is a reason you cannot buy newly funded casascius coins anymore.  Casascius was shut down because what he was doing was money transmission and he didn't want to have to get licensed and start tracking everyone's identity.  
  
You can still buy casascius coins on eBay but they are now falling under collectibles which is a bit of a loophole.  New coin makers no longer sell their coins funded and the few that do are trying to use loopholes.  For instance, titanbtc.com will fund your coin after it has already shipped and you have received it.  They're arguing that they are selling you a collectible coin that happens to get funded after the fact.  There is lealana.com who sells coins and they have the buyer fund them before they ship them so it is not actually them funded the coins, it is the customer funding their own property.
  
As time goes on, we'll probably see these loopholes scrutinized.

Putting a hit out on anyone is the wrong thing to do.  Taking the law into your own hands is almost always the wrong thing to do, especially when lives are on the line.  If you aren't familiar with this case, I should tell you that had Nob been an actual hitman and not the government agent, Ulbricht would have murdered an innocent man, one of his own admins who was arrested by the dirty feds who used his credentials to rob the silk road.  Killing is wrong, plain and simple and anyone who argues otherwise is fucked in the head.

@_date: 2015-04-03 17:34:14
I think you have a good point about them bringing up the murder-for-hire and being able to argue what they know.  But I think it is also relevant that the hit he requested from the corrupt agent wasn't what they focused on at the trial.  He has been accused of ordering as much as 6 hits but they only chose to outline 5 of them.

Show me one instance where I am trying to skew something as being pro-government or pro-law enforcement.  Sticking to the facts of what we know and speculating as little as possible does not make me a government shill.  
  
A few days ago I [submitted this thread]( pointing out that the federal agents were caught because of current regulation and argued that we don't need more regulation.  What we have is enough and possibly too much and I said that we should put whatever effort we put towards new regulations in re-evaluating and enforcing what we already have.
  
This is sensible and not pro-government.  If you want to say all regulations are bad, I'm not even going to go there because we can see the shit Homero Jeff Garza is running around doing without regulation and any fool can see he needs to be stopped.

You're not being objective and analyzing the facts.  That case corroborates what we know about the evidence that the FBI found on Ulbricht's laptop.  Those agents don't work in the same field office and aren't in the same departments.  At no time did they have access to Ulbricht's laptop.  If they did Why wouldn't they remove the evidence that implicates themselves?  Just because the DEA agents was dirty doesn't mean the FBI is dirty.

I'm all about personal responsibility and I think that should extend not just to people like Ulbricht, but everyone who used Silk Road too.  I would argue that each and every customer on there had to take responsibility for their actions and if they didn't do a good job of hiding their real identity, that is on them.  It's not like they didn't know what they were doing.  This isn't like Target losing customer data, this is people who knew they were participating in a market that facilitates illegal activity.  I don't believe it was right for Ulbricht to use murder to try to protect them nor do I believe his motive was to protect anyone other than himself and his enterprise.
  
At least you're thinking about it, even if I disagree, I like to see people think about what they believe and why.  Even if I don't agree with the rationality.

Bitcoin will empower the US because it is one of the few countries that can enumerate what is happening on the blockchain.  It is not a threat to the US, it empowers the US in terms of intelligence that is currently not available with cash.

I don't think the mods are purposely removing my comments.  The thread on the front page about me being a government shill while very funny and amusing, has also caused a down-vote brigade to happen to me which is causing some of my submissions to be automatically filtered.
  
The whole thing is rather amusing from my point of view since I know I am not a government employee, not that I wouldn't do this for a living if I could, I mean what else could be better than getting paid to browse reddit? :)
  
The fact of the matter is that I am not a government shill and I am just a person who wants to know the truth about things.  I have my own opinions about things and I don't mind voicing them, especially when they make people question the world around them.  We need more of that if we are to protect what little privacy we have left.
  
Another very interesting fact and observation is that [another front page thread]( is making people question details in the criminal complaint.  Details that should be questioned because they do not make sense.  I noticed this detail right away and immediately set out to see how long it would take for someone to ask the question.  I very much wanted to know if I was alone in my observation.  It took almost two days for someone like to ask the question and he linked to the imgur image I had been plastering in this sub.  I wish it didn't take so long for it to be asked but I am happy that there are other truth seekers out there.  It gives me hope.  Don't lose hope and don't stop questioning.

I agree with everything you said and I like your approach.  To answer your question, maybe they suspected the father of disguising brain seeds or private keys in his wife and daughters belongings?  It's a possibility for sure but we would need to know more about the contents of what was confiscated to be able to determine if this is a reasonable assumption.
  
I saw another post around here dealing with hiding private keys in pictures, not sure where I saw that one but it stands out to me as another way to secure your keys that people wouldn't immediately suspect but that law enforcement might be looking for.

@_date: 2015-04-03 14:08:20
I'm going to try and explain this in a way that I think most people around here will understand.
  
Coinbase is a good example here because they operated in a similar manner when they started.  Coinbase bought and sold bitcoins on bitstamp and then sold those bitcoins to their customers in the US.  This required them to have a money services business license and to comply with AML\KYC regulations.  Coinbase complied and has slowly offered their service as they become licensed in each jurisdiction.
  
Bruce does not appear to have been licensed and was doing the same thing as Coinbase while not attempting to follow regulations.  I'm not defending the laws and regulations or the people that enforce them.  I am simply stating the truth of the matter and pointing out that Bruce broke the law yet this blog is appearing to say otherwise while also admitting that Bruce broke the law.  They contradict themselves and I am being down-voted for pointing out that contradiction.
  
Do you understand why Bruce is no longer in business?

@_date: 2015-04-02 21:21:00
Low blows?  It is called satire.  It doesn't really matter what I say at this point, I still get down-voted by the sheep.  You have people around here who idolize Ulbricht and will down-vote anything regardless of humor or factual content.  If it doesn't fit their confirmation bias, they don't want to see it.  It would be funny if it wasn't something we should be worried about.
  
Look at this submission for instance, you have a picture of a coffee shop with blurry faces and it has 20+ upvotes merely because Ulbricht *might* be one of them.  It's about as ridiculous as not having a sphincter.
@_date: 2015-04-01 23:54:22
This sort of thing doesn't go over well around here.  See my comment history and karma rating for examples.
  
Also, one of the mods, will think you're "poising the well" of support here.  As if this sub-reddit is an official support network for Ulbricht.

@_date: 2015-04-03 22:44:54
I agree to an extent but I have problems with the comparison for several reasons.  BerkShares are locked at a specific exchange rate in relation to the dollar and are not easily transmittable or used outside of their intended jurisdiction.  They're not really a threat and if they ever did become one, I expect it would receive the same treatment(not that I agree with it).
Bitcoin transcends borders and has the power to disrupt in many different ways.  They had to act fast to maintain control.  Again, I don't necessarily agree with it, especially since it has the potential to lift people out of poverty and empower the 99%.  I am a member of the 99%.

Owning bitcoin is not yet a status symbol, owning bitcoin is insurance against its success.  Your word soup has an example of this that you completely missed.

They are not the same.  Not being material to the case has nothing to do with the other evidence and whether it can or cannot lead to a conviction.

It's not the same idea if it is order of magnitudes different.  The bottom line is people need to take responsibility for their actions.  We can argue the semantics but it isn't going to make Ulbricht right for trying to commit murder.  Even if someone threatened to start killing his customers he wouldn't have been right.  The right thing to do at that point is to turn over everything you know to law enforcement and allow due process to take its course.

If the whole thing is true, Burt was acting similar to Coinbase.  He was trading bitcoin on exchanges and then selling that bitcoin locally.  The difference is that Coinbase is licensed to do that and Burt wasn't.
  
This is also from the blog:
  


  
Note that she tries to claim that "Burt wasn't trading that much" yet they had "an unusually large amount of cash on hand because undercover Federal Agents had been buying Bitcoins from him right and left during the months before our house was raided".  And she admits the other half came from trading on exchanges.
  
I guess you just want to ignore their own words that spell out how Burt was breaking the law.  Maybe because you don't want to admit you're a tool being used to fund criminals.

Walking through a neighborhood is not the same as setting up tor, creating an account and placing an order, they are order of magnitudes different.  And you had the ability to obfuscate your identity on silk road while you couldn't walk through a neighborhood and be invisible.  Even in some states, defending your own life can put you in prison, so the system isn't fair in terms of what you think you should be able to do.
  
As best I am aware, not a single silk road customer has been prosecuted even though they have *buyer information*.  There is a reason for that and that reason is because anyone can place an order and have it shipped anywhere regardless of whether they actually live there.  There is a lot more that they have to prove in order to prosecute a silk road customer.  Silk Road customers have a lot of room to deny their involvement and Ulbricht's actions ultimately weren't really effectual at protecting anything other than his own enterprise.  For instance, a 15 year old kid could place an order and have it shipped to their neighbors house who is never home.

That is not correct.  Did you read the documents for the submission you are replying to?  The argument was that it wasn't material to this case and could create bias.  And the judge appears to have been correct given that the corrupt agents were not working the case that resulted in the apprehension of Ulbricht and that they worked for a completely different agency.
  
Let's not ignore the fact that the corrupt federal agents worked for the DEA and SS while the agents who located and apprehended Ulbricht were FBI out of a different field office.  There were multiple independent investigations happening at the same time.  It is much more logical to stick with the facts and question them than it is to simply say everyone is corrupt so Ulbricht must be innocent.

Only in terms of their field offices involvement.  Remember, there were multiple field office working this case and their field office is not the one that led to the apprehension of Ulbricht.
  
Also, this latest investigation was conducted by an IRS agent who has no vested interest in Ulbricht.  Another totally different office and agency.

Then you need to read the transcripts and understand that these officers worked for a different field office and their testimony was not a part of the trial that convicted Ross.
   
The evidence presented in today's complaint regarding the corrupt federal agents re-enforces and further corroborates what we already know.  You don't get to pick and choose what evidence you believe because they extorted and committed theft.
  
The point is that with this evidence and the evidence we have already seen, Ross Ulbricht intended to commit murder, he tried to hire people to do it and it doesn't matter *to me* in arriving at my judgement of his character whether or not he succeeded.
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:37:12
These federal agents had no part in the seizure of his laptop and the evidence gained from it.  The criminal complaint from today further re-enforces that evidence.

We don't know that for sure.  But it looks like it is proven for at least one of those instances based on the criminal complaint for this case.  I think it's plausible, but I'd like to stick with the evidence.  Sadly, it doesn't change the fact that Ulbricht(DPR) intended to have someone killed, regardless of whether he was entrapped.
@_date: 2015-03-30 23:42:21
Because the evidence we saw at trial was not the result of the agents being indicted.  It was a completely different field office.
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:54:07
Then you should review the court transcripts.  I have followed this case from the start and reviewed the transcripts as they were made available.  Your assumption that it could have been tampered with does not hold water.  The contents of his laptop was forensically captured and analyzed at the time of its seizure and the Baltimore field office was not involved in that.  The agent who performed the initial capture and forensics testified and I would encourage you to read it for yourself.

Force's corruption doesn't prove that Ross wasn't DPR.  That's what his trial was about.  Force's corruption and the case revolving around it has only helped to solidify the evidence we have already seen.  It was through that process that we learned about Ulbricht's tendency to turn to murder to deal with his problems.
  
I'm not so sure that had they been able to bring up the case, that it would have helped him prove he wasn't DPR since it only re-affirms the evidence and the agents desire to get rich and stay free doesn't benefit from Ulbricht being apprehended.  I'd bet the only reason the defense is embracing it now is to help with appeals.  There's no guarantee that if there was a new trial that they would even bring it up, but we can guarantee that the prosecution would be able to use it to corroborate evidence.  Evidence collected by an IRS agent who is not affiliated with the DEA and does not benefit in any way.
  
It's very complex and interesting to think about!

Yes, you should read through the transcripts from Ulbricht's trial.  The bulk of the evidence comes directly from Ulbricht himself.  That's why this latest case will be so important, because it helps to corroborate that evidence.  We now have someone who was on the other end of some of those conversations.  Hopefully we will see more and complete more of the picture.

There are many delusional people who believe they can operate anonymously using complex systems they have no actual control over or ability to audit.  From the firmware on your computing device to the networks you use, you are not in control of it and it is foolish to believe that you are.  Anonymous solutions are a mere illusion in the real world and the illusion is sustained by the opaque nature of action taken by intelligence.
  
If you want to be anonymous online, it is extremely difficult to sustain but you can be opaque to all but a few and as long as you aren't a threat or a useful tool, you will live in ignorant bliss believing that you are anonymous.
   
The blockchain isn't going anywhere because it is a very useful tool in many aspects of society.  It is a system of control and these systems are very desirable for controlling the herd.  Sidechains and services will purport to offer anonymity and people will believe that they do, but in actuality it is just anonymity from your closest neighbor, which is good enough for most people.  These services are not a threat to bitcoin and will not affect its longevity.

In this case, Ross Ulbricht wasn't being tortured, the agent he hired didn't even know who he was.
@_date: 2015-03-30 18:05:29
This won't affect his conviction.  But it looks like it will affect any future convictions involving murder-for-hire.  The evidence I've read in the criminal complaint only cements his current conviction but will all but undo any effort to prosecute him for murder-for-hire.
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:49:18
Having admin access to SR only allowed him to reset PINs and change account status from buyer to seller.  It didn't give him access to Ulbricht's laptop and the bulk of our evidence comes from Ulbricht's laptop which contained his diary, bitcoin wallet and meticulous record keeping.
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:23:18
Yes, Ross himself reviewed the actions of Number13 and another redacted account on SR and determined the risk.  He made no note in his records that his account had been compromised and no one was in a better position to make that assessment.  
@_date: 2015-03-30 23:39:15
It was allowed to proceed because the defense didn't motion for a delay of trial.  My questions is:  why the hell didn't they motion for a delay?  They would have had more time to review the evidence they had and would have been able to review evidence from the ongoing investigation and subpena more people.  It makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:37:05
Pretty credible.  This was from the IRS agents investigation.  He has no vested interest in bringing down Ross, he was after the agents.
@_date: 2015-03-27 16:53:04
It's far from useless since you can put a portion of your income towards it every year and not have to pay capital gains when you cash out.  Buying the underlying asset requires that you pay capital gains when you cash out or use it to purchase something.  Of course, this all depends on there being gains.

People down-voting and up-voting me care.  It certainly does make a difference.  Causing people to question makes a difference.  The more people who question, the more soldiers we have against unjust laws, corrupt officials and would-be murderers.  Not questioning and complacency is one of our biggest enemies, it is what allows the few to lead the majority to war.
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:42:08
Yep, he's bringing the corrupt agents to justice and also helping to corroborate what we know about Ross.  It's an interesting turn of events.
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:50:46
You haven't read up on it then.  
  
- Because of regulation, Bitstamp reported one of their accounts. 
  
- Because of regulation, movement of big amounts was reported and the IRS agent was able to reference it.
  
- Because of regulation, one of them invested in an exchange in order to try and launder.
  
- Because of regulation, there was a paper trail to investigate these two and that paper trail was their undoing.

Kind for kind is a good point, but in the case of shares versus actual bitcoin, that might not be considered kind for kind.
  
You can only claim a certain dollar amount for losses in a fiscal year.  There is no upper limit on how much capital gains you can owe.  Capital gains might keep you from making a profit depending on how much of a loss you have.

I'm assuming as little as possible.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:50:04
It wasn't, I don't think they were allowed to read his handle.  But the journal entry where Ulbricht determined he wasn't a threat was read and entered into record and that is corroborated by this latest case as well as his handle.
@_date: 2015-03-30 23:50:25
The forensics were covered in the original trial, I don't have much speculation about that.  I would love to see a re-trial so we can see more evidence etc..
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:13:22
It's not reasonable to lump all *officials* together like that.  It doesn't serve the truth.
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:08:28
My account age has nothing to do with the evidence presented.  Nor does my highlighting the evidence presented help these agents in any way.  By merely talking about it, I am doing the opposite of damage control.  By showing that the evidence in yesterdays criminal complaint corroborates what we know, I am re-enforcing that these officers are probably guilty.  I have no doubt that they are.  Just like I no longer have any doubt that Ross Ulbricht attempted to have people killed.  I do not support people without evaluating their character, and I have done that with Ross.  I see a lot of people here are willing to brush it under the rug because it serves their greater disdain against the war on drugs.  While I do not agree with the war on drugs, I disagree much more with making an idol out of an *attempted* murderer.
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:58:43
It was multiple field offices conducting independent investigations..
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:50:55
This latest evidence only corroborates what we already know and adds more fuel to the murder-for-hire charges.  This investigation was conducted by an IRS agent who has no vested interest in Ulbricht or the drug war.  What he found corroborates the evidence that we have seen from Ulbricht's diary, bitcoin wallet and meticulous record keeping.
  
Here's two screenshots from yesterdays criminal complaint that highlight Ross Ulbricht hiring a federal agent to commit murder:
  
  
  
We now have a totally independent investigation aside from the several that were working on apprehending DPR.  The field office that Force works for is not the same field office that apprehended Ulbricht and conducted forensics on his laptop.  Forensics that are not in question as best we can tell.
  
I personally do not want to see someone capable of protect their illegal endeavors by murder set free.  What is to stop them from doing it again?  I'm telling you this because I see a lot of blind fanaticism surrounding Ulbricht as well as whitewashing of this evidence on the part of the defense and their family.  Let's not forget that Ulbricht's own mother has been scaring people into donating by claiming we would lose our freedom if Ross is convicted.  Ross has been convicted and we have not lost any freedom.  So in addition for the high potential for Ross being a murderer, I cannot agree with the tactics of the defense.  I am compelled to say something, especially when I see other people in this subreddit silenced for saying the same thing.  Which as best I can tell, is the truth of what we know.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:04:25
This is just pure speculation on my part, but given which office they came from.  I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that one or both of them were the "hitmen" Ross Ulbricht hired to kill people trying to extort money from him.  I'm betting that since there were multiple instances of this, they decided to not tell their peers about at least one of these black mailing instances.  I can just see them shitting their pants when they realized that Ross kept meticulous records and that it would eventually lead back to them and their operation.  If this is the case, it would bode well for Ulbricht's pending murder-for-hire charges as he may be able to prove entrapment.
  
EDIT: Reading the criminal complaint and it looks like Ulbricht(DPR) paid Force(Nob) to kill someone on page 42 of the complaint.  Still reading, but this looks very good for Ulbricht's murder-for-hire case.  I wonder how much intent will matter in this case.
   
EDIT2: Request for Sealing at the end cements that we won't know anything more about this until trial and maybe even during trial.
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:31:07
There is no proof that Ulbricht tried to scare away extortionists with the threat of death.  
  
There is proof that he paid people to kill other people.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:29:40
I agree with most of what you said except your very first sentence.  The evidence that he tried to have people killed is there and has been further corroborated in this latest case.
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:19:29
So you accept they they were corrupt and trying to extort Ulbricht but don't believe any of the other evidence, come on, stop being so biased and attempt to be objective.
  
You're ignoring that I am not judging him in a court of law, I am only focusing on his intent.  His intent was to have people killed, regardless of whether he was paying a corrupt federal agent to do it.  He didn't know they were corrupt or that it was even them who were extorting him. 
  
I see he's your hero and logic will only go so far with you, that is apparent based on your responses.  
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:53:04
His mom is always trying to say that the murder-for-hire charges and accusations are false.  But the evidence in the criminal complaint only shows one instance of the murder-for-hire, an instance he was not on trial for and is not charged with(Maryland), yet she completely ignores that there is ample evidence that he did try to have people killed on more than one occasion, regardless of whether it actually happened and regardless of whether or not he was actually talking to a federal agent.
  
I cannot respect her or Ross based on intent, both her intent to whitewash it and his attempt to kill.  It's very disappointing.
@_date: 2015-03-27 20:30:07
Your statement that you do not pay capital gains on bitcoins is wrong.  Your capital gains might be 15% depending on certain factors, but it could also be less or more depending on those same factors.

This summary leaves out the fact that the criminal complaint highlights that Ulbricht paid Agent Force to kill someone.

Extortion is nothing compared to murder.  There were more cases than just these two.  Have you forgotten how he was willing to have a wife and child murdered too?  I guess you haven't reviewed the evidence..
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:43:19
Edited my statement.
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:37:41
I'm confused, please clarify.  In order to have a hit placed on someone, you need to know the identity of that someone.  Are you saying that you would not go to the police with their identity and would give that information to a hitman instead?  How would you know you had the right person and weren't having an innocent person killed?
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:18:57
That's a good point.  But he may be able to argue entrapment if he can convince a jury that the agents were working both sides.  I'm not a lawyer.
  
An example I can think of is hookers and johns.  If a john drives into a neighborhood they really have no business being in and tries to pick up a hooker(undercover cop) on the side of the street, that is not entrapment.
  
Similarly, if a hooker(undercover cop) approaches a guy as he is leaving his job and convinces him to come with her and then asks for money before performing "the job", I think that is entrapment.
  
Again, I'm not a lawyer so I might be wrong.
@_date: 2015-03-30 23:58:53
I doubt that.  It must have been strategic or were missing some info.
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:53:20
It looks like Ross Ulbricht hired Agent Force to commit murder. You can find this information in the criminal complaint, here is a screenshot of the relevant info:

It isn't unraveling, its been re-enforced.  Read page 42 of today's criminal complaint.  He tried to pay a federal agent to kill someone.
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:56:00
I think you're right, I think he has a good chance of arguing entrapment and getting off in the Maryland case if it is ever brought to trial.  But that doesn't change my judgement of his character.  His intent is what matters to me and it is what determines if I will support him or not.  He appears to have tried to have people killed on multiple occasions.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:04:32
That's fine and caution is a good practice.  But we have people running around here just making shit up with no evidence to support it.  Things like all of the evidence from Ulbricht's laptop was planted, and that all of the agents are the same and working together to frame Ross.  Truly stupid things to say.  All the while, they are saying that Ross is a hero without waiting for the trials to conclude.  Blindly propping up a would-be murderer who appears to have really tried to have people killed with each new revelation.  There needs to be a balance and there is nothing wrong with me helping in that regard.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:14:58
You should consider that the defense made no attempt to make that argument and that they completely imaged the machine, which would allow the defense to assess and review the possibility for that.  I'm hoping we get a new trial so that we can see and review more of that type of information.
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:17:38
I would argue that trying to have people killed(for whatever reason) is wrong.

Ross Ulbricht hired Agent Force to commit murder.  We have no evidence that Karpeles has ever done anything so bad in his life.  If you don't believe these accusations, read the criminal complaint from yesterday.  Here is the relevant part:
  
  
This information was corroborated using evidence found in the possession of Ulbricht.  He's not the Boy Scout you seem to think he is.

It's hard to tell with you since you displayed cynicism elsewhere in this thread.  Ultimately, I don't think that is healthy for focusing on the truth of things.
  
Usually, when the feds want to brush something under the rug, you don't hear about it until years after it happened.  I could see them getting some sort of plea deal, but not because the feds want to help their own.  They have secrets to keep and there are many unanswered questions about the case and how they found Ross.  If they get any kind of deal, it will be to keep them from talking, not to help them.  We'll see though, I'm betting they will be made an example of simply because we know about it.
