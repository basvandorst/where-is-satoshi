Most goverments force you to have a bank account when opening a business. Also, you are not allowed to keep cash overnight, must be deposited to a bank. Also, cannot receive cash above a certain amount, so it must be a bank transfer. This kind of things...

How hard is to make 256 bits crypto into 256 Mbit one?

You expect us to watch 17 minutes of that?

Bitcoin nodes are keepers of the public ledger. Is good that most nodes are updated to the latest version.

Not all good news are the same. Overstock accepting bitcoin is different than Amazon doing the same.
Bitpay, push it!
@_date: 2016-10-05 17:51:10
The correct question is why isn't everybody else preparing.
@_date: 2016-10-25 00:05:21

This should be refined to a better version. Think about the fact that US has a military budget higher than the next 10 following countries together. So much power demands constant spending, or else.

Do not expect the price to jump up right after the halving. Look at price history graph from 2012.

She can be nice when she wants. But I read somewhere that she agree with Blockchain police thing, that's a big nono in my books. Because when law enforcement expect you to roll over and play dead, whoever doesn't like to play like this will be an outlaw.
