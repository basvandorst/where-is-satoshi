So at what point does that line of reasoning become a logical fallacy? If that is said every fucking time a dip/crash/correction occurs but the next 100 times it continues in the same pattern. In general is it not reasonable to assume it will go back up? It's like seeing dark clouds on the horizon and saying, " Well it rained the last 5 times I saw dark clouds on the horizon. But since it won't rain because past performance does not mean future performance, guess I will sun bathe." No you are going to probably/generally stay inside and be warm and dry because it actually rained.

For someone who is new to this community, what are the implications of this and why is it significant?

Found out the cosmetic items in the game Playerunknown's Battlegrounds can be traded to a third party to sell for actual USD. But the third party I am going through also has bitcoin as a withdrawal option! With the game launching today I hope I can get some of that coin from selling a few of the cosmetics I have saved for the launch!
As you hodlers say, "To the moon!"

Based on bitcoins history how soon will the next crash be? Also how big a crash based on an average of previous crashes will it be? I understand any guess is really just a guess even if from an educated individual.

No, just more secure. If you go to Bitcoins website they have a few good listed wallets.
