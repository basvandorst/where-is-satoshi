I probably should have mentioned I'm posting from 'Straya...

This couldn't be more true. Otherwise it'd be like [this]( at my house.

Way to give back! You're the kind of person this sub needs - just showing people how bitcoin can empower you to do good deeds such as this.

It's a regular YubiKey, right? It should still have use.

I'm givin' 'er all she's got cap'n!

I use mine for challenge/response authentication to login to Windows. It's basically the same as having a key in order to start a car, only with your computer.

Finally, a real currency I can get behind... And in my belly.

I looked through the threads around here and the threads on their support forums and found hundreds of issues. It's kind of discouraging.

He was active as late as an hour ago, so I think some results will come through.

I'm aware. I just figured I'd plop down some money I made by investing and selling in bitcoin. It's not a loss for me in the end, even if it never gets to me.

I ordered one of these guys yesterday. I think I'll be ecstatic to see it in June.

Thanks for the tip! I've also contacted MtGox at this point to see if they can offer any support on the issue as well.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:05:29
That's really strange and makes me a bit uneasy about it. I've never used them before, but now I don't know if I will because I've sent 3 email inquiries to their support address since then and tried doing live chat, but I've received no response at all.

How long do your BitInstant orders take to go through? I made one last Wednesday and have yet to receive anything on MtGox.

I'll check them out. Thanks for the links!
I messaged and replied to You might try doing the same.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:47:39
I sent you a PM about 8 hours ago. I'm not trying to be pushy, but I'd like an answer since when I was supposed to get my BTC the price was $129/BTC and now it's almost doubled. I will definitely use your service in the future if you guys resolve this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:13:45
What's their reputation like?
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:32:27
I think I'll shoot for that tomorrow. Thanks again, by the way.
