We should really start cataloging these everyday grievances.

Sure, prices can be volatile. Thats a risk both the sender and receiver must agree to though. It's assumed that both parties are aware of the risk.. 
And we can assume the dollar will forever remain stable and be backed by "the full faith and credit" of our government... until it's not.

My bank, as well as my wife's, required us to do this in person. I actually asked why, they said that it limits the likelihood of fraud.

They needed the money wired, specifically. I was surprised when I found out that neither my wife's bank or my bank allowed for this online.
The point being, if he had a bitcoin address, I could have sent him the money the minute he asked.

Good point. Next time I'm in there I will ask.

Oh yea- sure, with limited time on a weekend, when banks are closed, let me find out which bank offers the option to wire money through a smart phone, then transfer the money I need wired to that bank (because that's always a quick process right?) and then wait for that new bank to process that wire.. sounds like a blast. Instead of just sending bitcoin to a wallet and going on my merry way. That's hardly an interesting story to tell the internets though!

Oh- without a doubt, the process to buy bitcoin is cumbersome. I'm guessing that as demand grows, this process will be streamlined.
