Anyone with a brain should hate them since they are pretty much a scam.

I set up my own node running in a VM using [this guide]( I have 512 MB of ram allocated to the VM and I don't think it ever has issues, at least not that I'm aware of.

I sense an influx of cheap gaming GPU's in the near future.

Goodby GPU mining.

With PCI-e x1 extender cables with the ends cut out to allow a full 16x length card to fit in them.

Thats not how pooled mining works, you get paid in proportion to the computing power you provide and using a GPU is laughable at this point.

Almost. You will use way more electricity than you will mine if you are going to use a GPU.

You have to buy the Avalon chips that do the actual work separately. Then you have them sent to Burnin to have them soldered to the boards. He then sends you the completed board + avalon chips.

I just got my refund for the one jalepeno I ordered 5 months ago. Feels good man.

Luckily got back all the money I sent to them ($288). BFL hasn't canceled my order yet so I still need to watch and refuse the package if it comes.

I ordered a bitburner fury on September 15th and it arrived October 9th, but I was one of the people who ordered a bitburner xx and had the order for that transferred over to a bitburner fury order.
I would guess they are not taking support emails because EVERYONE is already emailing them about the 100 euro refund for not meeting their 64 GH's target. Either that or they dont care anymore; I'm starting to think its the latter.

I would bet this is no more than a blank PCB with some components soldered to it.
