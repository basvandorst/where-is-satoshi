I don’t want to punish people at all and I agree with you, the more, the merrier. I don’t want people to take it the wrong way. I’m just saying that lately it’s like 75% shit posting here.

Go to Coinbase.com, create an account, enter a payment method, get verified, buy, wait, move it offline, then wait to retire. Can buy as little as u want.

I sent from coinbase yesterday and it took about 10 hours

You can keep your bitcoin online, on coinbase, but you don’t really control it. You are at their mercy. 
If you move it offline to a paper or hardware wallet, you own it outright since you have the private key.

I started here as a newbie but some questions are just stupid. Everyone on here would be a fuckin billionaire if we knew all of the answers. 
This should be a place to discuss the technology, The exchanges, The hardware, Mining, etc.... lots of people here can offer good advice. 
However if you are asking for investment advice, you should go elsewhere.

Sorry, but If people are this fucking dumb, they should not be investing their money in anything but an education. It doesn’t matter how many fucking Bitcoins you have. It’s the return on your investment that you should be concerned with. That’s the same regardless.
