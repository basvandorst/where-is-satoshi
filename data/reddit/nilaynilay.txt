he should have done way more before the fork took place or right after it
i wont say too little but definitely tad too late
no doubt will get hate for this and many will say i am not even worth his finger nail
and this is exactly why he should have done a lot more. Us mere mortals look upto him as our God, hero and more
atleast i did when i was starting out.

how do you deposit cash? and how do you withdraw cash.
are you allowed to trade in margin?
are you able to keep a account in BTC and not USD 
is it like localbitcoins but instead of a centralised server it uses p2p mesh so it cant be shutdown by seizing a single server

your eng is fine. some parts are pretty poetic and well written.

he is in the game ever since he started giving those talks. these kind of disclaimers dont absolve anyone of there responsibilities
and he is kind of a tribe leader whether he wants it or not. millions of people take his word on things related to bitcoin
I think it is a mistake to not take sides. sometimes a good man taking sides is what galvanizes the masses to think for themselves

1. When you spend 1 BTC to create a USC 0430 contract, you’ll get 1 USCA contract and 1 USCB contract at the same time both of which can be traded in BTC market. Or you can convert back to 1 BTC with 1 USCA contract and 1 USCB contract. When the contract is due and delivered at 24:00 April 30th 2018 (UTC), against the USDT/USD price e.g. 0.95, a USCA holder will get 0.95 BTC from a USC 0430 contract and USCB holder gets the rest.
2. If you believe there’s a default risk, you can choose to buy USCB contracts. When a default happens leading to a drop of USDT/USD price e.g. to USDT/USD=0.4, a USCB contract will get 1-USDT/USD=0.6 BTC.
3. If you don’t believe there’s a default risk, you can choose to hold USCA contracts and sell USCB contracts. If no default happens, meaning USDT/USD=1, each USCA contract will bring you 1 BTC and the amount you get from selling USCB is the extra profit.
