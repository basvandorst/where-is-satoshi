Nope, the best evidences suggest that it's a socially positive thing to legalise all drugs.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:00:08
If only drugs were legalized then they wouldn't be immediately associated with CP and hitmen.

There isn't enough capacity in bitcoin to be a reserve for a nation state. Yet.

The price of care is about 10% of what you pay when we collectively bargain with all the suppliers and providers of care through our NHS.
That's capitalism at it's best mate. We get better health care than you can afford to buy and we get it cheaper than you're allowed to pay.
If you want to die and bankrupt yourself and your family go right ahead.

The money spent per person is much lower. You end up with the same sickness, illness, disease, etc, the same quality of care, if not better. But you pay per person much less. Because the government collectively bargains to drive down the prices of the most common meds and procedures.
This saves money overall. I'm happy if I never get sick and never have to use the NHS. I'll still pay for the welfare of everyone in my society. That's what society means.
I'd have to have paid health insurance in the US and there would have been no guarantee that it would have covered all my costs anyway, I may still have had to pay out of the nose for things that every other western nation takes for granted. I may still have had to travel far and wind for treatment.
Also, on the NHS I get health care in every country but the US, because US prices are unafforable. That should tell you something about how much you pay.

Not in the quantity they can make em.
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:38:01
Can confirm, I mean I get seen within an hour of A&amp;E and get constant care and treatment for anything I have, until I don't need it anymore. Which could be hours or years, it doesn't matter.
I get free meds, free doctors, free specialists. It's fucking terrible, they won't take my money. You tell me poptarts09, tell em how it really is.

You're the one said that we weren't dabating on reddit. I was just telling it like it is.
We don't die with medical debt, we don't live with it, we're not bankrupted because we get sick. We get healthcare that is second to none and we sure, we pay some taxes. But taxes aren't a bad thing when they collectively save money.

it's hard to transact on bitcoin, or any crypto, if the means of transacting is taken away.
But this is not what bitcoin was for, the point of the blockchain is to prevent fraud and crime while giving everyone equal access. Not to survive a disaster, if you want to be able to trade when the world comes to an end, buy gold.

Nah, it erodes trust in the market, which means the gains it gets from the buyer are smaller than the losses from the seller.

In a way it is. It's the search for the solution to a dynamic problem.

As of about a week ago I have no profits except for what I mined on NH. And I'm spending that on drugs and hookers and blackjack..

There will be a market in providing a full chain to miners, servers will be spun up to just provide the blockchain, btc will change hands for this service.
Where you see a problem I see a business model.

Yes, if it could be trusted or enforced in some other way.
No, in that it's easy to bypass.
I have separated my coins into fixed amounts which I'm gifting to my family members as wallets. So in that way I can be trusted.
But could/would you trust me, to give you a wallet with coins on it and not immediately spend them before you even got to load it up.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:27:45
Yes. it's miners all the way down.

localbitcoins will let you buy that without ID, but you pay a premium for no ID exchanges.

In the UK we had a big boom bust, and several banks died, when they literally printed money out of thin air. OK, so technically they loaned it to each other and magically created more the value of the loans, which they then loaned to everyone else at better rates than everyone else.
Technically they made money out of nothing. So yes, it does happen.
@_date: 2018-07-11 02:30:22
This typically happens in movies. However you will want to make a bit for bit copy of the drive, and scan that. You will want to research the structure of the wallet app you used, to find out if it anything will stand out.
I mean it's an interesting experiment. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:17:37
Not at all. Certainly it would shake up the marketplace. If Bitcoin ever does die it won't kill crypto. It's many things to many people.
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:21:30
Fair enough, certainly sounds like you were shooting him down for describing exactly what bankers have done for millennia, more or less.

In his defence, he predicted bircoin be at a million.
If he makes it, and only sells one, to himself, for a million, then he keeps his man parts...
But technically he is eating his own dick either way because of that typo.

Umm, I think it's hyperbole, but it's not wrong.

He didn't do it. it's obvious that the corrupt FBI agents who stole millions in bitcoin and had no case until after they had hacked admin, and could easily impersonate him, did it.

If all labour is transmutable to money and vice versa then the banker got two dollars for his one. And so money has been made out of thin air and in turn, the value of all other money is lessened by it's creation. What you're describing rewards the banker for doing nothing.
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:45:26
Explain this to me, because as far as my mind can grasp it then it doesn't matter what the money is spent on, only where it came from. And if it came from a loan, which nearly all money does, then it will always accumulate interest no matter how many times it's exchanged.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:46:31
There will still be a period of time where Crypto has an attack surface, historical addresses will be pilfered and people will go from mining coins and transactions to an attack any address with a significant value that hasn't moved in a while.
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:22:10
Crypto is time sensitive. Eventually all will be known.
@_date: 2019-05-21 07:38:57
So in your scenario, to deal with the interest conundrum, the banker get's free labour, from everyone, forever. And probably bank enough labour in a day to pay for work for a decade? And you think that's a proof?
@_date: 2016-07-27 13:44:49
They're still on the blockchain is what she meant. You can never take them off the ledger.
