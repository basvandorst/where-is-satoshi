I don't understand how these things work... Where is the seed and how can anyone be sure the BTC hasn't been taken

This is a free game and should be released before Christmas on android. I have quite a few Easter eggs in it already but if there are any suggestions you want to make for things you want added in the game. Let me know, I'm open to suggestions.
Edit: Thanks for all the support!
@_date: 2019-11-25 13:53:37
Thanks man, I'm pleased with it so far!
@_date: 2019-11-25 10:20:10
That's true

'Bitcoin Collector'
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:42:10
I want to get the experience right for as many people as I can.
The game is free and this normally means ads are the only option for monetisation, but ads suck. I was considering just openly adding an option to support the game via a BTC address or patreon and not including a single ad in the game. How would the community feel about something like this?

There is a final boss and other bosses too. Every enemy is an Easter egg that relates to Bitcoin and the purpose behind it, so I won't ruin it.
As of right now I've avoided putting real life people in it or using it to roast other projects. This is a conscious decision because my intention for this game is for it to be fun, without being hateful. I also feel it's unfair to push my personal opinions on people who just want to play an innocent 2D platformer about Bitcoin.

It's free to play and ad free.
Let me know if you run into any bugs, I made it on my own and didn't have many people to test it on.
I'm aiming to add more levels each month.

How is Tron a store of value? But some others aren't.
@_date: 2019-12-11 15:19:24
It's free and has no ads. 
Just an option to tip if you wish, I'm happy to keep it that way. Hopefully people have a better experience and share the game.

This game i made recently is a 2d platformer where you find keys. Lots of Easter eggs like people pretending to be satoshi.
The game was released but I unpublished it because Google rejected further updates because it had a bitcoin tipping option.
I will be releasing it again once I've added 2 more story lines. The initial one is about the banks and has fiat enemies but I want to add some more about other bitcoin related stuff. I also needed to add some things like level selection and saving the game too. Should be out again early next year.
@_date: 2019-12-10 21:25:33
Thanks for the feedback, that's a good point I will make a button for exiting levels in the next update

Maybe in the future, the problem is apple charge $100 a year to be a developer on the appstore. As a hobby, I don't have enough money to pay that right now. Maybe when christmas is over.
@_date: 2019-12-24 11:05:26
That's a good idea, I guess because I don't have a website up yet. Anyone who tips on Reddit in reply to this comment I'll PM them the APK when I get to my laptop today.
For lighting use the tip bot
For legacy use this 14AQiM3NGY2YTMeifWsq4H9gPSZLJxCVq2 and DM me the transaction ID.
I'll get working on a website in the next few week.

Urm.. the app doesn't ask for any permissions on your phone or request data.
You can play it with your internet turned off.
Beyond that I suppose the only way to be entirely sure would be to review the code yourself, after downloading the app on a virtual machine. 
I'm not too sure how deep of an answer you wanted for this, please don't percieve this as rude.

Thank you man!

I'm quite greatful of bitcoins current price. Quite amazing that it went from pennies to $20,000 in 11 years. I don't see why we need to keep growing to be successful. Bitcoin is very successful at these prices.

Unfortunately, Google doesn't allow any payments that are not done through Google play. I've had issues with games been taken down due to this. The game "bitcoin collector" in my post history has been taken down for this reason.
Edit: I'll be releasing that game again, I just figured I might as well add some content to it before I release it again.

Urm... urmm... It's an alternative universe where he used some of his holdings to buy a machine gun. That said, he is using it in self defense, if the shills catch you they rip you apart like zombies.

I took some feedback and made the FUD red, I also made gave his swing some lightning.

It's a simple survival game with a bitcoin twist, I made over the few last week.
Hope you all have a nice Christmas!
EDIT: I forgot to say, any feedback is welcome, this game is made for you guys so literally just comment what you want and if it can be added, it will be added.
