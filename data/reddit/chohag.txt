In my opinion, you don't have the right to hold that opinion.
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:58:07
... and yet they are willing to do so anyway.
@_date: 2014-07-19 06:41:17
As opposed to divulging the sensitive state secret that the US is fucking everyone with impunity and then running off to hide in a US prison?
@_date: 2014-07-19 06:21:30


Because it worked so well last time?

Facing the consequences, the real consequences not cushioned because you're too fat to fall, is the point of a free market.
@_date: 2014-07-17 22:00:06
This is finished. You're apparently an idiot.
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:42:57




Meanwhile, outside America, fuck you.

You've never set foot in an office have you?
Politics *everywhere*.

Maybe your neighbour doesn't want a miserable business-quashing cunt next to *his* house?
@_date: 2014-07-19 06:20:30


No I wouldn't. I'd fix my character flaw by gaining an understanding of it.
And oh look at that - I did, and became hugely successful in the technology industry.
@_date: 2014-09-15 16:00:07
I think 'fully' may be a bit generous.

New York had to gain this relevance. It can ungain it. See: London.

Where do you think the money to repay idiots who lost their money in idiotic schemes comes from? One man's credit is another man's debt.

@_date: 2014-07-17 21:42:50
Because that is not how reality works. Reality does not take kindly to debtors. It *will* reclaim what it is owed. Seems it's catching up.

A rather apt analogy - while Neo was busy cinematically saying no, he and everyone with him was very nearly killed in the real world.
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:44:48
Since when did free mean fair?
@_date: 2014-07-19 06:09:14
Why do that? They are doing it to themselves with some measure of success.
@_date: 2014-07-19 05:42:33
With blackjack and hookers? They have those already.

We do it with cables - almost none of the internet doesn't have a standby device waiting to take over when the first fails^* - why not pipes?

Yep. Sucks to be them.

Correction. Honey Badger follows his own rules.

Gravity was involuntary, but then we made planes and rockets and spaceships.

He's talking about the important lesson everyone *else* learned about politicians and power dynamics.
@_date: 2014-07-19 05:57:04
Mostly it's because of the "'s around "good guys".

MtGox seems to have been weeded out just fine despite the lack of 10 years of records, fingerprints and bonds.
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:40:23
The Gox debacle which resulted in the kind of idiot who blindly trusts a company like Gox losing their money? The Gox debacle in which people were batting way out of their league yet people threw money in their direction anyway without a care?
Sounds like some people learned an important but hard lesson.
Sounds like a win.

No shit, Sherlock.

Lots of people with lots of fiat currency.

It's their state, they can fuck it as much as they want.

It's wrong, yes, but who suffers? New Yorkers.
This is how Freedom works. You makes your choice. You pays your price.

There are hardly any excesses of the most crazed psychopath that cannot easily be duplicated by a normal kindly family man who just comes in to work every day and has a job to do.

Did I mention bitcoin? I don't think I did. I was talking about a piece of land.
@_date: 2014-07-17 22:17:13
Whoever. By merit. Code. We shouldn't. Yes.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:34:43
Quite so. And foreigners may then decide that it is not worth the hassle when dealing with US trade and so take their products and services elsewhere, enriching some other economy.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:18:11
Everyone is talking about what the government will do as if there's just 1. There are at least 190, depending on who's count you take.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:07:05


Correction: Are worth thousands *of dollars*.
If the US wants to mark some bitcoin as worthless inside their borders then it needn't affect the rest of us.
Edit: Typo.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:55:33
And people trusted a person who merely told them who he was?
Sounds clever.
@_date: 2013-11-15 11:33:59
Mmmm. Juicy juicy downvotes.
Let's all just bury our heads in the sand and pretend human nature isn't.

Don't give your money to people who are going to steal it.

No. Humans and computers both think, but only humans think they're thinking.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:19:01
That is exactly what I meant.

Gold. You can use it in place of lead.

That was my first thought - a sociopath would probably have succeeded. This guy sounds like he was just a thief.

God you Americans are arrogant bastards.

The circus stopped for a week or whatever it was. Government didn't.
