I think you can use Revolut to withdraw in EUR, convert to GBP then send the funds to your bank.

haha don't talk about 0.03 like that, a lot of us here probably own less :|
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:39:23
Yeah... silly me only just started getting into it and I didn't buy the $5700 dip at all (£4000). Now it would cost 3 times as much to own the same share. I remember first seeing BTC around $300 or so, price was constant back then. Then I was researching it around May but had exams then and also there were a lot of things happening around that time in the UK. Was $2000 then and I forgot about it over summer and started reading up end of October :)

bruteforced yeah, all my other accounts which had that password were broken into over the last few years but I didn't do reddit for some reason. They couldn't lock me out as I can reset it if they tried to change the password. All they could have done is use my account but looks like this was purely for vote manipulation
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:52:40
I thought that would happen when it hit 7k again, but perhaps because it isn't an all-time high this time it has not dropped below.

yeah but the transaction may take longer to be mined, as there is less reward for those processing the transaction I believe
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:45:06
Not sure myself, but perhaps see if you can find any unboxing videos and compare the packaging to your picture.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:42:59
and they've already wasted around 24 bitcoin in fees. wtf

@_date: 2017-11-29 22:33:53
you can probably transfer it for less through GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:41:21
Are you sure it isn't your bank making you pay a fee for the international transfer? My bank wanted around an extra 10 pounds just for the initial 6 euros to verify your bank so I left it. Also I think people use GDAX instead of Coinbase once you have the funds for less fees
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:44:47
Even more silly after what just happened
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:26:58
hmm, may have a look. If the transfers are SEPA only like Coinbase then I'm sorta outta luck there. UK Banks charge a bit for them

@_date: 2017-11-26 18:05:32
Is the rewards site accessible on your mobile, or just on PC? you can go to BTC wallet on the APP, and the top right is a QR icon, click that and there should be an option to copy to clipboard. Paste that on the rewards site or find a way to send it to your pc, through a messaging app or passphrase.io or something :D
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:55:48
I don't think you need to switch wallets for every transaction. You are meant to generate a new send / receive address for every transaction. That way nobody will be able to decipher how much you currently own as it will be distributed across several addresses, all linked to your wallet. I'm new to this too but believe this is how it works.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:26:35
Fair enough, what time do you finish then?

Generate an address using the app or on the site, paste it into the external source and bingo, should be fine. Check it against the address list after you've made it, may have to refresh / sign back in.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:37:20
hey again, saw you comment on another post earlier! Nice to see another guy from the UK every now and then. I was going to the same but decided to transfer to Revolut last night before it had gone crazy towards 9000 :( The transfer won't go through till tomorrow

nice one :D

Coinbase has been down for a while for maintenance and they normally get their prices from GDAX, which was trading a bit lower. Probably showing the last price Coinbase was able to display before it crashed / went into maintenance.

I thought you meant the Bank Transfer beneficiary type, personal or business when you try to send through Revolut :D Sorry if I confused you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:28:38
yeah :D I'm still getting a cheaper deal than I would have yesterday because I have been able to get onto GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:25:28
if you're a Hodler, surely it doesn't matter how quickly it reaches 10k, as long as it's stable? rather hit 10k gradually than hit it and dip to mid 8000s
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:41
I thought it was going to come up with the exponential price chart :D
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:03:16
Your transfer should go through today, I've just had one work
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:40:58
Get started information on the right hand side / community info
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:48:50
you mean like off the card or from a UK Bank? Many UK banks charge £10 or more for a single SEPA transfer
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:30:29
haha at least you're earning money to invest!
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:13:25
Check the address with blockchain :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:49:22
Everyone keeps saying there's less / no fees using GDAX I believe
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:42:12
You can't deposit GBP on Coinbase / GDAX. The abbreviation for SEPA is Single Euro Payments Area i.e. only Euros are transferred in these type of transactions. Hope this helps!
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:15:19
It will work fine, yeah I had the same thing happen when I was just messing with it! Each time you press the QR code thing it generates a new address, if you want to be 100% sure, generate a new one from the desktop app and use that. All of them should work fine as long as you copy them exactly
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:19:57
I don't see it dropping below 9000-9200
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:49:14
may be too late by then
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:51:29
well hasn't happened at 7k yet... I'd say Friday / Saturday as some people may still not know the fork was cancelled and it is around the time that it should have happened. This or 7900-8100, whichever comes first.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:59:39
Yeah you need to activate the euro account and then convert the funds from your gbp balance to euros and they'll get put in the euro account. You then can transfer to Coinbase. They only process transfers on weekdays however.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:18:30
Do you need to sign up to the exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:57:29
I don't know what you mean. You can generate a new address by going to tools I believe on Coinbase. I'm not on my PC right now. This address can then be used to deposit Bitcoin from anywhere to your Coinbase wallet. I'm pretty new to this too but I think I understand these things.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:35:51
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:19:50
bit of a funny domain as you said, also your first post on reddit :|
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:12:33
surely it doesn't take much more time to calculate how much $100 is in BTC and then send that exact same number to 5 addresses though :D
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:33:34
From a security perspective I wasn't sure that opening ports would be the safest thing, it took a few days total but fairly easy to keep up to date after 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:06:19
I actually think the same thing has happened to me too! Don't remember downvoting many if any posts on mobile accidently here.

hey, maybe you could be on to something :D
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:28:18
Yeah, I'm hoping to get some more once the transfer to Coinbase goes through. Don't think Revolut process any over weekends though
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:04:29
lmao it's 7am here
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:47
it isn't that much on Coinbase, probably isn't able to update.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:53:37
Trying blockfolio's alerts at the moment. Hopefully I'll get one for 10k or the dip :D Coinbase ones didn't work for me
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:53:12
yeah, I have that too because I'm from the UK. EUR / GBP work though I believe, don't know what your options are, maybe CAD and something else
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:02:10
So are you trying to do this on PC or on a mobile app? You should have mentioned this and where is the external source coming from? Do you need a QR code, a physical address and do you need to input it via your mobile device or through the PC :D
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:50:21
Appreciate it, my post hit about +8 points and then my karma sank :/ Probably a threshold and then the bots just zap our posts down

@_date: 2017-11-29 13:03:00
Ideally you want to use a limit buy apparently with price slightly under the current market, however if the price never dips that tiny bit, you are left with no order. I just went with market buys, still cheaper than direct from Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:32:32

would like to know as well :D
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:14:05
Yeah you have a point there, I don't see much point in trying to get the transfer cancelled now but I'll stick to the card in future, unless I hit the limit with it. Feel like I've already been burned enough, I could be wrong but I don't see anything super crazy happening before this transfer goes through. Two weeks ago on the 13th was the $5700 dip, crazy to think how far it's come since then.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:51:38
Try doing the maths! How much do you see bitcoin going up to, type an amount of bitcoin you would be able to buy right now, multiply them together. That's how much it would be worth :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:21:47
My posts are all getting caught by the spam filter at the moment I think :( I'm trying to deposit some coinbase funds into GDAX and it just keeps giving "Request has been terminated" 30 seconds later. Been doing this for the last 20-30 mins or so I keep trying
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:35:38
can't see this on the new tab, tried it with an imgur link and thought that was the problem
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:56:01
"up to" being the key phrase. you could be getting 10^-8 BTC :D
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:37:00
I managed to predict / read the charts pretty well the last few weeks, but a couple days ago didn't buy the dip at $5700-5800 and now it's nearly 7k.. Hoping on another drop once people people inevitably start selling
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:03:26
If you need convincing, you're obviously in the wrong place.

I didn't buy any when it was at a dip of £4k.. regrets now, waiting on Revolut to confirm a transfer from yesterday which won't happen till tomorrow :(
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:11:59
yeah there's been a couple posts about it, saw [this one]( yesterday!
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:44:14
yeah I did make a mod-mail at the time and they were aware of it
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:51:32
Yeah I recommend Revolut. They only do processing during the week so take this into account. My bank charges £10 for a SEPA transfer but I don't have to pay any extra fees with Revolut.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:36:18
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:44:03
the coins have been moved around multiple times to try and make it harder to trace it seems
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:37:19
Isn't it just in your BTC wallet on GDAX?
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:17:07
It wasn't far off :D
