Now that I read it again it does seem far fetched that it is real. Also, winning 17 million dollars in a casino is crazy.

I saw it come by on my Facebook feed at like 1 AM. Sleepy me didn't think or read twice. It does look ridiculous now that I see it in the fresh morning light.

I got started with Bitcoin using Coinbase. I created a wallet and I think I got a couple of cents from Coinbase (or a third party website) to try it out when I first created the wallet.
However, I can't link my bank account in my country to Coinbase, and they don't allow purchases with credit cards.
As soon as I saw that Circle opened, I linked my credit card which pretty much went flawlessly and instantly. Circle's interface is great and beautiful. Purchases with my credit card are always instant, the only thing that sucks is the 2.95% fee I have to pay.
Also, their mobile app is not available in my country (yet).

This guy is right. I have sold twice. Once via localbitcoins and once via the mycelium app. Just meet up at a coffee shop or a fast food place or something and make the exchange, wait for confirmation, and done!

I use Gyft outside the U.S. without any problems.
Their app was not available (Android) in my country, but I just downloaded it somewhere else and installed it. Their website works fine.

I can tell you that bitreserve.org is a GREAT help for people like me.
It is difficult, time consuming, and expensive for me to send money to a site like bullionvault.com or similar.
Between the fees of sending money to them, and the fees of them sending money back to my local bank account when I want to cash out my Gold, it is not a smart strategy for me. Also, it will take days and days for the whole back and forth to happen.
Now I just buy BTC with Circle via C.C. (instantly) and send it to Bitreserve to hold in Gold or Yuan.
Physical Gold Bullion is hard to come by here, and buying physical bullion online is really no option. Shipping and insuring is very expensive, and you need to pay import duties when it arrives. All in all not really worth it.
I understand that if you can walk to a coin dealer and buy some Gold coins it is easier, and that shipping and insuring shipments are considerably cheaper when buying and shipping within the US, but please remember that there are large groups of people like me out there who do not have those options, and Bitreserve is really a great alternative for us.
I am also excited for the launch of bitgold.com next month and I have been looking into coinapult locks. Please let me know if somebody has advice about the fees of bitreserve compared to coinapult and bitgold.
Edit: I am in Aruba

I would add that you can also encrypt your paper wallet for an added layer of security. In that case somebody still needs to guess your password before they can sweep you private key. I have no experience with Trezor, but I am really thinking about getting one. It seems like everybody that uses Trezor is really happy with it. Until that time I am using encrypted cold storage.

I am also using it. However, when I try to send BTC or GEMZ it gives me the error message: "No response returned from API server. Are you connected to the internet?"
Any idea how to fix this?
The rest of the app works well, and I can message everybody, just can't send BTC or GEMZ.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:09:37
Thanks for the help. I just removed it and installed the new updated version, works perfectly.
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:05:06
I am using this as well, and bought $10 worth of GEMZ in the presale. It looks good so far, but it is still in a very early phase, and not all of the functionality is there yet. 
I recommend downloading it and giving it a try. Don't be turned off if not everything is working yet. 
I think this has great potential to help BTC adoption, and so far it is a great app.

I just sent the Gems I bought in the pre-sale to my phone app, or at least a small portion of it to try out. They are manually reviewing all of the transactions and there is a 24 hour delay in which you can reply to a confirmation e-mail in order to stop the transaction.
Anybody else excited?

Can confirm that credit card from aruba works. Instant buy, no hassle, no problems, no ID or other confirmation needed. $500 limit per week with c.c.

As I have said in the other thread. I love Bitreserve. It is great for people like me in countries where direct access to physical gold, or even a gold ETF or a service like bullionvault, is almost impossible or very expensive.
Bitreserve finally allowed me to buy gold for the first time, while I have been trying for the longest time to make that happen.
I can also hold some yuan which I plan to hold on for the long term, just like my BTC. I try to spend BTC and buy back directly every chance I get, but there are not that many options for me ATM.
I would like the fees to be lower, and I hope that they can make that a reality soon. In the meantime, I will be buying BTC slowly but surely (Circle limits suck, but I get that they have rules they need to follow) and holding some bitcoin, yuan, and gold on bitreserve.
It would be even better if I could buy gold or BTC on bitreserve directly with my credit card.
I am always wondering how safe my fhnds are wherever they are stored. Some more info about how you store your BTC would be great.
Thanks for the great services, keep it up. And please expand into other commodities such as oil.

Maybe you can buy Amazon credit through Gyft.com and get 3% back, then use the Amazon credit to buy PSN membership on Amazon.com.

No faucets. I haven't used this account in a while for anything. My first thought was referrals, but I don't think I ever did any referrals either.
@_date: 2015-04-12 15:36:16
I have been using this service for a while. Works great so far. Site has great design and is easy to use. Would like to see the fees for precious metals lower, but fees for fiat money are very reasonable. 
Of course you have to trust them, you can research the fpunder, Halsey Minor I think his name is. Has founded a bunch of big companies in the past. And they are
 completely transparent with the reservechain they have. All still relies on trust.

Thanks for the heads up! I will keep doing some more research on everything.

It has worked great for me so far. I have bought 5 things off amazon with it.
Support did take 2 days to reply to my ticket, but it turned out I didn't need them, it's all pretty straight forward.
I ship to a freight forwarder in Florida, so my actual address is never revealed.

Well, vaultoro only charges 0.5% to convert to gold. Bitreserve charges 0.45% to convert to USD. That is not too bad considering the usual 2 or 3% merchant fees for credit cards. It would also allow them to keep part of their holdings in bitcoin, which is what I would do as well. Just take a chance on it with a (small) part of your holdings. As a business they may not be able to afford any extra risk.
@_date: 2015-02-24 02:52:27
Thank you very much for the info! Very clear and understandable.
Can you please do the same for Gold? I am very interested to know your findings.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:23:34
I like Bitreserve. I use them, and I have recommended them to others.
However, there are some great competitors popping up that I have been trying out.
I have been using Bitshares to buy bitGold and bitSilver. I have signed up for Bitgold and Vaultoro (both have much lower fees than Bitreserve, and I still need to check out coinapult locks.
Bitreserve has (by far) the most beautiful and user friendly website/layout. However, I think they need to start working on lowering their fees.
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:10:52
After closer inspection, the "i" in "investments" is a lower case "L".
Also looks like the time and date on the website are not in order.

I know that the volatility is an issue for them. But there are so many services that they can use to convert BTC into a more stable store of value.
Bitreserve, coinapult locks, bitshares/BitUSD, Bitgold, Vaultoro, coinjar.
Are any of these viable options for MM dispensaries?
They could just collect bitcoin and send that to bitreserve to hold in USD, and have their suppliers make accounts on bitreserve or a similar service. I mean it's a start.....
@_date: 2015-02-24 04:06:28
I have been using Bitreserve for a while, and I really like their clean design and ease of use, but I think the commission for gold is 2.4% at the moment, which seems a bit high. I haven't tried Coinapult locks yet for gold, and I have seen conflicting stories about the fees and spreads for each service and which one is cheaper.
I have also been using vaultoro.com lately instead of Bitreserve. Vaultoro has a very low 0.5% fee.
I also want to try out Bitgold.com when they open, their fee is only 1%.
I have also been playing around with bitshares and buying bitgold and bitsilver. However, bitshares has crashed a couple of times on my computer, and I had to reinstall it and download the entire blockchain again, but I think that they have a light client on the way, which would be great. The great thing about bitshares is that you get yield/interest on your holdings.
I am looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:18:10
No problem. I reported it to Google as well. I hope they take it down soon.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:13:52
You can use bitshares.
You can buy BitBTC and get interest/yield. The BitBTC is pegged to the price of BTC.
This video is a little boring, but does a pretty good job at explaining it.
You can check out current yields on 
Seems to be at 0.82% now, very low, but better than nothing. BitSilver will give you the highest interest at the moment.
It's a decentralized platform. I have just been getting into it lately. It takes some work to figure it out and get started, but it looks like it has great potential.
I got my bitshares through shapeshift.io
