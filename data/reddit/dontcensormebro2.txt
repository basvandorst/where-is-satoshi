Please tell me that Bitgo doesn't allow security modifications over their api.  If the original set (1 and 3) of multisig keys did indeed sign, then the only way this would happen is if the circuit breaker was disabled and allowing that over the api without multiple 2 factor, wait periods and notifications is ridiculous, hell it shouldn't even be allowed over an api.  Bitgo should have a damn lockdown feature where an account cannot be changed without triggering layers upon layers of manual security.

@_date: 2017-02-06 09:31:49
You miss my point, I never said all validators would cease to exist.  Secondly, I never said a POW change would be impossible, in fact, quite the opposite.  In face of such bad behavior one would be required and the community would without a doubt have enough consensus on to actually change.  So yes, the community cannot relinquish control over full validation completely to the miners, however, that doesn't mean every single person has to have that responsibility in the face of such a low probability event.  It would be akin to every person walking around with a watch to detect when gravity starts to behave badly.
I don't think miners have absolute control.  I'm simply saying that if they attempt to subvert the system then so many other assumptions fall that arguments against certain things such as SPV become minor, because the entire system is at risk.

@_date: 2017-02-17 04:08:34
It works both ways, if the miners feel the community is pushing a change that is not beneficial AND requires their zote, then why zote for it?  This political game of saying miners not zoting is political, or that they can't zote at all is going to get you nowhere, because it defies reality.
@_date: 2017-02-03 22:03:11
There is a lot of baggage there, you cannot equate their decision not to hard fork yet as any indication they don't want larger blocks.  That is not logical.  The hong kong agreement said they explicitly wanted a hard fork to larger blocks, and there have been a million other indicators.   Just one example is 
@_date: 2017-02-17 08:04:20
Sorry, it's true.  You say it's not true, then you go on to tell me why settlement network is being pushed.  4MB was determined as what the network could sustain 2 years ago. 2 years.  To not grab that capability while the technology can sustain it is backwards.

Sorry, I assumed I was dealing with someone who could reason, but since you need a lesson, here it is.
This is a logical fallacy called denying the antecedent.
if i deploy segwit, then i want bigger blocks.
i am not deploying segwit,
therefore, i don't want bigger blocks
@_date: 2017-02-17 07:59:48
You can't claim they are "demanding something" if the 1 node 1 vote still wouldn't allow segwit to pass.  That was my point.
Your two examples have the same outcome for the network.  Nothing happnens.  They are expressing their opinion about segwit by not voting for it.  While at the same time, using out of band communication for what they would like to see.  They have already stated they would run segwit.  They just want to see the non witness portion increase additionally.  For you to say that is not ok is merely your opinion, they are doing nothing outside of their rights.
@_date: 2017-02-17 07:38:40
I only pointed out the BU nodes because even if you expanded mining to one node one vote, which is about as decentralized as the network can get.  BU could reject segwit according to the 95% rule.  So to complain about miner centralization is interesting to me when that is the case.

Nobody knows, that includes both of us

They don't have the ultimate veto power.  The code you write gives them that power BY DESIGN.  All to avoid a flag day hard fork.  It is you that accept the limitations of such a design, it's not inherent to bitcoin.

vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network
All of bitcoin's security model is rested upon the miners being honest.  This only applies to when attackers overwhelm the network.   Has this ever occurred?  Everyone would know.  Entire classes of wallets would become vulnerable and obsolete.  The mining would be considered compromised and the community would switch POW.  Compromised miners can double spend against even fully validating nodes or you require some combination of sybil and evil miners.
@_date: 2017-02-17 06:08:32
That's hardly a correct analogy.  The miners are congress and the nodes are NASA?  I don't follow that.  This whole, miners don't get a vote, or miners don't have a say stuff is a little crazy to me.  They are a pillar of the network.  I mean, what would you say if the miners were 100% decentralized and segwit was rejected.  Then what?  So just because that power is now less decentralized, they don't get a say?  Hell there are enough BU nodes to reject it if every node had a vote.  Anyways, calling it a "demand" is political.  Do they really want something else???






We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, **eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork**, in production, for the foreseeable future.

Sorry, you are wrong.
12. Conclusion
We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with
the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of
ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change **if honest nodes
control a majority of CPU power.**

I'm not talking about them being dishonest outside the rules, im talking about dishonest within the rules.  Aka sybiling, and overpowering the network.


Again, the entire earth would know.  This is such a minor thing to limit the network on.  If this were to happen, bitcoin would be forced to switch pow.  Regardless of how many people are running a full node or not.

Night troll sock, bolding statements don't make them true.  I just proved it with a tweet and you had no response.
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:28:26
They don't decide, you think the miners are stupid enough to increase it and risk orphans because most of the community, including exchanges, are saying X is the highest blocksize we will accept?  The economic majority still has the option to hold their ground, just as they do today by choosing to run software that is limited to 1MB.  Just because some number is hidden away in code that can easily be changed and recompiled doesn't prevent anything.  
Notice that it doesn't mean there ceases to be debate, it just shifts it so nodes actually have a say on BOTH sides of the debate.

I have no problem with offchain, neither does BU.  I don't think it should be at the expense of main chain with what the network can handle.  I have real concerns with paying for security at a 1MB size.  The network can handle it, so I would like to see it increased.
@_date: 2017-03-09 00:39:24

@_date: 2017-03-12 19:01:44
I'm still not sure I follow, how do you eliminate the effective increase but still give signatures some kind of discount on data while also not penalizing non signature data?

"We" as in you and a few developers that think they own the network?
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:52:17
don't be fooled, segwit is a malleability fix while giving heavy signature transactions a subsidy so off chain transactions can be pushed.  The effective increase is merely a token to push segwit.  Aka "segwit IS a blocksize increase", just like "LN IS a Bitcoin transaction".  Lol
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:42:09
This applies to softforks too.  It's still possible for an old node to see two chains, if a majority hashpower disagrees with a softfork and mines a block that is not valid according to the new rules.  If the "new" rule chain has less hashpower, you are knowingly committing unupgraded nodes off the "true" (from your perspective) network.
@_date: 2017-02-03 23:28:29
It's not politics.  Core has a very different vision than that of most that want bigger blocks.  Arguing over consensus is fine.  As you point  out, risks must be weighed against benefits.  What you seem to discount is that the risk to network health is static.  It's not, at some point the benefits will outweigh the risks, and that is where we will see something happen.  Good luck
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:07:54

@_date: 2017-02-02 10:21:19
Those aren't all companies...case in point the very first item.
	1200wd	wip	**library**
Yes, a software library.  How many of those libraries have segwit in their mainline?  I'm going to go with ZERO.  Now having a branch ready with segwit is only prudent to your customers IF it gets activated.  Even if I hated segwit and i maintained a bitcoin library I would maintain a branch that had supporting changes so I could at least say I was ready, but I certainly wouldn't merge it to my mainline.  That's exactly why you see the status for all those as 'WIP', meaning it's a branch that is work in progress, or 'READY' meaning the pull request is ready to be merged.
This list is a little silly.  Just to pick out one... Bitcoin Knots is listed there, great, Luke has his fork of bitcoin core ready that barely anyone runs.
@_date: 2017-03-09 01:37:13
I do not agree with blockweight as a solution to utxo 'bloat', because it opens signature stuffing attack vectors and creates two classes of transactions, at a discount!.  Imagine many millennium in the future we want to increase the blocksize.  *GASP*  I can just hear it now..."We can't increase it because the blockweight discount allows for an adverserial case that the network can't handle!"
Effective doubling also requires the entire ecosystem to use segwit.  While that may happen after a while, realistically that would take years.  We don't have years.
Finally, I don't want to be in the same place, when in the future it is time to increase it again.  BU is a solution to that.
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:06:49

The fact they were so eager to simply drop his name from the summons exposes their motivation.  (How do they even know he is a Coinbase customer?  Did they verify it or simply take his word?)  After all, why drop his name except only to escape the court from actually looking at it.

All fine and dandy Dave, but if you guys lose the case against the IRS and have to hand data over and you classify everyone's transfer as a sale the worry is that they will say "see here, coinbase says you sold the bitcoin, so pay up" when nothing could be further from the truth.  Are you required to classify them as sales?  If instead of a bitcoin company you were a gold company and i requested you mail me the gold, that is not a sale.  Why is bitcoin any different?  You guys have no basis qualifying these transfers as sales.

Essentially the data the IRS will get will be completely wrong and will not match the tax reports I have submitted at all.  So the IRS comes to me and says hey you sold this many bitcoins on this date, you owe us money.  I say no, I transferred those to a wallet under my control.  Now what?  I have to prove it?  Do I have to sign a message with the private keys to those bitcoin to show they are under my control?  Does the IRS even have the capability to verify something like that?

@_date: 2016-12-16 10:31:10
BU makes something that is not configurable today (the blocksize), configurable per node.  You in fact have this power today, go grab the code from whatever repository you want and modify it, then run it.  If you can accept that fact, then why is surfacing that through configuration so scary to you?  Really anything can be changed, even *gasp* the 21M limit.  All I really think you are saying is you are afraid because it makes it easy?

He was banned for spamming the sub, then created many alts to get around the ban.  I watched him create 20-30 posts over a 5 hour period.  He was basically asking for a ban, then immediately after being banned ran over here and complained.  @_date: 2016-11-29 07:08:23
No, not all money can do what Bitcoin does in terms of transacting.  Also if demand is infinite as many claim then increasing it is not a problem as there will still be more demand than supply, it's just that the network will be able to handle more users/use cases.  So yeah, it actually does work that way.  If you can free yourself from 1 -&gt; 2 or 1 &gt; 8 from equaling infinity then that is a start.

If it's never going to happen then you have nothing to worry about, good day
@_date: 2016-11-28 04:31:47


Holy cow, is this really who you think you are to Bitcoin?  Our savior?
@_date: 2016-12-03 00:09:15
Ability to categorize transaction on the fly right as you send it would be nice too. (Sale, Transfer, Gift)
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:15:01
You do not pay tax on transfers.  The issue here is can the IRS even tell the difference?  For instance, the transfer went out, they have no idea if you bought something or transferred it to a personal wallet.  That is the issue.  Now you can prove ownership with a signature, but is the IRS really going to go around demand signatures from everybody to prove they still control the bitcoin?  Do they even have the technical capability to handle stuff like this?  Bitcoin is exposing the tax system for what it is.  My feeling is the tax system is going to have to bend first because Bitcoin sure isn't.

I'm not a liar, you are just blind, that was intentionally put there.

What is your point?  He found a bug to fix?  Great.  I am not treating him as anything, just bitcoins structure.
@_date: 2016-12-22 03:54:35
If you say so
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:05:13
Unless it comes from the one true repo Core?
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:22:04
Nice regurgitation, if BU is 99% Core code what exactly does this say?
@_date: 2016-12-07 04:51:02
Banning you for spamming is entirely different than showing an opinon, stop trying to make a comparison where there is none.
@_date: 2016-12-03 00:02:22
Thank you, I would recommend that you modify the reporting available to your customers to default outgoing transactions as a transfer instead of a sale.  Perhaps some way of going to history and marking specific transfers as sales would help in reporting so that categorization of a sale is opt in, instead of opt out.  Or make that configurable.

This is all under the great assumption that the software you produce represents the will of the users.

I see, thanks
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:47:50
So you are hung up on what they call it?  That's your beef?  Do you understand what they even mean by that?
@_date: 2016-12-17 01:19:54
Lay it down for me, tell me what I don't understand
@_date: 2016-11-28 04:33:52


So regardless of merit, you want to criticize any and all hard forks?
@_date: 2016-12-07 04:58:26
No, it's not tough.  Moderating a sub for spam is very easy to distinguish from moderating a sub for opinion.

Speaking of that tweet, Luke hasn't had a commit on his repo since July.  Clock is ticking.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:45:25
LOL so luke can make posts about how XT is an altcoin (utter bullshit) this guy can't respond with the letters XT?  This sub has become complete shit where core feeds you guys propoganda.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:52:56
It's pretty obvious they have decided to call XT an altcoin in order to minimize it.   It's pure propoganda and core devs stomping their feet crying how the community won't listen to them.
Please don't tell me you really believe that some economic minority would continue to use the old chain because they believe in it.  That is pure fantasy.
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:12:11
Yeah they can't seem to argue the merits so they switch to propoganda by calling it an altcoin which they know has a bad connotation.
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:07:31
good luck with your hard fork
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:35:34
So explain the difference between the hardfork and xt.  
Is the only difference that you assume everyone abandons the old fork in the core SANCTIONED hard fork?  You assume the economic majority is not in support of XT?
Bad assumptions IMHO.
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:39:30
I really hope core tries this.  It would be a springboard for XT.
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:33:18
This is where people have such a problem with the LN.  It's clear you think that bit coin should be stunted to allow LN to work.  If LN is so great why can't it derive it's fees from the utility of instant transactions?  Why does it also have to be subsidized by an artificial limit.  If we go down thia path it is going to choke miners, reduce security, centralize payments and reduce adoption.  Sounds like a great future.  Is this what you call elegant?
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:41:31
I see what you are saying now.  Instant transactions are not everything.  Slower on chain transactions would be preferred over instant for several reasons.  Control over op return, multisig, stealth payments, time locked transactions, privacy (not going through centralized hubs that require identification), and a million other reasons.
I'm curious also how you think ALL the current bitcoin services and wallets designed to operate on chain would work in this theoretical environment.  Would they all need to be thrown out and redesigned?
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:59:08
Why do you call it clumsily?  Because it's not core sanctioned?  It's been discussed for years and Gavin released the code with tests (for 20MB) then backed off 20 to 8 for a compromise.  It's only this way because core wants to take bitcoin in a new direction than Satoshi wanted.  They released a piece of software and people are free to run it.  I'm really sorry if the market chooses to run it.
@_date: 2015-08-23 06:18:42
If some future system can give us instant transactions then great, but it isn't here today.  The blockchain bloat you speak of are real transactions.  Much greater resource consumption?  Look if a raspberry pi with an average internet connection and average storage device can handle 8MB blocks I'm not sure what to tell you.  There is an urgency to do it, because users will start experiencing problems by next year and no other solution is anywhere near solving the problem.  It takes a long time for forks to roll out and they have to be started earlier than they are needed.
The LN alternative you speak of is YEARS away.  It has it's own problems and unsolved questions.  Pushing users off chain for the sake of scalability was NOT Satoshi's vision at all, and for the LN guys to come out and claim this is the way it has to be is going forward is going to meet serious resistance which is what you are seeing today.
If that growth rate outpaces what the community is not comfortable with it can be soft fork limited.  8GB wouldn't happen for 20 years.  Do you know what the biggest hard drive was 20 years ago?  It was 1GB.  You can now get 8TB and 16TB is right around the corner.  That's a growth of 8,000 times.  Equivalent by 2036 by the same scale would be 64-128 Petabytes.
So yes, bitcoin can scale as is, we just have to give it time.  The nice thing is that we don't need it to scale to VISA levels yet.

Let me clarify..."Please dont tell me you really believe THERE IS A POSSIBILITY that some..."
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:49:38
I'm aware of that, i was responding to the guy who was implying you could get banned for using [REDACTED] instead of XT in a reply.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:54:47
Sorry man, we call bullshit where we see it.  The censoring is really what did it, people don't react well to censoring.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:59:46
It's highly relevant.  Look at your image next to the hardfork.  You say "Everyone chooses to abandon old chain".  Please explain to me why they chose to abandon the old chain?  It's because they followed the majority.  And the same thing would happen with XT if it kicks in, so those two examples are equivalent.
Thus your only distinction between the two is in your own mind.  In your mind hard fork 0.8.1 was a sanctioned hardfork by core, and everyone magically switches over.  You can't seem to accept the fact that the same would happen with XT and you are so so wrong.

@_date: 2016-09-23 15:51:13
A BIP is not an idea, it is a design document.  Secondly, they are not good or bad, they merely follow the BIP process.  Why do you attach such connotation to this particular one?  You should correct your statement.  See here -&gt;

This is widely agreed to be not from Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-10-20 02:20:19
Asymmetric.  SPV wallets don't have to upgrade and they get access to the full capacity change with no dependencies.
@_date: 2016-10-19 23:10:52
Id love to see your data on that
@_date: 2016-10-19 23:11:55
It's not misinformation, it's not honest to say we are going to get a meaningful increase right off the bat and you know it.  It will take a long time.
@_date: 2016-10-19 22:50:21
Yes, and all the wallets and software and infrastructure that has been built up over seven years is all up to date too, so we will immediately get an increase..  umm no
@_date: 2016-10-21 02:59:22
How are you willing to concede the second point yet claim somehow your fees will be less for sure?  Yes, the policy only counts a portion of the witness data, but miners are not bound by that policy.  You are competing for space on the chain, if you are the only one sending segwit transactions, the extra space is extremely small.
@_date: 2016-10-20 01:58:49
The fees are policy, and most miners have their own policy.  The capacity available is dependent on other users using segwit or not.
@_date: 2016-10-23 07:46:47
Before you go about telling someone they have little technical knowledge, it would be wise to understand what you are talking about.
"Segwit improves the situation here by making signature data, which does not impact the UTXO set size, cost 75% less than data that does impact the UTXO set size."
On the basis of upgrading, you again don't understand what it means for something to be policy.  Miners can decide freely what transactions to include in their blocks.  They could require 1M satoshis per byte if they wanted.  The protocol does not enforce what fees will or will not be accepted.  The Bitcoin Core software may decide that on your behalf if you choose to run it as is as a miner, but most miners have their own modified software they run.
We are talking about FEES here, not what data is counted towards the limit.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:49:17
This is simply not true man.  How much extra capacity will you be able to access when Segwit goes out if you are the only one sending Segwit transactions?
@_date: 2016-10-20 01:56:10
That's great and all, but the rollout will take a while.  History says this is true.  That is the reality whether you want to accept it or not.
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:58:46
What?  The capacity increase is for just that, more capacity.  Has nothing to do with fees.  They changed some code to alter the fee POLICY which means miners are in no way bound to that policy.  Miners are free to accept ANY valid transaction with ANY fee.
