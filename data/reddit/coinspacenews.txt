Hoping so! All signs are looking good right now.
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:55:46
That's correct.  The report is published here: 
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:49:52
That's more along the lines of what I thought. I was seeing a lot of FUD yesterday about how they fired their auditor, and was thinking, "Who cares! Who even uses Tether?"
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:16:47
I don't even know if it would cause that big of a dip.  People said the same about bitconnect and that just went under.. good riddance. It dropped 2.5billion in market cap.  The crypto market as a whole barely budged. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:01:49
Can you explain to me why people are so worried about Tether? I don’t think it would be that bad. There’s 2.5B Tether circulating. If it went to zero, yeah the market would lose 2.5B and some people would be pissed but the market fluctuates more than that every day. Am I missing something that would make this have a bigger impact?

My first target is 13.5k within a week, then 16k early Feb.

No just to post crypto news

Good point and could be the case. It will be interesting to watch through the year to see if there are patterns. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:44:06
Thx for the link. Interesting
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:54:56
Binance doesn't use Tether. I only know of Bittrex and Bitfinex. Still, if Tether went to zero I don't see it impacting the market a whole lot.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:43:08
Interesting take. Thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:02:07
haha.. whoops.  Thanks for posting.  It's corrected.
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:33:13
I would be interested in seeing this if you can find it.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:13:23
idk.. I don't know anyone that uses Tether.  I know it's offered as a trading pair on Bittrex, Bitfinex and Cryptopia but majority of traders trade off of BTC, not Tether.  I still don't see it having a big impact if it went away. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:31:08
Love it
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:27:28
You’re right! I had pasted it and lost the paragraphs in the process.  Corrected it. Thanks
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:15:25
Ohhhh. ��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:39:06
No it’s 19 million worth of btc at the current price.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:05:57
frickin Bob!
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:21:11
It’s good to know that the BTC was distributed and that the market absorbed but scary that they still hold way more than he dumped. Also need to note that there are many other whales that can do the same thing. This means the market will be subject to these crashes for some time. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:15:13
No, this shouldn’t have much impact on trading price at all. Purchasers will be investors that want to hold.  Nobody would buy them go dump the next day. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:01:24
Google would be your friend but you’ll likely need a lot of money to participate. The US Marshals are auctioning off over 2000 btc March 19th but need a $200k deposit to participate.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:11:08
here's your bob: 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:03:41
But I hope it's not true because this is the last thing this market needs right now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:03:27
Yeah the media seems to really be after btc right now. It’s quite interesting. But I agree it will become old news soon and should start creeping back up then once it hits another parabolic break the cycle continues I guess?
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:23:22
So funny! What terrible hackers
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:40:57
Very true. All the investors that I value their TA have said 8.4k would be very important.  If BTC doesn't hold 8.4k we go to the mean uptrend at 6k.  If it falls below that we are officially F%$
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:24:12
Well I guess it would depend on how good of a deal they got. If they bought way under market they could dump for profit. But I’m not worried about it. They’ve done auctions like this before
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:46:31
That’s what I figured.  People just spreading rumors.  Thx
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:02:28
Just tested $8.4k again..
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:02:57
Hahaha. �� 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:22:00
I hope others will learn from this and sell OTC or auction next time there’s a situation like this.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:51:07
Yes, my reasoning about the marketcap was wrong.  I researched more.  If Tether went out much more than 2.5 billion would be pulled. But I still think the worry is exaggerated.  Tether can go to zero and of course the market would dip, but it wouldn't be the end. Nothing can stop blockchain.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:04:25
Nice chart! As you can see from the chart if this is a crash we still have some ways to go.  If it’s a correction then we’re probably about done.
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:45:54
There’s no article, it’s just people posting on threads. I figured it was just FUD but wanted to verify. I have my BofA linked to Coinbase.  It’s how go in and out of fiat/crypto
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:15:50
Wow this is nuts. I don’t like that they still have so much left.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:21:05
I call that unrealistic.. but who knows? I personally don't see it going any lower than $6k before a reversal. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:01:08
Nice way to look at it
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:56:13
Let me know when I can check blockfolio again.. lol. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:55:28
Exactly, hoping they take notes
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:50:47
Interesting take, I think you're probably right.  We wont see another parabolic spike for quite some time after this shook all the new investors and probably scared away some potential new ones.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:02:24
I sold at 12.8k then bought back two days ago.  Just hodling through the losses now. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:18:44
Good point here
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:03:10
Check the Binance board.  Many people are posting about their accounts being manipulated.  Not trying to spread FUD but I think this is true.  The VIA pump makes absolutely no sense otherwise.
