Looks like 3 different people puked in a tray, then threw some rice in for good measure.. Wtf

Indeed. Do it yourself. Free money! What are you waiting for????

How many customers on average do you have per month?

Just glance at the for a few seconds...

I don't see these price predictions going anywhere until there are nation wide (We see this in California so far.) regulations in place, validating it's legitimacy as a currency. There are lots of businesses that accept it now, which is great, but these businesses aren't doing anything with it but giving it back to BitPay or Coinbase. They really have no reason to hold it. It is nothing but a glorified payment processor right now... With huge potential of course.
There will also need to be some sort of breakthrough tool that offers ease of use. Currently, it is very difficult for someone new to the protocol to pick it up without doing extensive amounts of research. This hurts bad.

Thought about this... But people also need incentive to use bitcoin so it gains adoption. These companies aren't going to be saving anything on fees if people aren't actually using it

Second Bank of America. I've been doing weekly buys straight out of my bank account to Coinbase for years.

Can you just send your coins from a current wallet to a segwit wallet with no issue?

I'm worried about trusting torrents.. I reformatted this laptop and the only thing I've downloaded is Chrome and bitcoin core just for security reasons and I'll probably keep it that way
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:05:32
Let us know if you're buying. Will avoid. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:38:56
Ahh thanks!

I feel like if we're ever going to see prices $10,000+ then the volitilty​ will have to increase even more..
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:12:27
How do you launch it like that? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:27:52
What are potential opportunities here?
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:39:17
Thank you! Might have to try
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:17:27
How does something like this affect the value? Will each chain be valued where BTC is today with only one chain keeping current prices while the other falls? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:03:31
Nothing happens. You can collect your BCC with your current private key in a wallet that supports it.

My recent withdrawal took about 30 minutes
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:24:44
See, the shipping fee is 26 euro.. That is kind of unreasonable. I'd prefer Amazon prime shipping. When will that be available again? Or do you have US warehouses that will ever get stock again? I can't pay 26 euro to ship something like that.

I'd love to get a trezor, but I've been waiting for the Trezor 2 to drop. I don't want to buy the first gen of the second gen is so close. I'm very conflicted - when is the new version going to drop? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:19:18
Thanks for adding that.. I feel better about just getting a trezor 1 right now as opposed to waiting
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:54:38
So, I just looked at the bitcoin store and it says not shipping until August. Where can a trezor be bought and shipped within the next week or two? I'm in the US and hoping to not pay outrageous shipping fees.

I just bought a raspberry pi and am completely new to it, but my plan is to have all of my wallets on it. Is Linux (raspbian) safe enough even if I connect it to the Internet? I don't plan on using the pi for anything else other than crypto storage
@_date: 2017-06-28 12:22:27
What happens if you rebroadcast it? This happened to me the other day and I saw a feature on electrum to increase the fee, so I did and it said I double spent. Is that bad? 
@_date: 2013-12-30 07:43:58
 accepts Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:15:12
You just made my point
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:44:19
Gold is measured by weight, not quantity. Bitcoin is measured by quantity, so you can have 100 "bitcoins." Would you say, "I have twenty dollar?" Bitcoin is not gold so I don't get your analogy.
