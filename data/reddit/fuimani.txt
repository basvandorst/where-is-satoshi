It means that the *price* **at one point** *was* (# of coins/1,000,000,000).

A much better metric for the Americans would be the Pratty - 1/116th of a Bitcoin. Further, you can split the Pratty into nine Centoes.

Hey; I've already bought a 2000$ arithmetic calculator and 500$ books. What's a million-dollar synth?

why are some people so obsessed with getting money for stupid reddit posts

But aren't you all just glorified apes?

I've bought a few second-hand hard disks and always flip through them.
Old owners are interesting, I tell you.

That's the only thing fully pictured that I already had, incidentally.
EDIT: clarity (no pun intended)

Correction: This *has a good side* for Bitcoin. This is not intrinsically and all good, nor is it necessarily good overall at all.

Reminds me alot of Apple's newest Mac Pro - heat sink for multiple PCBs/chips in the center and a single fan to cool it all. It's awfully elegant.

My bull boner is getting huge. This might be bad.

Are we using "bits" here as an alternative to uBTC? I can work with that.
EDIT: SI units

This post got me off of my ass and got me to secure everything today. Thank you.

Pretty sweet artwork you have. You might want to use higher-resolution thumbnails, though, as they look particuarly fuzzy on your site.
Good luck!

Although still a bastardized way of doing things, I went through Gyft to buy it from Amazon. Buying it using fiat would have been a hassle at best for reasons I don't want to go over.
Took me quite some time to decide to just buy the thing - and sure enough, we hit 600$ not but a few weeks later. Not my problem - I have my synth :)

I figured as much, but thanks for the clarification. It's one of the better terms I've heard so far.

I wish I could say I've been here for awhile. Still a fun place!

Credit cards aren't stolen because they're "dangerous". They're stolen because people steal things.

This is my shorter, public key(board). I have a 58-key MIDI keyboard that I dare not show anyone.

what genius posts of yours do you deserve a paycheck for?
or mine? or really anyone's?
EDIT: rather, a better question
why would this even be a cryptocurrency? why would you go through the trouble of creating and maintaining one with miners and storing a blockchain when you could make a simple value in your database labeled "bullshitkarmacoins"?

I understand the "troll account" part, but not "anti-Bitcoin." I didn't find it humorous at all despite my pro-Bitcoin standpoint.
@_date: 2014-08-02 15:34:26
if reddit's going to do something for the cryptocurrency world, one of the worst things it could possibly conceive is making *yet another damn* altcoin so users could pull in an income

Sounds like it's asking for exploitation. "Mining farms" go from buildings with rigs spewing out heat to

"Alex Daley, chief technology strategist of Casey Research, a financial research firm, says that the FBI already owns between 5% and 10% of all Bitcoins."
Somehow I doubt this is true.

"A promise to pay the bearer" makes less sense here than it does in the fiat world of things.

I usually don't buy on such a whim, but you have music I like and support Bitcoin. Thanks!

People who equate error density and intelligence aren't, in my eyes, too valuable.

It's a good-looking and apparently functional site, and any legit Bitcoin service is a good one, but overall it's rather fishy. The lack of HTTPS is particuarly offputting, and the website is generally sluggish at best.

Why is this being downvoted? This is probably the most honest statement I've seen all day.

Thus far, 0GH/s, -0.0579 BTC/day. Pretty good for a little noise machine.
