Lmao, from 2003-2007. You're like the guy who told me that buying bitcoin was a bad idea because it crashed from 2013-2016. Nice cherry picked 4-year timeframe.
You could've bought at the peak of the market and lost the maximal amount, and be up MAJOR right now. Don't spout bullshit nonsense advice that having a house is not an intelligent idea.

Not being able to import keys is pretty shitty, for sure.
Not being able to set fees  is also shitty. However, I usually set up the tx, then see what the fee is. If it's too high (i.e. .001 btc) then I just don't transact (since the bitcoin network itself is also unusable at those fees, as far as I'm concerned)

Uh, no, the waiters are being screwed over by the restaurant which refuses to pay a fair, living wage.
Here in California, servers make the state minimum ($10/hr) and the tips are gravy on top of that. There's plenty of jobs which pay just the $10/hr, so waiters are actually getting a pretty good deal. You're just justifying a shitty, fucked up practice by blaming that guy instead of the restaurant for royally screwing over the employees. 
That being said, I always tip, but it's a stupid, shitty institution that screws over both patrons and servers.

Hmmm, yeah silly math mistake, but, I'd expect an engineer to: 
1. Be able to realize that $180k USD is well above the 'medium end' of engineering salaries (national average is ~$80k/year, I'm not sure what kind of statistics class you must've taken to call $180k 'medium end') 
2. Be able to realize that that's absolutely nowhere near the Japanese engineer salary
3. Be able to use google to verify the above, and also do 10-second research to see that the average engineer salary in Japan is ~$50,000 USD 
So yeah, the article/title is complete bullshit still. Even doctors in Japan don't make $180,000 on average.

Not necessarily. He's not making a prediction. He's simply saying there's a considerable amount of days of it being over 1000.

I see. So I suppose if one used a foreign coin exchange, no one would ever know what they did trading the currency back and forth...

Digicash is Friendster. Bitcoin could still be MySpace, even if I hope it's Facebook
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:29:14
Fair enough and I agree with your premise. However, I still think it's arguable that if fees increase considerably from their current level, it will affect decentralization and bitcoin will more easily be controlled by a fewer number of whales who can throw around their weight. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:35:30
Increased transaction fees are **bad**. Bitcoin was supposed to be the cryptocurrency that allows you to buy a coffee and maybe pay a couple cents fee. If bitcoin's fees get to the point that people can't move around $5-$10 without having to second guess whether the transaction is "worth it", a crucial part of Bitcoin will have died.
edit: to the downvoters - you are certainly more than free to disagree and consider me a moron who doesn't understand bitcoin. That's fine. But if you could explain your reasoning as to *why* you disagree, that would be very beneficial, and I do believe it's the point of this topic. Not once have I ever claimed to be an expert on bitcoin; I'm simply expressing my opinion from the very limited understanding of bitcoin that I have. 
To back up my thinking a little bit, I've found that the bitcoin discussion is heavily dominated by users from the US, Western Europe, and China, with complete disregard for current and potential users in developing nations with weak economies, or even good economies with weak currency. You and I may barely give a fuck about a $1 fee, but that's can become a *substantial* amount when we're talking about the Venezuelan Bolivar or the Indian Rupee or the Nigerian Naira. Thus I do find increasing fees quite problematic.
Again, I'm not claiming I'm Bitcoin Jesus or any kind of expert - and I'd appreciate a response detailing your reasoning rather than a hivemind, reactionary downvote.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:44:25
Hah, this is a great response.
People will twist anything to mean anything. BU seems like a major fail after that bug but people are getting downright *religious* with this shit. 
Let's make this about bitcoin, and not about politics or getting personal.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:41:51


Well, they still have to worry about computer security of the investment account ;)
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:39:57
I agree with that. One interesting thing is that each of the 'fractal cycles' of bitcoin have shown a huge spike, a major crash, then a slow growth to the previous peak... which triggers the next spike. However, this time the slow growth has surpassed the previous peak, but without the next 'spike' being triggered. 
I can't imagine the ETF approval would cause bitcoin to jump more than $2000 or so, it's already "priced in" so to speak. So I wonder what will be the next spike trigger. Something after that will surely result in another crash as well. I think your prediction of a temporary fall to $500 is very possible.

If when you win, you win $6, but when you lose, you lose $10, you're essentially playing the house, and the house always wins. Lots of people who tried switching their money in and out of BTC in 2014/2015/part of 2016 came out under. Of course if you bought in at $100 then you're looking good, but the fact remains taxes are a killer and it makes more sense to just leave money in BTC, at least in my opinion.

Taleb is a nice author and worth reading but my god is he a pretentious bastard with an inflated sense of self worth and a toxically high level of ego. He even mentions "the IYI thinks this means everyone is an idiot but it's just them" no, not really, he paints with too broad a brush stroke and pretty much does talk shit on everyone. 
Again, I just bought antifragile and finished The Black Swan and the author of the Bitcoin piece definitely fits Taleb's IYI but I think one would be hard pressed to find a person who does *none* of the things Taleb bitches about, other than Taleb himself perhaps.

Are you sure this is true? Let's say you had GBP, traded it for USD a day before Brexit, re-traded the USD for a greater amount of GBP, and now that GBP is higher than immediately-post brexit, you trade it yet once again back to USD, netting an overall increase in your amount of USD.
I do not believe you would be subject to tax liability at any point during this process. Why is it different for bitcoins to altcoins?

In the US you'll have to pay taxes when jumping from BTC to USD; I don't think it makes sense to sell BTC for USD if you are long, unless it's like that other guy's case where he paid off his kids' debt. Very good use of money in that circumstance.

Exactly. People need to realize were it not for this guy and people like him who transacted huge numbers of bitcoin for relatively (in retrospect) cheap items, we wouldn't be where we are today.

I have no rebuttal, but basically shat on the topic OP's post without actually offering any contrary views on the matter.

The irony is palpable and delicious. Why don't you learn to construct a grammatically correct sentence before calling someone else a moron. But based upon your comprehension skills (I spoke of the difference between a 10x and 1000x engineer, you retorted with some nonsense about "no engineer, no product" which was... a strawman, go fucking figure, irony times two) that may be asking too much of you.

Let me guess, you're a software engineer too. Software engineers are absolutely notorious for overstating their own importance and minimizing others'. It's easy to think you're all that matters when you work in a software company with little to no hardware, supply chain, operations management, failure analysis, sourcing, etc. Things get a little different outside of the computer monitor.


Except I do since I am an engineer with an advanced degree in the field.

Idk what about his post is "misinformation" really. I am one of the few who visits both subs. I like this one since r/btc focuses more on the "bitcoin war" more than the adoption of the technology overall, but the post is quite accurate it seems. It's not like the censorship never happened.

The easiest way I've explained this to people is *not* by discussing fractions or decimals of a bitcoin. I've lost people by saying the words ".001 bitcoin". Instead, a simple one-liner is all it takes.
"You can buy $20 worth of bitcoin if you want".
You can see the gears turning in their head _immediately_. Highly recommended to use 'you can buy $20/$50/$100 worth of bitcoin' to explain this concept.

Is it? I haven't sold a single BCH I've received since the chain split. 
Since then, my BCH has gone from ~$400, to a price today about $1600. People say a bitcoin is worth $8600 right now, but really, it's worth $10,200 as far as I'm concerned. I see no reason to sell either BTC or BCH right now. 
Looks like you're the fool if you didn't hodl your bitcoin cash...

I say it in jest (I use robinhood myself) but there's an element of truth. Robinhood is the only US broker to offer zero-cost commissions but on the flip side it's got the least features and is unequivocally the worst trading platform if you ignore price. Anyone who has money to trade can and does use a better platform, or a human financial advisor/broker. 
People have $100 and $1000 Robinhood portfolios while on E*TRADE, Charles Schwab, etc a $20,000 portfolio would be considered small.
robinhoods user base, generally speaking, is not the type that would be able to go out and buy even 0.5 btc.

Wow, I completely disagree. You're perfectly fine with them taking massive chunks of your paycheck? The $2000 extra in their pocket didn't come for free, they spent valuable time and skills in order to get that money. 
Why would you pay using bitcoin when 
1. We believe the price of bitcoin is likely to go up, therefore you're losing out on "more" than you paid for
2. You already have fiat lying around 
3. You're taxed on your crypto gains for the purchase

2. Pay your taxes on the gains
that's it.

The fees are 4x lower on gemini (perhaps more than that) so even if the customer service gets as bad, it's still a better platform.
This would of course be re-evaluated if they raise fees.

My coworker today was like "what's ethereum based on?" 
I replied the ecosystem, and nothing else.
He said well that sucks, at least bitcoin is based on gold.
I replied bitcoin is based on the ecosystem, and nothing else.
I'm not sure if I got my point across.

You don't actually know what happened then, do you? 
Of course there was no body. The FBI posed as a hitman, and staged the murder, then once they confirmed the "murder", they were paid out for the execution.

Wtf why would you even say "you do you" to me when I said I was holding lmao. And how do you know sell in May and go away doesn't apply to BTC?
Anyway you said "this is the path you have chosen" like he's a monk who has left the monastery. Or a man who's father and grandfather and so forth were all doctors and he chose to become an artist. You sound like Obi Wan talking to Anakin after he decided to follow the Sith. It's pretty humorous, actually.

Gemini has lower fees and is more reputable IMO

edited. Meant to say fees are 4x lower ON gemini, not than gemini.

Haven't used it, only used Coinbase, Gemini, and Poloniex
Polo is nice because it offers a LOT of coins. People call it "the pumphouse" though so you should be careful if you're on it. Pump and dumps on it all day. The major coins with high volumes are about the same you'll see on other exchanges though.

You can't simply state 'slippery slope fallacy' and dismiss an argument. It does apply in certain scenarios when people are comparing unlike things (i.e. "if we let homosexuals marry, next people will marry animals, and after that they'll marry cars!") however it does apply in many cases... for example this one, or debt. When the US was only in $500,000 national debt, and someone argued for reducing it, with the argument "next it'll be $5 million in debt, then $500 million after that"
Smug borrowers would have looked at each other, dismissed the guy with a "slippery slope fallacy lol" statement, and patted each other on the back. Yet here the U.S. is with a $13+ trillion dollar debt. The slippery slope exists. The *fallacy* is using it in places it cannot be applied ("if we allow police to set up DUI checkpoints, next they'll take away our guns!")
The virtue signaling, sure, but he has a point about the blocksize. Why would the blocksize increase stop?

That's.... quite concerning, to say the least.

Thanks... couple more questions.
First I use breadwallet and gemini. I've never one seen a prompt or screen or any other way to set the tx fees. Where does one see their tx fee or set it?
Second, what's stopping everyone from doing low fees? Kind of seems broken if you can explicitly set a 0tx fee that never confirms.
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:59:16
This is the kind of good, educational, well-thought-out rebuttal I come to this sub for. Bravo.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:51:16
Thanks but still wanted to clarify a thing or two.
So the guy signed a transaction with his private key, and the resulting public key/public signature is what showed up at the bottom? 
Also when I've sent btc transactions from wallet to another, it just sends the money. I've never seen a way to send a message, how would one do that?
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:33:05
He does seem to be disingenuous with what he's asking, either that or communication is not his strong suit.

I wouldn't consider that dollar cost averaging, then. If you only have $100 to invest once a month, and you invest all of it immediately, I don't think that's DCA. If you have $12,000 to invest and split it into 12 $1000 sums, that would be DCA.
