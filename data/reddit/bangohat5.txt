Bitcoin will be on sale when it hits 30 dollars. What is with you clowns? These coins are just scams, just like the stock market. The top dogs want you to donate to them because they got in early :) People bought bitcoin around 20k. while guys sold for that price and paid like 100 dollars for it :) If crypto is alive in another 5 years I wont' believe it. No coins have any value but in all fairness, no stocks do either. They are all ponzi schemes. IF Apple makes 100 trillion and nobody buys the stock the price won't move up. Welcome to reality :) The only stocks that have value are ones that give dividends so I'm banking on neo and other coins like that.

If fiat dies so does bitcoin. We cash out our bitcoin for fiat so if fiat is worthless then so is bitcoin. You don't want the dollar to collapse.

Thanks for reminding me. I love watching the black Friday animals on youtube fighting and trampling each other like wild monkeys.

Sounds like you lost a ton, so angry. I'll wait until it hits 200 and buy some.

Bitcoin is a great store of value. Pretty sure just putting money in the bank would be better. Say you had 20k in bitcoin and decided to take 10k out to buy something then woke up the next day and only had 10k left because it crashed. That's not a store of value. Crypto is not different then the stock market, the more money invested the higher the price moves up. Now a smart person I know is some old lady that lives near me and she invested over 50 years ago and only invested in companies that gave dividends and has been living off them for who knows how long. Can't even imagine what here stocks are worth today if she sold them all.
