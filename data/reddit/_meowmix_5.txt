What are you talking about internet gangster? Like I said grow up kid.
*Edit I now see you are just a crypto noob that deletes all his posts and has insecure issues as a mid 20 year old with a weirdo girlfriend. Yea I can see why you are mad at life.
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:15:36
For you maybe. Turns out you are not the only type of specific human in the world. Crazy right?!?!?
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:59:09
How do you know that was all of it? When you assume you make a ass out of mostly just you.
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:18:58
Ok cool just downvote because everybody doesn't interpret/understand something the same way you do. Grow up kid.

Sounds like a scammer looking for donations. If you had 22btc you are either rich or got in early and either way should know better. You are either scamming yourself or deserve it for ignorance.

@_date: 2018-09-20 00:33:10
Kinda like how hackers created more EOS? Maybe they are confusing that with BTC.
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:11:56

@_date: 2018-08-13 21:09:41
I just bought 2 BTC designed silver rounds today and it was my first ever purchase with actual BTC. The process to set up and to send to Bitpay just to use it was annoying but once it went through it was satisfying. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:37:02
Bashing because you have nothing better going on with your life. Cool stuff man.
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:04:50
Pretty cool. She has kind of mannish hands. Maybe scale the font down slightly so it lines up nicely with the edges of the blue triangle. The BTC "B's" on her tittys are kinda blobish and don't really have the same retro feel as the rest of the piece. I dig it though nice job dude. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:17:35

@_date: 2018-08-29 19:04:57
No, it's not. A bash on Btrash. Why does the black guy who have suffered and been oppressed for ages have to represent the bad side of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:06:16
No because who is entering the "news" onto the blockchain in the first place? 
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:55:44
You have to pay capital gains taxes everytime you trade crypto to crypto or sell to USD. So you are paying taxes twice if you buy/pay for things in crypto. Sales tax, and capital gains tax until the USA decides to change the law. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:49:35
Lol I do and it was only like $60 for both of them which I have easily made over the past year and a half on BTC. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 06:01:33
Btrash was my fav
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:49:52
It is a proof and only 3000 were made is why there is a premium.
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:55:11
Why does the black guy have to be Bcash?
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:22:46
Whats up with people joking about moons when we are below 7k. Stop saying any sort of  green is mooning. You fucking kids ruin everything good or funny.

Heard that since July. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:30:33
Wow man you clearly don't have kids. It's pretty simple and easy way to minimize something bad. They get a shit load of candy it is not a big deal to throw away stuff that looks re-wrapped. Grow up. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 02:03:59
Are you slow? That same meme was posted yesterday and you are trying to deflect about reposting it already. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:36:31
So you don't think we are capable realizing that? You think we can't figure that out without this shitpost?? I guess you would have more upvotes otherwise.
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:26:41
Lol so bad
@_date: 2018-10-20 06:59:04

Overplayed. Like literally already posted earlier this week. And this guy was brutally murdered.
@_date: 2018-10-18 02:16:04
In all your other replies you keep saying "its funny to me" the last sentance in the OP literally says "joke". Are you fucking handicapped? 
@_date: 2018-10-26 16:06:04
Wtf for real?
@_date: 2018-10-20 15:47:35
To each their own. Some people split uo large amounts incase something bad were to happen. Myself personally, I just keep it all in one wallet with the ledger.

@_date: 2018-10-24 03:50:44
How many people are going to post the same damn thing. 2 seconds of looking at the sub and you would have seen this all over.

Thought that was the 30th?
@_date: 2018-10-25 00:31:11

If btc got sent to you wouldnt that just be your public address they sent to?
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:36:05
You are 100% just assuming everything about me. My parents threw away suspicious looking things when I was a kid in the 80's and I went wherever I wanted. Like I said, grow up kid. 
*Edit By the way years ago a 9 year old was at the park up the street by himself and was raped and murdered by a man. It happens man. Being careful and neglecting are two different things. Throwing away weird looking candy is not a basis to assume they can't do anything. You are assuming a insane amount about nothing you could possibly know. Normally I don't have to throw out anything where are you getting half?

Crazy idea, shill your YT videos on YT. Why would I go to reddit to find YT videos. A different take came out to "I dunno if he was being condescending, snarky, or what?" You literally said nothing of value or even opinionated. Shit post. Just another cringy kid trying to ride the YT crypto content creator wave.
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:54:52

Right but to exclude the US with its economy ect. would not be good for adoption.
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:59:13
Makes no sense for me to pay sales tax and capital gains tax on top of that. They would have to change the laws. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:49:17
Seems like using BTC as a currency to buy things is pointless unless they excluded it from capital gains taxes.
@_date: 2018-11-01 02:19:14

Yea dumbfuck that putting BTC on candy that looked handwrapped could be cause for parents to throw it away.
@_date: 2018-11-01 03:01:18
So you don't believe CNN, Time, Wash Post but you post snopes while missing the point of the OP point I was making entirely. You can't fix stupid I guess.

Probably a dumb question, do you wait till the transaction to come through before you deliver even if it takes awhile, curious cause while normally fast sometimes I have had transactions take awhile.
