If there is no limit all you have is a sophisticated I.O.U. system.
Because people would just create more coins when they needed to send new transactions. And you would have to trust the person who sent you the original coin that they would pay up.
The limit is in place to remove the requirement of trust and instead place it on the value stored within the coins themselves.

@_date: 2014-03-17 23:03:48
The amount is increasing only because more people want to use them.
Once the market penetration is complete the value should stabilse. It is only the increasing demand that is driving the price.
Yes speculation is a factor but people are only speculating as to what the final price will be. Ie buying now because you believe that the current price is undervalued.
To put it another way, you could sit back and wait for bitcoin to become established and then use the services that are available with it. You would not have lost anything by doing so. However, you would've missed out on any possible gains.

Well with the implementation of hardware wallets that could be the way we're going.
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:08:16
Simply, all wallets and their corresponding keys already exist, you are just being assigned one.
Your next question is going to be how do you know that you haven't picked one that belongs to someone else. The answer being that while not impossible it is statistically improbable.
This was covered in another thread recently:
Basically theres so many different combinations the chance of it happening is so minute that it is not a factor.

Yes, in order for you to convert BTC to cash, someone has to buy them off you. Be that on an exchange or in person.
What safety concerns?
@_date: 2014-01-30 08:41:38
Yeah without convincing the community to accept regulatory amendments to the protocol the only thing they can change is the degree to which the exchanges collect information on its users.
One of the positives was that they would expect exchanges to maintain insurance to compensate users if the site was to fail due to negligence.

The only issue with that is that exchanges act as points of contact with fiat system and would be governed by each governments laws and regulations.
While it is entirely possible to be unregulated within the crypto world interaction with fiat will always cause friction.

@_date: 2014-02-11 16:21:57
Nah simply cause its just easier.
Say for example you want to buy a computer using your Bitcoins, prior to say Scan accepting Bitcoin you would have to go to an exchange, complete a trade, withdraw those funds to your bank account. Then go to the store and buy the computer.
Where as since the store accepts Bitcoins now you just log in and pay.
Simplicity counts for a lot in purchasing, that's why amazon has set up their whole one click system.
The easier it is to buy something the more it will sell. That's why you get those sweets at the check out counter or companies pay to have their products on the ends of aisle in the supermarket.
That coupled with the fact that Bitcoins have a similar affect to shopping abroad or gambling chips. It doesn't quite feel like real money, which makes you more susceptible to spend it. Especially no since the price has increase so much.
Imagine Frank the early Bitcoin investor bought $100 worth in 2009 has hundreds of BTC sitting in his wallet. Spending one or two buying something from Tiger or Overstock isn't going to have too much of an affect on him.
In terms of the snowball effect if he's part of the buyer club from a new store accepting bitcoin and helping it hit the news. More stores will see that and want to accept bitcoin as well. So its somewhat rewarding to him as well, that and he gets a new Graden set or PC.

Anyone who thought that Bitcoin could interact with fiat currencies at anything above small scale transactions and not encounter regulation was seriously deluding themselves.
That being said, regulators should only have the option to govern Bitcoin actions at those points of interaction.
The internal bitcoin ecosystem itself should not be regulated and infact is almost impossible for regulators to affect.
However, as the community becomes more comfortable with regulation, changes proposed to the protocol in favour of regulation may find stronger support. Which is something to watch out for in the future. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 09:34:54
What was the reason?

@_date: 2014-01-28 23:25:02
From what I can tell you can use bitcoin in the states as much as you want.
But if you want to run a business, the bank who funds your business will want to know where all the money is coming from. Hence the license, it looks like the license will only be required if you want to operate an exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:58:56
Most cryptos rise and fall with btc. With varied effects as btc goes up or down the effects are amplified in the lesser cryptos.

It's not this but this is still good news.
Basically Bitcoin is more exempt from VAT in the UK now.

Yeah it would, just as an example Bitstamp would survive Mtgox wouldn't.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:07:00
Simply way would just be to split the key in half, that way you'll need both parties' consent to access the wallet.

But in MtGox's scenario Bill is a sneaky bastard and tricks Bob into paying him again.

I'm not entirely sure what your point was...

Doesn't seem to pickup on the mobile app yet but I'll check the site when I get back home.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:35:16

@_date: 2014-02-24 15:13:11
And people wonder why despite all the panic the order book is still open.
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:11:17
Blockchain.info is a relatively reliable site but I'd advise keeping the majority of your coins in a watch only address. Then store the paper wallet somewhere safe.
That way you're only using the site to track your coins so even if someone was to gain access to your account or Blockchain.info went offline you'd still have direct access to your BTC. You'd just need to find a new wallet and enter in your address and private key.
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:13:01
Nice article, least they were able to distinguish between MtGox and the rest of the Market.
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:46:03
True initially they said they'd limit their mining to 5% but lets be honest they produce the miners they can do what they want with them. As mining companies go they've been relatively good to their customers. 
But lets not forget that they're a business, they can be nice about it but they're still in it to make money.
@_date: 2014-06-23 13:23:06
Yeah April was my estimate too although I knew that was still optimistic.
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:46:16
Aside from the guy who just bought 2000 of them on Gox you mean.
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:19:17


And the value is doing what?
I'm only talking semantics here, I'm not trying to justify to you anything about Bitcoin.
Only that the value increases as demand does, hence why with the current low demand due to uncertainty following recent news has caused the price to fall.
Yes hysteria caused the price spike last year, with people being very optimistic about bitcoins future. But as I said before it was purely people perception that buying at that price was a good thing to do as they felt bitcoin was still undervalued.
Whether or not that is the case remains to be seen but it doesn't make it any less true.
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:16:02
This was always their plan and been pretty vocal about it too so it shouldn't come as a surprise.
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:04:54
They work for me.
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:47:05
Technically speaking they're the same but it comes down to luck on such a short time table.
On average both accounts should mine the same amount. But since blocks aren't guaranteed one might get slightly luckier than the other. But theres no way to tell for example you may be unlucky in the first hour at which point the 1GH/s will win or your unlucky in the 2 hour at which point the 1GH/s will lose.
@_date: 2014-01-25 10:09:24
Possibly depends how lucky they feel they'd get a block roughly every 10 days.
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:31:09
The daily trade volumes are massive, even if all that was occur on one day it would barely be a blip on even some of the exchanges. Admittedly if your looking at them today they are slightly inflated with all the hoopla thats been going on, but even during quiet times there's still millions going back an forth.
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:21:18
Liquidity, if New York allows banks to work with Bitcoin companies then you'll have an environment where legitimate exchanges can exist and new companies can spring up.
It will lift a lot of the legal haze that's has been holding back bitcoin companies in the US, at least for new york. And yes if it is successful in new york other states can look to it as a working example.
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:46:14
Another way for unconnected areas would be a Bitcoin backed economy.
@_date: 2014-01-30 08:23:06
Well that was to be expected, tbh they were a lot more amicable to Bitcoin than I thought they'd be.
Overall I thought the whole thing was relatively positive. The fact that they were even having the hearing shows they are giving Bitcoin serious thought.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:32:46
Not very good jokes though, this one is better.
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:58:00
Lets be honest the bitcoin community is still relatively small. And not everyone wants to buy stuff all the time.
Especially during a dip.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:54:42
Yes but only if Mtgox released their payment records so that we know which are the offending withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:09:41
mBTC is the generally accepted one atm
The tracker I use on my mobile switched across to it a while back and it works quite well even after we dipped back below $1k
Personally I like to call them bits so ฿0.001, pennies to the pound so to speak.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:38:34
Your second point is why I think the NY regulations will be beneficial for Bitcoin.
With trusted and insured companies getting involved people will feel secure storing their coins in an exchange. There's even news of some banks/Amazon setting up wallet storage for ease of use.
Obviously this does go against Bitcoin's be your own bank. But they're several new systems coming out to make those more secure and accessible. I.e. Trezors hard wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:48:50
No, but if there was some way to update the buy it now price automatically and link it to a particular exchange it could function as one.
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:22:53
Stability is good when nothing is actually happening atm 
The biggest news we've had recently is Overstock getting involved but by itself that's not that ground breaking it's a sign of good things to come should the other retailers get involved but by itself it isn't going to generate that much demand.
If you look back to 2013 we're in a similar stage that occurred after the crash. 
If you actually look at the charts the growth last year was immense. This period of stability helps to reassure people who haven't bought in yet that there us at least some support at this level.
Once investors feel confident that this is the new norm you'll probably see a slow climb again until the next piece of news. But you should probably expect a few dips as well since those with unsteady hands get spooked easily during this time.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:53:07

@_date: 2014-01-30 13:45:27
Um... try mid 2013
This has hardly been going on for a month and I wouldn't call it stable.
On a side note, I always find it amusing to look back at both last years "bubble" and the 2011 one in relation to the current swing.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:25:07
Because the easiest way to get money out of Mtgox is to convert it to BTC then exchange it on another exchange.
So people are willing to pay a premium when purchasing.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:16:58
Because somebody is trying to mess with the market.
Put it this way BTC has been stable for the last few weeks so if you wanted to sell your stash would you A trickle it into the market so that you can sell it for the highest price.
Or B sell it all in one go and buy up the entire order book thus driving the price down... And then maybe post about this sudden shocking dip in the price to boost its effectiveness...
@_date: 2014-01-28 10:54:55
Apparently you can still get Euros out, just dollars is basically a no go.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:04:08

There's nothing stopping you BUT it might not clear up.
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:14:35
True, the main issue with GHASH.IO was that they didn't allow people to mine outside their pool, which has changed now.
That being said it does pose a slight threat should someone gain access to the facility.
But tbh a fork isn't that much of a threat these days, there's enough people paying attention to see when it happens then they can just ignore any blocks from that source.
But we will probably see a lot of commercial grade mining centers pop up in the coming months. Hell even at the recent New York talks someone mentioned the US opening their own mining center as a way to secure the network.
Whether thats a good thing or not I can definitely see big business getting involved. After all there is a lot of money to be made in mining.
The real kicker will be when the big chip manufactures get in on the game. You can quite easily imagine them mass producing ASICs as PCIe cards for the masses and server blades for data centers.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:30:47
Personally none but I have heard of some people getting withdrawals processed. And tbh from a purely speculative angle if no one was getting withdrawals there would be a lot more chatter about it.

Yes but you have to trust someone at some point.
With the Foundation at least you know who they are and where they work. It doesn't have to be them but you need a common source for reputation to be built on.
The longer they are in business the more respectable they become but you have to start somewhere. 
In addition it is in their interest to make sure these sites are reliable otherwise they in turn are tarnished with the same brush. And any site that was verified by them would also want them to maintain their integrity in verifying new sites.

Its a cloud hashing center ie they rent it out. 
Edit: Also 200PH? where are you getting that figure from. If its from:
KnC Neptune: 3TH/s @ 2.1kW - That means ~4761 miners running on a 10MW data center (actually, the number will be lower because of all the other things consuming energy on the data center, but whatever...)
So, about 14283TH/s, around 70% of the actual BTC network hashrate. And I am sitting here, with my 0.0004TH/s GPU...
I seriously doubt they'd be maxing out the facility straight of the bat, simply because they wont be able to produce that many units. They haven't even manufacture one Neptune yet let alone 4,000.
And even with Jupiters they'd need over 15,000 to fill that place, so they've got a while before they even get close to using even half of that places capacity.

If you use a fresh wallet for all purchases you have deniability.
Yes they can tie that wallet to your name, yes they can see the coins came from a separate wallet. But there is no proof that you own the other wallet.
The bitcoins had to come from somewhere you could've bought them off some guy in the street. They can suspect but there is no proof.

Chill winston, no reason to start throwing insults. I was only providing my own opinion on the matter.
tbh even if they're withdrawl system was facing difficulty atm BTC withdrawls are still being processed so if you really want your funds you can transfer them to another exchange and withdraw that way. So there not exactely holding you to ransom.
That being said if people want to sell for a premium on Gox then they might have to wait a little to withdraw.
and in regards to it being a ponzi scheme, they only seem to be facing a cashflow issue. ie they do not have the available cash to fund withdrawls, similar to any highstreet bank would suffer should everyone want to withdraw their funds. The difference being MtGox's issue relate to circumstances outside their control due to seizures of funds. So yes I'm willing to cut them a little slack.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:25:05
If they start processing withdrawals they'll probably be accepting cash as well would mean access to very cheap coins.
After they reach normal market price they'd probably leave Mtgox and go to other exchanges but there would definitely be a flurry of activity.

To be more precise there have been no restrictions on Bitcoin itself mainly because they can't impose any restrictions. Nor would there be any reason to.
What they can do is limit their exposure to Bitcoin where it interacts with their currency.

On a side note, those running "code" in their basement are processing the network transactions. And are thus providing a service, for which they are receiving payment in bitcoins.
The end result being that their reward is directly related to how useful bitcoin becomes.
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:42:25
Before Bitcoins were the only way to get funds it of MtGox so people paid over the odds to get them hence the high price.
Now that BTC withdrawals have been halted people fear a collapse. And in the notion that should MtGox fail it would be easier to get fiat from the auditors than Bitcoin people are now trying to switch their funds back to fiat even if it is at a loss.
That coupled with the uncertainty that's been going on over January (the real cause for the stability) and the recent Russian news kicked off the dip.

This one is simple, basically with the recent surge in Bitcoin theres a lot of very rich geeks out there. With currently no simply way to spend their funds. It's not that they're trying to avoid tax etc but that buying with Bitcoin is just easier.
As retailers pop up they can quite easily drop 2 or 3 of their BTC to buy something cool. And at the same time promote Bitcoin. It's a win win.

I don't think most serious enthusiasts believe it will completely replace standard payment systems. However, what it might replace is global transfer systems. Which is a much smaller market (currently).
For example, buying coffee or your groceries with bitcoin isn't really going to improve the experience that much. Since it is already mostly electronic and physical cash still serves a purpose.
However, when it comes to internet transactions specifically those that cross borders/currencies. Paying with bitcoin cuts out several layers and makes the process that much simpler.
Then there's also those who would prefer not to interact with the general banking system.

I doubt that will happen though due to the amount of hardware required. Using % increase always gets a little ridiculous after a while.
Increases now are limited to manufacturing there aren't any breakthroughs left in terms of CPU&gt;GPU&gt;ASIC. Now we only have optimisation and quantity.
The next big batch is KNCs Neptunes which for a 1,200 batch will prob add maybe 600-700 onto the difficulty.
Currently they've only planned 2 batches up to June next year. There's maybe 3-4 other companies capable of delivering similar batches. Which might get us to 25-30PH/s 
That being said if mining was to get to an industrial scale and a big chip manufacturer to get involved well there's no telling where we could end up.

No since the amounts exchanged in purchases would equate to quite a small % of the economy.

Yeah one of the main things that came out of the talks today, was yes have regulation but only enough to make the government feel safe about it don't touch the protocol itself. The main reason being that its not an "American" product they wouldn't have any right to change things.
Which as much as people complain about regulation, if you ever wanted to convert btc into fiat, you have to interacting with fiat regulations to do so.
That being said you can still create a wallet and purchase bitcoins from for cash.

While that is true, in order to get to that figure it would take just under 60,000 Neptunes.
And while I don't doubt that ASIC production will ramp up in the future it's going to take a while and a lot of money to produce that many units.
Even if KNC for example was to triple their production rate to 3000 units per quarter it would take another 5 years to achieve that figure.
But yes, with big business actually starting to take notice of Bitcoin, it won't be long before a big chip manufacturer turns their gaze toward it. And with their resources it would be relatively easy for them to claim a large % of the mining. Preferably they would limit themselves to a certain share maybe 30% and then hold at that rate, maybe selling excess equipment to 3rd parties.
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:31:07
Exchanges have to sit in between both bitcoin and legacy banking systems so KYC is required.
That being said they should only require KYC if you wish to withdraw in fiat.
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:56:12
It depends what you want to use it for. 
As a public currency a private blockchain is not a best idea. Unless it's run as a public service but even that has some issues.
However, as a ledger between multiple organisations private blockchains are perfectly suited.
Just to clarify, "blockchain" technology has business implication well outside digital currency.

Not that they're not money transmitters just that they don't have to apply for a license.
It's only if your conducting/facilitating transactions on behalf of a third party that you will need the license.
@_date: 2014-01-13 17:48:35
Those fees normally only apply if an actual charge is placed.
Usually if you go to pay for something the store contacts your bank directly to confirm you have the funds. If you don't your card is declined.
I'm not 100% on the way it works but occasionally purchases can be made without direct contact to your bank and the transactions are processed at a later date. If you conducted a series of these transactions that later caused your account to be overdrawn you would be charged a fee.
The reason behind it being you have benefited from the purchase and the bank has to honour the payment to the store so because of that your account is put into debit. And since you didn't arrange it with the bank beforehand and give them time to prepare the extra funds they charge you a fee.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:03:11
I disagree simply because the US can't control what happens on the blockchain.
However, what they can control is which businesses are allowed to interact with it from financial point of view on US soil.
Additionally the existence of responsible and regulated exchanges can only benefit Bitcoin. Not to mention stop fiascos like the one currently occurring at MtGox.

Surely if the chain moves along and excepts a new paradigm, while technically your coins are still valid, to spend anything you'd have to eventually accept the new system that everyone else is using.

@_date: 2013-12-18 13:52:46
The  government didn't flat out ban buying through exchanges they simply limited exchange funding to banks only so that they could track and monitor the transactions.
What caused this current dive is that temporarily one of the main banks halted fiat exchange.
Now why they did that isn't clear, it could be a sign of where things are going or it could just be with the sudden rush they didn't want everyone to withdraw all at once.
Either way it's going to be a fun ride so hold onto your hats.

Bitcoin itself no, but if your looking at the exchanges then yes.
If people started using BTC for everything from salary to paying for groceries then you wouldn't need a central body to govern it.
But if you want to covert it to and from fiat and want a trustworthy exchange to do that on then those would also have to comply with fiat central bodies and policies.
If you don't want to use the main exchanges then there are other less intrusive way to convert fiat &amp; BTC.
