It's zero fee. Their income comes from a premium subscription model (which is optional).

Genuinely curious, how would one implement and system to batch up transactions? Would it rely on an intermediary coin (ie not a standard bitcoin transaction)?

What’s up with these clickbait titles?

I've found the error in the code. I'm not sure if it's reversible though, because it's sending the wrong private key to the encryption routine.
ie, instead of sending ABCDEF it sends ABCDEFG
EDIT: I can't figure out how to decrypt it, but I can tell you where the bug is. In screens/PrivateKeyScreen.py:
    BIP, Address = gen.encBIPKey(self.privateKey, self.BippyApp.chosenCurrency, self.passphrase, self.isCompressed)
`self.isCompressed` is set False, but it should be True. Manually setting `self.isCompressed = True` before that line fixes it. 
The error happens here (in key.py)
    	isWIF, comment = isWif(privK, cur)
    	if isWIF is True:
    		if isCompressed is True:
    			privK = enc.decode(enc.encode(enc.decode(privK, 58), 256)[1:-5], 256)
    		else:
    			privK = enc.decode(enc.encode(enc.decode(privK, 58), 256)[1:-4], 256)
Instead of grabbing until the last 5 characters, it grabs until the last 4.
Because it encrypted it incorrectly in the first place, I'm not sure if it can be reversed.

Don't even worry man. I bought a TON when it hit $600, pretty much at peak. The next week it was at $200. I was gutted, but I held on to it.
I'm sure you can see where this is going.

I purchased in November 2015, when it went up to $600 CAD. That would have been roughly $500 USD.

What's your analysis?

The main reason I use an ad blocker is to block ads. I have enough common sense to not get phished. But blocking stuff like this is also good.
