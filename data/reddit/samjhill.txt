Yes, there are. [Eclair]( for Android, [Zap]( for desktop.

Having a direct channel would be awesome, but you probably won't have channels open to each person on the network. You will probably have to do multiple hops to get where you want to go.
However, more nodes breeds competition for lower fees. You can set the fee manually; I think 1000 SAT is just the default. A lot of the people running nodes (myself definitely included) are still learning how this all works, so fee competition is low on our priority list.
More nodes also means there are more paths to get where you want to go, so you can route around someone if there is a problem, so more consistent performance. Same thing as TCP/IP, if you've studied that.

I don't have a direct channel to Blockstream, though that would have been cheaper. I wanted to try multi-hop, so I'm connected through other nodes.

Hey! I bought a sticker. $8 purchase total. 
[Open this window to understand what I'm about to describe](
My node is GOODBOYE��.
I have 2 channels open; 1 to p2sh.info and another to ln.mempool.co. 
The payment took 2 hops: 1 to TrueVision.clu, then another to SLEEPYARK (Blockstream's node).
 
You seem to have a pretty decent grasp of LN. Maybe a few minor details (i.e. the _two parties_ aspect are a little oversimplified), but broad strokes, you have it. I'm not an expert either, I'm just a developer learning all this, so someone in here will probably answer you better than I can.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:12:46
I believe if you and the other party don't agree, the channel closes at the last agreed-upon state. I could be wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:59:14
I _think_ there are windows clients, but the guide is for Linux only.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:14:12
Glad you think it's cool too!
1) Yes, I paid ~0.60 USD to open each channel. 
2) When you run the command `lightning-cli getroute &lt;nodeID&gt;` it generates a graph of  and cost. I paid 1020 Satoshis to TrueVision when my payment took that route, according to the output of that command.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:42:28
If you run `lightning-cli getroute &lt;nodeID&gt; &lt;amountInSatoshis&gt; 0` you can see the path your transaction will take, with costs included.

I haven't heard about this - have any links?

Hey! [This guy]( seems to have beat me to it.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:03:13
Common misconception - it will actually get faster and cheaper as more people use it, as well as lighten the load on Layer 1.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:53:32


No. Not by a long shot - it's going to get faster and cheaper as there are more nodes added.
edit: but there will probably be a third layer at some point. Andreas talks about it a bit, but I have trouble visualizing it right now.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:08:08
Interesting. The `delay` values I saw on my `getroute` was 23ms and 9ms. Where is the additional time coming from?
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:07:11
It probably took much less time, but the shop page probably had to do an ajax call to check on the status of the payment.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:27:41
For me, price is the _least interesting_ part of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:57:33
Are there any guides on how to set up a Lightning Network channel to accept payments as a web-based business?
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:47:35
[I followed this guide.](
There are a few minor corrections I noted in the comments, might want to read that as well.

Thank you! I designed them in TinkerCAD, prototyped a bunch with my home 3d printer in plastic, and then I sent it off to Shapeways for printing! They're steel, plated in Pewter.

@_date: 2017-12-29 17:30:30
Sure! I'm pretty new to Docker, so I'll have to figure out how to do that. Maybe after lunch.
edit: [Here you go!](
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:39:02
Dockerfile is linked in the GitHub repo above :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:08:53
So, after making this, I realized there is an [existing Docker image]( but that is more for making a cluster of nodes than getting started in the LND tutorial, so I'm going to leave it up. It was a good learning exercise that I threw together while waiting for one of my work-related Docker projects to finish compiling.

@_date: 2017-12-26 17:31:17
can I open a payment channel? I have a spare PC &amp; fast connection; I'd like to be a hub.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:28:01
Glad you like it! I will update for mainnet ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:53:04
Good points re: security.
Yep, exactly: the eventual goal is to be able to spin up LND containers on my VM host at will. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:18:23
Yeah, I'm bad at titling/naming things. Sorry.

I use Copay. It's pretty decent

I got into Bitcoin for autonomy of money. It's ridiculous that someone else can tell me where, how, and when I can pay my bills. 
Doubly ridiculous that they can't set up a fallback system for when they're doing maintenance.

I have a script that scrapes their about us page and stores it :)

I've been tracking daily new users. It's been 100k per day for a while, but the past few days it's even more. 300k yesterday.
