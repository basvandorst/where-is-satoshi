Only if you send less than 4 cents at current exchange rate will transaction fees be more than the amount you are sending.

Bitcoin's scarcity isn't artificial either. Bitcoin and dogecoin are not the same thing. Gold's scarcity is as artificial as bitcoin because its value is not derived from its intrinsic uses as a metal good for jewlery and electronics. The only reason why you want gold more than copper is because other people want the same thing. And the reason why other people want the same thing is because it is scarce. People will continue to want bitcoin versus other cryptocurrencies because other people want bitcoin. This will continue until a cryptocurrency comes along which is so technologically superior that its superiority can overcome the network effect of bitcoin. 
The value of any currency is artificial. As long as the demand for bitcoin stays stable the price stays stable. Value exists only in the mind.

Exactly! The fast and loose code cowboy style is fine if you're some amateur-hour social media app maker. But blockchain.info is a financial services company. If they followed enterprise software engineering principles like performing stringent requirements analysis and then using that to create a comprehensive test plan which verifies that every requirement is met, this could never have happened. 
This isn't some weird corner case bug that only happens when an attacker maliciously exploits an API call in a way that was never intended to be valid, this is core functionality. The fact that core functionality was not tested is a horrible sign.

Multiple private keys must sign the transaction to spend the coins.
So I use greenaddress.it. If I want to spend my coins I initiate a transaction. Then they send me a 2fa code to verify that I am in possession of my phone.

That sounds great but unrealistic. A system like that would inevitably result in a return of feudalism as the strong and power hungry take control by force. 
Do you have a realistic strategy for attaining and protecting this utopian view of a voluntary society?
In a world without power-hungry fucks something like this would work. But how do you expect this to actually be realistically attainable? Seems like it would necessitate warfare to protect the collective from outside dominating forces. Then, even if the outsiders were successfully fought off, those who attained the natural role of the combat leaders would not want to give up their power, and would become warlords.

I apologize. Your extreme position just seemed a bit too zealous for me to believe that you were capable of rational discussion. 
I think that there are many problems with the role of the state in America at this time. The military industrial complex, the crazy drug war enforcement and private prison industry, stasi-esque surveilance, etc... America has problems. But the idea that the state is 100% something that makes your life worse is an oversimplification of an extremely nuanced and complex topic. 
I've experienced amazing public education provided by the state, with highly qualified and enthusiastic teachers all throughout my primary and secondary school years.
I get to go to an amazing university (University of California, Santa Barbara) which is heavily subsidized by the state. An equivalent education at a private university would cost me far more than I pay here. The presence of these universities is a big part of why California is consistently on the forefront of the tech industry. The results are obvious: Internet was invented in California.
Another of many good examples of effective government are the Fish and Game services, and the Wildlife services. Preserving our wildlife and our natural ecosystems is a massive boon to our nation. Their intelligent management of hunting to maintain the health of our ecosystems is one of the few examples of effective government that we have. The idea that private actors would protect wilderness areas for the common good (when exploiting those resources and logging all the trees is FAR more profitable) is preposterous. 
This weekend I will be going to Yosemite National Park and I will be able to do this because of the state.

If it's money that you can afford to lose, bitcoin is a great bet to make. It is riskier than most other investments, but the rewards are potentially greater than any other investment out there today. PM me any questions you have. 
If you can wait until a bit over a week from now when my finals and spring break are over, I can meet with you via skype and for a low rate ($13/hr paid in btc if you choose to get some) I can teach you best practices with regards to how to securely generate a paper wallet, as well as answer any btc questions.
Personally, for 1000 dollars worth of BTC if you don't know how to boot linux off of a live cd then you are probably better off just using a Multi-Signature wallet.
I personally store my bitcoin not on a paper wallet but on an  Multi-sig wallet. In order for my funds to be stolen, an attacker would have to either physically steal both my phone and my private key or somehow hack both me and the provider to get both keys. However, I have a very small amount of btc. If i had more than say $2000usd worth of btc i would definitely set up a cold storage solution.

A bitcoin is really a share in the bitcoin DAC (distributed autonomous corporation). By speculating on bitcoin you are directly investing in the ecosystem.

The government is not the biggest polluter in the USA. Not even close. And if you think that America had a better wildlife and wilderness management before the national park system was created, you are fucking high.
And if you think that engineering and constructing the Los Angeles freeway system is just "dumping dirt and tar in straight lines" then you just don't know what you are talking about. Engineering a freeway to be able to withstand earthquakes and be durable enough to last decades is not easy, and costs far too much money for any private actor to do profitably.
I'm not saying that the government is some sort of amazing benevolent entity that has no drawbacks. The government in this country has countless flaws. 
All I'm asking you to do is to have a more nuanced opinion on such a complex topic of how the world should work, and maybe try to view the situation from different angles instead of spouting off meaningless "gubment is bad" one liners with no fucking substance.

Probably has something to do with the fact that dollars and euros are used by billions of people. Bitcoin cannot do that without much greater liquidity. In order to get there it has to go up in value.

I shall read into this more soon. But it seems to me now that a system like this doesn't work very well unless we fundamentally alter what it means to be human. Many humans are power hungry. Right now, it makes sense from a natural selection point of view to have power. 
Until people achieve an evolutionary advantage by maintaining a free society instead of dominating those around them, I don't see how free societies will materialize.

Actually where I grew up the public high schools were significantly better than the private schools. All my teachers were incredible, we had several computer science classes, robotics program, machine and wood shops, excellent athletics facilities, Olympic pool, international baccalaureate program, etc...
Meanwhile private schools in our area don't pay teachers as much on average and tend to get the bottom of the barrel because of that. Private schools put on a facade of quality and then go cheap on teachers to max out profits.

I transferred from a community college. The Comp Sci professors there were very qualified. The department chair and main teacher for the later classes was formerly a very high-up engineer at IBM, and taught us how to design software so much better than any professor I've had at UCSB. Most of the physics and engineering teachers also held PHDs, or had lots of experience from places such as JPL. 
From interacting with fellow UCSB students I think that my lower-division education at my community college was far more rigorous and prepared me better for UCSB upper division classes than UCSB lower division classes did for those who went there all four years.

The part where you say there are always the same number of people buying and selling. This may be true for actual transactions which go through and 2 people have their orders filled. But when you say that more people looking to buy than looking to sell is impossible that makes no sense. Every person with a buy order is buying and every person with a sell order is selling, even if their order isn't filled. What that guy meant was that as long as demand is greater than supply the price goes up, but you cons along and say it's impossible.

Gold-bugs expect people to pay increasing amounts for each "unit" of a function based on artificial scarcity. (Iron, Copper vs Gold, literally no reason for the price difference). Metals aren't very scarce, only Gold is and it's essentially a joke that Gold owners expect to get rich(er) for doing nothing but holding some metal in their basement.

My point is that elimination of hierarchical structures is currently infeasible. Perhaps more and more decentralizing technologies will be created which can replace state functions but right now it seems to me that the best that can realistically be done is to try to create the least-shitty state possible.

You can cash out your bitcoins for fiat at both exchanges as far as I know. Is this not the case? Sure, you will have to wait for a wire transfer to go through but you can get your dollars out of the exchange.

EDIT: after thinking more about the implications of the blockchain, I am not as sure that it won't be fought heavily by incumbent powers.

The SAFE network actually is not slated to have distributed computing. All computing will happen at endpoints, and the SAFE network acts as storage and communications between endpoints. David Irvine did say though that at some point he would like to add distributed computing.

The allosphere is not very useful you are right. It's also far from the must important stuff they work on. I would say that the must cutting edge stuff we are taught is in computer networking. Most of the really cool research stuff you have to be a grad student to be exposed to.
