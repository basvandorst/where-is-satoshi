There are plenty in Greece as well, I don't understand the point that you are making.
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:08:35
I will! Getting curious now...

Have you ever met or talked to a refugee Bitcoin-Yoda?

Yeah, that sounds similar indeed. Thankfully in Greece refugees are legally allowed to work. But since the unemployment is above 20% there isn't much work available, especially not for refugees. Next to that people often need to be re-educated, for instance I know a heart surgeon who needs to more training in order to be allowed to work in a Greek hospital, but can't afford the education to do so.

That was really inspiring to read, thank you for sharing that.

Cool, will do!

Well... the question is, where else are they to go. Refugees seek refuge, because they had to leave their homes due to violence and war. Because if they had stayed they would not be alive anymore. For instance, two of the people that are involved in this project are a Syrian couple, who lost both their babies when their house got bombed. So all they want is a place to live, somewhere on this earth, where they can be safe and live in peace. Like we all want.

Thanks for the questions! The textile is sourced from a greek supplier that has a GOTS certificate.
And yeah! We can make a t-shirt that says "I LOVE Mulukhiyah"! No problem at all!

Out of curiosity, what is a refugee according to you? Have you ever met one?
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:33:52
Ah great! I already thought that because of the way banks in Greece are very limited, bitcoin might be more popular. Good to hear that this is true. 
And never heard of AEK FC before, but that's a nice idea! Thnx!!

Sometimes shit just comes, if you want to or not. And you have to make the best out of it. Thankfully shit is a great fertiliser and it can help you grow really beautiful flowers and trees. Just saying.

Hey there, sorry to hear you feel that way. I'm not sure how to respond to your comment, but I'll do my best.
I've been in Greece for a while now and I've seen Greeks and Non Greeks having a hard time. I've seen people in desperation cry simply because they didn't know how to pay the bills, mortgage or get food on the table for the coming months. With this project I'm trying to create something which benefits everybody involved, by using products which are sourced in Greece, working together with Greeks and help refugees become independent from any form of aid. In that way I hope to have a positive influence and not a negative one on you and your country.
If you are curious if this is true I'd invite you to come and visit me ones the project is running, so you can see for yourself if you believe it is something positive or not. DM me.

Hahaha. Dude. Relax!! I'm not propagandizing anything. Just curious if you had met any refugees in your life. Just making conversation. It's pretty clear that we have very different views on this topics, so I'm not expecting to be able to change your opinion on anything. Just curious.
