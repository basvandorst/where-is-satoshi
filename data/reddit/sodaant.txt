If that were the case he must have known about it over two years ago, when some of the edits started being put into place.

The chance of you getting robbed versus your bitcoins stolen is probably pretty similar.

The wired article talks about it:

You can't really compare a lot of things a government does to things individual people do. The national debt is nowhere near equal to a single person being in debt, increasing the monetary supply is not the same as counterfeiting, the state taking assets on a court order is not theft, executing criminals is not murder, among many other things. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:13:28
Basically the government has powers delegated from citizens. Since you seem to have a problem with the basic powers of government, how would you suggest we improve it? What would your government look like without the power of asset forfeiture, taxation, imprisonment, or any of the others?

Well the mere fact that he backed a startup with $23 million (at the time) of bitcoins, which was 1.5% of all outstanding coins does tell you something in itself. Very few people would even be close to having that much.

To properly answer that, you have to look at the purpose of a government in the first place. This is obviously a divisive topic, but in general most people can at least agree that it is to promote the general liberty and welfare of its citizens. To do this, the government is given powers that individual citizens are forbidden from. This includes things like compulsory taxes, imprisoning people for crimes, etc. These goals of government sometimes means helping the greater body of citizens at the expense of individuals. Eminent domain is a good example of this. It has been something that's been around long enough its in the Constitution. Without it, a single stubborn person could prevent a highway that would benefit thousands of people by simply refusing to sell.
A secondary component of the governments purpose of ensuring the welfare of its citizens is to improve the economy. One way it can do this is increasing the money supply, which generally stimulates the economy, which makes things better for most people.
Seizing money is another example of collective welfare. Without the power to seize money, people could do unlawful schemes, such as pyramid schemes, go to jail for a few years, but still have huge amounts of money when they get out. Same is true of robbing someone, if the government does not have the power to seize money, you could just rob people, go to jail, and come back to have all the money you robbed. Obviously this is not a power which should be used lightly, which is why it usually requires a court order. (I won't get into civil forfeiture here)

How much do you think they should be fined?

Just because there are problems doesn't mean that there are practical solutions, or even that there are solutions worth implementing. The way I take is that the devs acknowledge that the coin isn't 100% perfect, nothing is, but that for all the "solutions" to these problems, the cons outweigh the pros. I'd love to see some practical solutions to some of the problems you've identified, and I'd be glad to pass the suggestions to the developers if you don't wish to work with them for some reason.

I don't think the second point is all that relevant. At best, you could get a single day or two's worth of production, though I suspect that it would take less time than that even, possibly even a few hours, to find and correct, and then you'd have a grad student who would get into a LOT of trouble, probably even get kicked off their team. One possible solution to this is simply to delay the payouts from the pool by about 24 hours, which gives Stanford time to correct anything like that before the pool actually cares about it. A second option would be for a hold to be placed on payouts for a while if that kind of thing does happen, and once the points get adjusted, the payouts can just go back a few days.

I'm always surprised by the number of anarchists/anarcho-capitalists on I'm curious, how did you get to that political leaning?
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:36:42
Well, oddly enough, that's because banks tend to actually comply with money laundering rules to avoid fines exactly like that.

Its a pretty typical requirement for most businesses holding property and financial accounts. Basically, if it is inactive for a certain period of time, it will be given to the state, where the state will then put it in a place where you can then claim the property. For new york you can find the details on this site: 
It makes it easier to pool all unclaimed property for people into one place at the state level.

Probably more likely, but still I think its not a very large risk. Real world currencies have that type of problem, yet they also survive.
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:10:00
Ah, so you're just using a completely different definition of stealing. Every dictionary I have on hand defines stealing as taking something both without permission AND without right of law. The government taking someone's property is the first, but not the second, and is thus not stealing. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 00:43:35
It was very back of the napkin math using points instead of flops, but it seems like it should still be more than 11%.

If you're talking about jcoffland's comment, I do believe he is actually the F client developer who, if my knowledge serves me, is contracted by Stanford to write the client, not the scientific cores. Here's his github if it helps: 
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:18:42
For what its worth, if anyone needs a second opinion, I can say pretty conclusively that is in fact one of the F developers.
@_date: 2014-06-13 04:34:55
So then you either think stealing is okay, or the government should never take any property from private citizens, even if its blatantly illegal, such as having a bomb. Which is it?
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:32:17
To that effect, it may help if there's a public ledger of some sort accounting for where the coins from that 3% are going, just for the sake of transparency. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:53:11
Well that was easy, thanks! I know I've seen that before, I must have just forgotten.
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:22:53
I think part of the problem with working with F first is that you could not have easily predicted how big the coin would have gotten, even now. My back of the napkin math shows that in the last few weeks, curecoin has increased the total ppd of F by around 40%, just on its own. As time goes on, this could very well increase by quite a lot.
@_date: 2014-06-13 03:43:18
Stealing implies that the act was illegal. Is it stealing if the government takes cocaine from someone's house they have a warrant for? Is it stealing if the government takes an illegal automatic rifle they saw in someone's back seat? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:50:30
I haven't seen any particular hostility, and I've had many of the same questions. However, every single time I've asked them, I've gotten honest answers every time. I'll try to section out my individual responses:


First, its only 3%, and second, its not going directly into their pockets, most of it is being used to fund sending some people to the bitcoin conference, giveaways, bounties (for things like translations), and other assorted community purposes.


Yes, they do, and that's probably one of my biggest concerns as well. However, if they broke the coin for some reason, I think they would be hurting themselves the most, so I personally find it very unlikely they would ever do that. Why shoot yourself in the foot just to poke everyone else? Further, I have been trying to think of various ways to properly do this in a way which is actually distributed, but its quite difficult to do, and a centralized system makes it much easier and simple.


Well, that's true with a huge amount of applications. However, I'm not sure the entire coin will be compromised, just whatever is in hot storage in the pool for payouts, and therefore worst case you'd probably lose a few days coins, but I don't think that would be terribly major. 


Once again, no. All this would mean is someone would get theoretically one or two days worth of coins at most, I doubt it would compromise the coin. Further, F has been running for  almost 15 years at this point, and I'm sure plenty of people have tried, but I don't think anyone's done that successfully yet. 


Do you have any suggestions for fixing the above issues? Its not that the developers pretend that the coin is absolutely perfect, but you can't wait for perfection that may never come.


However, they are very willing to work with the F team to assist with testing and generally moving the project forward, which curecoin is making a great stride towards.


Lead developer of the client, not the scientific cores and projects, correct?

This isn't true by itself. Oftentimes the increased gains in productivity go elsewhere, to capital costs needed to realize those gains, or to things like lowered prices. If my company buys a machine that picks tomatoes, and now one person on that $300,000 machine can pick 10x as many tomatoes as normal, should all the extra revenue go to the one guy operating the machine? 
Most productivity improvements are driven by improvements in technology, which often require additional capital investments.

I feel like I'm going against the grain here, but no, that won't help, and here's why. 
1. Much as people don't like saying it, bitcoin IS volatile. This means that if you buy that $20 of bitcoins to, say, purchase an app when it comes out or for when you need it, its very unlikely to be worth $20 anymore. It may be worth $28, it may be worth $8. Sure, you could end up with more money, but you're just as likely to end up with less, and that's a major issue that will prevent people from using it.
2. Security. Bitcoin wallets by definition aren't really secure, and they don't have the protections that bank accounts do, as transactions aren't reversible. If someone robs the bank, I'm not out of my money, and if someone steals my credit card and buys some nice electronics, I'm not liable for it. On the other hand, if they steal my bitcoin wallet, tough luck, I don't have any more money.
3. Currency exchange. You'll lose some amount of money in the exchange, and you'll not be getting much in return. There's still no overarching reason to use bitcoins over any other currency, mobile payment is already quite simple for the most part, no need to complicate it with an intermediate currency.
