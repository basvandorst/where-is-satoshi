negatory, good buddy;  because: services.
In a deflationary currency, the individual with a monopoly will still see an outflow of currency to others that provide services (assuming that the rest of society agrees with the value of the currency, and the ethics proposition of providing a service to said monopolizer), and the outflow will be asymmetric, and differentiated among the service providers of the same services (i.e., some are more efficient than others, therefore, get more.).  Now, having said that, the caveat is in whether or not society feels that, given the qualities of the whole, this particular implementation is not worthwhile.  Specifically, are the actors creating a better society, or is it getting worse: most people do not realize just how much democracy is brought by blockchain to equalize currency; Bitcoin is merely a social project created to leverage this tech against the sophisticated improprieties of the financial elites.

it is simple math: there is a finite amount of bitcoin; the more you own, the larger the percentage of this finite amount.  That is really all it is about.
The 'miracle' is in that the hard problems have been handled; security.  Bitcoin has the most security in that it requires tremendous (the most, of any digital currency) amounts of resources (electricity, equipment,  Internet) to subvert it.  It would require Big Government grade action (legislate, or attack; 'ban' or 'surrender' are pretty much the only options); which brings us to it's main flaw: there are still very few manufacturers of the sha256 algo calculator hardware (aka: the objects commonly known as miners, or mining equipment).  So, it is these guys that are very quickly acquiring the most Bitcoin.  Of course, if that happens, bitcoin will be worthless in that adoption will be stifled.

This.  Interesting that while you initially argue against the case of mining farm energy, you actually make the case for it in your final statement.
(you imply that 100% efficiency is not always achieved, but is the desired goal. Therefore, mining is a way to monetize, or arbitrage, the difference when no other option is possible; prudent thinking.)

I am being literal, when I say 'luck.'
You are talking about statistical probability to evaluate a theoretical cost model for predicting success.  I am saying that the probability goes from absolute ZERO (for not mining, at all, with anything), to greater-than-zero by mining.  But you're missing the point; by solo-mining you run a node and gain valuable insight into the ENTIRE Bitcoin process by doing so.  And, when you no longer want to run a full-mining-node, there are other options, like a solo-mining-pool (which is awesome! -BTW), or you can even take a foray into running your own pool (don't ask me - I was not long for this).  But yes, at least buy 1 lotto ticket, because without it, you, literally, have ZERO chance.
EDIT: as for OP question: the answer is 'unlikely.' In pool, the cost to run the laptop (unless it has ~14TH/s connected to it) will outweigh its gains.  But, NOT in a pool, you at least have a chance at striking it big!

Earning Bitcoin is completely different; in that you are legitimately, participating in, and thus contributing to, its adoption.  The caveat, however, is in how will your Government react to your abandonment of its Fiat (i.e., controlled) monetary system.

your 'million buys and sells' is off by a large margin; and not comparable; and, so much lower if you are merely counting wallet-wallet trades.   But..

Precisely! you get it.   BTC is a super-magnitudes-greater efficient settlement layer; for transmitting wealth; so, you make a lot of electric-power in the desert, effectively converting electricity to wealth via mining, transmit your excess wealth (via the internet) to your investment (power-plants in regions where power is more expensive) and sell that power for a profit.  It is in essence, the oil model, but you produce the energy right at the remote plant; because, you don't actually have to transmit the electricity.  Or, they could just keep the profit, but where's the fun in that?

AI (real) + token(real) = gimmick(because, the token can be anything, including BTC.)
It makes no economic sense to expend resources to secure two tokens that accomplish the same thing. This defines a competition; not a competition for people's attention, but for the resources required by a PoW protocol.  In short, as it pertains to BTC's design and implementation, "there can be only one."  That is BTC's implied directive.

Please also allow me to point out that the cost increase to the miner (for larger blocks) is only in the diskspace storage of the blockchain (they will still be able to prioritize/filter based on fee criteria);  So, to a mining pool, the cost increase approaches $0 (since only one copy of the blockchain is required for the entire pool), whereas an independent miner has to assume the entire cost increase.  Larger blocks will hurt solo miners, but have a trivial effect on mining pools.
The point of my comment is to highlight the real danger of larger blocks; the acceleration toward the centralization of BTC;  which will facilitate its manipulation as a currency; which is in direct contradiction, entirely, to its existence. Ergo, it will cease to be useful.
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:51:49

Yes!  but I want to clarify one point; The leadership is actually a bicameral chimera, consisting of both the developers (who present their code) and the community (that chooses which code to implement).  Bitcoin presents a paradigm shift in government; away from a republic as being the practical implementation (i.e., "there is someone smarter we can put in charge to steer the ship") and directly toward the more idyllic democracy. Because the Internet allows immediate and equal access directly to the Bitcoin protocol, by anyone who has a stake in it; there is no need for representation nor proxy executive.
There are so many Ben Frankiin quotes on the matter, but i can't  find the one about the ideal condition where a person could know everyone's best ideas (of course, this is what drove his infatuation with the printing press as platform for the conveyance of all ideas), as that would allow for direct democracy.
potential of direct governance is implied in:
“Freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a free government: When this support is taken away, the constitution of a free society is dissolved, and tyranny is erected on its ruins. Republics and limited monarchies derive their strength and vigor from a popular examination into the action of the magistrates.”
and in:
"In these sentiments, Sir, I agree to this Constitution, with all its faults, — if they are such; because I think a general Government necessary for us, and there is no form of government but what may be a blessing to the people, if well administered; and I believe, farther, that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years, and can only end in despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government, being incapable of any other."
but most importantly:
“The way to be safe, is never to be secure.”
-Ben Frankiln
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:15:07
"majority control of the ledger"... is centralized.   If your proximity to one copy of the ledger brings you tranquility, then you should know that: hashing power is control of the ledger, and that a single nation has more than half of that power, thus, the 'majority control.'

False-flag Operation; Actually, the weak point is not made.

To put it into context, we have reached a point where only the largest miners are profitable.

I know you put considerable thought into this prognostication.. however..
The 'tech' is moving toward a multi-sig, adversarial banking paradigm; whereby bank A has part of a multi-sig key, and Bank B, has the other.
If Bank A&amp;B where to collude, you would see movement of your Bitcoin asset, and promptly stop providing your business to said banks.  
Of course, this implies a non-fiat world, where banks have much less incentive to lend. Because, (at scale) lending is only possible if someone can easily dilute the money supply.

But, your analysis is incomplete; this would paralyze bitcoin, until a PoW change.
Also, more insidious, is the mining of perfectly full blocks, but, with some strategic, TX's being large scale double-spends, intended in their favor..

Well, it sort of does, ATM:
Financial institutions have come to realize that Bitcoin is traceable, pseudo-anonymous; and that AML/KYC has already come to Bitcoin.
Therefore, bright, shiny, new coins are easy to declare as never having been laundered; which is a very valuable thing; to not 'have to explain' the history of an asset to an investigator.
The current gossip is that: mining-pool operators are in direct negotiations for OTC trades to institutions, and also directly through Bitcoin futures contracts.
So, things are a little more hazy regarding value, but, when the halving happens, the formula used by the SEC to evaluate Bitcoin, well, it will double its 'cost-to-produce' estimate, and if you consider that network hash rate is still increasing..; so, assuming the same formula is in place then, their interpretation of the cost-basis will go up.

err.. no.  Bitcoin's value is, ultimately, a function of its perceived utility, indicated by the depth of its adoption.    What you are describing is more of a collectible's market.  My son swears that his Pokemon card is worth $1000, but, as I keep trying to explain, it's only worth whatever an actual buyer pays for it, and since he is not actually willing to sell it, it hasn't any value...

Since peeps here (r/Bitcoin) are focused more on price, than tech....
If you want price of BTC to increase, network hashpower has to increase; ergo, cost to mine a BTC has to increase.
Why? because SEC.  SEC determined that the base price to mine a btc is \~$4-6K (I don't recall where I saw this figure).  It is estimated that BTC is being sold at that price on futures contracts, wholesale, from miners.
Which does NOT mean, go throw some money at the biggest pool; that would simply work to curb the cost, or even keep it static.  No, instead, more competitor pools need to exist; thereby decreasing the efficiency to mine, but also, driving up the cost.  I suppose, ultimately, there could only exist a single pool, but the financial power of the pool operator would cause his/her unseating, to be insurmountable.  Bitcoin is a revolt; that applies internally as well, to anyone that wields power.
EDIT: (rebut to all the shade being thrown):
Y'all are jumping on the bash-em'bandwagon; but (hubris) your missing the point.
I am proposing that: price is inversely related to the hashing-*Efficiency;* and correlates to Hashrate Distribution.
And, what I am not sure of is, whether or not that is entirely novel.

Well-intended, but misguided.  If Bitcoin can be manipulated to accept interim compromise, then it is a failure; it would be no better than fiat.  Bitcoin is paranoia; it cannot be reactive to exploits, but rather it must be hardened against more than the merely plausible, but even the non-existent threats.  Bitcoin is an uncompromising faith in math, not PR, politics: a religion of mathematics as numismatics.

Immutable communication is the only purpose of blockchain.  And the ONLY thing that makes bitcoin special is the sincerity with which it began communicating.   And the only thing that makes the bitcoin blockchain significant, is the amount of security (difficulty) operating to solve its hashes.  But to ignore the elegance of simply using mathematics as a store of value.. it transcends the Internet.. it can be used in as simple a setting as two people with pencils (and a couple of days together, with an abacus; intimate, yes?).
EDIT (I keep forgetting to answer your question): Arguably, you'd have to print the entire Bitcoin blockchain in order to trace the ownership of each coin; every block, from genesis up to the most recent (provable) block; though it is (statistically) recommended to ignore the most recent 6 blocks.  But, it also somewhat democratic in its deference to consensus.

This is the aspect that O'leary (and others) cannot wrap his head around;  Bitcoin is The SHA256-algo-secured protocol.  Altcoins (majority) are copies, experimenting with alternative algos, tweaked incentives, contain loopholes (as compared to BTC).  SHA256 is significant here, because, if that breaks, then ALL security encryption on the Internet is broken; website SSL, ssh, banking, etc.   Basically, if you trust your banking website, then you trust Bitcoin, because they are secured by the exact same security protocol; No other coin is secured via this method, to this degree.

testnet is your friend for personal experiments like this... though,
'wallet to wallet' is a high-level description.
'wallet address' is also a high-level description.
Still speaking in high-level descriptors, per Bitcoin protocol, it is merely that an 'address' is a public-key(pk).   The basis of the Bitcoin ledger is that: pk exist, and BTC quantities are associated to these pk, and proof of a matching Private-key (sk) can authorize a release of the BTC attributed to that pk.  A (valid)'transaction' is merely that: BTC attribution is verified, and a specific amount of this verified BTC is released and attributed (to any-god-damn-thing) as the owner of the sk has directed.

\&gt; The mechanism is used to \~\~~~verify~~\~\~ **validate and confirm** new transactions by \~\~~~create~~\~\~ **including the transaction in a** new block\~\~~~s~~\~\~.
validation: the miner researches the history of the ledger to verify that everything is legitimate about the transaction.  
confirm: the miner stamps his approval of this transaction by including it in the block.
\&gt;Mining is basically having some “ASIC” mining equipment solving very difficult mathematical equations that would take a human years to complete
watch this video: [
\&gt;When a new block is formed 12.5 BTC .... ... Depending on how much you contributed to discovering the hash (answer)
This explanation implied that the owner of the ASIC's has joined a pool; essentially, loaned his miner to a pool operator.  The basic mining reward premise is: the miners compete (a guessing-match) to create a valid block. The winner of this guessing-match, gets the a) block reward (12.5btc ATM), and b) the fees from all the transactions they placed into this valid block.
In a pool, however, the miner (the pool operator), may have arrangements to divide this reward to the pool-membership, per whatever arrangements have been agreed to; but, this is completely at the discretion of the pool-operator, FYI.
\&gt; Not to mention transaction fees may be raised if necessary.
TX fees are completely, totally, factually; negotiated by: a) user, and b)  miner! (or, the pool-operator, don't be uncomfortable calling it such).
1) The user, via their wallet settings, specifies how much they want to give the miner in fees.
2) The miner, via their mining wallet settings, specifies what is the, well, anything-they-feel-like-filtering-for thresholds (pseudo-code: 'don't include tx's from X', 'unless minimum fee&gt;X', etc..).
\&gt;You could join “cloud mining”...
This explanation is misleading, inaccurate:  Cloud mining is when a customer 'rents' the ASIC of another customer (the seller) via the cloud-operator (a middleman, but, which may also be the direct owner of the ASICs; AND which, might also wear the hat of 'pool-operator').

seriously.. not trolling.. let me explain: sha256 is merely a math problem, a block is nothing more than a set of transactions (a factorial sequence) that is used as an input to the sha256 equation,  the blockchain is merely a geometric sequence of sha256-hashed blocks.  Each block is, in fact a page of a ledger, whereby each transaction can be historically traced.  Have you actually ever browsed the blockchain?  anyhow, while (I'll concede) it is impractical to maintain a printed copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, it is not entirely out of the question.  And, each block, can, in fact, be proven (mathematically).  So, you could print that ledger and, voila, achieve tangible! Seriously, though, the notation hasn't changed, in 9 years.
EDIT: so, yes, (to answer your question bluntly), Bitcoin exists, with or without the internet.  The internet simply facilitates it's use, and makes it practical.

TL;DR: it's become an ASICs arms-race.  My opinion is  akin to "Dr. Strangelove," except that this arms-race may actually benefit humanity. Furthermore, I believe groups should form cooperatives that build competitive ASICs (not-for profit), because, sending resources to a few companies to produce ASIC's is analogous to patronage of a Commercial Bank, whereas cooperatives are more like belonging to a Credit Union
AFAIK, GPU's aren't disallowed for Bitcoin, they are just nowhere near as effective as ASICs.

!Argentina Settles Export Deal With Paraguay Using Bitcoin!
where do you think they got the Bitcoin?  
Bitcoin is a zero-sum system; so, it doesn't matter if they transferred it directly from the bus-rider to the settlement bank; because, it is a near-complete cycle: Argentine bus-rider sends BTC to Argentina's National BTC manager (by way of SUBE), the National BTC manager pays Paraguay, Paraguay sells BTC to Argentine bus-rider, rinse and repeat.

Is there ever a quantifiable ROI in advertising? That's all it is; spam-miner posturing.
Here, you seem to be missing the point that it is not the other miners that see these spam'd TX's (until after they are mined); rather it is their value to the spam-miner in (falsely) projecting a limited supply of block-space to cause the community to conclude that high fees are justified; and cause the bitcoiners to up-adjust their fees.


Does there exist a fee break-point where there are diminishing returns for the spam-miner's own fake transactions to fill its own block (thereby, projecting a limited supply of block-space) in an effort to move the fee market in the direction the spam-miner (tm) desires ('Supply and Demand")?   I suspect, in practice, there is evidence to suggest that this break point moves with market sentiment, so profitability is indeterminate.  (searching for, 'what is the point of spam transactions').

EDIT: tl;dr; I got nuthin'
"What did you have in mind?" - I have 2 hypotheses (neither of which do I see BTC surviving):
 
1) assume Bitcoin (current iteration) is dead; gather the generals (alt-coins, BTC devs, whatever) and let them battle it out - however this will certainly create more devils we don't know.
or 2) BTC represents a concept worthy of sacrifice; much like nations battle for supremacy; whereby BTC rules are a hostile environment, that at the same time they (rules) need fierce protection from disruption.  Practically speaking, wage an economic war of attrition through political manifestations (currently happening) akin to the Russia/US Cold-War/Space-Race, whereby, and among other things, one group to cause unnecessary spending escalations upon the other.  
afterthoughts; the mere existence of alt-coins is also decentralization; perhaps the endeavor to create one coin to rule them all is the folly; perhaps everyone should have their own alt-coin, a quantifiable measure of their own weighted worth; David's 'Bowie Bonds' as a blockchain currency would have been..

TL;DR: The solitary 'bitcoin' project-name on github causes confusion; the ethical thing would be to archive it, and use the entry to explain the many flavors/parties and voting necessities of bitcoin. Perhaps, maintain it like a 'Voter Pamphlet'.
 
 please expound on 'marketing shenanigans'.   Let me explain: Bitcoin is primarily a technology concept, but the eponymous 'bitcoin' is merely the name of a specific related project on github; and, because of this unfortunate choice of a synonymous name, leads people to believe that it is the only choice to implement the concept.
Confused? maybe, confusion was the intention of the github/bitcoin group in selecting to continue updating that particular project name.    , please emphasize that the grandest ethical violation of Blockstream, is that they are (intentionally or not) capitalizing on the name recognition of 'bitcoin' to affect the factors which casual/new bitcoiners use to choose which flavor of bitcoind to download.  
for the ELI9 crowd (tested on 9 YO. FYI no 9-YO were harmed);
Blockstream is 'capitalizing' in that: when a person wants to get into bitcoin, they look-up what software to get, and the immediate gratification of finding the big and in-your-face result of THE 'bitcoin' project on github is just too much to resist.  Resist? yes, resist in looking for what bitcoin is really all about (more on that is a moment).  Anyway, this 'first to market' factor has a tremendous effect on the numbers for BS' bitcoind flavor, as a result, it lends more power to BS; voting bloc.  Voting bloc? yes, bitcoin is in reality a voting system.  Wealth is tied to this voting because it (a stake) compels a person to put forth an effort in creating the fairest system for trading the value of their work as a human.  This voting is done by choosing which flavor of, AND examining/changing the default settings of, bitcoind, on your node.  So, as a result, many people don't even know to vote, realize they have a vote, or that they should vote at all.  
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:52:24
Yes, miner=miners_in_pool (see: stratum mining).
So, it is much more nuanced:

    therefore; miner_C &gt; [miner_A || miner_B]

Let's ask ourselves what is the purpose of the (non-mining) full node;  to hold the DB in case the miner node needs a new copy?   and that's decentralization?  no.  not really.  Maybe the miner can shop around for a copy he likes?? then what, you have a forked chain on your node?  The distinction between (non-mining) full node and miner is not as relevant as people seem to want to believe; more specifically, a (non-mining) full node is largely meaningless to decentralization; 
Now, for aggressive TX filtering and the advancement of a competing agenda, OK, they are useful for war.

Historically, only under the threat of violence, did nation states simply create wealth to offset the outflow from their coffers.  BTC precludes this practice.
As for a dictatorship: to borrow from one of many historical paraphrasings of King David's Psalms (12):  **The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.**

You're not wrong;  I only wish to disambiguate this 'swooshy.'
Wealthy Capitalists! won't be as wealthy.
a few decades ago (in the U.S.), the avg. corporate head received ~20x the compensation of the lowest paid worker; coincidentally? the overall wealth disparity was at an all-time low.  The march toward banking progressed and we de-coupled fiat from gold, and the disparity grew at an exponential pace.  Bitcoin, has the potential to create a global referendum on fiat/currency policy; for the positive.  And, as you eloquently pointed out, the industrialized chimpanzees of the world may still be too tribal to recognize this opportunity.  I mean, hell, the U.S. citizenry is still too disconnected to recognize the sublime economic benefit to the majority in pegging fiat to a finite commodity. They are such brutes so as to dismiss the very notion that banks have any capability to subjugate everyone, and merely through economic policy; rejecting the edict of "the pen is mightier than the sword."

why do you imply that people are incapable of formulating a budget?  Maybe some people run 24x7, maybe some people budget 5x8, maybe even only run their rig during energy strategic periods (or fraction thereof)?  Why is that unfathomable?  In fact, if we look at the current hashrate,  the fact that it is 2 days to readjustment,  and that we are at the lowest network hashrate of the last 6 months, I might not run my rig all year, until this.

The Pool Operator.   The Po-Op (I like it) directs the hashpower alotted to him by the users; however, these users have no clue as to what filters the Po-Op has configured; they could be mining for empty blocks, filtering for addresses, creating orphaned blocks, double-spends, etc.. they have no idea, and won't have any clue whatsoever, at least, not until AFTER the block is solved.  But the VAST majority joined the pool so they wouldn't have to know, or care.  By the time they know something fishy is going on, it's after-the fact, probably the result of something catastrophic to Bitcoin.  So, yes, pools do NOT meet the definition of decentralized mining;  I mean, the very definition of the word 'pool' means to concentrate, coordinate, contain, a thing.
Therefore, it is NOT a misconception; despite the army of downvotes I'll get on this sub-reddit.  Because: head-in-the-sand, just wanna get rich quick.

Price point for attacking the Bitcoin network; currently, about $300k/hr([
An attack (erase a TX; aka "double-spend" in BTC vernacular) only requires the bad actor to split the chain.  This creates quite the drama for the (honest)miner that created the competing block, &amp; whom will (most likely) continue to mine the chain built on her honest block, until she decides to abandon it (else, lost block reward!); at which point, it (block or chain) is an 'orphan' in BTC vernacular.  Meanwhile, other miners will choose which block to build upon, per their own (random) criteria.
So, the attacker, would need to continue to compete against about half the network until either of:
A. the honest fork is orphaned, or
B. his objective is achieved (e.g., victim has released lambo, and he retained the BTC via the double-spend).
Therefore, yes, it is good practice to wait until x blocks have passed, until releasing the lambo; and calculate x as (Wait\_X\_Blocks\_before\_releasing\_lambo\_to\_buyer)= ($ value of lambo) / (\[$ 50% network pwnage\] + \[$ to solve a block\])

The problem is: if I can link a coin to you, and you can't prove that it actually belongs to someone else... 
So, the coinjoin isn't illegal; doesn't need to be proved; merely that a chain of TX can be linked from the purported violation to a KYC'd person is enough to level the accusation.  Law Enforcement doesn't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt; they can accuse anyone on the slightest evidence; the damage is done upon being accused; though, more damage may result if prosecution proceeds, or worse yet if prosecutors succeed in convincing a jury to dismiss the statistical-probability defense as a bunch of math-nerd non-sense and gibberish (this happens quite frequently)

Your explanation, still, does not identify how to preclude the pool-op from using your hashpower.
In fact, you have explained the opposite; that Slushpool has extended you the courtesy of allowing you tell the pool-op how you would like it used, is an acknowledgement that the pool-op has the power (despite any demand) to do with your hashpower, whatever the pool-op desires.
You do not have any verifiable receipt to indicate which fork you were mining; your contributed hashes report is manufactured by the pool-op.

Geez, its like you want coherent writings... (I agree, I was rambling.)
To put it succinctly, the geographic location of the ASIC loses relevance when control of its hashpower has been given to the pool-op; ranging anywhere between completely irrelevant (the pool-member doesn't GAF), to grandiose irrelevance (the pool-member has a thorough understanding of all the potential shenanigans, actively monitors and investigates all suspected malfeasance from the pool).
'mining' and 'mining pools' lose any distinction when one is talking about a miner in the pool; from a 'valid block' perspective, they become one in the same.
Perhaps you believe that, since it is the remote (ASIC) miner (pool-member) which solved the block (for the pool-op), it could only have used the rules of the (ASIC) miner owner's node; yet, this belief could not be further from the truth.
Maybe, you care to share with us how you **prevent** the pool-op from misusing your ASIC?

Fiat is play money; worse, it is \*fake\* money.  Bitcoin won't ever care what you think its worth in fiat. won't.. care.. ever..  You're only hope is to battle it, break it, kill it; or accept it.

Only way is to mine them yourself; effectively, trading your fiat for BTC through the $ costs of the mining enterprise. (mining generates new BTC, but also exposes you to the liabilities associated with indiscriminately processing transactions for flagged entities.)

Nope? well, sure it can fail as a technology, however, no one has been able find an economically feasible way to break it. That's Huge.
And, about the only restriction in the design is in its demand for loyalty; either you are with BTC, or you are against it.  Violence against those who are for it, is just about the only way to break Bitcoin; That's Huge.
Speculators using fiat to pump-and-dump is mildly relevant; Bitcoin demands loyalty; therefor, the community that is for Bitcoin will need to unseat fiat, demand the installation of Bitcoin as the foundation for economic governance, and establish an economic policy revolution.

EDIT: Sounds like this tenancy agreement is month-to-month, so.. you will probably have to pay the bill, this time. However.... it is perfectly normal to raise rents based on periodic evaluation of operating costs (including previous losses: i.e., this bill):  just be cool, it's just business.
Precluding, that there aren't any contradictory stipulations (in particular, a contractual obligation to the dates of the lease termination). For raising rents, it is a normally-accepted practice to give 30 days notice of the intended changes to the tenancy agreement (raising the rent, periodic power-usage and cost evaluations, and increased security deposits for unusual cost overages, etc.);  The new agreement could be an increase to the rental rate.  I wouldn't outright ban any UL listed equipment, but I might stipulate that tenant needs to respect the power capacity of the circuits he uses, and any damages as a result of the tenant's activities, and electrical bill amounts in excess of &lt;your baseline&gt; will be conveyed to the tenant through month-to-month rental costs.
Don't, just tack-on the $$ for the new bill; instead, also add a little more too, just in case.
NOTE: any bad-faith acts on the part of the tenant are just-cause for escalating to law enforcement.

Bitmain's actions are hurting adoption by causing concern within the community regarding Bitmain's mining/manufacturing conglomerate as a point of increasing centralization.   Antpool is merely proving that the rules are imperfect.  Perhaps if Antpool offered a bitcoin faucet, or if Bitmain sold Antminers as a loss-leader, even if they would simply do their best to keep the mempool clear, then this would be less of a topic.
My personal opinion is that Bitmain has an unfair advantage in that it is leveraging the Chinese infrastructure, which is built upon a humanitarian nightmare, to produce and mine at reduced costs; overall, it benefits from the resources that are effectively below global prices for power and wages.

    The token or “virtual currency” used in coin offerings are not 
    issued by the monetary authority. Such currency does not have

The second one is a factor of marketing and success; as of yet, though BTC remains the largest target, it still manages to fend off attempts to corrupt its ledger, however, caveat emptor always looms.

Bitcoin, has many qualities which undermine the power that bankers have attained, and which evidence has shown that they use, to subvert the wealth of the clientelle for their own gain.  Simply that it hasn't yet reached that level in your country, does not mean it won't.  Maybe you'll need Bitcoin then, and maybe, by then, Bitcoin functionality will have improved so much, that bankers don't even dare. Best of luck.

only because it is a function of the dollar; in terms of transactions (a real indicator of its health), BTC is down.  OTOH, it is unclear if the volume may be derived/estimated value based on exchange-data, or it might be as measured via block transaction amounts; there *might* be more private, unreported volume.

Because 3.  Inflation is !super-evil! (I can't overstate that enough).  It is the reason that once in the very near past only one adult in a family had to earn income; and now, two adults can barely support a family. The only people who can keep up with inflation are bankers and CEO's.

I've (painfully) read the context of the comments so far.
1. Bitcoin is still beta; it doesn't (yet) have a mature enough technology to resolve thefts.
2. the thefts that have occurred, are the result of incompetent users. (this was most recently re-iterated by the Bank of Canada; not a single fraudulent transaction has ever occurred on the Bitcoin network).
3. you pay a premium to bankers for the insurance service that protects your money; most of that premium is invisible to you, and comes in the form of inflation.
4. Bitcoin Custodial services are starting to emerge; the most recent being:
[BitGo Custody Service]( These services will offer smart-contract features the preclude the possibility of mistaken addresses, or else be notorious in their ability to trace mistaken payments and have them returned.
5. at the moment, only the most tech. savvy people are storing their own bitcoin with any degree of security.  Just stay away if you are not comfortable with it until the ecosystem matures.

50/50: The bankers have more options this way.  They may be buying it just so they can (try to) kill it; they may have already plotted the trajectory to the penny of just how much better-off they would be if BTC didn't exist.  If money can come of it, no matter how, they will do whatever it takes.

Good points, though, 2) is not semantics; but rather, a technical distinction that has enormous implications.  Specifically, miners who are afoul of BIP-148 run the risk of losing all the coins they have been mining on the alternate chain; this is because a re-organization of the chain is possible in a soft-fork scenario (i.e., BIP-148).   Miners who are against BIP-148 can only throw all their hash-rate on the network now so as to influence the upcoming difficulty adjustment, to reduce the possibility of pro-BIP-148 miners from finding the first BIP-148 block before the expiration, Nov 15, 2017.  So, the hashrate question is relevant, though it is beyond my ability to calculate/predict the necessary hash-rate for the first BIP-148 compliant block to be found in the allotted time. Basically if there is ANYone mining BIP-148, then, it is happening, in which case, it is the rational miner that would mine it.
EDIT: so, the most salient question is, "how much hash-rate, (esp. in a single pool) will be mining a BIP-148 block come Aug.1-30?"
EDIT: and, "what are the most significant counter-measures against this pro-BIP-148-hashrate?"
EDIT: there is also some dispute as to the workings of the protocol regarding BIP-148 and the number of blocks required before the BIP-148 expiration (some predict the code to require 2016 blocks before Nov. 15, Though, I am not a BTC dev., so I could be mistaken).
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:19:21
Not so much a gain as it is a loss; for Bitcoin.  it reduces the available coins, thus limiting distribution; which, during the adoption phase, is destructive to long-term adoption (price rises too fast).  It is a form of attack.   Remember this, in the end, "there can be only one (coin)."
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:35:33
Yep! this, right here.  That is the true super awesomenesstest beauty of BTC!  Specifically, even if it is only a single, solitary user that wants to UASF, they can; and everyone's BTC, including this one lonesome's own BTC, will remain, intact.  AND, if the UASF is deemed to be of a particularly good rationale, the intellect of the community will compel them to adopt it, at insignificant risk to  their existing system (which remains separate and intact); it allows for a protocol upgrade to occur in parallel with the legacy system.  (EDIT: that the price of BTC became affected, throughout any of this, was merely the result of the psychological effect on the humans.. FUD).

I might be overly-optimistic, but this may be a useful purpose of KYC services, like Coinbase.

The ENTIRE value proposition of Bitcoin is: it's a popularity contest.
However, the grim fact is also, that it is an outright revolt; a conspiracy; against EVERY GOVERNMENT on the PLANET.  So, there comes a moment, for everyone that throws their allegiance behind Bitcoin, that the realization sets in; the realization that, a completely passive resistance is NOT going to win.  Or, more importantly, that a commitment to "the cause" will be required, and this reality-check will trigger a self-preservation instinct to abandon this dangerous, perilous campaign; via a sell-off.

The flaw in your logic is that BTC proto does not perform inter-chain hashrate comparisons.  The only hashrate it cares about are what it took to produce a valid block, and it compares that to realtime, and then adjusts the difficulty as required.  Otherwise, you are correct in that the initial blocks will be slow to arrive, though, most of the miners that support bip148 are currently withholding their equipment from mining so as not to create too high a starting point from which the protocol will need to adjust; but, come August 1 UTC, they will start mining and turn up the hashrate on their Bitcoin chain.

Sorry; bitcoin is NOT about compromise.  It is actual voting for what you think is best; and *IF* what YOU think is best is compromise, then, would you compromise on that? Rhetoric aside, bitcoin is about finding the most resilient code, and that which cannot be compromised.  The code is objective, and uncompromising, so, if it is flawed, there can be no compromise in resolving the flaw, objectively.  The big debate is about guessing the potential for shenanigans in a less-than-decentralized bitcoin; some think the current status is no-big deal; whereas others are predicting a slippery-slope condition.

Sorry if this hijacks the thread: I though the SW concept is that: several TX's happen on a side-chain, and it is presented to the BTC blockchain as a single BTC TX (a compression of many TX that occurred on a sidechain).  So, the (predicted) lower fees is a function of an effective reduction in the supply of TX in the mempool on the main chain.

Yeah, explain that to Marie Antoinette.
Indeed, BTC barons will need to spread that BTC far and wide, because if the wealth is concentrated, it is another form of centralization, and no one will trust BTC for the same reasons of its inception.
What will happen is this; there is already another revolt whereby the wealthy, to protect their own, have established a competing crypto.  And, being much less naive about the mundane than given credit for, will attack BTC. And, also being more savvy about warfare, will employ far more sophistication than for what anyone is ready(buying vast amounts of BTC, driving up the price, then not spending it and manipulating its market, false flags, fomenting sedition and treachery, capitalizing on imbalances, conspirators, mercenaries, etc.), and these destabilizing actions will both escalate and cycle at unpredictable rates.  BTC will already need to accelerate its outperformance of competing crypto's; cryptos that are already become even more within reach of the average Joe and spread farther afield.  If BTC appears to be too scarce, then no one will use it; Because Joe abides.

despite what everyone says... the value in mining is as much a contribution to the network as it is for the mind-expanding experience; specifically, you may be inspired to discover/create something (&amp; not necessarily bitcoin-related either) as a result of the immersion (yes, an Archimedean pun).
* get an old ASIC ( 'cause they should be less expensive).
* use it to mine on the testnet (your own full node).
* switch to mainnet and mine for a few days- watch your logs.

Selling them does not ensure they aren't used against you.   You need to keep them, and turn them on immediately on Aug 1 to ensure their hash-power isn't used against BIP148.  Everyone needs to dust-off their old equipment and run them on the BIP148 chain for a couple of weeks starting Aug1.

actually, I think it is you that is hyper-focused; you miss the point that it is ethical for for an individual to contribute to the security of his community; (and, it is because of this lack of awareness among community members that benefit from belonging, that it was necessary to establish a mandate for taxation- that you disagree that income (vs. estate value, physical vitality? %GDP?) should be used as the basis for determining the level of contribution, is merely a detail- a tree in the forest).

hashrate gets split at that same point where a transaction is bip148 complaint; bip148 nodes simply don't recognize the hashrate of any non-compliant miners, therefore, the only miners it recognizes are bip148, and they are 100% for bip148.  Now, if what you mean is to ask is for a comparison of the actual hashrate between the two chains, then that is not entirely irrelevant, though is not totally an issue because the proto will adjust difficulty down to make it 10 minutes between blocks, eventually.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:48:45
Yes; that is at the core of the issue at-hand (BIP148, UAHF, etc.).  When it becomes obvious that there is an imbalance of hash-power, there is a revolt.  To avoid a revolt is precisely why the mining pools have, in the past, coordinated to avoid excess advantage (ghash.io).

intentions are irrelevant.   The facts are relevant.  Bitmain is exploiting an advantage created upon the backs of the millions of people under the political control of his government. He is not their champion. This is NOT bitcoin...  Bitcoin is consensus. Bitcoin is justice!

yep, and they will crash themselves to a single winner.. a winner who'll no longer have incentive to suppress the price.

Totally; I get it; I feel you,  however..   It must prove itself, and prove that the collective has engineered it be invincible, resistant to social forces, else gold really IS more valuable.  else, Darwin.

Well, if you want *my* conspiracy theory:
Jihan tells China, "I require assistance toward furthering our plans."  
China responds, "I see, at the right moment, we unleash hashpower upon the target."
Jihan, "yes, of course."
EDIT:  Conspiracy theory aside, does anyone need more proof that hashpower concentrated within the borders of a political body meets the definition of "centralized"?  Or that trying to split hairs differentiating hashpower vs ledger is asinine? Seriously.

They don]t have to be felons; the mere appearance is damning; just ask Gary Condit.

Obviously I have no idea how many, but I do know that there is incentive: Revenge.  All those ASICS that are sitting, dusty, in the closets of bitter miners that are pissed that they even had to buy ASICs from specialty manufacturers. Manufacturers who set  marginal ROI price-point for the hardware, AND use the profit to also fund their private competitive mining!  Basically, any pool that is not run by a ASIC manufacturer has incentive to UASF.
