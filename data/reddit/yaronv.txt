Do you consider gbt (get lock template, I assume) to be fully decenterlized?
For one thing you have to trust pool operator to trust you. 
If I am a new guy that offer low fees, no one will join my pool unless I have some reputation. 
Need for reputation enables high fees and prevent and served as a barrier for compatition.

Maybe I am missing something. 
But I thought that even in gbt the pool operator pays the miners.

No, we are at very early stages of development. We only have the whitepaper for now.
We will take the connectivity issue into consideration.
There are solutions for that, but perhaps too compilcated ones.
Thank you for pointing it out.
Note that some of these issues might be less applicable for non-bitcoin blockchains.
In particular if an average block contains very few txs, then connectivity might not be super important.
Nevertheless, the reason I am posting it here was to get feedback from bitcoiners. And I thank you for the detailed responses.

We offer high scalabity from day 1. 
P2pool requires more work to increase its scalability. 
In simple words, currently p2pool is impractical if the pool size &gt; 1%. 
In addition, in some blockchains p2pool solution can't technically work, since they have different coinbase tx formats.

Technically, a pool can say it doesn't pay if the blocks contain some txs. 
I guess one argument would be that such behavior leave trails and miners will go to a different pool. 
But at least in theory it is not full decenterlization.

Our protocol does not solve region centralization.

I think it worth mentioning that in present form p2pool has real scalability issues. 
If 10% of the network will work with it, the miners' variance will be huge. 
They have cool plans for increasing scalability, but at the moment it is not scalable.

The security of p2pool dictates that the entire pool would submit a single share in a 1 minute interval. 
If the entire network would mine with p2pool the variance would be huge. 
In fact, even today some organize in pools in order to mine for p2pool. Otherwise the variance is too big.

Do you have figures or estimation on p2pool orphan rate?
Stale shares is not an issue in our protocol.
True, in our protocol miners would have to take care for high connectivity. We hope that low fees could compensate for need of better infrastructure. 
That said, in other blockchains, where block intervals could be as low as 15 seconds, the connection time with the pool operator is also an issue. There miners already have an incentive to create good connectivity with the network. 
There also orphan (uncle) blocks are partially rewarded (7/8 block reward).

I was reading some comments of on p2pool in other threads.
I get the impression that it is an active project.

Thanks for the stats.


Must admit that incentivizing to have good connectivity was not part of our initial goals. I guess p2pool also does not give such incentives (only incentivizes connectivity among pool members).
We could think of some tricks to do it. Either relying on timestamps or do some dedicated games to incentives good connectivity. But I would have to think about it more.


See contract code [here](
In particular take a look at `submitShares` and `verifyPendingShares` functions.
Note that in our protocols miners could submit their shares days after they were mined.
Also note that we only validate that shares form a valid block header (i.e., we only examine the 80 bytes header).

Could you elaborate on other solutions, other than p2pool?

What if it prevent rewards only from txs that are sent to wikiliks?
I can agree with your argument that perhaps the best "decentralization increase" per given investment is to extend gbt.

Our technique can work with any smart contract platform. 
Even if it is not pegged with bitcoin.

Beware that P2SH is not a good way to outsource computations.
All submitted solutions are visible and miners or nodes with better connectivity could submit them on their behalf (and get the reward).
