Thanks mate. I might go with Electrum but I still have to research if there's a better fit for what I need. And I still have to read up more on Bitcoin to completely understand what I'm getting myself into. This sub is a great resource for noobs like me. Thanks!

If you want to buy an item from Amazon, maybe you should use Purse.io instead. I think you can also get gift cards from there.

Which company is that?

Not OP but complete newbie as well. What's a good wallet to use? If I backed up the wallet file in a USB for example but don't update it every transaction, can I still use it to recover everything?

You should look here:  and maybe you should use Amazon.ca instead of Amazon.com when picking your item. Better yet, go to r/PurseIO. I'm a seller though so I have limited knowledge on the buying part of the process.

So if someone gets ahold of my unencrypted wallet.dat file, they could take my coins and run, right?

Check out Purse.io. You don't need GC's there. Just list the items that you want directly and the buyer will buy it for you.

Welp. Looks like it doesn't support Amazon.de. AFAIK Amazon US GC doesn't work in other countries. Have you tried r/giftcardexchange? Someone might have what you need.
