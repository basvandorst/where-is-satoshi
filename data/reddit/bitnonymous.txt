Right on dude.  I keep telling people:  
revolutionary technology + millions wanting to use it + mass media frenzy + mass adoption increasing + acceptance increasing + scarcity = WE WILL NEVER SEE TRIPLE DIGITS IN BITCOIN AGAIN.  Where are all the Bitcoin Trolls? "Bitcoin is over!" "Bitcoin is dead!".  Their heads must be exploding as we surge.

Terrorists are in other countries, it would be vital for these terrorists to use bitcoin so NSA can track them, suppose they can't?

I think Hactivism could start to cause pain to those attempting to suppress revolutionary technologies.  Not just revolutionary technologies, but technologies that can benefit mankind and free the enslaved (basically all of us unless you are top 1%).  I would like to see governments and central banks hit with these attacks.  Also, those involved in revolutionary tech have enough credentials to land job positions at key organisations and cause pain from within.  I have no skills in this regard but if I did I would like to get a job inside the belly of the beast and wage such a covert war against the oppressors.

I can say without doubt it is NOT the NSA behind Bitcoin.  There is simply too much resistance to it from the major players.  NSA would have had backdoor deals with major countries "just let em use Bitcoin, we can then track their illicit behavior and let you in on it".  That is what would have happened.  No way it's NSA imo.

I'm not sure if you're joking or not, but I also felt that Satoshi could have also been an alien trying to help us evolve to our full potential.  He was likely forbidden to directly interfere but allowed to use our own existing technology to change things.

If NSA was behind bitcoin all countries would have backdoor deals with the NSA to track their citizens on bitcoin.  In reality many countries are rejecting Bitcoin.  There is no conspiracy here.
