I don't think there's anyone in particular to contact, what generally happens is that a Wikipedia administrator notices a lot of edit warring (when people keep on undoing other people's edits), at which point they temporarily lock the article and block offending editors for a while.

I'm not sure what makes you think this, the whole point of Zerocoin is to make Bitcoin anonymous. If all Bitcoins were sent through Zerocoin, they would be indistinguishable, hence either all Bitcoins would be tainted, or none would be. You can think of it as a built in, trustless mixing service for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:43:18
Not exactly. Basically a few months ago an extension to Bitcoin, called Zerocoin, was proposed, Zerocoin would make Bitcoin anonymous.
The problem was that the proofs needed for Zerocoin took a lot of processing power and too much storage space to be practical. The 98% reduction in size means that Zerocoin is now lightweight enough to be implemented into Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency).

I think users of this subreddit get annoyed/defensive when people criticize bitcoin but don't seem to have a clue what they're talking about and clearly haven't read up on it at all ([example]( I don't think people on this subreddit mind when reasonable concerns are brought up (e.g. inflation or ease of use), though obviously there are some people who get defensive about these things too.
I guess it's also that a lot of people here see the potential of bitcoin, but can't see why others don't see this.

Yes, but my point was that although there are no quoted opinions in the USD article, there are facts which are clearly negative.


Perhaps you already implied this, but the Bitcoin article is simply quoting other's opinions, it isn't directly giving an opinion.


As I have already said, the critical quotes from a couple of sources are included because Bitcoin is a controversial topic. Why don't you consider this an adequate reason?


Provide a reasonable argument for removing these criticisms. You keep telling me that you've made a strong argument, but as far as I can see I've refuted all your points so far.


I am willing to change things in the article (and have done so dozens of times). However, I am not willing to remove all criticism of Bitcoin and make the article biased just because you want me to. I want to make a neutral article about Bitcoin, not an advert.

There are mBTC (1/1000 of a bitcoin) and μBTC (1/1000000 of a bitcoin). I think the 21 million bitcoins each divisible to 8 decimal places (instead of 2.1x10^10 or something) is because it's on the limit of what can be expressed exactly by a floating point number; if the number were larger, bitcoin programming would be much harder in many programming languages (you can see a more thorough explanation [here](

I agree, but I think this is the idea with Zerocoin (perhaps with an option to not anonymize a particular transaction in order to keep colored coins). However it can't be done at the moment as Zerocoin uses up too much storage on the blockchain. may have meant that people are trying to optimize these extensions when he said that "There are very smart cryptographers and computer programmers working on it".

It makes sense to invest a little in Bitcoin (no more than you can afford to lose, there's a decent chance that Bitcoin will fall in value). 
I think that in the long run, Bitcoin will either go to (almost) $0, or to a fairly high value (e.g. over $1000). Suppose you buy 1 BTC, if it goes to $0, then haven't lost too much ($100), if it goes to a high value, then you stand to gain a very large amount (e.g. over $1000).
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:48:55
To be honest I don't think anyone knows, there will probably a crash (or at least some sort of correction) at some point, due to how much Bitcoin has recent risen. But nobody knows when this crash will be, or how much BTC will fall (i.e. whether the minumum after the crash will be above or below the current price).
I'm personally holding onto my BTC for a long time. I figure that neither I, nor anybody else can accurately predict a crash.

I thought the idea was to provide advice based on how much was being bought. For example if an exchange has a low flat fee but a high percentage fee, it may be advantageous to go for a different exchange which offers a lower percentage fee if you're making a very large purchase. Or to take another example, some banks may have "concerns" if too large a sum is withdrawn in one go (and hence the person should use other means to transfer the money).

This is partially correct. Fees do affect processing priority, however, from my experience, a "low fee" must be extremely low indeed. I don't think I've ever paid more than the equivalent of $0.05 for a transaction fee (usually less), but as far as I know, all of my transactions have been included in the first block after my transaction. No fee transactions may take a long time to confirm (or just never confirm), so it's important to pay the fee.
The reason that I said it was partially correct is that other factors affect processing priority. Firstly, transactions in which a large amount of bitcoin (&gt;0.01 BTC) is sent can generally be sent without fees (whilst still confirming quickly). Secondly, the size of the transaction in kB also has an effect, the more kBs, the greater the fee needed to ensure quick confirmations.

I suppose you are technically correct in that there are no critical opinions in the intro to the USD article, but there is a negative fact with the claim in the article that "the U.S. dollar is the most commonly used form of wealth transfer in drug trafficking operations".
I agree that the criticisms are also applicable to other cryptocurrencies, but they still apply to Bitcoin (which, after all, is still the main cryptocurrency). Also, Bitcoin has probably received far more criticism than the other cryptocurrencies (by virtue of being much larger than they are).

It will probably become too big for the average person using their phone/laptop to store a copy (though Moore's law indicates that this may not actually be an issue), so most people would just use a thin client like Electrum (doesn't store the blockchain).

I've moved the list of Bitcoin thefts to the history page (it seemed strange that the list of thefts was several times larger than the entire section on the history of Bitcoin).

They're given as examples, magazines are named because saying "some people have said x" doesn't give much information about who is actually saying these things. The article should discuss the controversy surrounding Bitcoin, as well as the actual technology.
It's not a smear attempt, there are sentences giving arguments both for and against Bitcoin (the same paragraph gives examples of companies which support Bitcoin). I should point out that Bitcoin is not the only article to have these sort of criticisms, for example the lead section in the [USD]( article mentions that "the U.S. dollar is the most commonly used form of wealth transfer in drug trafficking operations".
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:06:44

Well in his (scam on this post, he just posted his own Namecoin addresses claiming that they were the addresses of a well known mixing service (in the hope that people would send to them). 
In the examples I posted above he made a post claiming that he'd lost a lot of Bitcoins (I didn't get a chance to see the actual message, but judging by the replies, he either asked for people to "donate" money to him to compensate for his losses, or he asked people to pay 1 BTC to have his encrypted wallet).

The magazines are named to let readers assess the validity of the source for themselves, otherwise people could easily add claims such as "most experts have agreed that Bitcoin is a scam" with no source or evidence to back up these claims, forcing the reader to just trust the article. [This page]( explains it further.
The choice of the magazine doesn't really matter, The Economist's opinion was probably chosen because it's fairly notable. The differing opinions were probably mentioned in the introduction because Bitcoin has so far been controversial (although the actual opinions are not facts, it is a fact that The Economist has made these claims about Bitcoin).

You are correct, there is a transaction fee. I suspect what meant was that the fee was extremely small compared to current fees for sending money via other methods. To take an example (I just took one of the most recent transactions from blockchain.info), bitcoins worth tens of thousands of USD were [sent]( for a fee of about $0.03.
@_date: 2013-08-11 16:46:44
I normally use BTC, it seems to be used far more commonly than XBT (standards and abbreviations should depend on how they are actually used, not on decisions from some committee). While Bitcoin remains relatively small, it seems pointless to complicate matters by worrying about a hypothetical ISO announcement. I think it's likely that such an announcement would only happen if Bitcoin grew substantially (perhaps to the level of replacing other currencies), at that point, most people would probably just stick with the currently used BTC.

I'll explain it again, the article doesn't directly have any opinions. The opinions are **quoted** because it's more helpful to say "The economist thought Bitcoin was bad because of x, y and z" than "some people think Bitcoin's bad". There is a controversy section later on (the reception section), but the introduction is meant to give an overview (and hence an overview of the controversy). It is important to discuss the controversy over Bitcoin because (whether you like it or not), Bitcoin has so far proved controversial.


The article is about "Bitcoin", it is not a "[Protocol of Bitcoin]( article, so the reception of Bitcoin is important. After all, someone reading about Bitcoin for the first time would probably find it helpful to know how Bitcoin has been received, as well as how it works.
The opinions would of course be irrelevant in the "Protocol of Bitcoin" article.


No, those people were criticizing Bitcoin (though their criticisms may have applied to other currencies too). Even if they were talking about cryptocurrencies in general, the criticisms would still apply to Bitcoin.


You seem to have conveniently "not noticed" the rest of the paragraph, so I'll quote it here:
*In 2012, The Economist reasoned that Bitcoin has been popular because of "its role in dodgy online markets," and in 2013 the FBI shut down one such service, Silk Road, which specialized in illegal drugs (whereupon the FBI came into the control of approximately 1.5% of all bitcoins in circulation). However, bitcoins are increasingly used as payment for legitimate products and services, and merchants have an incentive to accept the currency because transaction fees are lower than the 2 to 3% imposed by credit card processors. Notable vendors include Wordpress, OkCupid, Reddit, Chinese Internet giant Baidu, and Humble Bundle.*
You can clearly see that there's a bit criticizing Bitcoin (dodgy markets), but immediately after that there are very positive claims (increasing legitimate use, low fees). The negative **and** the positive are included to ensure a balanced view overall. You seem to want to bias the article by only removing that first half, leaving all this good stuff just below.
@_date: 2013-09-04 16:19:21
It's probably a safer choice to just buy bitcoin; if bitcoin takes off, holding bitcoin will be like investing in TCP/IP before the internet became popular, holding mining equipment/bitcoin company shares would be like investing in a dotcom company.

@_date: 2013-11-04 20:27:11


Bear in mind that Bitcoin is also used in the "dodgy markets" I described earlier, another reason why this is mentioned in the introduction. 
You seem to be saying that criticism of Bitcoin should be removed because the problems also apply to other cryptocurrencies, however, just because some of these problems are shared by other currencies does not mean that Bitcoin suddenly lacks these problems. It is absolutely fine for there to be a particular criticism/controversy section in both the cryptocurrency and Bitcoin articles. 
Furthermore, almost all these critical news articles are specifically talking about Bitcoin, hence why these criticisms are quoted in the Bitcoin article. Their criticisms don't change to criticisms of cryptocurrency just because you think they've made a mistake (even though I agree that almost all these criticisms apply to cryptocurrencies as a whole), Wikipedia doesn't allow original research, it's a tertiary information source, and collects its information from other sources.
Bear in mind that the article also mentions advantages to Bitcoin such as low transaction fees and fast transactions, despite other cryptocurrencies having the same properties. I still think the article should keep these things and not instead only have it in the cryptocurrency article.

I just want to emphasise that you should use an wallet where you hold the private keys (as opposed to an online wallet where another company holds the keys). Bitcoin has had many instances of online wallet holders closing down, getting hacked, or getting "hacked" (and taking people's bitcoins with them). 
Also, make sure you backup your keys in several locations.

My guess is that Bitcoin would implement Zerocoin's anonymity features if they became important.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:49:21
I think the idea is that as bitcoin (hopefully) becomes more popular, there will be more transactions, so the total fees paid to miners will increase. Also, if fees were ever too small to provide an incentive for miners, the miners could simply not allow transactions with no fees/extremely small fees (perhaps requiring fees worth $0.05 to ensure the transaction goes through). Each individual fee may seem small, but they quickly add up.
How would you stop people repeatedly tapping this faucet with a program? It's easy to have a captcha with a centralized sever, because they can hold "answers" to the captchas in secret, but it seems difficult to stop one person taking all the bitcoins from a decentralized faucet, after all, they could presumably create hundreds of addresses in order to claim a large amount.
On a slightly related note, faucets are one of the only times in which Bitcoin transaction fees can become a problem. Basically each time you get bitcoin from a faucet, you get a very small amount. If you want a large amount, you must have a large number of incoming transactions, which we'll call "inputs". To make a transaction later on, you would have to bundle up all of these inputs, which increases the number of kBs of your transaction (possibly into 100s of kBs), making your transaction fees much larger than normal.
