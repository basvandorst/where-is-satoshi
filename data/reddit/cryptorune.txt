it's not stealing whoever has the keys can use the coins. he did noting malicious to get the keys. if you have your private key out on the internet in plain text of course someone is going to move the bitcoins
@_date: 2016-08-15 07:02:43
Your question lacks tons of info that is needed to answer. 
If you still have the hard drive from that pc and did not delete the file "wallet.dat" (this file contains your private key).  the private key is how you can get the bitcoins
If the file was deleted you might be able to recover it with recovery software. as long as the hard drive did not have data written onto it to much after it was deleted.
If the hard drive is dead and wont turn on at all it is still possible to get the private key off of it if you paid professionals to extract the data from the drive but it would cost more then the 5 bitcoins.

if you dont take them someone else will soon if the guy complains you can always return it maybe even get a reward

60mil just to cover losses and then they have to buy it
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:18:09
No it's not it's like saying if you take a hundred dollar bill inb put it on a park bench it is not stealing. is a better analogy this guy has his private key in a public place google in plain text  your porch is your private property and ppl need to trespass to get onto it. 
Your reasoning is bad
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:49:28
Just import the keys into a light wallet and try from there. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 03:18:16
I never used armor but im guessing it is like bitcoin-qt. open console and unlock the wallet command is something like  " walletpassphrase PASSWORD 500 " that should unlock it for 500 seconds.  replace "PASSWORD" with the actual password.
then do the command to dump the private keys " something like this
dumpprivkey your-bitcoin-adress-here "
after you have all the private keys for the addresses you want download some light wallet and import them there or import them to blockchain.info
Armory prob has a help menu to get it's exact commands if these don't work 
Stop sending transactions with such high fees instead send them to me lol 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:26:06
Yea I obviously will never touch anything even remotely related to bitfinex if these become "customer losses".
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:27:41
if you got a email with the long code somewhere you could use that to recover the bitcoins also thats a good place to start checking 
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:22:56
No bitcoins had no value 10 years ago. So it has gone up ∞ vs gold.
@_date: 2016-06-29 23:42:17
If they can't prove they sent it then they are lying obviously. Take it to twitter or something get enough attention and maybe you can force them to address this.
@_date: 2016-06-30 01:00:47
It did not get more complicated it always worked like this.
3 years ago blocks where not full at all so every single person got priority no matter what they paid.
Now blocks are full and you need to pay more then others to get priority.
Bitcoin was always built this way but it never showed until recently.
This is why there is such a block size debate
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:26:26
lol obviously wrong just do a little google search 
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:15:56
Does not look simple even after seeing the solution to 1 
@_date: 2016-06-30 12:34:59
most people would be unable to buy 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:54:47
I think with the provided information from this image I could get this private key could take awhile though. 
Hi Derek!
@_date: 2016-06-30 21:15:12
I am not excited for this at all.
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:09:20
I never claimed it was stable or not. 
You told him that it was not stable I am asking you what your evidence is?
or him 
otherwise you both are just making baseless claims.
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:21:13
once you give them your money they have control over it.
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:41:26
Also just don't use Bitshares! 
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:13:11
Wish I had money to throw around like you
@_date: 2016-06-30 21:30:30
The image gives you a place to start looking and a potentially smaller amount of space to look at to find the correct key. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:44:16
News comes out bitcoin is a safe haven ppl think about investing. CRASH!!!!! ppl say nope
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:31:03
link to transaction? the fee must just be to low. 
It will get accepted eventually no need to panic could just be awhile. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 23:15:31
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:12:28
sell to not lose more money price drops more other ppl sell so they don't lose more money price drops more.
until it gets so low people who sold early see a buying opportunity then price jumps a bit calms down
@_date: 2016-06-29 23:55:21
Do it manually  
with Electrum 
Green is the next block
Yellow is in 1 to 2 blocks delayed 
Orange is a long time till maybe never

It looks like if you withdraw open.BTC assets as BTC it should be fine..
what is the address you sent it to
@_date: 2016-06-20 04:25:40
mining is always a loss
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:37:58
I used to make money on steam dota 2 item trading and would have to convert keys (the currency used at the time in dota) to bitcoins so I could spend the money. 
and keys cost $2.50 but would sell for $1.70
I did 1000's of dollars of transactions like that there is a whole economy there but to convert to REAL money you have to take a loss
@_date: 2016-06-30 12:33:39
If you still have the hard drive they should still be there unless you reinstalled windows. 
it would be in this directory C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin
replace "USERNAME" with your profiles username

This is why you should not use online wallets. how much did they steal from you?

I don't understand what you did it is very confusing? 
please explain better
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:08:55
what wallet are you using?
@_date: 2016-06-20 04:29:38
Now there is less supply to acquire Bitcoins though mining so every one with bitcoins will want more money before they part with there Bitcoins. 
It creates an artificial increase in scarcity because buyers have less ways to get bitcoin they have to buy from the market.
Everyone knows about the halving so they know they can charge more for there Bitcoins
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:42:26
bitfinex happened 
@_date: 2016-06-17 15:25:43
You don't know the address you sent the bitcoins to? 
Your bitcoin wallet address

You can not mine bitcoin with normal consumer PC hardware any longer. You need to create or buy ASIC hardware that can compete with the other asic's in use.

sending USD funds to btc-e is a bit  more expensive fee wise. 
That is why prices are lower
@_date: 2016-07-05 17:02:14
it cant work because bitcoin sucks for micro transactions and fees are just to high

This format is very easy to create with fiat. why is bitcoin even involved? A Niche within a Niche sounds to me like it wont work.
If it was going to work it would exist with a fiat format.
@_date: 2016-07-08 06:51:41
It does not need to increase in value to be an investment. 
Example: joe smo might buy a suit while he is job hunting. 
It could be a good investment. The return is a higher chance of landing a job.

If people can link to the cards or embed them into there own sites.
People could replace a tip jar with this bitcoin visualization card for fun.

how is it off chain? I have to deposit all the money I ever plan to use in one big deposit? I don't understand off chain transaction with my offline local wallet
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:22:08
Yes 10,000 is obviously possible.
But don't hold your breath thinking the halving will make it jump that far.
@_date: 2016-07-16 17:55:00
Depends on the fee you pay on each.
If you pay a good enough fee to get accepted into the first available block they will all process asap.
@_date: 2016-07-05 23:47:43
I personally like to send my btc to a new created wallet instead of importing. 
But there is no reason you need to if you don't want to. 
If you are only playing around with a few dollars I would not waste the fee money sending it.
The import is fine.
@_date: 2016-07-17 14:43:13
Need a way to link to the cards otherwise it is not fun
@_date: 2016-07-15 11:06:11
This transactions can't be canceled but you can spend a transaction with a fee that uses these coins making this transaction invalid.
Essentially a double spend. Yes you can do this I have never done it myself.
Most wallet software will not let you attempt a double spend because they are trying to help users not make errors. 
You just have to send the same transaction but this time with a fee the network will accept it and it will be in a block making this other no fee transaction invalid and removed.
I don't know how you get around the wallet software and get this done though. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 22:07:07
Ha absolutely no details. 
Nice post

It's important to public perception of the current monetary system so it is related to bitcoin the alternative.

if it's a contract on amazon it is a scam lol.
Try these instead   
@_date: 2016-07-15 08:06:54
no fee means it will take a long time,
29 blocks minimum to possibly taking so long it drops off after 3 days of waiting.  
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:24:57
why do I care what they think
@_date: 2016-07-08 06:31:48
It depends how much money you have to just blow. It's obviously not a good investment of your funds.

About 4.5 for the coin and 25.5 btc face value
Pretty expensive very pretty nonetheless
