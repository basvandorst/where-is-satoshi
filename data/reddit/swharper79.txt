Grassley (R- IA) introduced this bill.

Read it and weep.  You've been conned.

My iPhone 5s is far from obsolete from lack of NFC technology because very few people actually use NFC technology(despite it being in many people's hands). Just because a phone has an NFC chip has not been enough to make the technology mainstream - there are many other pieces to the puzzle in order to achieve mainstream use, which proves my point along with basically every article written on the topic. 
Anyhow the aforementioned article does an excellent job explaining the reasons for leaving out NFC until 2014.
Here's another:

Or perhaps due to size constraints of the components or battery life concerns, issues surrounding contractual deals with the various institutions involved in such transactions, etc, etc?

What metric are you using to state that NFC is "popular" or that a iPhone 5s is obsolete technology since it doesn't feature it?

NFC requires electronics which have an impact on the engineering of the device, which Apple customizes to fit within its own design constraints.  The fact that Android phones have had it for awhile is irrelevant because they feature different cases, widths, lengths, batteries, etc.  The iPhone is one of the thinnest in its class so I have a hard time believing that there's an abundance of extra room on the logic board for extraneous processors.

Apple rolls out vertical solutions and without ApplePay NFC isn't useful anyhow.

[Here's]( some actual data showing that NFC/mobile payments lack traction.  Given that the technology has been slow to gain traction its fair to say we can put to bed your unsubstantiated claim that phones made without it were engineered to be obsolete in 2014 once NFC technology has been added.

A7 processor, M5coprocessor, gyroscope, RAM, memory, custom camera components, custom fingerprint scanning components etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.  There's a lot of engineering that goes into iPhones in particular all of which interplay into the overall package.  Additionally, as I already mentioned they are still in the process of getting additional vendors on board ApplePay (contractual issues), and NFC is only just starting to catch on now in 2014.

In case it isn't clear - just because a feature exists on a phone doesn't mean people actually use it.  I know, very complicated.
