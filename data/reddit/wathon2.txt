The Scarcity concept only apply to thing with intrinsic value, something that people actually want. 
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, but by all mean, keep pouring your life saving into bitcoin until it goes to 0.

holders have been calling bottom since it was 10k, 9k, 6k, 5k, 3.5k, ect..  Their hands must be all bloody now catching all these falling knives. 
The Absolute bottom is ZERO.  Until then, it can always go lower.

such shortsightedness,  bitcoin is only as valuable as there are fools willing to buy them, the greater fool theory.
Stories like these will SCARE away any potential buyer.  Good luck with your holding when no one is buying.

No.  Each bitcoin can be divided into millions parts,  determined scarcity is a lie. 
When people can no longer mined bitcoin, they will simply divide the existing coin thus increasing supply.

Crypto Junkies:  crypto-currency is decentralized and can't be controlled by the govt. or any one entity.  
Also Crypto Junkies:  OMG, there need to be consumer protection in place.   Where is the govt!!  where is my money.  
LOL.  Oh, the irony.  CryptoCurrency,  the biggest scam of the century.

Yet another reason to not invest in crypto at all.

The idea of "you don't lose if you don't sell" is dumb AF. 
Guess what, there is something known as opportunity cost.  Instead of holding the bag while earning no dividend, that money could have been used to make money elsewhere had you sold. 
While it's technically true that losses aren't realized until you sold; you are not making money either.  And Time = money.   Bitcoin has no fundamental, only hype, and the hype is over.   It will never go back to 20k.

Why use log scale?  Easy, because linear scale will make it looks like a pump-n-dump pyramid scheme.
