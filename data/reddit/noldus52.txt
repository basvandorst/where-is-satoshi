Ohh fuck! [Can cryptocurrency and the weakening of national states, as in the post above, be our great filter]( preventing us humans from reaching eternal life in the universe? 
That post made me think. Something like that that can defenitly happen in the future, and perhaps will the only way for the masses of people left out of the loop, to survive, be to eliminate all the technology that made the inequality gap arise in the first place. 
Technology is destroyed, society is reset to a time hundreds of years back. Where people are equal, in the sense that what their body can do is important for society and hence holds value. 
That would leave us as humans, again stuck in our primitive form,  because our "great filter" is ourself and our individual instinct to survive at the cost of the greater good. Perhaps it is the same out there in the universe, when lifeforms finally manage to almost reach a point where they can project their collective efforts and is-ness of their race/species out in the universe - then the individual parts of that life form causes the whole to collapse. 
In the future, with automation, people will be unimportant. And a scenario like this, where the rich can gang up in enclaves like this - is far from an unlikely scenario.
We should have been smart ants instead of smart monkeys.
Or it is about time that we start thinking about communism again. If people are left out, they will riot, eventually capture a nuclear sub, blow the world up.
