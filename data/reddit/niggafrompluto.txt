He's an idiot. Don't entertain people like that by responding. Not worth your time.

Lol this is literally how bitcoin started....
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:57:26
This is a great list!
One thing I can think of is that the lower cost of transaction could make my groceries cheaper.
I do understand the protocol and how it works and how it can be useful for other cases. I was specifically asking about the monetary usecase though.

+1 for closure

Sounds like he lost the motivation to think halfway through his post and thought "fuck it, but I've already written half of the post already so might as well click submit, but oh wait let me address this one last point with some BS for good measure."

You sound fucking stupid, and word has it that the conference was just as stupid as you sound (e.g. circling sequential numbers on a piece of paper with numbers for no fucking reason, etc)

I think the "B+" was highly sarcastic.

Then tell me why YOU would want to use Bitcoin in common everyday transactions! That's why I asked. I want to know what you and others here think.

I understand the protocol and its many usecases. The blockchain is fantastic.
I wanted to know why people thought there was great potential for the specific use of common every day transactions.

You kids have fun, Bitcoin is a fucking mess and I'm out.
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:49:58
Thank you for actually answering my question and taking the time to explain!
Some of what you said makes absolute sense. It seems like a great way for people in disadvantaged situations to move value around.
However let's take the United States for example. I don't think I'm in the minority demographic in the US. I think most people do have access to some form of a credit card or at least a debit card. Forget the credit card for a second. When you have a debit card what advantages does Bitcoin get you?
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:36:59
Tell me what advantages Bitcoin gives me when I'm buying groceries because I really want to understand.
I agree different people care about different things, but buying groceries is a mundane task that I'm sure we can all somewhat relate to.
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:52:12
Fortunately you have consumer protection and the bank or credit card would have detected illicit purchases and refunded any transactions that aren't yours.
So I'm not sure yours is the best example.
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:55:47
When did I say I was smarter than anyone else and when did I say I wasn't looking at bitcoin as a whole?
This is a very specific post targeting the use case of common every day purchases. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 19:28:42
I think bitcoin is awesome, but I'm still not going to use it to buy shit. It doesn't make my life easier.
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:35:08
Have fun gambling.
