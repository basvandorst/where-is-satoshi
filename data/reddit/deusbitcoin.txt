Stealing has been apart of the psyche of this community from day 1. Taking advantage of someone is perfectly fine. Remember Hall Finney acknowledged bitcoin to be a ponzi scheme and encouraged early followers to accumulate.

The only way they can increase the value of their coins is by investing into BTC ventures to increase the available liquidity. So it's a win win for everyone.

Without meeting someone in a dark alley you have only once choice and that is hand over all your personal information to a shitty bitcoin startup and they can debit your bank account. Whole process takes about a week. Currency of the future.

Bitinstant was the last place that enabled obtaining bitcoin in under 5minutes at 50,000 locations in the US. Back in those days you could buy BTC inside Walmart and have them delivered within minutes to your phone...
The ecosystem never recovered since as now it takes days upon days and endless documents.

Roger Ver + Satoshi Nakamoto own up to 25% of saleable coins...

Amazing how this subreddt has no clue how markets work.
Someone offered $2mil of bitcoin  and someone bought it. Ownership of 2 things changed hands at an agreed upon ratio.
This subreddit is deluded beyond belief. Bitcoin has 2 prices a bid and an ask and they should only be of concern if you are buying or selling.

Basically you'll have to find half a dozen middle men, fill out loads of AML/KYC forms, give all your personal info to shady companies and risk the BTC price going down in the meantime.
Progress.
