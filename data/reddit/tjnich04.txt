ITHINK I FIGURED IT OUT.
i sent the 0.01 btc to my trezor before adding the passphrase. i then added the passphrase as it was being sent. so it went to the other address. so.. now how can i accesss the 0.01 btc ?

i sent my btc to my trezor before having a trezor passphrase. then i added a passphrase while the btc was being sent. this passphrase was giving me a different address than i had sent the first btc to.

its been 65 minutes now
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:31:29
i did this and it shows 0 btc and nothing pending...
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:17:27
where can you see the address on gdax that youve sent btc to? all i can see is the amount and a transfer ID number
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:08:41
makes no sense. but thats why i only sent 0.01 btc. still no clue where the error happened. i just now sent 0.001 to my trezor and it is showing pending in coinbase but the address its pending to is actually the correct trezor address this time
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:29:37
GOT IT! if i just press enter instead of typing my passphrase then my 0.01btc shows up! so how do i transfer that 0.01 to my address with the passphrase lol

@_date: 2017-11-19 07:42:45
ok now im really confused because it says that i sent the 0.01 btc to an entirely different address than my trezor. but i copied and pasted... i looked that account up and sure enough it has 0.01 btc in it
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:15:33
ok.. 3 hours and still nothing
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:36:37
thank you
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:36:14
that is crazy. luckily it doesnt really matter how long for me it takes
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:12:42
and ive never used that btc address
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:46:07
i only transferred 0.01 btc to make sure it worked 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:46:52
ok, it wasnt much for the first transfer im just making sure it works. i figured it would at least show up on trezor as pending..
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:21:38
thanks. didnt know if there was a better way to do it without the sending fee
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:40:48
it also shows my daily withdrawal limit used as $0, but the amount of btc that i tried transferring has been deducted from my balance
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:30:00
wouldnt it still show as pending on the trezor?
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:12:28
but how the fuck did that address even get there... i never typed in anything. copied and pasted everything!
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:13:37
HELP. i did the same thing. i transferred btc from gdax to my trezor address and nothing. on gdax it says complete, on my trezor it is showing nothing. i dont know whats going on!
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:33:52
which is what i always do. it ended up being because i added the passphrase mid-transfer. it gave me a different address after the passphrase.
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:20:03
it never showed in your trezor as pending? but also showed on gdax as confirmed?
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:54:26
coinbase transaction history. but im certain that i copied and pasted my trezor address...

@_date: 2017-11-19 08:02:32
ive never sent to that other address. and its total btc in it is 0.01, the amount is sent
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:01:13
nope. both start with 3 thats it. no idea how this could have happened
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:03:17
how do i sell when that day comes? transfer everything to gdax, sell btc to usd, transfer usd to coinbase and then to my bank account?
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:36:27
good advice
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:25:21
can i always still send to my "previous address" or does it always have to be to the fresh address or the newer ones generated when you press +more addresses ?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:42:56
but im not losing this 1% if i send to my trezor am i? im a noob sorry
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:56:54
