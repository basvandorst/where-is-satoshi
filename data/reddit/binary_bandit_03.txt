Wow, thank you for such an informative response! I will definitely keep researching! I guess, as I was reading, I thought it was a for sure thing. (Internet *truths*, AmIRight)
I will keep an eye out for sure, but I was definitely going to start somewhat small, but I figured if people had a pretty good idea of what was happening it might be worth chucking an extra $100 at it. But I definitely think that the increments is the way I am heading. Thank you again!

Completely new here, so I apologize for my ignorance. 
I just set up an account, so I am waiting on Gemini verification. Once that is done though, possibly by the 1st, and I deposit from my bank instantly you are saying that I can buy the BTC right then. However, to withdraw them to a wallet will take another 4-5 days. (which makes sense) But what does that mean for the value / split on the 1st? I think I read that if it's still in the exchange then it would just convert to BCC, in other words -- I would need to some how get the BTC I bought into a wallet prior to the first. Is that correct? 
If so, I assume I am a little late then. My understanding of this whole concept is in its infancy to say the least. I think I picked the wrong day to start learning about this stuff, but I am just trying to understand if it's still a good thing to have bought them before August 1st without being able to withdraw them. 
Sorry if that was long winded / confusing, but I will do my best to clarify if you respond needing more info.
