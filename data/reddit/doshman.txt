You can argue the logical stances that you have from first principles as much as you want, but the developed world had this discussion a long time ago and we decided that workers have rights. You seem to think that for the majority of people it's easy to quit your job and then find another. It's a shame that you have to worry about putting food on the table in-between jobs, especially when you're living paycheck-to-paycheck.
I did not assert anywhere that companies "give nothing". Companies are dependent on the labour of their employees, but they sit in a priveleged position: The company can fire you and hire someone else, but you can't "fire" the company without having other arrangements. This is why workers have protected, hard-fought rights. You talk in another post about how as the owner of a company you should have the right to do with it as you wish. The thing is, workers also deserve rights, especially when a company has so much inherent coercive power over its employees.
And with respect to starting a company: No, it is absolutely not an option that most people have. Not only does it take some amount of initial capital - and when you consider how many people are living paycheck to paycheck, it just simply isn't an option. And that's not even getting into the fact that starting a business is a demanding prospect that requires plenty of savvy which many simply do not have. And that is perfectly fine: To paraphrase Caddy Shack, The world needs ditch diggers, too. And of course, even ditch diggers deserve rights.
Also, why don't you move to Somalia? Normally, I'd feel bad about taking such a lame and overdone insult, but if you get to conflate my belief that all workers deserve rights with Stalinism, then certainly you should indulge me on an equally cheap shot.
A closing note on the subject of "mafia unions": the reason why many unionization movements required assistance from organized crime groups was due to the private police and union-busting sharpshooters I alluded to earlier in this comment chain. I'm not out to paint labour movements as absolute saints: getting help from the mafia was morally gray, but they did what they needed to do.

The difference is that money laundering constitutes a deliberate actgion done to mask illegal activity, while phone use does not. Besides, using the phone to organize criminal activities can get you charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, anyway. So you should pick a more convincing example.
Also, Money Laundering charges very rarely come in alone. They're paired up with the harm-causing ones. In my personal belief system, knowingly executing actions to make prosecuting a wrong are nearly as bad as the wrong actions themselves.
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:13:01
Money laundering makes criminal investigations massively more costly. That's (probably) the main reason why it's banned. It's something that criminal organizations regularly do, hardly an "invented" crime.

Hey OP, what's the primary function of a bank?
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:50:01
Rather: Of course banks have less money on hand than they do in their accounts. This is kind of how banks work.
(Part of) The reason this is okay is that banks are insured by the gov't. You can call out the government giving "bad banks" cash as much as you want, but if they didn't loan out the money then there was a good risk the banks would collapse, and then everybody would have been worse off. To quote Ben Franklin, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
Indeed, if a bank fails, the government has insured taxpayers for 25k/account. The people who were unfortunate enough to have money in, say, Mt. Gox aren't so privileged.
So I'm still a bit cynical about Bitcoin as a cure for the issues with the financial system.

Only problem is, without them the content you're looking at would probably never have been made. 
I used to think like this, too. The first person to really open my eyes about it was Cory Doctorow, who distributes all his books under  Creative Commons. Despite this, he doesn't accept donations, and encourages people to either buy the book so that his publisher, editor, etc. can recieve their pay, or to donate to a service to get (his, IIRC) books to underfunded school libraries.

It isn't entirely the voters' fault, part of it is how reddit's voting algorithms are flawed and heavily biased towards low-effort, easily digestible content (e.g. images/image macros, articles with sensationalist headlines) over more substantial, but slower-digested content (e.g. in-depth articles, videos&gt;5 min). The effect becomes worse as subs get larger.

I guess the point of this is that customers should have the expectation that they will receive the services they have paid for, and regulation is great because it ensures that the honest companies stay honest. Transparency is no substitute for regulation, and expecting the public to have perfect information is a recipe for disaster: The only upside is that you can chide anyone who lost money with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight vision.

I'm already well aware of what the 51% attack can do. Being able to double-spend (or allow your friends to double spend) seems to be worth plenty in and of itself, as long as there are business that will work with unconfirmed transactions. The only real protection against this is adding an effective delay of ~an hour to every service to get a confirmation, which basically kneecaps Bitcoin as a competitor to credit/debit as an online payment method.
So I'm still a bit cynical, especially if a 50% attack could be going on e.g. as we speak without anyone being the wiser.

The "one issue" is denying a discriminated-against portion of the population a right which the majority have. That is a giant stumbling block. You state that the founding fathers believed the federal government could do more harm than good, but here is an instance where it is doing an act of good, and here's Ron Paul personally giving the middle finger to homosexuals and using the federal government to "do bad" while simultaneously going on about how the federal government does more harm than good.
He is part of the problem, but still claims to be part of the solution.
And wrt the closing 900 bases thing: like with marriage as a contract, he talks big, but there's no action. At least, I haven't heard of it, and I've heard a lot about Paul.

Yeah, I'm sure that the FOSS dev who is the principal author of Notepad++, the same guy who introduced the Bitcoin donation address on that page in the first place, thought that the Bitcoin address was manipulated by hackers. That is a perfectly reasonable guess to make when you have no information about the situation  at all. 
I mean, I know you just want to tar and feather anyone who does anything bad for Bitcoin (and that's assuming this is actually being pulled forever, and not, perhaps, a mistake or the result of a technical issue) as a slackjawed idiot who doesn't know anything about computers.

I notice you've replied to two of my comments in this thread (and about a week late), so I'll aggregate my response in just this one post.
[Here's a video from last year where Ron Paul reiterates his position. He pays lip service to the idea that government should have no business in marriage, but again, goes on to say that states should have "the right" to decide the definition of marriage](
He's saying one thing, but ultimately doing another. 
Ultimately, his voting record supporting bills speaks more of his true nature. He votes supporting the "one man one woman" view of marriage while voting against bills that would give gay people the right to marry. He can talk about how the government should "get out of marriage" but when he votes supporting the DOMA, which is a bill that exists completely to let the government define and enforce its definition of marriage, his actions speak louder than words.
In the same video, he goes on to defend his voting record (particularly wrt the DOMA), so I have my doubts he's had a change of heart with regards to gay marriage, unlike what you assert.
Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that Ron Paul is critical of US militarism. I wouldn't say I agree with him on all points but at the very least any functioning democracy needs critical voices. However, asserting that Ron Paul would "end war" is absolutely ludicrous, and we the voting public should absolutely not vote in representatives who give lofty, vague promises vaguely "ending war" if it means voting in someone who has concretely taken hypocritical steps towards barring rights for homosexuals, and will continue said steps.
Besides, we've already done the "let local governments decide, they'll do the right thing" thing in the 60s with civil rights, and [it turns out that  sometimes it takes the national guard to do what's right.](

First off, you should cool it on the personal accusations. Not only is it bad debating practice, but also, I'm not the guy you think I am.
Anyway, I already explained my stance as to why regulation is important. What's important here isn't how the system works, but rather how the system fails. There may not be any difference between a certified and an uncertified doctor if everything works as it should, but what happens when things go wrong? There's a chain of responsibility which ensures that when something goes wrong, and there has been negligence or wrongdoing, someone will be held responsible. That is the core difference: someone is on the line so they damn well better do their job to a standard.
And if there is no certification system and anyone can call themselves a doctor, how can you know who is reasonable and responsible and who isn't? Word of mouth? What's to stop a doctor discraced in one town from skipping towns, dyeing their hair, and changing their name? And then what happens for long-term effects of malpractice, where it is hard to tell what contributed to a issue without a system to track this? Are you just supposed to sue everyone and hope eventually someone pays out?
So in a nutshell, It's not how a system works, it's how a system fails. Does it raise the barriers to entry? Yes it does, but I as a consumer don't want the barrier any lower than "is accountable if they prescribe rat poison". Likewise, I don't want to fly in a plane that will fall out of the air, a car that will ignite Ford Pinto style, [a bridge that hasn't been certified]( Remember that certification and regulation have a preventative effect by holding people to a standard, too.

So? they can still double-spend any of their friends transactions, cancel others' transactions (e.g. to make it look like innocent people are double-spenders), and prevent other miners from receiving block rewards, getting all of the blocks themselves.
A lot of people are misinformed, but all of these are serious fucking problems. The wiki goes on to speculate that being honest and not doing these things would be more profitable, but all of these things seem like a pretty good racket to me.

IRS agents aren't stupid. If you're on the receiving end of an audit, they've got a lot of data in front of them to look through, and these are sharp people who can spot discrepancies in any mound of paperwork.

I can't help you necessarily with that as I am not a US citizen and am only a little familiar with the taxes there. 
The TL;DR of this article with respect to your situation is that if you deliberately file useless bullshit (like the OP says you should do) or send the IRS your tax-evasion manifesto instead of your tax return, you will be fined. If you intend to file your taxes like a normal person, this article does not apply to you at all.

Funny you mention that. You know one of the largest causes of the 2008 financial crisis that claimed those companies occurred was *loosened* regulation? Now, I'm of the opinion that the US government should never have loosened these, and this is certainly a failing on the government's part as a regulatory body  (indeed, up here in Canada the banks were all fine because they were never deregulated in the same way). But make no mistake: this was the fault of insufficient regulation, not too much.


I don't know. The FDIC insures all savings accounts up to $25k (most other governments provide similar insurance). The government could have just let the banks fall and then everyone who had money in the banks could have been punished for the banks' hubris, but they didn't. 


Exactly why nobody left any money in Vicure -  OH WAIT. You see, having imperfect information isn't a crime that deserves to be punished. Consumers should have rights insofar as the obligations companies have to them should be honored. If a food company sells food, the consumer should have a reasonable expectation that it has been prepared and handled in a safe way just as a consumer should be able to trust that a financial institution (bank, forex, etc.) can't just up and leave with their money. It isn't Joe Smith's fault that his bank was doing shady things with their new abilities post deregulation any more than it's his fault if he unknowingly buys a package of contaminated hot dogs from the supermarket. The difference is that the gov't can crack down on the hot dog manufacturer for its violations, but can't do so in (quite) the same way with the bank. If the food company takes a hefty fine for its negligence, thousands of citizens won't be out their life savings.
Don't get me wrong, I believe that the government should have brought the bank execs to task instead of letting them off the hook with golden parachutes, but I hardly see how conditions would have been better for consumers with no intervention or regulation.
