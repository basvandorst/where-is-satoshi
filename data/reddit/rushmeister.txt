The above causes are all great! Really a good initiative. Can you also consider to give something to the Ross Ulbricht fund? Freeross.org. 
I think any donation to this fund is important for future privacy of US citizins

I can confirm that alot of individuals between 20-30 in The Netherlands hodl crypto and it is increasing in popularity every day. I don't have exact numbers on how much everyone hodles ofcourse but it is more than 100 thousand euros ��

This made me chuckle 
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:21:11
Fraud fraud fraud illicit use bla. Same old, same old. Trump needs to get educated by objective people about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:03:58
Great cause!
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:02:30
Reading this led me to think about tether and bitfinex. Can't help it and don't mean to fud
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:36:38
Only think Roger ver is achieving is making a big split in the crypto community
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:51:12
This is just great! Thumbs up for bitstamp
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:06:17
It might be a risk but they could communicate in a transparent way with the community about how they plan to approach this and why it is difficult.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:15:43
Andreas burned roger so hard with his comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:49:44
I sended Coinbase a support ticket! 
@_date: 2018-09-28 11:03:00
Can somebody  explain why nobody uses the  bcoin  implementation? I use Bitcoin core to run a node but I am interested in why  other implementations are used significantly less 
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:28:29
Didnt know! Whatever the case, they are slow. Just like Exodus and plenty over other wallets
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:11:55
The atleas said they would implement it in 2018. Will probably boost segwit adoption to 45% ish?
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:51:39
A bitcoin ETF might be the catalyst, IF it is announced this year..
@_date: 2018-05-03 10:27:00
Atleast every 1 or 2 months
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:58:52
Dude bitcoin core is the client i am referring to.....it is the biggest client that is used...
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:56:21
I am in Denial. Everyone probably is :)
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:23:44
The chart is not even up to date..
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:14:04
 Bitcoin Core v0.16.1rc1 has been tagged last week! Update soon!
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:17:55
Well without electricty society will collapse anyway not really a bitcoin specific problem ��
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:26:44
I agree on that
@_date: 2019-08-22 06:26:47
Bought it for Friends! Great work
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:45:53
The cz one or the whalebot
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:54:38
Who sold that sat!
@_date: 2019-02-20 09:27:52
Shit that is cool
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:15:43
Somebody moved alot of coins....
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:03:45
Haha Roger Ver is nuts. He is the one trying to manipulate everyone to think that Bcash is bitcoin. He even runs the website bitcoin.com that claims that Bcash is the real bitcoin. 
Love it to see him flipping so bad. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:36:45
This is highly confusing to me. didn't know
@_date: 2019-02-04 14:32:07
Or just mine it for almost nothing
@_date: 2019-01-05 18:33:57
Exactly. This is the point of softforks. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 06:40:18
Decentralisation is not binary. Its a spectrum and not simply yes or no.
@_date: 2019-01-23 21:21:49
Lol there payment app 'tikkie' just had a privacy breach. Why would we trust  any service a bank offers. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:54:49
Warren is extremely biased. Did I just hear Warren say: "most ICOs/cryptos are ponzi's ?" 
There is ofcourse a lot of bullshit ICOs that will never succeed but illustrating everything as a ponzi is just to easy and short sightened 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:09:45
So far so good indeed. However, I fear that some of these fossils in this committee that are asking the questions cant comprehend what cryptocurrencies are. What this technology can do. We will see what will come of this. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:59:33
Dont worry about Bcash. Tech wins from a forked coin that gets hyped. I bashed bcash at first. However, I know think that we should not participate in any fudding against it. Waste of energy that could be used better, like using it for constructive discussion on this subreddit.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:41:43
Kind of missing the point here. This line of reasoning does not fit in with what bitcoin is. Kind of the whole point is that a central power can't force anything upon you.  You say that someone should decide for everyone whether they want to use segwit. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:57:41
Or announced;)
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:43:33
They use segwit. I just asked in their telegram.
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:02:02
Ah thanks that clears it up for me
@_date: 2018-07-21 10:00:56
It legitimises bitcoin for the average joe,  which could bring the influx of new investors and institutions
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:42:59
They use segwit
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:21:01
Everybody can do his or her part
@_date: 2018-07-17 09:59:15
They already had  P2SH segwit if i am not mistaken!
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:10:02
Cant say anything about these data points
