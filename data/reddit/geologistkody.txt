I know this is a long shot and also straight up asking for donations, which I feel awkward and bad about right out of the gate. I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in December of 2016 and have been receiving chemotherapy ever since. As you can see from the before-and-after pics, it's not going exactly well. You can't read it very well, but the card I'm holding in the 2018 picture gives my reddit username GeologistKody to prove my identity. Details: my case is terminal, with tumors in the liver, lungs, stomach, esophagus, and hip.
Being only 32, my retirement savings are so meager and my wife makes only $12,000 per year. I'm about to start receiving government disability retirement and Social Security payments, which are not going to be much at all, especially with our medical bills. I feel like I'm leaving her high and dry after I pass away and it just kills me (morbid humor) to think about it. With this cryptocurrency boom happening right before our eyes, I'm hoping this might be a last ditch opportunity to raise funds that might attempt to give my wife at least a *little* bit of financial security. Might any generous traders out there be in a charitable mood today to help us out?

First, thanks for caring enough to even click on my post to check it out. What do you suggest?

Thanks. I've heard good things about that and cancer. I'm on a very healthy diet now and consuming very little meat. The issue is that most of my liver is cancer, which is preventing me from getting any nutrition out of anything and I'm wasting away.
