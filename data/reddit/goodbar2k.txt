So it's being used for 8-10% of transactions, but hasn't achieved mainstream adoption?  What is holding it back?  
My (naive) impression is that we're all driving on the highway, in traffic, and looking over at the high-speed lane without realizing that lane is available to all of us...
Why aren't more people using the high-speed lane?

I think you skipped over the "like-kind" aspect I mentioned.
this [link]( warns IRS may not deem crypto to crypto "like-kind" (but it's nevertheless an open question)

Look at Javascript frameworks.  Angular2 and many others have free or near free labs and tutorials online.

If you lack confidence in your coding abilities, you can start out as a tester (which will put you in the environment, while you work on getting better at code.)
We move savvy testers into developer roles quite frequently.  Testing may be less sexy, but it gets your foot in the door.

Pretty sure bc crypto is property, you only pay Capital gains when you back to fiat.  Not crypto to crypto (like to like, I think they call it.)

I hear you, but I do feel he addressed/admitted that it is costly (which is refreshing in this day and age, where the MO seems to be lie/deny).  See his comments about "we probably cannot afford two".  But I think it's fair for him to observe that the current opposition (the Wired article for example) oversimplifies the objection to the power usage without really digging into details.  That hydro-dam electricity *was* going to waste in China.  As demand goes up, the price for electricity goes up, and it may cease to be viable to run your mining operation.
My question is: What if it becomes less profitable to mine new bitcoins...will miners still mine for transaction fees AND can we all agree to scale back the difficulty for mining transaction fees once the coins have all been mined?  Or does difficulty (and therefore energy costs) HAVE to keep going up indefinitely?
*Edit: clarification on final sentence

If support is pulled for Segwit2x, what is our best alternative to improving tx speed?  (Genuine question, trying to get smrt-er.)

what about bittrex?

it means you won't trade bitcoin for fiat, because you'll just use bitcoin for everything and fiat will be a dinosaur that funky old people use

why do the different exchanges have different price points on crypto (e.g. bitfinex at 9550 while kraken at 9650)

"If you hoard currency you make everybody else richer. if other people are richer they will on average *make themselves poorer*"
Does that help?

That guy is an asshole, and you are totally right about life being expensive.  But the asshole's argument, distilled, is "at lower rates of available capital, don't bother with crypto...invest that capital in self-improvement so you can get a better job and, someday, afford to seriously invest in something, crypto or otherwise."

This is what you said, but it's a logical fallacy.  In order for them to be "richer" they have to hoard, not spend.  So where do you draw the imaginary line where all people say "Okay, that's it, we've hoarded enough, we're all now sufficiently rich to start consuming again."

I have a feeling...that tonight's gonna be a good night.
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:18:38
"become rich" is relative...you argued that hoarding was the key to getting rich...how does the hoarder know when to stop hoarding?  what defines "rich enough" if the behavior of hoarding was what got them there?
I'm not the only person to point out the logic flaw here, so not sure if you are just messing with me.

But that backroom dealing was how you got Segwit, right?  Otherwise we were ALL at an impasse...as dysfunctional as the US governing body for the past 8+ years with two sides refusing to give an inch.

can someone eli5 why promoting segwit2x is a bad thing?  or refer me to a (good) pro/con article i can read to become better educated on this issue?

There is an elegance to this article.  Acknowledges there were two camps and asserts that a compromise, any compromise, is better than on-going fractious debate.  
Whether or not the Seg2X agreement was "behind closed doors" it is clearly a compromise between the segwit and HF camps.  If miners renege on the 2X part of that compromise, they are acting in bad faith and setting a dangerous precedent for future negotiations between differently aligned camps.

In his example, there is still only $100,000 of "actual" currency in existence: the $90,000 removed for loans and the $10,000 left as $100 across 100 accounts.
Those people with $100 in their accounts *think* they have $1,000 in their accounts, but if they all walked in to withdraw it, the bank would fail (because they loaned out the $90,000 and don't have it to pay you back).  You, however, would get your money back thanks to Uncle Sam and the FDIC Insurance.
