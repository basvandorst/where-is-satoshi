An app for people who have never lent their friends money, and because of that still, still don't realize what a horrible idea it is.

The government requires financial businesses to be.  You think they want to have to run their own private detective firm on their customers?

It wouldn't make any sense if both people were using fiat.

It should in theory appreciate over time if people maintain interest in it because the supply will deflate over time.

Never have I seen this much FUD upvoted.  Bitcoin isn’t guaranteed to go up like some idiots think but it’s not a product that has “literally no value” either.

“No one uses bitcoin because transactions are too expensive because too many people are using it!”

Do you think it will go up or down?  Make a guess based on information available to you, put some money in or not, and then adjust your beliefs based on new information.
If the reasons for you thinking it will go up don’t change, hodl or buy more.  If you have reasons to think it won’t ultimatly go up, then sell.
The only think is DO NOT time the market.  Do not buy and sell trying to hit the sell at highs and buy back in at lows.  This method will work until the time it doesn’t and you will lose money.

You could say this about anything people put money in.  People who are early in Facebook or Apple stock may take profit when they’ve had large returns.  There is nothing bad about that.

You need a large amount of coins in an online wallet though.

The IRS can do what they are doing to Coinbase to any exchange that interfaces with American bank accounts.

Any time the person sold them it would have been a capital gain or loss they would have needed to report.

Donald has never bragged about evading taxes.  Everyone pays the lowest amount of taxes that they legally can including him.

If it was certain the price would already be at that level.

Who wouldn't?  It is idealism to think that someone is willing to go to jail to protect you.

I think people report losses from theft on their taxes usually?

They don't have to prove you didn't pay taxes, you have to prove you did and didn't do anything that was taxable.
@_date: 2016-11-19 01:59:52
Yes and what percentage of your taxes is that?
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:53:13
Exactly.  Fees would set themselves based on supply and demand.

With a horse race of 10 horses you can study their history and guess at which ones or more likely to succeed over others.
With 1000 horses in a race it’s just a roulette wheel.  Some will have success and others that look good will have their dev team go down in a plane crash.  It becomes a bigger gamble when there are so many options.

Generally by following the coins until they end up in a known cold wallet with thousands of coins.
If you send from Coinbase to what they presume is a deposit address and then a minute later it ends up in a known cold storage address with 100,000 coins you are associated with gambling and too big of a legal risk to Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:25:41
Not true. If 10 people buy bitcoin for $500 and the next sale is someone buying at $510, 10 people have made $10 and one person has broken even.
Something going up in market price can make everyone winners, there is not a loser required.

Its just weird that people are hopping in now to "lend their advice."  Its easy to tell people to sell when an asset is dropping because it is the safest thing you can do, especially if you are taking profit.
But where was your educational learning when the price was $30, or $100, or $1000?  This community and bitcoin has been around for YEARS.  People are acting as if the entire history of Bitcoin is 6 months.

That's a backward step way of saying they remove the illegal parts of a post.  If someone posts something illegal and you edit out the illegal parts are you removing the illegality or "removing evidence of it".  If someone is planning to bomb something and you destroy their bomb are you helping or just "removing evidence of the illegality of the underlying bombing."

If a company was signing up new customers at birth and demanding money from them a decade later people would be outraged.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:31:14
If you allowed workers on your plantation to leave for $3000 but otherwise demanded they hold up their end of a contract signed at birth what would be different about this?

Because people like to over complicate things.  People will use credit cards and centralized services at least to start.

That's cool too.  For those who can afford it having a personal 24/7 owned car will become a luxury.

He already launched another one called Mega, and then when he sold it to Chinese investors said "Oh don't trust it anymore!  But I'll make a new one that you can trust again!"
He hypes his projects and if they ever come out he just abandons it and moves onto the next one.
