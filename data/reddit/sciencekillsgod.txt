Now google ‚bear trap‘, could be anything, we will only be able to tell in hindsight

Did I mention anything about JP Morgan‘s general legitimacy? Please read my comment again and try to understand it

Talking about blockchain just be aware that 99% of crypto are not blockchains per definition. Check how they evolved, did they came into existence and everyone could participate and earn the reward by participating or ICO/premine. Compare Bitcoins history or Moneros for example (and a few others) with the rest and tell me which is the novel

„I think we have 2 very very interesting years ahead“ agree on that one, though I believe 38k as minimum new ATH would be rather disappointing/boring with only 2x and touching the 50k (or like 45k) would be more realistic

If you don’t engage in speculative value and try to find some objective measurement for the inherent value cost of production seems like a legit attempt imo. (Bear in mind the cost will double with the halvening)

So how about you write a paper or at least a sound argumentation about these points instead of a rant reddit about the evil evil banker (don’t get me wrong I’m not a fan of banker either and see the benefits of a transparent system such as bitcoin but still I prefer objective argumentation and discussions over „they are bad and evil we are good“)

Don’t click any links, inform
Yourself good enough to be able to assess a credible UI you feel comfortable to use

Neither do eloquent words make up for bad logic

Feel free to propose better ways of objectifying the inherent value despite using cost of production as e.g. network usage. But your sheep comments bashing JP Morgan won’t get anyone anywhere
