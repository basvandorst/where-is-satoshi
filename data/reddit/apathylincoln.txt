The issue isn't the transfer, it was because he was not authorized to transfer those coins. This is stealing and has been frowned upon as long as man has had possessions.

You are completely correct. Sometimes people forget that jail is a punishment, and once served the convict is expected to resume being a functional member of society.

I got into this back in June 2013 and a wise man told me of the issues with Gox back then. Seemed pretty sketch to me so I never went there other than to laugh at the arbitrage. So glad I followed that advise, and if I could remember who it was that gave it id tip them a ton of coin.

Not sure why this was down voted but this is a fairly good POV. If a competitor says to you "this has increased our revenues, please don't implement it, that will cut into our newly increased revenue streams" guess what will happen?

I am sure if the media mentioned anything linking bitcoin to homophobia there would be a crowdfunded donation to some LGBT rights group within a week. In fact I'd bet BTC on it.
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:37:06
Can you pair that with relevant info like days the coin has been around? Surely that is the reason for bitcoin's share.

They had an IPO back in October (?) To raise funds for fiat implementation on cryptostocks. Haven't heard anything from them since, but I assume they are working on it with the regulators.

If Gox comes back and the user base does not get their missing coins back I am curious how many users the new owners think they will have.

It would be logically distributed but not physically. You kill the network connection and you kill the VPN connection at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:10:35


This is an objectively false statement, and you should be ashamed to say things like this. Blocks were not regularly full until long after the *second* halvening. For the newbies, thats 8 years. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 18:34:24
Or modifying the block target time to less than 10 minutes would do the same, but simpler.

Define positive.
For someone who has a bit of Bitcoin but a large amount of fiat, a positive change would be a value drop.
For a bagholder, the opposite.

1/1000 bits would be a millibit (if you could split a bit)
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:50:15
Oh for sure. If you are logically distributed and the blocking is also logical it will be ineffective. But physically blocking a VPN ddos would be very simple.
@_date: 2015-10-10 01:39:00


@_date: 2015-03-18 19:01:44


I intentionally did not comment on that, because it is difficult to impossible to track that. But if the source of the logically distributed DoS is known, it would be easier to thwart compared to a physically distributed one. You appeared to be speaking in theories, and I was as well.
