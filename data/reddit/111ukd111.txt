This article rips off the source article without giving them credit.

Here's a reddit post that links to the original article:

Just in case you're looking for a worthy cause:

Why is that?

+1 for Lauzon. 
We did an /mma poll of popularity and he was at the top. Also, he's active on reddit, and into tech stuff.

No, Guelph. 1 ATM per 50k people. We're getting saturated up in hurr.

Inflation is pretty tough to understand. ;/

Notice the huge dip when the USD was taken off the gold standard.

Ghana Medical Help is a registered Canadian charity that accepts bitcoin and dogecoin:

It can't continue forever without the dollar becoming worthless.

Like yeah, inflation is great. The fed was mandated to minimize inflation or deflation. Keeping money in coffee cans is called "saving", which is necessary for investment. Inflation causes overspending/consumption and lack of saving. Just look at the savings rate of the US now. This is basic economics. Downvote if you like, it'll still be true.

Tough crowd. What the graph illustrates is how dramatically inflation eats away at the value of fiat currency.

It was a great day for the small NGO I volunteer with. I set up bitpay on Wed/Thurs, and on Friday we received 7 donations. I did my best to publicize it: 450 facebook people "saw" it, and I'm featuring it in our holiday newsletter.

I think Bitcoin is a great fit for our NGO because we are a very bare-bones organization. Lower transaction costs will equate to more life-saving medical equipment where it is urgently needed.
We supply very basic, but urgently needed equipment to hospitals in northern Ghana:  
An electrical fire at Bongo District Hospital has burned down the operating room and the equipment in it. We have reports that the makeshift theatre is now utilizing entirely GMH-donated equipment: 
Cheers Reddit! :)

Amazing! I'm really pleasantly surprised. Go bitcoin! Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:25:08
6 donations received today. Thank you wonderful people! Even a very small amount will go a long way. Many of the items we ship are relatively inexpensive, but make a huge impact - like surgical instruments. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:20:04
7 now. Go reddit! Go bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:18:57
I agree. I think Bitcoin has great promise for developing countries too. I'm surprised at the amount of people in Ghana who have internet access. Our facebook page is bigger in Ghana than the US.
Oops, did I misread you? Were you saying it makes no sense to send money to Ghana Medical Help? We generally buy the medical equipment in North America and ship it to northern Ghana. We also have on-ground volunteers in Ghana, but we do most of the research and fundraising in Canada.

Thanks for the questions! We operate mainly from Guelph, Ontario, Canada, but we have volunteers across Canada and in Ghana.
For more information about our operations and impact, please check out our website/blog:  or on facebook:  
We have partnered with more established NGOs and charities, including MedWish, WorldScopes, University of Toronto International Health Program, Heart to Heart, and the Korle Bu Neuroscience Foundation. We've even had a little help from a Canadian astronaut you might have heard of. ;) 
If you have more questions, please ask away! :)

It was a great day for the small NGO I volunteer with. I set up bitpay on Wed/Thurs, and on Friday we received 7 donations. Now a bunch of new people are aware and on board the bitcoin spaceship! Not only that, there's a good chance the money donated will allow a sick person to exit their hospital visit. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:54:52
5 bitcoin donations now. Thank you all for making our adoption of bitcoin so worthwhile! :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:38:50
Second donation notification received. Thank you bitcoin and reddit! &lt;3
