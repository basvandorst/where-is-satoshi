I know that it is difficult to trust a person in this case, we do not live in the same country, and I am from venezuela, a country known in the world for not having laws, laws exist the problem is that people do not comply, this does not It means that there are no honest people.

I can adjust to the percentage and earnings that you want during the first year.
This project involves my father (Rafael Molina, 55 years old) and I (Andres Molina, 22 years old)
We are a family of right principles, and we are looking for a partner, a helping hand to start this business.
We can provide you with all the information you want, all the telephone numbers of contact, address of our home.
You can also visit Venezuela if you have the capital to do so.
We are really a humble, middle-class family, but money is not enough for us to live in peace.
