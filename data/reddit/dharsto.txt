I love bitcoin, but this shit scares me.

Wish my SO would do this.

Look at bitcoin gains for the last week, month, and year. This growth is not sustainable and a lot of people are going to lose money.

I know the feeling now, got Btc-ed

Wow that's a catchy song...

Congrats but wrong place to post this. No one should know how much you have in crypto but yourself and any significant other.

Congrats on realizing your gains. I keep saying I'll sell "next week" but it just keeps going up. Capital gains are gonna kill me in my country, oh well, least I'll still come out positive and when I sell I can finally stop checking the price every 5 seconds.

Cold storage all the way dude, after loosing a lot on the Btc-e scandal recently I'm never keeping btc online again, holding till I need the cash.

Thanks for the cheap coins

Bought around the $4-$10 price point in 2012-2013. I took money that I didn't need in the first place and said "fuck it, if I lose it all so be it" ended up throwing them all in cold storage and I don't plan on selling anytime soon.

The way I did it was to just take a lump sum and say "fuck it if I lose it all that's fine". Bought the coins and kept them in cold storage. Was hard not to sell back when it hit $1000+ the first time, and even now I'm considering selling.

No exchanges then though, just like the one guy who tried to sell 50,000 for $50.  I remember kicking myself when i bought at $4 and went to $10. Everyday I tell myself I should have bought more.

Closing in on $4000 CAD. Feels good man.

Seems to be a complicated issue, this is why I'm sitting in LTC and fiat until the dust settles.

Jeez these stories make me cringe and kind of scared. I've got a good amount of bitcoin in a cold storage wallet, if I ever lost the password I'd be screwed...
