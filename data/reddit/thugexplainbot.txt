No. Diversified into 10 heavily researched cryptos.

I live in MN. Where no other market lets me buy crypto due to licensing. Coinbase is my only option.

Hell I am a 22 year old truck driver that listened to a dozen hours of crypto, now I got a nice nest egg to fall on.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:46:28
As a truck driver I am home maybe 5 or 6 days a month. and I got a 1080 that plays only arma 3 and occasionally star citizen for no more than 12 hours during those 6 days  I feel like I should start charging it rent in form of btc.

Interesting, thanks!

How come we pay fees to the miners to send bitcoin when they are already paid by the blockchain introducing new  BTC into the market?
@_date: 2018-05-18 20:51:47
I just got back from vegas and my bank (Wells Fargo) wouldnt let me withdraw MY money that I had saved for months because they said I had bad spending habits, which was one overdraft I quickly resolved before a fee could be applied. I was on the phone for 3 hours climbing up the corporate ladder telling them its my money so give it to me I will buy a damn giraffe if I want. I ended getting put in touch with a corporate banker that had to call someone for me and they had to speak to a second person because the first denied my request without looking at my profile. I can't wait until we can gamble with crypto. Oh also they wont let me purchase crypto from my account.

I believe in both, but more towards gold. As much as a success Bitcoin is as a virtual currency, gold still is valuable to every human and holds value well while BTC is only valuable to educated people who have reliable internet connection. I am not dissing BTC but gold has survived itself through mankinds greatest and worst times. Maybe oneday BTC can say the same.

Last time I bought with bitcoin was November. I was charged the equivalent of $20 miner fees to move bitcoin to anotjer wallet and then for the purchase. Is the fees still high or did they lower them?
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:50:30
Isn't that what mining is; confirming the transaction as real?

Well shit. the ATM owner spent money to provide a service, they may as well be able to recoup their costs and make a profit.
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:34:26
REEEE you know nothing of me or what I do for fellow Americans. Fun fact; You are obviously the hateful  bigot to assume who I am before even meeting me. I am sorry you are triggered but maybe one day you will see the arrogant ignorance of your ways and maybe then we can have a beer together.
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:27:28
All jokes and insults aside, where did I say anything about me being religious or a snakehandler. If you going to insult me at least have it make sense.
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:04:52
Nope. Just a guy who is better protected you wrong and clearly triggered your wrong ideology since you seem to have resulted to insults since your brain doesnt have the tolerant capacity to accept diversity.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:05:51
Yes I do.I always go out the garage and approach the front door so I can see if anyone is hiding behind the wall. I read a story similar to yours.
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:34:09
Wow delusional and stupid. venom is almost harmless ingested. Poison in the other hand is deady ingested. Well I tried playing nice but: DONALD TRUMP IS YOUR PRESIDENT. Bye boo.

Nah. If you want wealth, you find it like I did, you dont work at mcdonalds.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:04:08
Im not saying I am a badass, I am saying I am better protected than you.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:24:24
No it is liberals that live by emotion. You want to let in illegal immigrants and protect radical muslims in fear you would be otherwise be labeled a racist. Generally conservatives live by logic. Lots of foriegners want to enter but we cant support them all? How about legal immigration system to filter the good from bad and keep out the bad for example. And the fact you resorted to insults goes to show you do in fact live by emotion and are indeed triggered. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:03:40
I know you are posting this to try to get under my skin because you know I am right. I am not paranoid I just enjoy safety. I live a full fulfilling life and the steps I take to insure it add almost no extra steps. I am sorry you dont like guns and you dont like conservatives but half the US are gun owning conservatives and that is a fact you will just have to swallow.

Let me tell you how I have my house set up. Every door has a steel center to prevent breaking. The deadbolt is premium high strength titanium alloy and every hinge has 4 3.5 inch screws to slow a breach. The second a door is hit harder than a double fisted slam it triggers the home alarm and I have an AR in my bedroom, glock in the kitchen, glock hidden by the front door and a shotgun in my basement. Im never more than 2 seconds from protection and it takes at least 10 with your best sledgehammer. Research guns because you obviously know nothing.

I surely didnt stumble upon gold, I was raised poor, I worked a job I dont like (truck driving) and I make good pay and soon I will start my own business.
@_date: 2019-10-20 04:00:28
And when power goes out, Gold will be more trusted than a trezor with bitcoin in it.

I'm just getting into crypto. I got
roughly ten bucks of BTC and 30 of ETH. What can I do to make money? Also do they have safeguards against hackers? I'm new and want to try to invest in them.

Thank you so much for that! Any advice on a cheaper one? I am unsure if the pricier ones are just rip offs or not.

I am new to Bitcoin, is Coinbase a wallet? I used it to buy my crypto. Also what is the cause of BTC to change price? Coinbase only let's me sell/buy at a fixed value, is there a way to make orders for different amounts? What are some tips to keep my bitcoin safe until I can buy a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:08:02
Thank you I will do exactly that!
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:08:11
Thank you for the help!
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:26:42
Yeah the second someone manages to open up any of my doors I will have a gun in my hands ready. Whenever I answer my door if I cant see anyone in my peephole or its a stranger I have my gun in hand behind the door when I open it. Guns save lives.
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:59:24
Thank you!

Bitcoin just isn't for hodling, it's also for trading. Getting burnt is your fault it's called RESPONSIBILITY.
@_date: 2018-07-26 01:13:57
I used binance but the fees to move crypto in and out of coinbase were ridiculous, $20 miner fee or something like that one way. I don't have enough money to buy enough crypto to offset those fees in a few trades.
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:58:38
Like I said, I can't.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:16:35
If it became a common currency prices would skyrocket as more people bought the limited supply.
@_date: 2018-07-14 03:02:06
I was watching the market and was about to buy in on a possible bull market and saw this and realized every time I think I'm experienced enough to trade I am not. And now I will go buy games with that cash.
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:01:16
I will definitely give pro.coinbase a try. GDAX isn't legal in MN and my other markets won't recognize my bank transfers. Thanks!
