Intel doesn't need to buy anything they don't already have; just stamp up some cutting-edge asics...  The fines banks pay for their crimes are in the Billions; $14mm is a rounding error.  
The problem with this approach is that it's too simple; maybe something that considers the long history &amp; the short history; or maybe something that ties block size to fees (which is a political decision).

Explode this, to über, and airbnb to **everything**, and you're getting there.  
Ps. Idea   We need a trust/prestige system that can be shared in über, airbnb, localbitcoins, etcetcetc; please someone build this and let us have confidence in each other, and trust in each other, in a way we have *never had before*.

**Great.  Now the 51% attack becomes much more dangerous**.  
If you have an adversary with 51% hashpower, it can: 
* grab the hash of the last block; 
* turn off the net &amp; mine in silence;
* create uncountable blocks with only coinbase transaction;
* wait until 2016+ ahead of the honest network
* turn back the net and propagate the blocks.
So, for 2016 blocks * 2 = 4032 blocks, there may be a little problem in seeing our confirmations.  
People will demand a hardfork immediately, setting up a checkpoint, price will collapse, all sorts of inconsistencies will start to emerge.  
**Never underestimate a 51% attack.** OP seems to have forgotten about it.

Without Paul Volcker, there would be no USD today.  That's all I'm saying.  
And interest rates over 20% today would break the Fed govmt and the banks.

**Expected value** is the single concept of probability I can't trust or understand.   
If I make a bet for 1 Trillion for playing Russian Roulette (6 bullet holes, 1 bullet), then I'm:   
* 1/6 of a Trillionaire **AND** 1/6 alive.   
**WHAT the fuck!?!?!?**  That concept, philosophically, makes no sense.  Philosophically, the "quantum" world actually makes way more sense:   
EITHER I'M   
* a live Trillionaire   
OR I'M   
* dead moron.   
Weirdly, the PhD statisticians, information theoreticians, and physicists I've talked about this agree with me.  Expected value is for the normal curve and well-behaved distributions; they say.  Never for high-stakes binary outcomes of a RV.

Stability?  Most of 2012 was pretty stable.  But it won't stabilize because of hyperinflation in one rich country.  Any country will do the trick: Japan, UK, US.  Japan is going first, at least that's where the money has been bet on.  Bitcoin will serve as one measure of the stick of a depreciating yen.

The yen is about to collapse in 24 months and the dollar will follow shortly thereafter.  
You better believe your propaganda real hard.  Real is about to change.

it would be beautiful if the "honest" blockchain could "destroy" (=ignore) **all** coins held by those that went Bernanke.  
That is, you have 10btc today.  Then tomorrow comes up some inflationary update and the keynesian shamans get all excited.  Their blockchain gets forked from the satoshi one.  THEN the Satoshi blockchain also updates, now killing all the balance the keynesian users have on the honest network. 
That is, you accept 0.000001 btc from the keynesian blockchain, and the satoshi blockchain sees that you made that choice and zeroes your balance, perhaps by sending your coins to 1lolololIAmAKeynesianMoronlol.

**hyperinflation** increases the degree of freedom of commiting crimes that can end-up with serious casualties.
See "When money dies", or "Diary of an autrian middle class women".
Also, financial repression like bank holidays and Argentina-style "corralitos", always "for the sake of the people" and always "because of the speculator/jew/choose your scapegoat".  
You are coming to the topic through a heavy bias towards nanny states, in my opinion. Maybe we don't need the state to decide if we can or can't drink wine or smoke this or that (you cite drugs as crimes).

If you consider Gresham's law, and that the fiat banknote habitat that bitcoin is in, you'll keep wishing for a long time.  Banknotes are in an enormous inflationary bias.  Bad money drives good money out.  
What is going on, imo, is a *landgrab*.  People are starting to realize that they need serious protection from inflation, and that bitcoin is but one avenue to do it.
(BTW, since when has *serious protection from inflation become equal to "speculation"?* I really don't understand it when people say gold is speculation, when all central banks are devaluing.  The Fed alone is printing $120,000,000.00 per hour!)

You'd have to:

2A)  Start attacking it; my password is truly hard, it is actually a collection of passwords I use for (fuck-it) sites, like reddit, + a large number, + the password I use for personal ID sites like twitter &amp; facebook, + same large number, + my email address password.
You won't break it....  But even if you do....
You get a folder with a set of wallet.dat files.  All of them are encrypted.  And here, the passwords are created through hashes.
I thought about posting 1000btc in the web, fully protected by i) QT-client wallet encryption, then ii) truecrypt hidden folder, than iii) steganography on a large image file.
Publish the image file, tell the peoples of the world the public address of that wallet, and let them try to get it.  But that's no good for bitcoin, is it? From the point of view of btc, nothing is improved, so I backed down.

MARKET-MAKING could be a killer app.
Google "Systeme D"
A local, maps-based craigslist competitor which brings markets to life and has an escrow system.  
Say someone wants to sell some vegetation; someone wants to buy it; it's all local, so you can find the sellers easily, you send the money to the escrow-market-making service (your co.), your co. gets a small fee, then buyer and seller meet and when they signal to your corp that they agree on the transaction, you send the btc to the seller.
Sellers and buyers could have ratings to create some trust, and you could run this from anywhere in the world and it could be completely anonymous.  
I think there could be money here.

Yes, it's impossible to "print this shit to oblivion".  Let's go full-paranoid here and imagine that this was a CIA project.  Even so, it's open-source, so all the rules are out in the open.  Any change has to be accepted by the participants; it's like Bernanke having to ask you if he should print two Bill Gates per month or not.  The cryptography involved uses tried and trusted methods that have stood the test of time.  
The mining rules adapt to accomodate more miners (each making less btc) or less miners (each making more), and they can't mine, say, 300 btc in 10 minutes.  The system is built so that they will create 25 new btc around every ten minutes (for the next 3.9 years, then the mining reward drops violently).

Sure.  But that's what I'm saying: they can confiscate the gold from the pedonaziterroristspeculators who are so unfair to the children.  Bitcoin is way easier to hide (truecrypt is your friend).  
Frankly, I just don't give a fuck what they do.  Regulate or prohibit bitcoin, it's going up either way, and as the monetary and banking systems start to pop like they're in a microwave, one day, even the cafeteria in the fucking FBI will be accepting bitcoin.  
Bernanke is printing $800,000 new usds per each new bitcoin.  And Japan is even more fucked-up.  Europe's banks are leveraged like there's no tomorrow.  The political space for more bank bailouts is gone and what's left is this hidden bailout through "economic stimulus" money-printing orgy.
The math just doesn't add up.  There's just way too much tail risk out there.

* we are creating 3,600 btc/day
* Let's say less then 10% of subs of are the buyers -- in the entire world, there are exactly 1600 buyers. Not even one more.
* How much money on average do the 1600 people have to part with to keep the price at $30?  $2059, on average.  One HNWI can buy $1M and push up the average.  (For a billionaire, that's nothing, it's just a blimp on their portfolio).
Of course, a big bitcoin holder may decide to cash out and change the flow dynamics.  Alternatively, one billionaire may decide to throw 5 million and change it the other way.  
In sum, I don't think t's a bubble.  Price will go up and go down, but when 10% of can sustain this price spending an average of $2059 fiatnotes, I think there's room ahead.

I say we contrast two banking systems: 
* the honesty of the blockchain and bitcoin; the lack of inflationary surprises
* the dishonesty of the int'l banking system (libor conspiracy, Goldman selling "crap" to their own clients, MF Global, etc); monetary system (surprise: we just printed 10 trillion!), and bank holidays + confiscations + cash restrictions and other types of financial repression.  
# 
The second thing I think we should constrast is:
* ONE TBTF blows up, and the int'l banking system is f*cked.  The fragility is enormous and time will take care of it.
* 1000 miners blow up, ZERO people lose btc.  There is anti-fragility, as more miners will show up to reap the profits.
I love the memes springing up, and I think they provide great attention to our cause, which I see as financial stability.

i) they do accounting to keep the system honest;  
ii) they *have* to really work hard to find a salt to the hash... or else you would have (n^2) computers screams to each other continuously ("This is what happened!  These are the *true* transactions!  This is what happened!")  
iii) So when someone solves a block, it gets everybody else's attention, but proving first that it was really working unbelievably hard.  Then the network can reach an agreement.
It has some complications, but this is the basic idea; you don't work hard, nobody will even listen to what you have to say.  You have to remember, this thing is entirely distributed, computers blowing up, coming in, coming out of the network--all the time, for a full four years now.

* 1 month = 30 days * 24 hours * 6 "Fed blocks" = 4320 
* $85,000,000,000.00 / 4320 = $19,675,925.92 (each "Fed block")

This is wonderful comedy; using long words is no substitute for thinking.  The author seems completely unaware of the fact that he is a simpleton.  


Wait a sec, what?  There's no risk of hyperinflation?  You think a billion is too much for bitcoin?  **One billion is 8 hours of QE.**  And let's not forget the currency wars and Japan and NGDP targeting.  The West has taken the high road to Argentina, with no intent of turning back.  This is merely the logic of the entitled. 
Make no mistake, btc can fail.  It can drop to $0.  And this rally will end with a correction.  This time is not different.  But this does not alter the fact that bitcoin has much to grow, to at least tens of billions, in the coming years.
That is, without adjusting for inflation.  Put some ten zeroes to adjust for inflation.


* It's not a "theorem".  A theorem is a mathematical statement followed by a logical proof.  
MR "Theorem" explains why gold "became money" in the first place.  But Mises had zero understanding of thermodynamics and entropy.  Gold is better than silver not because of scarcity, but because it ignores the elements, the 2nd law of thermodynamics.  
Bitcoin holds even more negentropy.  To completely wipe out bitcoin, you have to delete all copies of the blockchain everywhere, stored in all forms (DVDs, pendrives, piratebay, etc).  Let's say there's a 99% chance that each copy will be destroyed until Dec 2013.  If there are 10,000 copies out there, this means the probability of the blockchain being destroyed is 0.00...[44 zeroes until a number shows up].  It's not going to happen.  
TLDR?  Author is a pompous moron who writes long words in order to appear sophisticated and keep Austrians holding Au.

Bill Gross (1 + TRILLION under management), Jim Rogers, Kyle Bass, Michael Burry, Peter Schiff, Mark Faber (just to stay in those more familiar to Americans), and an enormous list of big money managers are saying gtfo of bonds, and get gold.  Bitcoin is a very natural competitor to gold.
People that will eventually come:
i) gold bugs -- already talking about it.  
ii) FX traders; first with their own bonuses, then trying to create a "vehicle" or "instrument" to get btc by the firm;  
iii) specialized hedge funds.  
iv) Japanese savers being wiped out by uncontrolled inflation (see Kyle Bass' arguments)  
v) German savers escaping the euro.

One proposal would be:
1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 coiny  
1 coiny = 100 satoshis (or 1 satoshi = 0.01 coiny)
The scientific notation won't last in the long run; it's easier for the dumbs out there to make 1000-fold mistakes, and the history of technology is full of examples:
unsolicited email  --&gt;  junk email --&gt; spam
I say we start looking for a nice nickname for a really lowball figure; 100satoshis might be the best point; as it makes 1bitcoin as valuable as 1million of these units.

**Bitcoin is a landgrab.**  
Remember those empires expanding and extracting wealth from their colonies?  They got onto an island, took everything, brought back home, and that was a major wealth explosion in Europe.
We just stumbled into this commodity.  It's different from every other commodity out there.  It is rarer than diamonds.  We know the exact number of bitcoins to be created.  
It's mind boggling to realize how scarce bitcoin is:
* If you have 1050 bitcoin, there can only be 20,000 people in the entire globe with your amount.  Can you think of ONE city with 20k residents without consulting anything?  Just one city?
* 1 bitcoin is as scarce as 238 ounces of gold (when 21m are created; today 1 bitcoin is as scarce as ~450 ounces of gold)
* the number of btc created in 2013 is smaller than the number of people in San Diego.
* Divide 21,000,000 by the number of bitcoins you have and look for a city  in which each person can have that same exact number on wikipedia.  Go to google earth and look at that city for 3 minutes; now zoom out and see the entire globe!  
It's mind gobbling how scarce bitcoin is.  Today, at these prices, bitcoin is a landgrab.  **We are buying diamonds for $28.**  
A landgrab is different from a bubble.  Yes, there will be many bubbles along the ride, at least three more, but we'll get there.

Couldn't agree more; one problem we have is that so few people are old enough to remember Nixon's gold default, and the ensuing inflation; and that something dramatic is going on.  They'll think something dramatic happened after the fact, but it is loud and clear for anyone ready to open their eyes.  
By the way, I don't think there's any way we're in a bubble.  Take a look at the oil price after the oil shock of the 70's.  What we just had was a supply shock due to the reward halving.  
Talk about price discovery.  Note that the halving is *forever*, while the oil embargo was temporary...
Also, in a bubble, you don't see people concerned.  There is massive euphoria and bears are laughed out of the room.  I'm in until the next reward drop in 2017, when I will slowly unload 10% of my holdings each year--preferably spending in the btc economy.

I think this manipulator provides a great service. 
* anyone that doesn't really believe in bitcoin gets nervous and sells just like he wants to, so in the long run these weak hands will be gone.
At any rate, unless he's really willing to risk some thousands of btc, the market will bounce back in no time.  The scarcity of the reward drop has finally wiped out the remaining stock from the 50btc/10min days, and for the time being lots more people want to get in. 
To those that think bitcoin is  bubble, bitcoin is a *landgrab*.  Please study the history of landgrabs (like expanding empires extracting wealth from their colonies).  We've stumbled into this commodity, which is new and different from anything else in the market, and the smart people are going for the landgrab.

Slv is being shorted.  Btc can't be for now at least.  When silver moves up, yes, IT WILL EXPLODE.

Awesome idea; I would chip in with 10BTC.  We get a youtube vid and it could go viral.  If this becomes a meme bitcoin will accelerate.
Edit: we could also try to find the videos of the actual newscasts about bank runs, devaluations, capital controls, cash-use limitations, hyperinflation, etc.  Here's one (rather boring but illustrative) about venezuela and japan's recent devaluations.  It would be awesome if we could find real imagery of bank runs, protests, etc, the whole fiat fiasco.

Two observations: 
* People believe in the propaganda they hear.  People make most decisions based on the recent past, not on the dynamics playing out in the world around them.  (in short, people don't like to think independently of a group and the psychological need for having a "sense of belonging" makes it very hard to think for yourself.)
* Ask yourself:  why are people *momentum investors*? In the sense that they invest in something because that something has been growing recently?  It's because people under-react to information.  They simply ignore most information about changes in the world and proceed as if some things will never ever change.  It takes vision, courage to take risks, and the ability to imagine a different world to overcome this "herd mentality".  
As a final note:  Do you know when Churchill gave his first formal warning of the potential for upcoming WWII?  **SEVEN** full years before 1939.  Think about that for a minute.  For years, Germany was getting ready for war, and Churchill was screaming his lungs out, and he was laughed out of the room.  
Then they "got it".  Then they gave him the British Navy.  Then they made him prime minister.  Then he won.

@_date: 2013-02-09 02:32:37
could have a correction, sure, **but**:
* This year's production of btc will be less than the number of people living in San Diego.  Think about this for a minute.
* The btc community is growing exponentially, in here for instance it's doubling around 300-330 days.
* Just for perspective, suppose some crazy things:  i) Suppose no hoarder sells; and suppose all miners sell, and suppose 10% of r/bitcoin subs are buyers (90% are miners or just interested).  **If 10% of the people here are buyers, they have to spend an average of $1,683 per month to keep the price.**  Yes yes, full of unrealistic assumptions, but good for perspective. 
* Less than 1400 people can buy 1000BTC created this year.

Sure.  But once the present is gone and things start to unravel attitudes change, and lawlessness grows.  
I've lived under hyperinflation a long time ago in an unnamed 3rd world country; and I saw people from the Central Bank buying real estate with suitcases full of dollars.  Same thing will happen here; we will be trading with anything that still has trust.  
If bitcoin tanks to 0.01 tomorrow, I'm buying more and mining more.  To me, it's about hedging a banking-monetary system that's too fragile.  
Bitcoin is the opposite of the int'l banking system: 
* 1000 nodes blow up; nobody loses a single bitcoin.
* A single TBTF blows up, and the ripple effects could take down the entire system.  Spain has zero money and both their banks are a joke.  It could come from there, it could come from Japan, it could come from the libor conspiracy or from a COMEX default of paper gold.  There's just too much risk, interconnectedness, interdependence, and need for trust &amp; coordination.  It will blow up.  And when that happens, who is going to send food to Saudi Arabia or Japan on a Letter of credit from the new Leehman brothers.  
I want exposure to an honest, trust-no-one, int'l banking system.  Bitcoin price goes up, I cheer like everyone else; it goes down, I get some more.

I think the key issue here is "the incentive to spam the block chain" if there's no boundary.  SatoshiDICE could use the blockchain to get the random numbers, but only spam it when someone cashes out.  If you really like playing there, you'd send it to your sDice address, and cash out when needed.  That's orders of magnitude lower if sDice falls to pareto's law (~20% of the people having ~80% of the transactions).  TWO blockchain transactions could be used (as long as people trust sDice, of course).
Knowing full well that a hard fork is tricky, what I don't understand is why we can't have semi-thin clients that:
i) do not download the entire chain since 2009, and instead
ii) at every 52,500 blocks (~ 1 year), create the tree of non-zero balances, and download the blocks from there.  
So now we'd have to download a quick tree of non-zero balances from the Genesis block to 157,500 (around late 2011), then download from 2012 on.  
[Ps. I know that doesn't solve anything for *today* because of the sDice load is still there, but we're at block 223,134 and when we reach block 262,500, new users won't have to download 2012 at all.]  
What happens if 10 services take the liberty of using the blockchain directly?  So I congratulate Garzik for arguing for what is, from my perspective, the most fundamental role of gov't:  avoiding the tragedy of the commons.

* in December, people re-evaluate their lives and their portfolio; Some people with large savings certainly thought about bitcoin;
* We create 3600 bitcoin per day; if 10% of the users in r/bitcoin are buying, they only have to buy an average of $1500 per month to sustain price (assuming no billionaire gets in the game &amp; no large bitcoin holder liquidates rapidly--unrealistic, of course, but just for perspective);
* BoJ, ECB, BoE, &amp; Fed are printing their banknotes with no limit on sight.  The Fed alone is creating $800,000 new usds per each new bitcoin created;

Antifragility:  any move a gov't makes against bitcoin backfires in numerous ways.  
A 51% attack will be front page news in techmeme, slashdot, and will make everyone "sitting on the fence" (the vast majority of tech people) in favor of btc.  
A downright prohibition in one country risks severe humiliation should another country accept it; say; Russian central bank starts printing and buying bitcoin just to piss off the US.  If you think the US is high-almighty full of powers, google Vietnam or Falluja or Korea.  
And they're fighting an idea; if bitcoin goes down, litecoin is here, and we'll learn from the vulnerabilities and come back stronger.

You can have hyperinflation even without money printing.  Money velocity can grow rapidly, bringing a pull for higher money velocity.  A good example was Brazil's hyperinflations, where, by the third of fourth currency, they weren't really printing Bernanke style, but trust in the new currency was zero--Brazilians only wanted the usd.  
I do agree that the usd has way more slack then other currencies.  Japan is probably going first, UK next (Argentina, Iran, and Venezuela are already there but let's not count those).  But the usd isn't immune to a sudden shift in mood. And one item become scarce (phosphorus, silver, oil) could stop multiple supply chains and eventually bring up hyperinflation.

not over, just a parallel economy.

The interesting thing from my perspective is that:
* in 5 years, bitcoin will be widely known;
* in 2017, there will only be ฿658,800 created.  Think about this: only 658 people can buy 1000 bitcoins created in 2017.  Or, to put it in another way, the people in El Paso TX can't each one buy 1btc created in 2017.
So, by December 2017: If btc becomes legal and regulated? Over $1000.  
If it becomes illegal and goes to black markets?  Over $1000 too.  
And that's discounting high-inflation or hyperinflation.  Assuming today's usd purchasing power.

Maybe he wants to bet against you too, bro.  Hang on, let's wait.
PS. I got Benny Bernanke at my side, printing USD$800,000 per each new bitcoin.  Interest rates? ZERO.  Easy call from where I stand.  Let's see if he can stand up to his words.
