Without globalization we'd be paying 10 bucks a pair for 'cheap' socks built in our local high wage sock factory.  
With globalization market forces see alternative suppliers manufacturing socks where the input costs are cheapest.  People that would formerly have no job at all now have a job (crappy pay by western standards, but better than nothing).  And those of us buying socks only need pay $1 a pair.

That article shows one of the main beefs people have with the TPP and globalization in general.  
It benefits people in poor and developing counties, and has a substantial negative impact on certain industries in rich countries.
I understand the sentiment for those impacted, but it's hard to not value the capability of globalization to lift out of poverty millions of those who didn't have the luck to be born in a rich country.

It's not really FUD. Any legit lender will want to know the source of a deposit on a large loan.
Simply waiting a while after converting from Bitcoin (as stated in the article) will take care of the issue.  
I'd actually cash out to one account, open a second account at another bank, and then move the fiat there and wait for a few statements to cut.  
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:34:55
The TPP also has a lot of good things for the freedom minded person, breaking down/reducing artificial barriers between nation states.
It's not all good, but it's not all bad either.
I'm surprised there aren't more pro-globalization advocates in a bitcoin forum.

Most of us have rent or mortgage payments, property taxes, home owners insurance, etc...  to pay.

Someone help me out here, perhaps I'm misunderstanding things.
A lot of these proposed usages of the Bitcoin Blockchain (like what NASDAQ talks about) appear to be completely independent of any currency value that Bitcoin itself offers.
For example. Say the Blockchain ended up in use for all stock and other similar transaction world wide - a potentially very large market.  This would be a huge success for Bitcoin, but it wouldn't necessarily result in high prices would it?  
Aren't they just using the blockchain to store data, rather than store 'money' value?

Reddit leans young, and bitcoin fans lean (sometimes) libertarian.
Thus there are a lot of young libertarians here.
The young segment doesn't have a lot of experience dealing with the financial system (they don't realize a lot of the stuff Coinbase does is a sign of a solid financial institution company) so think all their KYC activities are unreasonable.
The libertarian segment has a lot of end the fed type folks - and they just hate anything that looks like a bank as a matter of principle:)

Wouldn't spending BTC with the Shift card be considered a taxable event by the IRS?
Seems to me that using this for day to day purchases would be a nightmare of calculating capital gains, etc...
Has ths IRS given any indication to Coinbase that their customers won't need to worry about that?
@_date: 2015-06-27 12:18:11
I'm still not seeing how this will help bitcoin gain value. 
Since bitcoin is basically infinitely divisible it's not like demand for the availability of bitcoin for this type of thing would push prices up.
Surely the worlds stock exchanges have the means to build a network of nodes for use as the bitcoin infrastructure themselves, even if every other BTC user/application went away?
It almost feels like bitcoin itself will be like the old paper stock certificates.  They have value because they represent X shares of IBM, and (ignoring any collectible value) not because of the paper they are printed on.

Nice idea, but the process takes too long for Greeks in a hurry.
I've spent the last week working with coinbase and so far they have allowed me to buy less than half a BTC.
I understand (and agree) with their precautions but they really aren't much use in a panic situation like this unless a buyer already has a history with them.
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:40:10
The fees coinbase charge are pretty negligible.  You'd have to buy a good chunk of BTC to run up the equivalent of the signup bonus.

I'd picked up the impression along the way that the whole proof-of-work feature was what would make blockchain valuable to a bank.
Instead of waiting days to fully process an ACH (in case the money being transferred isn't there) somehow validate the transaction thru a blockchain so you can release the funds within an hour instead of 3 days later.
@_date: 2015-12-12 14:36:34

Sorry you guys are having to put up with this guff from certain members of the bitcoin community.

Just take note of this...

So by using this CSV doodad - is this now a great way new way for Sophisticated bitcoin users to pay BTC to less-sophisticated bitcoin users, receive a product and/or service, and then reclaim the BTC?
I count myself in the second group, so if this does what it sounds like I'd not be willing to take BTC from anyone other than a major exchange.  Else I'd be living in constant fear that the person who sent them to me had stuck a sneaky clawback option in the transaction.
Please tell me why this is not a legitimate concern?

@_date: 2016-06-22 13:09:57
Please excuse my digging deep question, I appreciate your response and am trying to understand further.
So for a normal transaction the recipient generates an address for the BTC to be sent too.
For one of these contract type potentially revokable off-chain transactions, the recipient would follow some (completely different, would have to be done deliberately, impossible to do by accident?) process that would generate an address for the BTC to be sent too.
Is that all accurate?
Can (or will?) the sender be able to tell the difference between the two types of addresses?

I agree about the warnings you issued, but I'm not a fan of being reliant on a passphrase in your head.  It's too easy to lose it that way - whether by a memory failure or some sort of injury.

You have a major percentage of your net worth in Bitcoin already.
If it goes 'to the moon' even a few bitcoin will be enough long term.
Keep your cash for emergencies, car repairs (or even pay a resume writing service to help with the job hunt).
If you really want to spend some more on BTC go guy a hardware wallet and store what you already have somewhere safe.
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:40:54
One of the main reasons (apart from the fact I'd probably lose it all) that I don't trade.
I don't begrudge the government their 15% (or possibly 20%, for a really HUGE cashout in one year).  All the nice stuff in the US that isn't present in place like say ... Somalia? ...has to get paid for somehow.

President Xi is not a fan of corruption in party officials.  It's a risky move for them to be speculating  for potential profit, there is always the chance he'll make an example of them (corrupt officials sometimes get executed under his rule) if he wants to send an anti-BTC message!

How does getting a mortgage through a bank lead you to getting 'f*cked'?  
People making bad financial decisions can't be blamed on the banks - if someone taking out a loan is an adult they need to be smart about paying attention to the terms and conditions.
If they are not intelligent enough to do that, I don't think bitcoins are going to magically help them start using their brains.
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:17:27
Hey I like Trezor as much as the next guy, but I'd have to take exception to the last part of your statement.
In the US at least you'll never have to pay any banking fees unless you are a very 'funds restricted' (i.e. you can't maintain a small minimal balance), and there is generally no need to visit banks in the 21st century unless you want to do some cash transactions.

It's good to know they are doing thorough checks on the history of the people who will be involved in handling bitcoins - greatly increases the chance of weeding out cut and runners disappearing with large quantaties of deposits.
Those exchanges collapsing types of events are terrible, they have to stop if bitcoin is ever to gain widespread public acceptance.

If the cost is the chief objection, there could be a possibility for the city government (the Mayor?) in future to intervene.
You demonstrate to us that your Startup does this (you aren't a criminal, you have some funding, you'll hire a couple of people locally) and we will pay your bitlicense application costs.
This would help protect NYC's role as a financial capital, without getting the regulators involved in subsidising new firms.  
It really shouldn't be the concern of the regulators themselves whether a firm can afford to pay to play.

I second starting the account setup now.
It's a slow process to buy any sizable amount of bitcoin until the exchanges trust you.  Coinbase takes at least a month to allow largish purchases.
Get yourself verified with Coinbase/Circle/Kraken ad buy 10 bucks in each (maybe not Kraken if you are in the US) to get that process started.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:42:23
Oh it's not going to happen across state lines.  
If it were to pan out in this case, it would have to be some New York layer of government paying the fees incurred New York in order to keep a bitcoin outfit local (i.e. they would want to see the jobs/startup activity in their jurisdiction, not just BTC transactions).
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:29:34
The problem I'd have - and it is a pretty big one - is that bitcoin transactions can't be disputed.

Yeah, I read that title and I'm thinking the tweeter is claiming the purchase of a set basket of goods and services now costs 9% more bitcoin than it did a year ago.
Actually looking at BTCs price 12 months ago, it was in the $580 USD range.  So I guess you could argue inflation has been 100% in the past year.

That is the problem right there.  Every second article about bitcoin is about scammers in various pieces of the buy/sell/store infrastructure - makes it very difficult to trust whomever comes along with a new service.

Are you asking if the price of the magazine will go up, or the price of BTC go down?

What an idiot, his address has likely been noted by several nasty people.
They are simply waiting for the day BTC goes to $10000USD to visit this upon him....

Exactly, if the rich guy lost 50% of his 5 million that would be foolish.
Losing 50% of your 250 is no big deal, it's easily recouped thru working.

I will step up and make a promise here.
If long term holders create an environment where one 1 satoshi is the entire 'active' BTC float, I will sell one of my hoarded satoshis for whatever valuation that existing sub-divided satoshi is selling at/
I suspect I am not alone in making this bold offer:)

If you have a net worth of 5 million, then investing 25,000 in BTC has a very limited effect on you financially it it goes to 0.
If you have a net worth of 500 bucks, and invest 250 in BTC - then losing it is it not that big a deal.  He could pull a couple of extra shifts at work to recover it.

How many armed factions are using how many methods to kill Syrian citizens?  What sane Syrian wouldn't want to move somewhere where you have some assurance you will make it through the year without losing one or more family members.

+1.  
Unless your net worth is very low, then having a large portion of it in BTC makes no sense.
If bitcoin fails you are in a world of hurt financially, if it succeeds and heads towards the moon then you really don't need to own tens or hundreds of thousands of USDs worth (at todays prices) to have "enough" to be very wealthy.

My take is the end result for Bitcoin is it gets huge, or goes to zero.
I see no reason to invest huge amounts of ones net worth in it.  If it reaches its potential, even a holding of 10 BTC will be ample for anyone to live on.  If it goes to zero you are just out a few thousand dollars.
Buying a 100 or even a 1000 BTC, rather than just 10, is simply not worth the potential cost.  
- If it is eventually successful it will just mean you are obscenely wealthy instead of simply wealthy.  Basically you will be able to live larger.
- If it eventually fails you will have lost a huge amount of number instead of just a few thousand dollars.  This could have serious repercussions for your future retirement plans.

Yes I find that confusing..at one point it says 10,000.  But in the article it reference just 10.

Exact same situation here (Texas also).  I have a much better feeling about them than I do about Coinbase.

IF Gemini ever materializes in a trusted easily usable form (I see a lot of hype, but I'm not yet convinced) then I'd agree it's only going to boost prices.
There are many people who'd like to - or would act upon a Financial Advisers advice - to invest 0.5% to 1.0% of their net worth in bitcoin "Just in case".
Right now you have to jump through all sorts of hoops, and there is a good chance you will lose your money (thru fraud, or poor security).
If there is ever a safe option where the only way you'll lose money thru a loss in the value of bitcoins I have no doubt we'll see more people with substantial wealth divert a little into it.

I dunno about that, there's been various stories the last year or so saying the majority of Americans (probably one of the richer countries) don't have enough savings to pay for a $500 expense.
Pretty sure $120k would change their lives!

How can one reliably earn interest funding margin traders?
Seems like you face all the risk of wipeout - if the trader loses his shirt - with little of the potential upside.
