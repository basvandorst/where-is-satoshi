I've noticed on Youtube a TON of ads for very obvious ponzis such as usi tech and bitconnect.
 
a lot of people are going to get burned by these as they haven't collapsed yet.
Blows my mind that youtube/google allow this kind of stuff.
These ads have pretty high production value and could look legit.

When Satoshi first launched Bitcoin...the reward for mining a block was 50 BTC.
Approximately every 4 years, the reward for mining a block is halved.
We have been through 2 halvings (2012 and 2016)
the next halving occurs in 2020 when the reward will be 50/(2^3) which is 6.25 BTC.
Less new bitcoin will be mined and thus the inflation rate will be halved.
Anyone that claims to know "What is going to happen", doesn't.

- Bitcoin is digital cash.  The way a dollar can be handed at arms length from person-to-person, Bitcoin extends that arms length to worldwide.
- 1 Bitcoin can be broken into 100 million peices.  Like a dollar can be broken into 100 peices.
- Bitcoin is backed by its properties.  Like gold is backed by its properties.
- The cost to transfer bitcoin is very low (a few cents) and is a flat ammount for any sum.
- Bitcoin is created as a reward to people who run computers that process transactions.  This reward is usually very close to the cost of the electricity that runs said computers.  This is called mining.
- Bitcoin is decentralized. No one owns it or controls it and it is impossible to shut down without shutting down the internet.  
- Bitcoin is Open Source.  This means there anyone can check for themselves exactly how it works.

I sent this to my senators, I'm sure it sucks but oh well it's something:
I'm not the best with words but in case you aren't aware, there is a current and immediate problem with FinCEN shutting down start up entrepreneurs in the Bitcoin world.
FinCEN is classifying anyone who has a firm (or the next dorm room billionaire) related to Bitcoin as a money transmitter and thus subject to AML laws
Basically there's an insane amount of regulations (different regs in all 50 states) in regards to money laundering.
For a start up business in Bitcoin, if you get one tiny little thing wrong in any of the 50 states you get shut down.
This seems like a huge barrier to entry into the field, that simply doesn't exist overseas.  
Bitcoin IS the future, we don't know what it will be yet, much as we didn't know what the internet would be back in 1990.  
Do you want the major exchanges and firms to be speaking Chinese and trading Yuan?  
Don't let the FinCEN bureaucrats hand the Bitcion industry to foreign countries on a silver platter.
Thanks man.
