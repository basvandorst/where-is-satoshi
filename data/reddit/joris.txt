I have my investments set on Its pretty much the only coin satisfying the needs of a honest garlic farmer such as myself.

Crypto and privacy go hand in hand IMHO. We should focus on social networks that dont share all our data to the highest bidder.

Coinomi is fine for small amounts. 
It is fine because it requires a password, but the problem is by having it on a phone, with internet access you open yourself up to attack vectors. 
Nobody is going to hack you for a few hundred dollar, but when you have more you need to be diligent and start researching fail safe methods of holding your coins.

If you dont have an exchange why not make your own btc buying website?
I know a few companies that are more than willing to grant you access to large funds as long as you are willing to pay up. Many Dutch people for example fund people in countries that dont allow cryptocurrency. 
I sold btc that way for a while to some guy in India for his faucet network.
As long as you get a trusted partner you can make a lot work out.

1BTC=1BTC didnt loose when you didnt sell.
I had a good chuckle at your rambling tho. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:46:18
Not. When you dont sell you dont lose.
I still have the same amount of BTC I had a month ago so to speak.
Why give a fuck about what the price is doing right now. Its not like we are all dying tomorrow.
We bought knowing that the price could do either up or down, but all of us bought a ticket to the moon. To get to the moon you get nausea on the way if you arent stronk.
People hating and laughing cause the price is still rolling down but those people were never interesting folks anyway.
Wanna be stuck in the same situation for the rest of your life just sell off and call it a day.

There are hundreds more since gourl implemented an easy way for Wordpress shops to accept cryptopayments.

Side note, any better sub with less fud'ers?

\^ with that said I like to remember people the only way traders can take money from you is when you start trading your bitcoin away in the hope to chase the gold goose.

Use Ublock origin. In settings you can enable and disable whitelists. The plugin is opensource.

Honestly just hold onto it. Worst case you see it ride to zero, best case scenario it will go back up to 18K. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:14:16
But it hard to praise something when the countries own citizens cant even afford the tx fee. 
I am having a hard time being like "oh thats nice" because we all know the Venezualan government will abuse it. 
Its important that this message stays up even if you dont want to hear it anymore. 
Also,if I have to take a gamble, this is a drill to get people in position to pay them with petro instead of a normal salary.
Not buying anything from that country myself, because I am not in the mood to line the pockets of a dictator.
I refuse to even visit it unless that man is gone. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:34:12
You can buy smaller pieces yes. Bitcoin can be broken down very far.

Hundreds of thousands of people use Bitcoin every day. Not in the way people want it to be used but it is used. When Bitcoin goes to zero do people think folks stop claiming faucets? They dont give a f and will continue because it earns them money. (55K people right now online on faucethub, thats just one faucet) The guys who pay people in bitcoin for work will continue, the drugmarkets will continue, adnetworks will continue, marketplaces will continue.  In fact, I dare to say even more people are using Bitcoin at the moment. Legit using people, not charts and stats. You can see advertisement networks booming, even when bitcoin is down.
They wont go back to paypal lmao. Noone of those folks will ever go back to regular currency for their business or time-waste.
People keep looking deep into the charts and exchanges and forget that there are people out there who still make a living out of it outside of mining or trading. 
You cant pay faucets in gold, you cant pay people for work in gold. 
But you do want to hire that dev overseas without ever seeing him in person. 
Dangerous game everyone here is playing by speculating without knowing the uses. I dislike that argument of " btc has no value" as the some commenter said in this thread and multiple others are trying to repeat over other threads. It is based on no information except what they heard from others. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:26:39
Invest everything in random tokens that are advertised with referral urls.
@_date: 2018-11-16 04:41:15
That doesnt help him at all.
This is the easiest way to make people get turned off on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:02:34
The fact the market can bottom out, and with my luck its going to happen when I sell. No worries here tho, I actually only invested what I could afford to loose, so no sweat is spilled while the market is coming crashing down.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:36:11
Damn you are one cool dude. too much of a shithole so you come stink up the place here with an alt?
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:29:52
Thanks for confirming you are an alt stinking up the place.
Have a good day.

Is it an asset just as in the Netherlands?
I think we have the same rules.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:27:33
I have been checking for a hour right now, and the only compelling argument I personally found was that one guy you should sell, so you can reinvest later. 
But that is risk taking, and it is no use if you believe the price will go back up eventually. Yeah you might make a couple thousand, but you might be that guy that is going to get fucked and sell right at the time the price goes back up again.
Idk man personally I am just waiting this whole ordeal out, and come back when the market stabilizes. 
Dont take my advice for anything by the way, I recently bought more at 10K, so I too have a personal stake in this BTC thing.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:41:59
Didnt even think about that but yeah that is going to happen for sure.
We can already see it in small spikes happening. 
Right now my only question is if the price will return to pre-crash prices. And thats the only risk you cant influence, making it a tough decision.
All around, I rather eliminate the risk of daytrading, and just hodl. No need to take on extra risk with the stress this is causing already.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:29:34
True true, my bad English is not my native language, also its getting pretty late here. You say it better. My point was that waiting is an okay thing to do when you dont know what to do. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:57:48
So if I have a company that only accepts BTC I am now forced to stop accepting payments for more then 12 hours? Scuffed coin.
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:55:11
Thanks mate.
