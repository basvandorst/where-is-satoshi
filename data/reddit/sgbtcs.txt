I believe he arranged rooms a couple of times to gain trust and then went all out.  I may or may not learn more depending on what the Police are OK to tell me on Tuesday about the allegations.

Agreed - I am not too sure if I ever use localbitcoins again after this... But let's see - hopefully the Police can see through this criminal's actions as a common man in the middle fraud.  I must admit though, I cannot sleep at night from worry about it.

I think most people have given up, that is why mggox btc's trade at a premium - they can't take cash out so they buy btc's and take those out......

Yes.  This is exactly right.

A friend of mine asked me what are bitcoins and are they worth anything as he was looking around his old PC and found his btc wallet - I guess someone sent him 40 to pay him like 4 bucks like 3 years ago or something as a joke.  I told him that's worth now like 5K USD (when they were at 100 USD a pop, I don't know 6 or 12 months ago can't remember).  He then sold them to me, which I'm pretty happy about now.  I am guessing there  are more out there like that.

And yeah, I'm not angry so much as disappointed and scared to be in this spot. In the scheme of things its not a lot of money (well, it is, but not a life changing thing here if Police request I return it to the [other] victim of the attack)

Thank you.  I am pretty sure this would prevent such an attack being successful.

I can't remember where I read about this but someone on a forum did some nice research on this and charted the premium for BTC's on mtgox, and when the spread vs market was the highest there were the most complaints / issues around mtgox's situation (e.g. the USD seizures etc).  If you google you may come across these charts and see.  I've stopped using them.

Sorry.  No credit cards done, this is a wire transfer situation.  The Travel Agent probably should always use a credit card.  Why she thought paying into a random individual savings account was for hotel bookings I am not sure, but that was the man in the middle attacker's fault....
