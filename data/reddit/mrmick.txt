* [Mailfence]( (Free, based in Belgium, end-to-end encryption with Digital Signatures)

Email is (however) fundamentally not secure and one **has to make several trade-off's** depending on their personal preferences, specific requirements and understanding of security &amp; privacy on the whole. Though their are some projects ([DIME]( [LEAP]( ...) which are working on re-engineering the protocol - but that again is work-in-progress. I personally use [mailfence]( (due to their complete emailing suite - docs, calendar, address book, groups, polls, IMAP, POP, ... and the ability of Digital signatures) - however, it all depends on individual preferences and specific requirements.
[Privacy tools]( and [Vegard secure email services feature matrix]( are some of the other places that provides further details in this regard.

Under the light of comment, how this is different from other private and secure email solutions that support bitcoins ([Mailfence]( [Protonmail]( ...)?
