Scraping of the welfare system, to a certain extent. Taxes (yes sorry, society needs a minimum of taxes to help the weakest and to do business in a good atmosphere).
  Milton Friedman was for a negative tax which is more or less a way to finance a basic income.

I don't know but while I was considering that holding a bit of my savings in a Coinbase account was an "acceptable" risk (ease of access, 2FA and normally insurance against hacks if it's Coinbase's fault), but now I'm moving it to an SPV wallet (with a spending pin set up) with an encrypted backup in a 2FA protected cloud account. **I know it's not 100% safe** but it's a good balance between safety and ease of use... I think.

It's all about personal preference. Although if you opt for the online account solution, setup the 2FA (and back it up !!) and choose hack insured services (only if the hack is not your fault), like Circle or Coinbase (I think they are insured but not 100% sure).

Be careful, you won't have the same kind of service with the Amazon Web service. It's more developer oriented. Namecheap has many other plans you can migrate to if your site start picking up traffic. I'm not using them but AWS isn't really the same kind of service (even though you can use it for simple wordpress websites as well).

You can probably try to setup an automatic buying system. Coinbase does have it, it's called "recurring payments". But I'm sure you can try to setup an automatic wire to an exchange and buy automatically at market price. The problem I see though is that sometimes exchanges switch banks but usually they'll inform you by email.

It's not. As with the Bitcoin price, the more you have, the more you can control (whales). You suppress the government, you'll get powerful cartels of big corporations controlling many parts of the country. And they might not care at all about respecting the "voluntaryism" moto.  
I'm for more individual liberty, it doesn't mean that I will vote libertarian to scrap all the workers' rights for example...  
A good thing is to recognize that the government isn't perfect and need to be democratically controlled more directly and with more transparency.

Even banks can get hacked nowadays (see the SWIFT hack), but the difference is that they have one of the safest insurance you could think about : government. Personal accounts are insured up to 250k$ by law I think. In the Bitcoin space some services (Circle I think ?) have private insurance but to what extent it will pay back customer funds in case of a massive hack, difficult to say.

Give that choice to people, and they'll consider that it's a theft 99% of the time. You don't exactly know what your money is doing, point taken, but you can't say that taxes are utterly wrong. War is bad yes and it's infuriating to see my money used to fund the Olympics here in Tokyo, I never asked for it. Nevertheless, I use public parks, ride my bicycle on nice roads, got a good public health insurance and overall I'm happy that at least part of my money can contribute to good thing. I mean, no system is perfect and ours certainly isn't, but that central money pot is useful and provide a certain peace of mind to society. Money isn't property, it's just a mean of exchange, I don't mind if someone take mine but provide me in return (if I have a big surgery someday, I'll thank a non-existent god everyday to not be living in the US). I used public schools for free in France and could have been going to a university for peanuts. If I end up broke ? I can ask for those ~500 euros/month to try to get back on my feet.  
More transparency, less corruption and less money for army ? Yes, yes and yes. Government responsible for all the problems we have ? No. I have always been careful with single-villain ideologies.  
Anyway, outside of this debate. Thanks for making great Bitcoin companies.

The Bitcoin Blockchain is a decentralized databases that everyone can use without any permission coming from anyone but the protocol.

In that case though, you still have something rather than nothing. Also, they wouldn't have to create money to do that.
Money isn't the problem, it's the people voting for the politicians who use it badly, although I think Bitcoin could override the current, sad state of the world. Nevertheless, if the main exchanges continue to fuck up like that, it won't happen soon.

Libertarians : government is bad, bad and bad. Taxes are bad, bad and bad because my money is not yours.  
Soviet-style socialists : let's put government everywhere.  
Reasonable opinion : government can be good as protecting weaker people and acting as a good mean of redistributing wealth for everyone to profit from it. Yes, even rich people are using public roads etc. Of course, given too much power governments can turn bad and corrupt.  
I mean, libertarians are often completely blind. They make great entrepreneurs, don't get me wrong, but I'm pretty sure a society can't function under libertarian rules (which mean no rules except some vague ethics not enforced), even if you take the power of creating money out of the hands of the bankers. It doesn't mean that the current status quo is desirable though.

The simplest and "non nerdy" way is to get an address, print out the private key (offline), laminate it and keep it in a fireproof safe.  
Or keep the private key backup in different storage means, encrypted with AES256 (7zip can do that).  
You also have some services like Bitgo or Greenaddress that will keep your stash with a multisig vault, usually with 2 out of 3 keys needed to unlock. You get two, they get one and you can retrieve your bitcoins even if their service goes offline.  
I don't know about how hardware wallets work, but many people seems to be happy with it.

Weird statement. We're seeing wealthy people benefiting a whole lot from the growth, greatly helped by tax loopholes while the middle class is being sucked dry. Inequalities are a big concern, and that's partly because this debt based economy that you're talking about was believed to "trickle down", but it's not. Wealth is staying at the top and is growing, growing... Current monetary policies is creating working poors and progressively killing the middle class.  
A debt based economy also need a lot of trust, but how do you maintain it when your government believe that its money will never run out? You need a certain balance, otherwise people start asking questions. Where is the money that has saved banks in 2009? Why are wages not going up as much as the inflation? Is QE creating a new bubble?  


Sounds like you're propagating the Modern Monetary Theory that I see a lot around online. So let's say that the US starts to default in its debt. Not a small country. The USA... What would happen?  
A country that is allergic to debt and fear hyperinflation can grow. See Germany.

It doesn't take away the fact that the current financial system doesn't work to the benefit of the middle class and the working class. If wages had kept up, then I'd say it makes sense, but they didn't.  
Also I don't think we exactly need this system to finance public research. Your link between monetary inflation and technological advancement is far fetched. Japan had a deflationary/stagflationary economy for years, do you think they all of a sudden stopped public research? I don't think so. 
FIAT money *will* need to do better in the future. I'm not saying we should go back to the gold standard, but since FIAT money is built *only* upon trust, governments and central banks will need to earn it rather than force everyone by law to use it because they say so.  
Bitcoin is a healthy alternative and in our day and age maybe encouraging saving rather than endless consumerism might be pretty good for our planet.

"USSR wasn't real communism".  
:p  
I can't believe these kind assertions that belong to libertarian high schoolers are getting spread around. Capitalism can come in different flavors. Putting a little bit of central planning *is* a flavor of capitalism. The goal is still to own and make as much money as you can. Trying to push the narrative that a world of rainbows and pink unicorns would exist without central powers is extremely naive at best.   
Now try your flavor of capitalism and see society crumble completely, or even rebuild central powers.

You receive from the government a protection to your private property and different services such a justice, infrastructure building that no one would do because it's very costly etc.  
Taxation doesn't disappear into the void, it gives back in a way you can't always see directly. Libertarianism is trying to search for difficult theoretical models as to how society could function better with no taxes, almost no government etc. always quoting Austrian economists and everyone else who object "economic illiterate" like our *beloved* Roger !  
I'll politely disagree as I think that an economist like Karl Polanyi is much, much closer as to envision how modern society should be functioning, using anthropology and sociology along economics to support his vision.  
Austrian are just describing the "homo economicus" as rational, greedy and kind of empowered by the magic of the free market.  
Now onto Bitcoin, I think it will be a risk that it might be used to dodge taxes but I also think that it's a good counter balance to bad monetary practices from private banks or governments. It's people's money and I hope that it will encourage governments to reconsider how they handle their money, inequality etc.

You're following a "white paper" written at the beginning of Bitcoin. Things have changed and Satoshi's not god.  
The blocksize isn't something we'll never change but it must be a last resort upgrade, not the panacea to scale. That's what you guys got wrong and why you only have rich people supporting it instead of serious devs. Trust the engineers instead of a con artist marketing team.

We all want to scale, but we surely can't scale entirely with only the block size. Some people wanted to keep the 1mb limit to keep things as decentralized as possible (even with high fees for users) while Roger and co. said "screw this ! I want to buy my coffee with Bitcoin and if the blocksize increase fails to deliver that and centralize things, then I have no problem with it becoming Paypal 2.0".  
Core devs are sticking to the extreme censorship resistant narrative while Roger and co. wanted to keep the "so cheap to send !" narrative, which is more convenient to market to beginners.  
We could have had a 2mb increase (some core devs weren't totally against it) but a lot of things happened such as agreements without consulting the principal devs...  
Now we have SegWit but it seems that the biggest wallet providers don't count it as a priority...  
Also the extreme shilling of BCH supporters is annoying as they're trying to steal the brand, which is just not good to come to an agreement. We should agree to disagree and move on but BCH supporters really, really want to kill the BTC chain.  
Personally, while looking at the high fees makes me a bit nervous, it's still quite low for the craziness that happened this year. I'm also glad to see a robust blockchain but I really hope that the Lightning network will finally eradicate high fees and potentially undermine the BCH narrative.

As for the comparison, it's not relevant. Food and housing, while being at the very base of the needs, are a bit less of an emergency than a brain tumor that needs surgery or let's say, insulin for diabetics. If you think the "free market" would solve the problem of healthcare in the US, then I think you're wrong. If you put profits above anything, then the surgeon will have all the right to not perform life saving surgery if your CC isn't working (whoops), transparency or not.  
The "free market" (which still relies on precise policies and wouldn't exists without a proper framework such as the state, see Karl Polanyi) can't solve anything (it's a myth) and sometimes makes things worst (environment or healthcare etc.) because it fails to take into account bad economic externalities.

Not exactly legal tender.  
Google translate for you : "The above is the text of the law. A virtual currency is defined as a property value that can be used for purchasing or selling goods and services among the general public through the Internet. In short, it means that it was properly recognized as a means of payment. The point that is different from the electronic money and points that are currently powerful means of payment is that it can be exchanged for legal tender currencies such as yen and dollar."
Google translate : The virtual currency is the currency?
Strictly speaking, the virtual currency is not a currency. It is different from the statutory currency such as yen and dollar. Tax and accounting treatment is "asset".  
Bitcoin is *not* considered the same as US dollars or Yen, it's an *asset* that can be used as a *method of payment*. A hybrid status of some sort.

Aah, the good old rhetoric :D. Stop being a fetishist of money and accept that these are just numbers and that it's necessary to a certain extent to redistribute it in a community as Capitalism tend to favor accumulation at the top. It's not being violent, it's being realistic.  
No one is pointing guns at you but if there was no repressive measures, then it also wouldn't work. As cute as is right wing libertarianism, it's extremely utopian.  
I feel sorry for you as you're probably living in a European welfare state that has paid for your education and numerous other public services paid by the community.  
Now onto Bitcoin. I think it will be used along other currencies. It will be a counter power but not necessarily be taking over.

At the moment, most of the txs wouldn't even fill 1mb.  
Now stay polite please.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:16:51
The transaction count is the *very best case*, you shouldn't take it as is. We all know that 1MB is at most 7tps. So generally speaking 8mb would be 56tps. Not quite yet at Paypal level...  
Note that Core devs do not exclude a blocksize increase in the future. I even think that SegWit2x would have been successful if it has been negotiated directly with the devs and not behind closed doors with miners.  
SegWit is really genius but it has one weakness : it's not enforced. So companies do not want to bother implementing it that fast.

You're taking it the wrong way if you support the right wing version of libertarianism. Free market capitalism can't enable a "true" freedom since people can pressure others to do other things etc. You focus on the government like it's the source of all evils in the world. Governments are imperfect, but I'd tend to think that a society based on the sole "free market" would be even more. I agree with Karl Polyani on this point :

No you're not right.  
A blockchain needs to be safe and maintained by miners. Miners need a reward for this. Securing a blockchain to the levels of Bitcoin costs a lot. Having some Bitcoins grants you access to the blockchain, to transact with someone or to use the chain in any other way you want (digital contracts for example). The value of a Bitcoin more or less reflects the level of safety. The higher the safety and trustlessness of the chain, the higher the entry point for newcomers.  
Personally I like it because I'm tired of middlemen and their parasitic behavior when it comes to handle transactions.
No baseball card will ever do that.

In countries where cash is on the decline, big bills are really not used that much anymore.  
I've lived a good 8 years in Europe after Euro was declared official currency and I've never seen a 100 euros bill. Everyone uses 50 euros max. Above and it's usually Credit cards, checks (in France) that are used.  
I think one guy tried to pay with a 500 euros bill at an Electronic store and the shop called the Police on him.  
Now I live in Japan where they still uses 10K jpy bills (equivalent to 100 USD bills) but it's one of the country that still heavily use cash.

Yes, there will be plenty of possible routes. And in the rare case of a channel that closes during the hops, the payment will be canceled and you will just need to try again. 
As for the "bloating with data" each time a settlement is made successfully (and it is enforced by the main layer, the blockchain), it's gone from the network, so there's that. But I'm not expert enough to tell if LN is at a danger of being bloated with too many nodes and fall victim to its own success. But then it would become the same problem as BCH who wants to scale to handle gazillions of transactions on a simple blockchain, which would take the blocksize into the GB territory.

Bitcoin can be a *vector* towards investment. There's services that will give you some returns. It's just that 90% of them are garbage/scams, since it's the far west.  
 will for example give you some interests on your BTC.  
There's also  that have been proven to be legit at providing returns for investing into solar panels in South Africa.  
The point being that BTC ease the process of investing and make it accessible for everyone.

Well, Primes miner price are regulated by GAW yes. But I don't think they thought it as a Ponzi. I mean it's miners that where meant to have more and more features, but they couldn't really sell it very expensive at that time. It was a start, to see if the sales are good.
The CEO is well known, many people trust them, they are doing a pretty good job despite bugs. Wait and see and be careful, but hating with no proof is a really nonsense.

In Japan you can *almost* do it. Electronic chains accepting Bitcoin also sell food/alcohol (not everything but there's some stuff).  
I wish convenience stores were accepting it directly, that would be a huge boost.

A lot of people are making that same argument when I talk about it (and I never talk about it first, they often ask me), that I was "lucky to be at the top of the pyramid and waiting for more gullible people to get in and buy your stuff for a higher price".  
You could say the same thing about stocks, gold, silver etc. 
If Bitcoin was completely useless then yes. Except it isn't. There's hundreds of companies developing services, it's the very first currency of the internet, many businesses are accepting it (I was in Gent, Belgium lately and saw 2 restaurants accepting it). If you don't see any value in that then you don't buy, it's easy. But don't come to say I'm trying to essentially scam you :/.

I think that a cloud mining service that let you choose your pool (or solo mining) could be interesting. Some people wouldn't mind putting some money into pools that do not support BCH etc. without buying an expensive ASIC.

The definition of freedom of right wing libertarians is extremely simplistic and is difficult to apply to the real world. For libertarians, anything that isn't taken through force is OK. Except that there's plenty of example where you can take power without force (bribery, manipulation etc.). The thing you reproach to the state nowadays would certainly happen with big corporations. The "power" void will be filled.

This is one of the downside of a "pure" free market. You need informed people to make rational decisions, but you'll always have people with deep pockets trying to spread misinformation to undermine the free market.

You are making a point here. Yes Japan and japanese people love new technology. But knowing really how it works is instantly making you a "nerd". See the Linux and Android market share. They completely love Apple here. They love technology because it's making their life easier. I'm not blaming them on that, but when it's making you "lazy" to know how it works that's not good. They are very good at adopting new technologies (even old people), but that does not make 90% of the population programmers :p.
Also, they suffer from a Galapagos syndrome. Sometimes they create great things that works only in Japan, to see americans taking the idea far later (5~10 years) with good marketing to bring it to the world.

Very difficult in SHA256, difficult on Scrypt. I found out that cloud mining is not so bad. You can buy hashlets (GAW miners and Zencloud) on the "hashmarket", mine a bit, and re-sell it. This is the mix between mining and trading your "cloud" miner that can bring some benefits enough quickly.

I would want to stay on the "all decentralized" thing and I think many people here do. Is it possible by letting the "main" blockchain at 1mb ?  
To my mind, Bitcoin was intended to replace almost everything (bank transfers, CC, international remittances, cash etc.), but it seems that it's on the way to work with the actual system while improving it. Which seems objectively, more realistic.

I think beginners should stick a while with Coinbase or Circle, avoiding spending their coins on gambling websites and such.
It's easy (like online banking) and normally insured again external attacks (if it's not the user fault) by an insurance company. Enabling the 2FA is required though.  
Once you want to get your hands on bigger amounts, then learn about wallets you fully control.
Of course purists don't really like this way, but let's be honest 2 seconds : computer illiterates can't take good security measures (encrypted backup etc.) on a personal wallet.

That's not the debate here. They simply do not have any other solution for the moment (which is a shame I agree).

**In view of the above, there has never been a truly communist state** although the Soviet Union of the past and China, Cuba, and North Korea of today stake their claims. See also Marxism and Socialism.
Just to be precise. Roots of the communist thought and states claiming to be communist aren't exactly the same thing.  
Also Marxism makes a difference between *personal* property and the owning of the means of production. In other words, no you don't have to share your toothbrush but workers that are using the means of production (such as factories etc.) also own it. A similar system to cooperatives. Ideally, revenues from capital are almost impossible  and only work is rewarded.

If you find any proof that they're a Ponzi I'll gladly accept it and revise my opinion :) (I can be wrong).

Does it justify calling it "very insecure" though ? 


This is very different from the trust model in the "thick" client: the thick client verifies that a transaction's inputs are unspent by actually checking the whole chain up to that point -- there is no "X blocks deep" involved here. At that point it uses "X blocks deep" to decide how likely it is that a longer fork in the chain will emerge which excludes that transaction.

It's much more complicated than that. It's more of a mix of causes than "socialism". Saying it's 100% because of Socialism participate to the Americano-centric red scare.

That's were you're wrong, you keep the simplistic, right wing definition of free markets, which is at best extremely incomplete. I would go further in saying that free markets, in the definition of right wing economics (or Austrian), can't exist.  
In the words of Ha-Joon Chang:  


For a "free" market to exist you first need three basic intervention from a non-market entity which needs to be neutral: enforce contracts, resolve disputes, and protect property rights.  
It's pretty easy to see that "free" market without any government intervention is just a pipe dream in the head of anarcho-capitalists (which are btw, not anarchists).

You believe in a complete utopia solely based on a non-enforceable NAP that would end up in "Who's got the biggest guns?". Capitalism is predatory by nature. I don't want to live in a predatory society. Especially without regulations and public contracts enforcement. Good day to you too.

Listen to balanced views instead.  
The thing is Bitcoin will teach you how market works and that nothing can go up all the time. There needs to be corrections, prolonged ones sometimes.  
When people asked me in 2017, I told them "Yes, buy if you want *but* don't be surprised if it goes down. No one knows what will happen. But to get an idea, look at what happened before".  
Nevertheless, your patience will probably be rewarded in a few years.

No you don't. It's like Bitmex but denominated in FIAT. You can leverage trade and if you're right, you get FIAT.
@_date: 2018-10-07 05:44:33
Never safe to accept selling BTC for FIAT through CCs/Paypal-like providers. People will always try to charge back.  
Even when Paypal side with you (I tried on Xcoins), they sometimes can't do shit since it's the CC provider who do what they want.  
The only way is to have a high commission percentage to compensate and eventually a buffer time to release the Bitcoins to the buyer depending on how long the chargeback is possible.  
It's a bit of a PITA and most services who did that got also problems with anti-money laundering laws.  
 is still operating though (very high commission).

From wikipedia :  


Tell me were do you think were do you think the economy isn't "capitalist". You could say that it's a mixed economy with a capitalist base.    
What you guys often criticize is "chrony capitalism" but it's still capitalist. You're trying to appropriate for yourself a wide umbrella word covering so many different systems. But the base is still the same and I'd go as far as saying that where there's capitalism, there will be corruption, manipulation and so on because the basic premise and "goal" is to make shitloads of money. The easiest way to do it, is to cheat.

I disagree.  
  
  
*The basic living conditions, starting with sanitation, better access to clean drinking water, improvements in cooking and lighting energy sources, improved significantly.
There was a major increase in food sufficiency, improved diets, better nutrition and reduction in seasonal illnesses. However, there was no evidence that this cash transfer had led to a rise in alcohol consumption, contrary to popular belief.
Better health of children also led to higher school attendance and improved performance. The basic income also facilitated spending on school uniforms, books and stationery.
The cash transfer also facilitated small scale investments such as buying better raw materials and equipment, which resulted in higher income. There was also a shift, especially in the tribal village, from wage labour and bonded labour to invest in own farms and other forms of self-employment.
Women empowerment was another significant outcome of the pilot studies, as it improved their participative power in the economic decision making in the household.
These experiments also had a direct, positive impact on the debt structure. It facilitated reduction in debts, as it enabled the villagers to both borrow less from the moneylenders (at a high interest rate) and pay back to the money lenders with the basic income.*  
So yeah, hand money over to the poor, they'll use it wisely for the most and greatly improve the economy.

*You're* talking nonsense. UBI is a floor. Anyone working would get supplemental income (and probably as much as anyone wants). It's nothing about putting the means of production into the hands of the workers or the road to a stateless society (yes because the end goal of communism is getting rid of the state).  
It's just about not letting people sleep in the street/not having enough food or just enabling possibilities like going back to studying rather than working a minimum wage job.
@_date: 2017-01-10 09:31:35
They have experts to assess Bitcoin's risk and if they begin to buy (and publicly do it having accumulated slowly privately) it's almost a sure win for them.  
It would be an unprecedented form of legitimacy and as such would pop the 10K USD price in no time (it's just a guess).  
But I don't think they're really doing it honestly.

Never, ever take an English news site as source in Japan ffs.

Google translate for you : 
"The above is the text of the law. A virtual currency is defined as a property value that can be used for purchasing or selling goods and services among the general public through the Internet. In short, it means that it was properly recognized as a means of payment. The point that is different from the electronic money and points that are currently powerful means of payment is that it can be exchanged for legal tender currencies such as yen and dollar."  
Google translate : The virtual currency is the currency?
Strictly speaking, the virtual currency is not a currency. It is different from the statutory currency such as yen and dollar. Tax and accounting treatment is "asset".  
So stop with that BS that Japan recognized it as a currency on par with YEN or USD, it is NOT a *legal tender*. JUST STOP !

Blatant pro-market libertarian propaganda here. There can be "voluntary" exchange that aren't *really* voluntary.  
Very simplified example : work for me or starve. You're "free" to choose.  
Markets also create bad externalities : A voluntary exchange can create bad externalities for a non directly involved third party.  
Simple example : I allow you to cut the trees on my big property in exchange for money. Externality created is that trees often protect against flooding/landslide. A few months later, the town down in the valley will be wiped out by a landslide. In a libertarian world, there wouldn't be any responsibility taken from the owner of the property.  
If you think "horrible accidents" will be rare enough then good luck with your belief.

I've been attending the Tokyo Bitcoin meetup a lot of times, but stopped recently because I don't want to support their campaign (Roger Ver is the founder of this meetup). I've been talking with big blockers there, and even when Ethereum forked (with the result we know) they were saying "Naah it's OK and what's the problem anyway ? It still works no ?".

They don't even need to, that's the beauty of it ;). Ayn Rand and other US based thinkers just had to write some theoretical Anarchist thoughts *but* without the terrible image of Leftism in the US. Their Libertarians cousins do receive money and are supported by the Koch Brothers.
Teenagers just love the rebellious tendency of these stuff and because it's "US compatible, free of filthy communism^tm", it just spreads around. In Europe, where the anti-communist propaganda wasn't as powerful, anarchist are more into an anarcho-communist or syndicalist tradition.  
Right wing libertarians were the first to jump on Bitcoin because they like fringe technology stuff (a lot of them are also transhumanist etc.) and because they're obsessed with "sound" money (ie the gold standard). But Bitcoin is much more than this fringe ideology.

I'd download a wallet on a non-jailbreaked/rooted phone or a computer. FIRST, try to withdraw a small amount to see if everything is working. If it's ok then send the rest. ENCRYPT your wallet with a strong password that you won't forget. Properly lock your phone/computer with at least a PIN code. Setup a "spending" PIN if it's available on the wallet. Create a backup file, add a layer of encryption if you want with 7zip and AES256 locked by a password. Backup the file in one USB at home. If you're willing to trust cloud services, you can upload it on an account setup with 2FA, if you're unwilling, try to make at least two different physical backups, in a fire/water proof safe.  
It's as safe as you can get for free, while being able to spend it.

As much as I dislike R. Ver, you could do what he did: abandon US citizenship and get one of the Caribbean countries citizenship in order to avoid getting taxed abroad. There's plenty of countries that offer citizenship by investment. If you negotiate, they might even be willing to take BTC directly and it is actually officially the case in Antigua and Barbuda.

Japan's a bit different. CC aren't NFC but a lot of people and shops use Felica enabled train/metro cards (Suica/Pasmo in Tokyo). It's extremely fast and simple.  
It would be neat to be able to charge it with BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:28:00
It's much simpler with a payment gateway, especially when you need to get paid in FIAT, so you're not wrong for using it.  
*But* I think there's some free add ons to add BTC to your online shop. It will just send it to your wallet of choice and it could be an exchange address that is set up to sell immediately at market price.  
So yeah, there are solutions but it's a bit more complicated to set up.

Was looking at a Ver post yesterday. He was showing a new video where "he shuts up a Korean Blockstream believer" (or something like that). I watch the video and all I see is Ver arguing that Bcash is better because it can be spent like USD or Korean Won and just cut right after he's made that completely dubious argument. The answer of the Korean guy was never revealed.  
I don't like violence but Ver needs to be slapped and be told to stop his childish shenanigans.

No, that's not how it works. 


It is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media, consumer electronics, etc.). The main inflation we currently experience is in sectors where automation has not been applied due to government regulation or inapplicability – primarily housing, education, and healthcare. The real issue isn’t the Freedom Dividend, it’s whether technology and automation will be allowed to reduce prices in different sectors.  
  
It is NOT adding anything to the money supply.  
All the evidence for all other cash handout programs around the world shows no inflation or even gets into negative territory! This was the case in Kuweit, or still the case in Alaska.

My super non technical observation is that people are over bearish because Bitcoin never corrected so hard for so long in a multi year bull run but I also think that a few months ago, BTC was rallying too hard, too fast. The length and depth of this correction is probably correlated to how hard we rallied.

Uruguay has a free market economy characterized by an export-oriented agricultural sector, a well-educated workforce, and **high levels of social spending**. Uruguay has sought to expand trade within the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) and with non-Mercosur members, and President VAZQUEZ has maintained his predecessor’s mix of pro-market policies and a strong social safety net.
Following financial difficulties in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Uruguay's economic growth averaged 8% annually during the period 2004-08. The 2008-09 global financial crisis put a brake on Uruguay's vigorous growth, which decelerated to 2.6% in 2009. Nevertheless, the country managed to avoid a recession and keep positive growth rates, mainly through higher public expenditure and investment; GDP growth reached 8.9% in 2010 but slowed markedly in the period 2012-16 as a result of a renewed slowdown in the global economy and in Uruguay's main trade partners and Mercosur counterparts, Argentina and Brazil. Reforms in those countries should give Uruguay an economic boost. Growth picked up in 2017.

The most limiting hardware would probably be storage. I mean, of course 4 or even 20MB seems OK nowadays, but the VISA tps would probably need 600MB blocks. If it get filled your HDD would get full very quickly and only data centers would be able to run full nodes.  
SegWit seems to be smart and scaling smartly is good. If we encounter a wall, increasing the blocksize the "hard" way will probably be considered.

Capitalism is OK as long as it's moderated by a strong, democratic (close to direct democracy, like in Switzerland) and uncorrupted state.  
Otherwise, extreme versions of capitalism like ancapism or Libertarianism inevitably lead to chaos and extreme inequality. Neoliberalism which is already a pretty hard version of capitalism (with large measures at slashing down the state when it comes to healthcare, telecommunications, highways etc.), is creating a very unequal society at the limit of rupturing. There's no reason to think that going further into giving everything to the private sector will lead to a better outcome.       
Markets only thrives when there's a proper set of rules where they can safely produce positive outcomes for everyone.  
That's why I support Social-Democracy with a emphasis on strong individual liberties.

Bitcoin tends to have these cycles but on a much shorter time scale.  
I've been living through several of them and it's the same stuff every time ! But I feel like the hype is really bottoming and it's OK since it gives the devs some time to develop LN and other stuff.

My personal "feel" (entirely nontechnical) used to be 10K USD by 2020 (before the 2017 bull run). While I might not be wrong, I certainly didn't expect the price to go through 20K USD in between lol.

The coolest thing with Bitcoin is that it's a currency built for the internet and accessible to anyone. The online transfer capability is built-in.

BTC doesn't have to take over FIAT currencies. It's a counter-balance, a possibility of choice. Businesses will be able to choose if they want to hold or not and that's OK.

Visa levels of transactions do require 8GB, no way around that.  
If you really want everyone to use it daily you can't count on the growth looking like what we use to get before. It's just impossible. And no my math isn't wrong.  
The main ledger can scale to a certain extent but relying on the block size is risky (centralization, because nodes says fuck it it's too heavy to relay) and simply not enough. It's completely stifling the potential of Bitcoin. A block size increase is a *last resort* scaling plan.  
Seriously I don't how you guys plan to scale when it will go big, it's not possible you can't grow along graciously with adoption and trusting a linear growth prediction.  
As developers Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja wrote in their white paper on bitcoin payment channels:


  
What I can conclude is that BCH is hoping to either stay small enough or remaining principally a store of value long term so that blocks won't grow too fast for the technology to catch up...

Yep, even on a discord for video games where I'm a moderator people were discussing about it. It's definitely hurting BTC's image from what I've been reading.

So according to that logic, the richer you are the more reckless and selfish you will potentially be right ?  
Banks didn't act reckless because they were *sure* to have the government help in case of a collapse, they were feeling euphoric : so much money flowing in, the economy was still growing etc. All indicators on the green and absolutely no one to come and say that they were being extremely reckless.  
Same with Ver. He has a lot money and act recklessly and can potentially do some serious damage to people's savings in BTC who didn't even know about the civil war going on.  
Regulations are here to discourage reckless behaviors potentially harmful for everyone else. They might not be perfect but usually they're pretty effective. See regulations about protecting nature (national parks) for example.  
Ver wouldn't be able to do what he does if the crypto market was regulated (heavy manipulation).  
Welfare is here to cover basic needs just in case. Because life isn't always a "promenade in the park" isn't it ? Some external factors can push you down (sick parents that you need to take care of, loss of your job and so on...).

I'm using Coincheck because they are really easy to use and understand. They also have a decent volume (+ 80 000$/day). Parts of their website do no have English translation but it's mostly OK I think for non-japanese users.  
Kraken is a very good service but unfortunately they haven't been fighting enough to get the Japanese market so the volume is likely low.    
You can also check Zaif, lately they had a -0.1% fee meaning that they gave you money for trading. Old-school design but it seems to work. Japanese language only.  
If you can get a SBI bank account it's the best because coincheck is using it (free domestic wire + 0% fee trading = WIN).

You'll *always* have people trying to take power and force you to do stuff. Democracy is the closest we can get to a relatively good freedom. Taxes aren't theft, they are meant to be a redistributive mean to benefit everyone. People will always moan about it because they can't quantify how much it benefits them directly *and* indirectly. Libertarians only look for themselves, it's an extremely short sighted philosophy not capable to handle the challenges humanity is facing : climate change, market distortions and unbalance, inequality, food producing etc. It is also extremely inefficient to only rely on the market and hope that the magic will work, some day... It works in certain cases but not others.    
Another thing I've realized recently : public planning of cities. See, in areas regularly impacted by natural disasters, the state will force heavy regulations to try to mitigate the risks because if you let people doing what they want, such as deforesting (hello Haiti) or building in areas known for potential flooding etc. then everybody is screwed.  
Same for public beaches. People in Mauritius are actually angry at hotels buying beaches, restricting everyone's **freedom** to go to the beach and have a good time. Freedom is a complicated matter that need to take into account all the externalities. If I take the "freedom" to buy the beaches or even my own surf spot and forbid everyone to go in (helped by the minor government who will enforce property rights) then I actually impact everyone's freedom.  
I mean, I don't care about the state taking some money to have public swimming pools, good roads, good public schools etc. It's just what it is ffs, some papers meant to exchange stuff. If I have a good life, good social security/healthcare then I know that the community I'm living in, the state, will take care of me if the current capitalist system screw me up... And it can happen to anyone ! Sickness, business failure etc.

First you're contradicting yourself :  




Then you say that LN doesn't scale and require "really large payment channels". I will need more substance to that than just an affirmation.  
BTC didn't change anything to the "core protocol", it's only adding new way of transacting onchain at the moment. It's improving while BCH is only adjusting the block size.  
Also "many years" to reach VISA is incredibly vague.  
As A. Antonopoulos said, we will either be making the same mistakes as the internet or we can *try* to scale AND remain decentralized. It's difficult but possible, but BCH doesn't help at all.

Yes, the Deepwater Horizon disaster.  
From : 














This is usually what happens when you put profits before safety. It's a human tendency (greed usually makes you think about the short term) and if there's no regulation (or if you willingly violate it in order to make more money) this is the potential consequences.  
I'm also sure you're glad to travel in planes that have strict safety regulations.

Yes I do. Economies that are more neoliberal tend to react quickly to global economic changes. It goes both ways, as free market capitalism is a succession of booms and bursts. Except that the bursts can literally destroy lives. 
Jobs aren't leaving by the way, they're more and more precarious (gig economy, more and more freelancers, freeters etc.). This growth is fueled by cheap labor IN the US (and also veeery relaxed monetary policies like QE). But to me it's very weak, it doesn't have a good base at all.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:17:57
And what devs are trying to build is a trustless, decentralized way to scale partly outside the main chain (Lightning network will still use onchain transactions to settle channels).  
Because I've been discussing with BCH supporters that are realizing that scaling with the blocksize is unsustainable and they just tell me that Paypal-like companies will process everything off chain... I mean it's part of the solution but it's definitely not as exciting as the decentralized upgrades :/.

Well, what I do see is that there is quite a large majority that is agreeing that we will need to raise the block limit *sometimes* in the future. I don't think a lot of people are hardcore with the 1mb limit forever. We've got many ideas from the dev and many opinions. Now let's talk and find a compromise. If XT and 8mb block seems too much for a large part of people then we'll need to re-discuss it.  
The only problem I *could* see is some people with authority that could get manipulated.

You can mine Bytecoin, Monero (cryptonotes). Scrypt gpu-mining is also dead.  Check for coins with X11, X13, Scrypt-N or Jane algorithm maybe Quark.  
Know that you can also take a POS coin, just earning interests for holding coins in your wallet (Peercoin, CLAMS etc...). That's how you can earn Bitcoin (you exchange your alts after) with a normal computer nowadays.

You're basically saying that a monopoly that hasn't been achieved by force is OK. Describe one, that is private.  
The "consensus" style monopoly is a democratic government, this is the least force you can employ.  
But thank **you** for proving my point that libertarians have no problem with potential monopolies (as long as they are private, all is magic right ?). Even disagreeing with anti-trust laws.  
This is a simple example that government intervention is necessary to get close to the theorical functioning of free market capitalism (because there's also market socialism but it's another subject).

You're basically advocating keeping Bitcoin how it is (store of value) and moving it around off chain. I understand it perfectly but it's *not* what the BCH folks are trying to sell.  
Also it's still stifling the potential of Bitcoin. While Core have big projects on how to make it work as smooth as possible as day to day money, you're basically advocating keeping most of people's BTC and transactions off chain, which indeed recreate a Paypal 2.0 (to quote Ver...).  
And if I understand well, you're not arguing the fact that the BTC or BCH blockchain doesn't scale as is.

Normally on Coinbase and Circle, they are insured against hackers (if it's not the user's fault). 
Or download a wallet on your computer, encrypt it, put your bitcoins on it, do a back up on multiple USB keys. *Eventually* you can back it up on the cloud even though it should be avoided but if you want to, encrypt it in AES-256 with 7zip and setup a 2FA login on your cloud account. Note that it's also good to encrypt in AES-256 in case of  a USB backup.  
Paper wallets are good as well, but you'll need a safe at least because you can't encrypt your private key on it :p.

Google translate for you : "The above is the text of the law. A virtual currency is defined as a property value that can be used for purchasing or selling goods and services among the general public through the Internet. In short, it means that it was properly recognized as a means of payment. The point that is different from the electronic money and points that are currently powerful means of payment is that it can be exchanged for legal tender currencies such as yen and dollar."

    厳密に言うと仮想通貨は通貨ではありません。円やドルなどの法定通貨とは異なります。税や会計上の扱いは「資産」になります。

Your way to "increase individual freedom" doesn't take economic externalities into account as well as the protection of those who are potentially weaker and not adapted to the Capitalist competition. I also think that you'll give even more of an enormous power to corporations and people like Ver who are always trying to outplay the market (no rules = cheating allowed).  
Your philosophy is extremely simplistic and also fail to describe how humans react. I see a lot of libertarians denigrating sociology in favor of a pure scientific approach to the economy, which mean blindly believing in Austrian economics for you guys.

But you also know that it takes just a very few people to mess up everything. And the richer you are, the biggest mess you can cause.  
Very rich people are free of their choice, the thing is that they won't let other people do their own by hoarding and accumulating more.  
Money isn't everything, god knows I agree with that, but if you don't find a good balance between rewarding the success of people without making it unbalanced for the average Joe, the system collapse. And I'm not sure an anarcho-capitalist society would do better than what we have now. Government is just a part of the mess we are in, it's not the root of the problem.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:18:58
No one is coming with guns, it's a too simplistic analogy. People with 0 revenue almost don't pay anything and I'm glad that I have good public services. Almost everybody is contributing, we're a big community of more than a hundred million of people, it's logistically impossible to ask Bob if we could take a little bit of his revenue and convince him. Bob will have his say when he will go vote (and that include the local authorities who also have local taxes).  
You'd pay far more if all the public services were private as everyone would have to pay non-proportionally to their revenues, also battling against potential monopoly that aren't subject to competition (yes it's possible in a free market). In Norway if you're rich and have to pay a ticket for drunk driving, it will actually be calculated proportionally to your revenue : this is fair.  
To me, property isn't a "natural" right. Your property is first guaranteed to be enforced by the state itself, but your property is also *potentially* denying other people access to a certain area of the world, hence the payment to keep it.  
Also I'm pretty sure that a nice majority of people do not consider that taxation is theft since the libertarians have a hard time winning any election.

It's not only cloud mining, it's also good old mining with hardware, except if you are in very cheap electricity areas.  
Nevertheless, Hashflare doesn't seem to be dishonest. You get what you're promised to get for the price they're asking. The worst cloud mining operation are those who are intentionally lying and operating a Ponzi behind the curtains.  
Also I think HashFlare offer to choose between several pools, so if you can check that your mining hashrate is indeed directed to the chosen pool (for example, one that is signaling segwit), then it can buy you a stake in the current battle (correct me if I'm wrong).

I'm in Japan and since they've recognized Bitcoin as a method of payment, KYC rules for exchanges are becoming a lot stricter. I think it will be the strategy of a lot of governments.

When someone ask me if it's a good time to buy I have this answer :  
For how long you want to be invested ? If it's for the long term then you shouldn't care too much about getting in at 6K or 5K, this won't make much of a difference if you think it's going way higher. It it's indeed with that mind that you're buying, then the only eventual bad time to buy is during extreme FOMO as taking +70% loss over one year will get on your nerves but otherwise, be always prepared to take some losses. It takes patience.

Calling itself the "Real Bitcoin" instead of just saying "Ok we just disagree and we'll fork without trying to confuse people".  
It's like forking off Ubuntu 14 or whatever because you don't like the 15 version and saying "Guys, I've made the real Ubuntu because the original one is shit". Or "guys OpenOffice sucks since this version, I'm gonna make the real one called OpenOfficeUltimate". LibreOffice is a fork that did it well : outperforming OpenOffice but not trying to deceive people with a very close name.

@_date: 2018-03-21 10:24:54
Here is a good summary :  






All interactions in an unfettered free market, being voluntary, are by definition fair and equitable, because one side can always just walk away. Libertarians ignore the fact that most free market transactions are between entities of vastly unequal negotiating power; the wealthy, who seek greater profit but could live without the transaction, and the poor, whose only alternative in most cases is starvation, homelessness, sickness and death.
 &gt;**Government created prejudices between races, genders, religious groups, etc., and with government abolished such prejudices will become unenforceable.**
 &gt;This is backwards. Government does not create prejudice; it reflects the prejudices of the people it governs, or else it falls and is replaced by something else. In the absence of government individual prejudice and bigotry will not disappear; it will be fully unleashed to abuse and persecute any and all disliked minorities into submission, slavery, or extermination.






 &gt;Yeah. Right. Just as they do in Somalia. Just, incidentally, as they did in frontier America, when organized bands of people deliberately slaughtered their enemies and, more often than not, never suffered any penalty from the law or from their neighbors.


 &gt;Again, anyone with a basic education in either history or human nature should find this one failing the laugh test.


 &gt;Because, apparently, in the Libertarian utopia there are no such things as gangs, militias, cartels, organized crime, etc.


 &gt;This ignores two basic elements of economics: entry costs and economies of scale. In reality, the bigger and stronger a monopoly is, the LESS likely it is that competition will arise, because even if the competition somehow has the money to achieve the same economies of scale as the existing monopoly, the profits will be so much reduced by competition as to make the investment unattractive. Better, instead, to invest in the existing monopoly and get a share of the high profits and other benefits.


 &gt;This is the argument of privilege, of the haves who want to keep the have-nots in their place. Such people have no fear that they will lose out in a society without police, laws, etc. They are the Galts and Digbys and such. In the real world governments exist, and continue to exist, because the people being governed are willing to give up certain freedoms (the freedom to seek revenge, the freedom to take anything you want, the freedom to dump barrels of mercury into the river) in exchange for certain securities (security against being murdered, security against theft, secure clean drinking water and edible fish). Which leads to…


 &gt;This is the biggest Libertarian fantasy of them all. Government is nothing more than the means by which we enforce the rules by which human beings live together. Right now we, in the United States, have a government in which the general population has some, but not total, power to check and control the actions of our government (though with Trump’s election this is not guaranteed to remain the case). If this government were eliminated tomorrow at every level, in short order a new one would arise, either because groups of people demand securities for their lives and property or (much more likely) someone with a lot of power and no scruples sees an opportunity to rewrite the rules of society for his own benefit. Anarcho-capitalism is not, and never will be, a stable condition, because it is by definition unable to defend itself, either from a tyrant or from simple people who demand something more.


I also have countless examples of Libertarians going full fascists to preserve the world from Marxists (see r/enoughlibertarianspam).  
Libertarians usually put the free market economy before everything. Which is why Hayek was so close to Pinochet and why some businesses didn't have any problem doing biz with the Nazis (whoops Ford).

Mmmh the US spend much more than countries with Universal healthcare. I find very contradictory numbers [here]( [ and the graphic is here](  
Cuba is poor so it's highly likely that their free and universal coverage is maintaining the life expectancy pretty high.  
I'd be definitely afraid to go to a country where some people have to crowdfund their life saving surgery. But that's just my preference.  
Universal healthcare is affordable, I know a region in France that cover even more than the national system (that is in deficit), and they are actually in excess. It's Alsace-Lorraine. They probably are much more serious in running things over there.  
Here's another [take]( at Japan's healthcare system.  
Also, running healthcare on slight deficit doesn't bother me *at all* overall. It's money vs the health and life of the citizens and compromises in that area (and even worst, leaving it to the private sector) can be actually very detrimental to a country economy very long term.

I don't see the link with "terrible economics" but it's a common fallacious argument I encounter from libertarians or other believers into Austrian Economics.  
As I said, Austrian Economics can describe well how markets behave in ideal situations. They however, I think, fail to really have a good grasp on how it can work in reality and their eventual consequences, especially when it comes to market externalities such as pollution, or extreme income inequalities. At least that is what I think.  
And as you can read in my comments, I think Polanyi is getting really close to successfully describe how societies have been working (on the economic side of things) and how we can progress from here...

Prolonged bear markets need time to mature. Time tends heal the feeling that it has gone down so much from ATH. Once you get a relatively stable period, people will begin to believe that it's a good time to buy again (we're probably in this period right now). Then you need a catalyst to make things explode on the way up.  
All things considered, Bitcoin is doing well. Despite the recent gigantic FUD by mainstream medias about BTC using too much energy etc.  
I'm probably biased but I think it would need a catastrophic news/event to pull it way under the current price. The way is probably very slowly up from now on, notably based (like you said) on extremely strong fundamentals.

There needs to be a balance between individual liberty and the needs for the society to advance without badly intended individuals.

There is a big difference in advocating a monarchy based on heritage etc. And advocating for a more direct kind of democracy. Of course you could say "Let people create whatever the fuck they want, be it communist or right libertarian societies" but then it's recreating tribes and ending up with mini-states etc. It would just be a restart of some sort.  
Some individuals interests might always be at odds with what the "society" chose, but it's difficult to make everyone happy, even more without abandoning all the architecture of society and sinking into generalized violence.  
Your private property is -for example- guaranteed by the government (even though they could take it with violence, they can also protect it for you). No government = better get to buy these AKs.  
Some people will always want to take the power and some people will always follow them. That's just how it is. Look at Roger Ver and co. The imperfect solution we've found is a lot of counterbalance to a centralized power. A prime example is an independent justice system (of course it also can get corrupted, we see that everyday).

I disagree with you as I think that the market itself has been created by the "state" to form a market society, as Polanyi wrote. Some political decisions to intervene in the market are inherently just directing the way the economy needs to work for certain people. Neoliberals favor the wealthiest while Soc-Dem will favor the poor and the middle class. There's no state/market opposition, they work together and the market need the state to exist, at least to the scale we know of now.  
Modern Social-Democracy is at work in Northern Europe notably. While America is in a pure Neolib phase with Trump.

Front end is important but -to me- is more about usability than being nice to the eye, which should come after.  
The last company I was working for was putting the "nice to the eye" before usability.

Yes because you don't take any "credit" with it (or loan), you pay cash with a debit card, no risk for the bank/credit card company. The argument from the banks who are blocking purchase of Bitcoin is that some people were kind of "gambling" by using their credit card and paying the loan by reselling when btc is going up. Also, some people were using btc purchases to accumulate points/miles.

Do you think it will really work like that ? It's naive.  
Private entities aren't subject to democratic control and in the case of a libertarian society, they won't care about externalities such as pollution, safety (transports) or even outright screwing their customers. It is also potentially inefficient because you might build two bridges when not needed etc. Oh yes, the market might do its "magic" and adjust, but often way after bad things happened.  
Public services that function well provide an access to everyone, they're often more regulated and obey strictly to labor laws but are constantly attacked by people like you because they occupy something that you could grab and exploit with a "business".  
We can't let the market to decide for everything.

Very close ideologies. Minarchism is just extreme neoliberalism. Minimal state, leave everything to the market with very little regulation. Would end up in a highly predatory capitalism and externalities riddled markets.  
I'm for public utilities, public education, national healthcare and more democratic control with local councils so I do not agree with libertarianism. There's things that you *do not* leave to the market.  
Believe me I've been studying libertarianism for a while and also probably dug deeper than most people to find on the fringe political ideologies/movements (post-left Anarchism, situationism, council communism etc.). So while I might not be an expert on the movement, I've concluded that libertarianism, while interesting on a philosophical point (to refute, notably) is used to push corporations agenda (slashing regulations and hinder workers' right to profit more, short term) and are useful idiots for the right-wing (as most libertarians will vote Republican).  
This is also why they're only relevant in the U.S as it is considered "not serious" by Europeans.

Individuals that forms a state (yes you're a member of it). The state will guarantee that your property is yours, that you have a money recognized by everyone and that you don't interfere wrongly within the market. Isn't it interesting ? The state is required for the market to work as close as possible to what we call a "self regulated market". As Polanyi states, a self regulated market is only possible (or a form of it) because we gave it rules to make it work as a integral part of society. The second we abandon these rules, the market would crumble as it is not adapted to a good function of society.  
So I think that your definition of a free market is simplistic, flawed. But that's just my opinion after getting into studying many economic theories. While I think that Austrian Economists are useful to describe certain mechanism of market economies, their prescriptions usually causes extreme income inequalities because they do not integrate the market function into the whole society. They naively consider every individual to be greedy for example.  
Polanyi is even saying that market societies can bring progress and freedom on the condition that it's done well, and that includes the state. He also strongly urges to include economic studies with sociology and anthropology and I can't agree more.

It's for citizens of countries with very weak passports or economic embargo. Very few citizens from Western countries or other countries with decent visa free travels will consider it. Or maybe just as a "backup" in case of bad things happening in their country of origin.  
Antigua is right below St. Kitts (Ver's refuge) at the 22nd place on the passport strength.   
These Caribbean countries benefit from belonging to the Commonwealth, but they're often threading a thin line to keep a decently strong passport to attract people to buy it. St. Kitts notably got flagged in Canada I think (not visa free anymore).

First I'm not American. I don't support Bernie.


Do you really think Bitcoin will replace everything ? Naive.  


No it doesn't work at all. Precarious jobs everywhere, student debts. It's not because it works for YOU that it does for everyone. Even the IMF now is saying that we fucked up.  


Your point of view is far from being unanimous. It's a combination of regulation and deregulation that ended like that. Banks and capitalist will make money without considering externalities and YOU say that we can't blame them, but the government (who is far from perfect). Hence, bankers are your friends and thank you a lot.  
May I remind you that Iceland have been putting bankers in prison. They have been judged by their Justice system.  
Seriously though, poor bankers who were just doing their job of pumping money through loans. Bad government !  


Yes it's a high rate of unionization. Close to 70%. Oh unions are bad right ? I'll wait. Unions negotiate everything there. See, a collaborative, high taxes based society is succesful OMG !  


So you're agreeing to be a corporate puppet. OK thanks !  
Karl Polanyi was a complete idiot as well.  




Karl Polanyi  
Your "free" market and property is actually enforced by the (neoliberal) government. Therefore, you're one of their allies.
Venezuela is corrupt and a country that has an economy entirely based on Oil. It's not "socialism" that caused it. Actually they were neoliberal before and had inflation problems already.  
And if you try to put Venezuela as a childish argument again bad bad socialism, I'll just leave Somalia there.

Core devs even briefly "agreed" (I think it was notably Adam Back) to change the size to 2mb because Ver, supported by the "business" community (including Coinbase etc.) was already pushing hard. But then they came up with SegWit and said that since they'd come up with a solution that *only* requires a soft-fork (much safer), they'd go down this road.  
Ver didn't accept (he wanted power over bitcoin development because he's very very rich) and raged more and accused Core of being in bed with Blockstream to take control of BTC blabla, which is tinfoil hat levels of conspiracy theory.  
In other words, the "biz" side don't understand the dangers of making quick upgrades, hard forks etc. The "devs" side is trying to efficiently maintain a billion USD network that could crumble should any mistake be made, despite the lies and the negative marketing campaign being spread with Ver's deep pockets.

@_date: 2018-07-05 17:19:52
 are the benefits of basic income?
* **Eliminates the "unemployment trap".** Under current systems, when someone gets a job they lose most of their welfare payments. This means they can go from not working at all to working a full week without significantly increasing their income. This is a disincentive to work. Under basic income, when people got a job they would retain the same basic income payment, with their salary added to it, so the disincentive no longer exists.
* **Reduces government bureaucracy.** A lot of government workers are required to ensure that welfare recipients are not claiming their benefits fraudulently, and to administer the complicated system of welfare payments and tax credits. The increased need for personal tax advisers also sucks skilled workers out of the productive sector. A basic income would hugely simplify the welfare system by replacing most of these bureaucracies, which would reduce its administrative cost significantly.
* **Clarifies the tax code.** Taxes are way too complicated, and everything we can do to simplify them would be --all things equal-- a net gain in the value of human society. A basic income, coupled with a flat tax, is capable of mimicking all aspects of our current progressive (bracketed) taxation scheme, but without brackets. Everyone will, at the start of each year, know precisely what their taxes will look like; "predicting what tax bracket you'll be in" will no longer be necessary. All marginal tax rates will be identical, while the basic income ensures that net-taxes follow a progressive-tax structure. Also: a basic income, in the form of a "basic deduction", can replace and improve upon the "standard deduction" used by the IRS, which itself is problematic.
* **Greatly reduces fraud/waste/abuse.** When welfare subsidies are contingent on conditions like employment, income level, number of hours worked, family status, etc, there are opportunities to game the system, either by illegally lying (fraud) or by simply obeying the economic incentives put in front of you (waste/abuse). These cause losses of real economic value, which are paid for by every taxpayer. Removing this incentive structure allows confidence in the welfare system's ability to reach people exactly as intended.
* **Guarantees a minimum living standard.** Though it's subjective/politicized, people may be entitled to a certain basic standard of living, regardless of whether they are momentarily able to participate in the labor market. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 25,  states, "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control." ([United Nations, (UN)](
* **Lowers need for government regulations on the labor market.** Policies such as the minimum wage will become less necessary with the basic income, as people will already get enough money to live on from the basic income. And negotiating power for workers will increase. This will allow the government to remove some of the regulations on the labor market, creating a freer market and providing benefits for both employers and employees.
* **Reduces Gentrification.** When only the residents of an area receive that area's Basic Income, housing and consumer goods prices are thus inflated, making it hard for other social groups to swoop in with a bunch of money and inadvertently pick apart the community. The BI gives a relative advantage to established residents, thus protecting the community structure.
* **Reduces the gender "pay gap."** Women, on average, make less money than men, and debaters of this issue fall into two camps: (1) those who want to reduce that gap to help women achieve financial freedom, and (2) those who want to prevent the harmful effects of government pay-mandates and micromanagement. Basic Income is capable of satisfying both camps by giving all citizens a base income, making women (and *people* in general) less dependent on their work-income. And it does so without removing any of the beneficial capitalistic incentives to work and provide value. Furthermore, the gender pay gap is reduced for precisely those women who most need it: low-income women. It makes them less dependent on a potentially abusive spouse and less sensitive to pregnancy-based work issues, without unjustly interfering with the market's ability to set salaries for upper and middle class workers.
* **Improves mental health and security.** Mental health is one of the largest public health problems in most developed countries. The knowledge that the basic income will ensure a basic standard of living in any circumstances will provide a sense of mental security, especially when the economy is performing poorly. The removal of various dehumanising tests and stigmatisation of anyone who receives welfare payments will also serve to improve mental health. There is also evidence that [poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity]( comparable to a loss of 13 IQ points, or chronic alcoholicism as compared to sobriety. A basic income would remove this cognitive impairment.
* **Increases physical health.** The rising cost of health care is a cause of great long-term concern, and basic income could lower this cost. In the Dauphin, Manitoba pilot experiment in Canada, an [8.5% reduction in hospitalization]( was found to be a direct result of the minimum income. This was attributed to the reduction in workplace injuries and family violence resulting from the rise in incomes.
* **Simplifies implementation of progressive taxation.** There's no need for "tax brackets" having different tax rates when people receive a basic income, since the BI effectively causes the same tax rate structure, only requiring two numbers to be chosen: the value of the BI allowance, and the flat tax rate. With less thresholds and tax rates to play around with, taxation becomes less politicized and less used as a weapon of class warfare. This also simplifies your IRS paperwork and makes the tax structure smoother and thus non-susceptible to income-shifting.  
* **Redistributes money from capital to labor.** Even if technology doesn't lead to high unemployment, it may well lead to lower wages and greater inequality. Capital - equipment and machinery that helps to produce things - is now creating a greater share of output compared to labour - human workers. This allows business owners, who own the capital, to pay workers the same or less while more is produced, so they make more profit for themselves. [We are already seeing that output per worker is increasing, while workers' wages are not.]( In the long term, this will mean that business owners make more and more money, while those who don't own capital will make less and less. Basic income alleviates this by taxing the rich (who will probably own capital) and giving money to the poor (who probably won't), even if they can't find a job.
* **Increases number of small businesses.** Many people may currently be discouraged from leaving their job to start their own business, as if the venture fails they will have no source of income. The basic income would provide income to these people, so more people would feel able to start businesses, which could only increase innovation and competition in the economy. Evidence of this effect can be found in the Namibia basic income experiment, where those receiving it showed increased entrepreneurship with a [29% increase in average earned income, excluding the basic income](
* **Increases charitable work and academic research.** Much work in the charitable sector and other vocations (e.g. open-source programming, academia, or the arts) is socially beneficial but not profitable, so people have to do it in their spare time, along with a traditional job. A basic income would allow these people to spend more time on work that is socially beneficial but unprofitable for the individual.
* **Increases number of people in jobs they enjoy.** As people will not be forced to take on a job, they will be more able to find a job that they enjoy (or that pays well enough to offset their lack of enjoyment). Having people in jobs that suit them better will help to improve mental health, as well as leading to an improved quality of goods and services.
* **Gives financial independence to all adults.** Every adult will be entitled to the basic income independently of any other people. This means they cannot be controlled or manipulated by someone through control of their finances, [allowing people in abusive relationships to escape them more easily](
* **Prevents generational theft.** Most western countries already provide basic income to people of retired age.  But, if a nation or its socialized retirement program goes bankrupt, or the socialized retirement program otherwise becomes unaffordable, in 20 or 30 years (due to fiscal mismanagement or simple birth rate demographics) then it is to the great advantage of current benefit recipients, and at the total cost to those who pay into the benefits today with the false promise of receiving them in the future.  If entitlements are unaffordable/unsustainable, then the only fair solution is to provide the funds equally today.
  
I'm sorry if this is too difficult to understand.

Getting educated about the "blockchain" will probably tell you that you can't scale based solely on the blocksize but whatever... It also won't tell you about the true intentions of someone who has no problem with "insider trading" and is trying to deceive people by calling a fork the "real Bitcoin".  
You can fork all you want, just don't try to deceive people. It's because they perfectly know that Bcash have nothing to show that they're attacking directly Bitcoin, who has a lot more in its future in terms of technology and scaling plans.

Right wing libertarians are extreme capitalists and act in order to promote the interests of private entities such as the Koch Brothers. The defense of freedom you advocate is complete non-sense as it doesn't account the struggle of minorities, the struggle of workers that are exploited everyday, market externalities such as pollution etc.

You like to perfectly nitpick what you call "socialist countries" to try to paint a bad picture of anything that would go against free market policies. Unfortunately the world is much more complicated than that. 
Let's take Bolivia, who has had one one the highest GDP growth in LatAm for a decade... Under a leftist government. 
Ecuador, under Correa was also doing pretty well until they got struck by a terrible earthquake. 




  
You also perfectly know that the US despise these governments, and I wouldn't be surprised to discover that they're behind a lot of leftists LatAm demises (at least partly). I have no source on that though, but considering the History of pro-capitalist activities from the US in this region, we can seriously doubt they don't have anything to do with it.  
Also it's considered a "fact" that after the Chicago Boys were out, social policies actually cemented Chile's growth. Yes because an economy without state intervention is also an economy that does not take care of its lower classes, it's a given. 


  
From what I could globally see, it's that fast ways to "hard" Socialism like what Allende and Chavez did is extremely risky and is very difficult to handle as you anger a lot of people while not always knowing what to do with the means of production. Add to that a negative stance from the US, an economy dependent on exports on one or two things (oil for Venezuela and Copper for Chile) and you indeed get a recipe for disaster. Nevertheless, it does not mean that any leftist measure is bad. You can always see a truly positive growth of general well being in the majority of the population. The problem is when the government spending go over the board, swimming in money first without seeing the looming disaster.

You can setup your node to signal segwit (but I think you need to open ports on your modem for people to see it) but it won't really matter or at least not as much as mining (which is another thing). The problem is that to make any significant contribution you need very expensive hardware. Maybe you can rent an ASIC online but it will cost you money.  
There's also UASF which is not dependent on the hashrate. You can search about it and decide or not to signal it.

Yeah I think that the Bitcoin Android Wallet is simple enough to get started. There is also a help section to back it up. You can also setup a pin code to spend. It's a good compromise I think.  
Don't do it on a rooted phone though.

Pew Research uses data from the U.S. labor of statistics.  
Also wow, a progress of 30 USD of the *median* wage. Not excluding top earners ? Let me laugh at it.  
Here's a graph showing it's been mostly flat for low incomes   
But keep living in your world of fantasies were people are paid well and everyone is happy :D.

It would work the same way as the current system with cash. Charge the card at the station or a convenience store (limited to up to 20 000 JPY) and pay your coffee with it. It's instant and quicker than payment by credit card (non NFC).  
The cards were originally for trains but it has been adopted everywhere.  
You can't store your lifesavings on it anyway and you'll be able to use their very fast network. Some people might like it.

I've been watching the ponzi industry for quite a while in the crypto scene. They lie and promise huge returns, which is making profits on gullible and uninformed people despite people like me warning them. Scams feed on the uninformed, that's a fact and a consequence of the free and unregulated market, that's why IMHO the free market isn't a solution to everything.  
ICOs are like gold for scammers. Hyped, unregulated and thousands of people pouring money into it based on promises.

Live on the cheap (with your family or in a cheap area). Cash out a little for your expenses. You're extremely well placed for a moderate rise of Bitcoin in the next 5 years (10K USD).  
You could consider getting a reasonable apartment to rent out to cover a part of your expenses.

It's not the case everywhere. I'm in Japan and it's progressing but we still don't have much stuff that we can pay in BTC. Hopefully convenience stores and supermarkets will get onboard soon.  
Also I will travel to Bali soon and there only a few shops taking it and BTMs are only one way (only buying btc).  
So yeah... Sometimes I'm considering a Bitcoin VISA card.
@_date: 2018-12-23 09:50:26
Yep, that's what Karl Polanyi also found out.  
It's kind of funny, for the market to be "free" (or work like in the theory) we actually need a framework to solve potential bad externalities. Otherwise the lack of a framework would make it collapse very quickly.

It's just better to directly buy but some websites deliver what they're promising without any shady structure. Scam is a bit of a strong word here. Probably unprofitable is a better fit IMHO.  
Also, if the website is providing a proof of your hashing and enables you to choose a pool, it can be used to support Segwit for example.  
I'm not talking about websites that are outright lying and operating Ponzis.
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:49:14
Oh yes, because CEOs of bigger companies take a lot of risks /s.  
When you take profits, you directly take the work value from your workers because you simply own the business. It's easy math.  
Your employer rent you and expect you to make *him* money. You're just an investment.  
It's all about balance though. Nowadays the balance is hugely in favor of owners for the most part and that's not OK.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:40:57
No there's no website as simple as what circle used to be. Some websites might offer to add your card after adding your account and completed the usual KYC stuff. Cex.io does it. Coinbase also (but they are having problems lately it seems).  
The best solution is to choose a good exchange available in your area, do a domestic bank transfer and buy btc. Just renew your ID.

Check how ETH was in the early days. It was a command line and a lot of promise. Then came the DAO fiasco and the hard fork. It's difficult to keep trust in it but good for those who made money with it :).  
Bitcoin is more mature and at that time at least it was much easier to handle it (many different wallets and use cases).  
I know that ETH now have more accessible wallets and other stuff. But I'm still skeptical.

Oh I'm pretty sure some are appreciating the perks coming with living in Europe or even Japan (regulated and socialized healthcare notably).  


You're describing totalitarian autocracies more than Socialist countries. You know that it's a very broad word right (socialism) ? Including Social-Democracy to left wing Anarchists.   
As to compare to a third world "Socialist" country, I could talk about Sri Lanka (officially called "Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka". Of course it's not perfect but they had very nice roads paid by the state. So at least it was very easy to drive around. I also think their healthcare is socialized and almost free. Not bad.  
I could see myself moving there if they solve their ethnic problems (fighting between the majority aka Singhalese and minorities).  
For this new year I'll visit Da Nang in Vietnam. Looks like a nice city !

I don't know man. European countries spending 12% of their GDP to healthcare while the US are at 17% seeing some of their citizens going to Cuba to get decent healthcare.  
Public debt is an entirely other subject and is much more complicated than throwing it at us "filthy statists" when we tell you that it's not so bad to pay taxes like adults who are OK with helping each others.  
It doesn't mean that the state can't be dysfunctional, it just means that pointing at it for all our problems is foolish. Ron Paul is just capitalizing on this strawman type of argument.  
Denmark which is arguably one the of most social-democratic country you could find is at around 40% of public debt (as of % of GDP).

Also you can live long term without any justification ("Business" visa that cost 300 USD/year).  
You can live on the cheap for 1000 USD/month (as stated in the article). By my math, if he only lives on his current stash, he can go for 27 years like that. Of course it's very rough calculation but that's what you could do.

Inequality is inherent to Capitalism. You can't go around it.  
In order to earn money you need to exploit and spoil employees of the true value of their work.  
I also consider wage work a new form of slavery as a lot of people do not have much choice.  
I think libertarians are choosing the wrong fight and are just puppets for the wealthy (Koch Brothers etc.). 
That's just my opinion, so don't feel attacked or anything.
