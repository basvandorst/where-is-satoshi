Everyone that has been jealous and wanting to call this a bubble has gotten their chance these past few days. The price will hit all time highs next and they'll crawl back into bubble prophesizing

Thomas Lee always ignores the FUD and tells the truth, he's made some really good calls in the stock market.

My only criticism would be that choosing apple and Amazon as examples of the 2000 bubble is a little biased. Take a look at the highest 15 companies by market cap in 2000 and look at a chart of that, it's not pretty. Only Microsoft and some others have risen above their all time highs

With that said, a quick look at total nasdaq market cap in 2000 (6.6 trillion) to US GDP in 2000 (36 trillion). 
Vs 
Total market cap of cryptocurrencies of .6 trillion to world GDP of 78 trillion.

Do I need a computer or anything to hook it up, or can I install the program on it then just plug it into the wall? Sorry for the noob questions

Wow, I often think about what I would do in this situation, so I'll let you know how I would allocate that 1.8M. 
Unless you're going for billions and carrying on your life as it is now, it's not a bad idea to sell some of those bitcoins (no one has ever lost money taking profits). 
Diversification is key, and here is a breakdown of how I would split it up, personally:
1. Sell 33% - $594,000
2. Calculate the max amount you can put towards your mortgage this year and pay half or all of that 
3. Take half of the $594,000 (~$300,000) and get a decent financial advisor, and invest accordingly to your age, most likely 70% aggressively and 30% conservatively
4.  This should leave you with $200K or less, I personally would buy investment property or a chain business (tim Hortons, pizza pizza, etc)
5. Alternatively, stow away that $200K as well, and have a total $500K keep-safe in case your wife doesn't want to work or you want to make another big purchase
6. By keeping the 66% in bitcoin you allow yourself a comfortable cushion for living expenses with the other 33%, and also take advantage of a great buy-in price
Well done on the timing and enjoy the gains

This may be a naive question, but can anyone explain how the Bitcoin blockchain will continue to operate after all of the coins have been mined?
I know that it will take a while for all of the coins to be mined, but if the blockchain is in operation because of the miners that operate each node, how will the blockchain operate once all of the coins have been mined and miners have no further incentive to mine?

Ahh, got it. Thank you
