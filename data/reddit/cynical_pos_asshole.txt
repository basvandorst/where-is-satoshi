Buy low, sell high.

What a well-thought-out and researched retort.

I don't know anyone who would consider $7000 a shitty bonus...

Bought at $7444... kill me.
Luckily it was only .0777777 BTC, so my loss atm is only ~$70.  I'll just wait.  I'm just hoping it gets back to the upper $7000s so I can break even.
Definitely dropping another $200-$300 at the bottom of this dip.

Yeah I bought .0777777 when the price was $7444 thinking it's gonna go back up. Now I'm just hoping it hits 7500 steadily so I can break even.

Yeah, but luckily I only invested money I didn't "need."  So if my $600 sits in bitcoin for several months, I won't mind if it ends up back at $8000/BTC.

Except I can buy food, water, shelter, and clothing with FIAT.  It's also used by hundreds of millions and its value is based on factors of the US economy.
The only value BTC holds is its popularity.  Honestly, what do you have if you have a BTC, but it wasn't popular at all?  You've got a string of letters and numbers and that's it.  You'll say FIAT is just a green, rectangular piece of cloth, but hundreds of millions of people want that piece of cloth because they can immediately use it with ease to acquire things.  BTC is not the same and it really looks like a bubble.

Yes, but that's not equivalent to it being "pretty shitty."

Yep, you're right.  [Gifts from employers are not tax exempt.](

Just guesswork, same as everyone else.

I do think it's fair.  


It doesn't matter that the dollar is "popular."  It matters that a government body has created an infrastructure--using that same currency--that accepts the dollar for goods.  It's impossible for the dollar to not be popular because the entire US uses it.  The point stands that there is a 200-year history, 50 states, 300 million people, a government body, and millions of stores/shops/retailers that make the dollar what it is.  Bitcoin has none of this backing it, thus it's value is almost entirely in its popularity.
