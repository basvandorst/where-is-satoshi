Yeah, that would be the obvious next step - but that step is really a giant leap, and not one I expect to see unless the usd collapses.

You can't simply say 'one bitcoin equals one car' and assume that this will always be true in the future, because no company prices cars in bitcoin. Instead, the price is set in USD and then you can determine how many bitcoin you need to pay (remember that 1,000-bitcoin pizza?). Until prices are set in bitcoin, then its value compared to other currencies will always matter.

I just can't imagine having so many outsiders suddenly investing in Bitcoin in a single week.  It boggles the mind - it would be an outpouring of money not seen before in human history.  I mean, the market cap of Bitcoin is right now $4.8 billion.  To get the price from $357 to $10,000 would require an influx of another $129 billion within 7 days.  That's a steep order, even if powerful corporations decided to get in on it.

I agree with this comment. By tipping everyone who comments - sure, it feels good to get a tip, but it doesn't reinforce the behavior you want to see. I'd rather see someone get a large tip for an insightful comment than everybody in a thread get a small one just because they were there.

I think it's natural to hate anything that has passionate fans. Bitcoin has so many ardent supporters, including many who seem arrogant or naive - and who expect everyone else to be just as passionate about it. If that's your first experience with bitcoin, it's going to leave a bad taste in your mouth. 
I think for bitcoin to be truly successful, it needs to reach a point where people don't think of it as anything special. Once it becomes normal, it has won.

I don't see any disconnect worth those two beliefs. You can support the dollar but dislike black Friday sales - just as you could support any currency and oppose shopping at Walmart due to the way they treat employees, or refuse to spend money at chick-fil-a because you dislike their policies on gays, or because you think people deserve a day off with their families on Thanksgiving. 
I have to admit I'm pretty disgusted by all the consumerism shown on black Friday, and I wish it wasn't creeping into my country. At least it isn't associated with Thanksgiving here!

He gets the money by following the link provided by the bot.  It will allow you to send the bitcoins to an electronic 'wallet' you provide.  You can then hold on to your bitcoins, use them to purchase goods at a number of retailers, use them to tip other redditors, or just convert them into your local currency by selling them to other bitcoin users.  
I'm not entirely sure how the bot works, but it does.

An 8% effective tax rate is phenomenal! I take it you live in a state without sales taxes? I'm not sure what my effective tax rate is, but I'm pretty sure it's around 25%. Although like you say, I do get some tax breaks for retirement, so I should really sit down and look at it sometime. 
I agree with you about the common perception of tax refunds. They're not a free gift, they're an interest free loan to the government. I sometimes see young people who don't bother to file their taxes because they figure they earned too little to owe anything and I have to tell them they're losing money by doing it.
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:27:32
The UK (and Canada, Australia, South Korea, and new Zealand) have a lower average tax burden as well, according to the tax foundation (although that is not entirely true when looking at married couples, where the UK, Australia and South Korea are higher than the US). 
Being fair, this is showing the tax rate at the average income, and incomes in the US are higher on average than the other counties mentioned, so you could still be better off financially.
@_date: 2016-12-04 12:49:21
You can! But first you need to round up that currency. Unless you're talking about outright state-sanctioned robbery, you're going to have to raise government revenues dramatically... In a country where people are starving.  And meanwhile, the government still needs to pay its own bills... And prices have already risen. Deflation can be a bigger problem than inflation! 
@_date: 2016-12-04 12:46:03
Venezuela has oil. That's actually the problem! The government relied on oil revenues to introduce a ton of programs that reduced poverty dramatically, creating a welfare state. Then the price of oil dropped dramatically and the cost of maintaining the programs did not. The government either had to cut costs or find a way to make money... They printed money... This led to hyperinflation. 
I mean, it's way more complex than that. But they weren't trying to take on the USA or anything, they just dealt with a windfall badly and then doubled down on it when they were losing.

Not sure why you're being downvoted, you're right. Deflation is a huge killer. 
"I want to buy a new ipod... But if I wait a month, it'll be cheaper. And if I wait two months, it'll be even cheaper. Heck, only a sucker would spend his money now!"  
Plus, of course, that companies will be under pressure to lower prices as the value of money goes up, and their primary cost is labor - so they will need to lower wages. People resist that, so you'll see lots of labor unrest, strikes, unemployment (exacerbated by consumers hoarding money) and shortages of cash and a lack of easy loans, especially if the population is growing. 
Deflation is bad, people. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 12:30:27
They can and do destroy money all the time (your 'unprinting it'). But they need to own the money they're destroying. That could be via taxation or some other means, but it wouldn't be easy or painless. 
One way to do it without owning the money is to print new money and then declare a conversion rate between the old, inflated money and the new one. People then have a chance to take their old currency to the back and get the new one in exchange. This is sometimes used to try and end hyperinflation, but it's a sign of desperation (and, of course, doesn't mean the money you hold is worth any more). 
Another way to try and deflate a currency is to impose price controls - e.g. 'bread can no longer be sold for more than $5 per loaf'. This causes all kinds of problems!  The cost of doing business is often higher than this price, so companies may shut down or find ways to reduce prices, like making smaller loaves. Often supplies of legal goods become scarce, while a black market emerges which has 'real' prices. 
Unfortunately, once hyperinflation begins, it's very, very hard to undo it.

...Wait, no they don't.  If you hold onto grapes for a few weeks, you have dried up grapes.  You could conceivably turn them into raisins, but even so, if someone asks you for some grapes, they're not going to accept either from you - they want fresh grapes.  
In comparison, a dollar bill doesn't "go bad" if you hide it in your mattress and don't touch it for fifty years.  At the end of that time, you can still bring it out and exchange it for a dollar's worth of goods.  That's what they mean by 'holding value'.  
I mean, sure, bitcoin has some issues with being a currency, but it's hardly the same thing as grapes.  It might be closer to, say, a store currency (like Canadian Tire money, if you're Canadian).  Something that holds value, is easily transferred from person to person, but which is accepted only at a small number of places.

It's mostly owed to its own citizens in the form of treasury bonds, so you'd have millions of retired pensioners suddenly losing everything, and lots of ordinary people losing their kids college fund. Foreign countries would also not be happy - they could either raise tariffs to make up for the loss, which would hurt exports, or they could just take the hit. Either way, they'd be less likely to loan money again when the US needed it and more likely to consider other reserve currencies in the future, which would really hurt the US's soft power.

Not really. Unless you're financially independent already, you've got to have a paycheck coming in from a company. Even if that company is willing to pay you in bitcoins, they earn *their* money in dollars and purchase from suppliers who demand dollars. At some point, you're connected to the dollar economy. If it falls apart, bitcoins only insulate you from having your savings seized or inflation wipe out their value. It does little to protect you from unemployment, your pension or investments being devalued, or your real estate losing value. 
If society gets to the point in which the majority of the population used bitcoin for a majority of their financial needs, forget this post.

The president, von Hindenburg, appointed Hitler. By 1933 the Nazis, while not having a majority, had a plurality, and the government felt that by inviting Hitler into power under their terms, they could control him. 
Then Hindenburg died, and according to the rules of succession, Hitler became the new leader. He then took advantage of and/or orchestrated the burning of the Reichstag (parliament building) by a communist, and used it as a pretext to outlaw communism, then all other parties. By 1935, Germany was a dictatorship.

Well, for the fledging United States in 1780, it was to pay off the national debt and to maintain an army so that Britain would not think to invade them.
Today, taxation provides services which either are public goods (i.e. there is no reasonable way to get private individuals to pay for them since they are not individually affected, but benefit collectively, e.g. national defence, health inspections, regulations of industry, police protection, fire and ambulance services, road maintenance, etc.) or are in areas which that country's citizens have agreed is important to provide to all citizens at a fair or subsidized price (e.g. depending on the nation: health insurance, auto insurance, electricity, water, sewage, education, etc.).  
All in all, I find that I get good value for my tax dollars.  Again, though, that may depend on your experience.  I grew up in a relatively affluent country, but was not from a wealthy family, so I had a net benefit from taxes while young.  Now that I'm making more than average income for my country, my taxes are higher than I'd like, but I'm still happy to pay them.  
@_date: 2013-05-25 10:48:19
No country on earth so spends the majority of its taxes on the military, or even close. In the u.s., for example, defense is only 14 percent of total government spending, making it more likely that an Americans tax dollars are supporting health care (19 percent) or pensions (18 percent). This trend only gets stronger with other industrialized nations.

Oh, I think I've figured out why you're so angry... I think we've been speakingp at cross purposes. May I try again? 
The original u.s. Constitution was the Articles of Confederation. This constitution gave the federal government virtually no powers of taxation, which meant that the government not only couldn't pay back it's debt from the war, they couldn't pay some of the revolutionary war veterans their back pay. This, along with other problems, led to Shays rebellion, as well as the u.s. Discarding their original constitution and adopting the one you have now (less the various amendments). 
This constitution allowed the government to collect taxes, although specifically not poll taxes. That still left lots of possibilities... Land taxes, tariffs on imports, sales taxes, and more. 
Interesting story: when the u.s. Won the revolution, they had a massive (for the time) debt from it... Mostly owed to their own people, who had bought bonds. The founding fathers disagreed over whether they should pay these back at all, or at pennies to the dollar, or at full value. Hamilton and Jefferson were on opposing sides in this argument. Jefferson was afraid that it would make the rich richer... Because rich people had bought the bonds from poor people who were afraid that they wouldn't be honored, so sold them at a step discount. Hamilton wanted to honor the art full price, because many of his friends had invested in them. Hamilton won out. 
(yes, that last story certainly suggests governments aren't spending tax money wisely, but it's a very cool story that most people don't know)

One of the things the two-party first-past-the-post U.S. electoral system is good at is getting majorities for the winners.  More elections have had more than 50% for the winner than haven't.  The exceptions, of course, make good press, so we hear about them a lot.
So, for example, in 2012, Obama won 51.1% of the vote.  In 2008 he won 52.9%.  In 2004 Bush won 50.7%, while in 2000 he won only 47.9% (but his opponent won only 48.4%).  In 1996 Clinton won 49.2%, but it was a three-way race and his second-place rival won only 40.7% of the vote.  In 1992 Clinton won 43% of the vote, versus 37.5% for his nearest rival.  In 1988 Bush, Sr. won 53.4% of the vote.  In 1984 Reagan won 58.8% of the vote - a record, I think - while in 1980 he won 50.8%.  In 1976 Carter won 50.1% of the vote.  Before that I wasn't born, so I'll pick that as my arbitrary date to stop looking it up.  
In other words, in the last 10 elections, the winner won a plurality but not a majority only three times, and in two of those cases it was because of a popular third party.  
In comparison, in Canada, which has the same first-past-the-post system as the USA but has four or five major political parties, the winning party has only rarely won 50% or more of the vote.  
@_date: 2013-05-25 20:48:03

Historically, when someone waits for citizens to give what the state needs voluntarily to benefit everyone, it fails.  Thus, the state needs to impose taxation on its citizens for their own benefit.  Case in point: In some U.S. states, timber payments keep property taxes low, or they used to. When that ended, not everybody was willing to raise taxes. In Josephine County, Oregon, the county of 84,000 people was forced to lay off 20 of its 24 police officers due to lack of funding. As a result, 911 service in the county is now offered between 8 am and 4 pm on weekdays only.
Just to help that sink in, when a young woman called 911 at 4 am on a Saturday morning to explain that her abusive ex was breaking into the house to rape and beat her, she was told there were no police officers who could respond. The 911 operator helpfully suggested "asking him to go away" and "hiding in the house." He eventually found her.
Horrified by crimes like this, the residents of the county held a (second) referendum to raise property taxes - currently one-ninth of what I pay, and the lowest in Oregon - to cover re-hiring the police. With 51% voter turnout, the tax levy was defeated, 13,366 to 12,827.
Whether or not the agent who collects and spends those taxes is moral or wise is another story - a political issue.  In a healthy democracy, though, you can throw out the more corrupt politicians and go with the will of the citizenry.  Whether or not you live in a healthy democracy may be another story, but, as Winston Churchill said, "democracy is the worst form of government there is, except for all the others we've tried."  (Quoted from memory, so may be slightly off).

Sorry, one question - what does 'fit' stand for?

Yes. And then the fledging Republic nearly collapsed, and had to write a new constitution and put down revolts because it was untenable. Happened very quickly. Taxation just doesn't work as a voluntary levy.

I can see why they did that - it's just good business sense, even if it's not particularly nice.
PayPal sees BitCoin as a direct competitor.  Both are online ways to pay for purchases, but PayPal takes a cut of the proceeds and works through banks and credit cards.  BitCoin doesn't.  BitCoin has no real fees, so it's going to be more attractive to retailers.  
In effect, it would be like your cable TV channel having commercials for Netflix.  They may make money by having the commercial, but they'll lose money in the long run by losing customers.  
They may have made money by having you as a seller, but they'd lose money in the long run if your business helped others get into BitCoins.

@_date: 2013-05-25 13:38:49
There's our disagreement - I was looking at **all** taxes in the U.S., not just federal taxes.  To whit:
2013 tax spending
Health care 1,148.1 billion
Pensions 1,100.3
Defence 857.7
Education 781.2
Welfare 654.5
Protection 340.0
Interest 337.4
Transportation 288.8
General Government 117.7
Other Spending 532.9
TOTAL SPENDING 6,158.5
Now, if we assume that "protection" should fall under "defence" (I'm not sure what it means, actually), you'll see that national defence takes first priority - but still only represents around 1/6 of all government spending.  
Regardless, though, I didn't really come here to debate a foreign country's spending - just wanted to clearly point out that defense spending does not make up even close to 50% of any country's spending, aside from (maybe) World War II.
@_date: 2013-05-29 23:49:57

It sounds like you're well-meaning, but I imagine this wouldn't be appreciated by most people who weren't already into bitcoins.  
Imagine if you were a waiter and, as a tip, I gave you a 100 yen coin.  That's worth around $1, but in order to get the value, you'd have to go down to the bank and exchange it for dollars.  You might not consider it worth the trouble to do so - heck, you might even give it away to someone else.  Unless you were already planning a trip to Japan, it just seems eccentric at best.  
I think my own personal experience might be insightful here: I'm interested in bitcoins, but not invested in them.  I don't have the money to invest myself, and earning bitcoins online is more difficult than earning a dollar at work.  Getting $1 worth of bitcoins would be pleasant, but not meaningful enough for me to begin investing in them.  I'd probably feel nice, but wouldn't know what to do with it.  I suspect that waiters and others you might tip with these cards would feel the same even if they were interested enough to follow the QR code.

@_date: 2013-02-13 17:50:52
Okay, you have made some money with this - but it is all too easy to lose it all.  At that point, you'll be screwed - you're not investing with money in the bank, you're investing with credit cards, and as soon as the 0% rate is over, you're in trouble.  You may even be in trouble now - many times, those 0% rates have fine print (it expires if you don't pay the monthly minimum, etc.).  Find out!  If your credit card is a measly 12% interest normally, you'd be looking at $300 in interest per month - before you start paying down the debt.  It could leave you and your family in debt for over a decade.  This is a serious risk...and one you don't have to take.
You've been lucky or savvy and made a small fortune - if you invested at $14 and now it's $25.10, you've got almost 80% profit.  Great!  Sell at least two-thirds of it right now and pay back that credit card debt.  NOW.  Yes, that will cripple your future profits if it continues to rise - but it will save you from crippling debt if it goes sour.  
Using your profits to pay back that debt ought to be the number one concern you have right now.  
@_date: 2013-05-25 20:44:36
Yup. In this case, it was the coast of fighting the revolutionary war and paying the militias. 
But you're absolutely right... No economist will ever confuse consumer debt with government debt, and national debt refers firmly to the latter.
