BTC isn't rising. USD is slightly falling. These african persons are in debt (like you and me) of $ 35.000 Dollars and they never saw or spend one dollar. [
World Global Debt / World Population = $ 35.000 per person

I look at all bearish and bullish posts and only give my opinion. That is not allowed?

In Europe we can get BTC within 1 minute OTC (Over The Counter) I don't what kind of banking system you have in the US. But's it's like very outdated. Sorry.

It's to much hodl at this time. I see a big difference how we use bitcoins in Europe (use it) and the USA (Hodl and hope the price will go up)﻿. The biggerst home diverly in Germany and The Netherlands who is bigger than Diliveroo, Uber Eats and the other one who's gone now. Is [Thuisdbezorg.nl]( &amp; [ accepts bitcoins from 2015 . There is much more spending in Europe. And we are happy about it. No VAT

Circulating coins only helps the miners who collect transaction fees???? 
Sorry without the miners we don't have any bitcoin. Looks like you are mad about the miners. They keep the whole system going. They have to earn something. 
I think you don't understand the whole bitcoin/blockchain system. So stay out.

Ok I get it so there a two groups now.
The early adopters who see it as Satoschi sees it (Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System [ ) It's ment to be a CASH SYSTEM. Like me.
And there is a group who went in late 2017 to make  quick money (who use the word investing) and don't use it and never red the whitepaper They are mad because the price went down.
Fees?? Come on. Someone transfered 266.000 BTC last week with a fee of $27,50. Do they know when you are a shop owner how much fee you have to pay when someone pays with a Visa or Mastercard.
Do they know how much fee you have to pay when you want to transfer money to your brother abroad using Wester Union. No because they never did.
When group 2 has the majority nothing is going to happen with the value of bitcoin.
