Ok thanks :)
@_date: 2018-09-07 23:17:43
Buy btc on every 20% drop. In 3 years you'll thank me. You can look for good staking coin also. Some with a Great team great product and longevity like lomostar lmc 24% interest or Eos for the airdrops. That's easier to do than mining. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:38:03
Why they don't give the btc back to the people instead of dumping?
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:20:08
Why we can't instant buying with maestro/ bancontact?
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:35:34
You're wrong every rich ppl who puts millions USD in btc is watching those... That's why TA works. But they are so many factors that it can not be 100% right everytime.
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:39:34
Reading your thoughts I think that the Vaneck ETF will be approved. Because you all think it will be rejected because it's better for bitcoin... \^\^ 
So it will be a surprise and the big boys of Wall Street will come and play with the actual crypto bilionnaires. Whatever the price of BTC will increase long term because "An idea who time has come cannot be stop..."

Have you been killed? Why keeping 1.2 millions btc in a wallet without ever using a single one?

Yes I'm talking with you because you're loosing faith like lot of people today. And yes for now my limit orders are put so I don't have to work. I'm sorry that the market is awful for now. It's hard for everyone. No one can predict the future 10/10. It's just that TA is about probability, money management and cutting losses FAST. It's a day job with a lot of work/study. You can watch coinmasteryTV on youtube if you want to discover TA.

That's for USA. Not every country has that very shi\*ty taxation rules. But you're right the buyer are many in USA. But who knows if it will change one day ?
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:22:49
For you maybe. It's very hard to learn and hard to practice but it works 7.5 times on 10 for me so I'm fine with it.

Well orchestrated fud. They will sell us btc at 250k in some years. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:15:53
I disagree because the more they are people watching charts with T.A in head. More the charts become like I'm used to. So it's always good to spread the word :)

@_date: 2018-05-18 21:20:15
You do not get it. Sorry if I'm rude \(english isn't my first language\) but as Peter Thiel said yesterday. BTC is GOLD 2.0, not a currency... Understand that please. You can't use gold to buy your next car. Or maybe you can but that's stupid... Nobody wants to use a deflationnary asset for buying everyday stuffs.
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:01:01
What u guys think is the biggest difference between investors in btc in 2013 and 2018 ?
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:45:15
But people are really stupid for the big part... They can not understand that ! I hope one day a man will rise and explain in a REALLY SIMPLE way why BTC is the greatest store of value.
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:01:14
Holy shit
@_date: 2018-05-13 09:12:51
It's not simple but most of the economists think that btc is a good store of value. The next gold. E-Gold. You do not use gold for payment. For payment you need a stable coin. Maybe alchemint that is coming. It will be more stable than usd or usdt. As most of the early adopters, I do not think btc will be a currency but an asset instead. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:59:37
I think the community will get it in a decade. Maturation is needed. Maybe when the goldman sachs stable coin will be widely used, people will rethink the utility of btc and discover that it is like gold.

me too and btc was 300 USD when I spoke to her :''(
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:34:00
He is not one ppl. Nobody has to know so btc can more easily be the no boundaries world reserve currency of internet. When fully adopted btc will replace most part of all speculatives investment like stocks, real estate, precious mtl... Becuz of security, ease of use, liquidity...
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:23:10
Maybe some group of elite ppl tried hard to find a solution to avoid taxation , hide wealth and protect from central banks devaluing money. I think timechain took at least 5 yrs to create. After Nakamoto team ask on internet for some professional views of nerd like the one working now for blockstream. 
There is a non small case for thinking that btc is the work of the very same ppl owning already the world.
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:31:00
Imo fiat will always be but with btc we people have the power to evade the atrocious future central bankers are preparing for the 99% people. Im just considering btc as the new gold. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 05:06:55
IMO 2 btc is a lot. You should buy 1 or 2 ledger and duplicate then cut in two parts the 24words pass. So you have 4 half key stored in 4 locations. Don't forget a home can burn so put them in different geographic location
@_date: 2018-10-06 08:23:23
They are both very bullish on Btc.
@_date: 2018-10-30 09:46:40
Yes I saw that. Maybe the final shake before uptrend with all media's telling btc is great.

Half a million BTC exchanged in 24hours only BIT-Z lol
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:53:25
Without high fees in winter 17. Btc would be dead cuz it would have been a thread to the governments. It was a bad for a greater good. Now u have a new asset soon adopted widely. For the payment thing look at the best coins (fast and reliable) with lot of bank partnerships.  Btc is a valuable dinosaur. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:59:18
it 's far more impressive on Worldcoin index 80% du volume mondial sur bit _Z now = USD to BTC

@_date: 2018-06-05 20:47:06
Btc = gold 2.0 = store of value. Price increase is adoption. Use the fastest coin with banking partnerships for payments. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 10:48:31
That's an old lie. A deflationnary system is not subject to cash hoarding. That's a mf lie invented by the banksters. Just think about it. You will buy nothing if you have more money everyday?? We have one life, ppl know this.

Because it's ETH/BTC I do not know if it's lot of people switching from BTC to ETH or ETH to BTC...

And in the discussion on bitcointalk with satoshi he rapidly comes to the conclusion that bitcoin is a digital gold more than a currency. Months after he releases the whitepaper.

 Lower prices increase demand; they do not reduce or delay it. That's why more and more people own flat-screen TVs, cellular telephones, and laptop computers: the prices of these goods have fallen, and people with lower incomes can afford them. And there are more low-income people than high-income people. You idiot.
