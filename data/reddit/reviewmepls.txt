In Germany you only say "Euro" in German, not in English.

Which is fine, as it brings stability. The higher the market cap, the less influence big players can have on the price.

Oh wow, thanks, its highly appreciated! 
And coincidentally I had read your article yesterday, but had no idea it was you! Great analysis, especially the narrow window proof. I'm looking forward to part 2!

If you're looking for something short that's aimed at beginners, perhaps take a look at A brief introduction to Bitcoin (
A 10€ Black and White version will be available next week.

Shameless plug here, but I just recently published my book "A brief introduction to Bitcoin" on Amazon, which is tightly packed with everything you, your grandma and your cat need to know about it. No fluff.

In a year from now, probably 3.50

You don't think people at Alibaba know about Europe?

I had invested in ASICMiner, one of the first mining companies creating specialized hardware back in 2013. The "stock" skyrocketed, 5x, and the dividends were off the charts. Everyone was praising the founder, friedcat (if I recall correctly), so I just kept reinvesting those dividends back into it. They seemed so far ahead of the competition that nobody could touch them. In a few months, the dividend payments stopped and the stock fell to zero...

Your hardware wallet is based on android too, his worries apply just the same. Simpler is safer.

As soon as there's an app where I can drag and drop my conditions to create the contract. Until then, it's still only a technical promise for almost everyone

Thank you, that's very kind

That's the opposite of contraproductive, though. Summarising information and making it more easily available is a great thing.

Yes, you start from the basics and work your way up to more complex topics. You can check out the table of contents by clicking the link at the bottom of the page

I don't see myself reading that white paper anytime soon, but would you care to say a few sentences on what makes it good in your eyes?
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:56:40
No doubt, Andreas is amazing and his book is also available for purchase on Amazon. My book is a briefer dive-in which has a number of other focus points
@_date: 2019-10-11 15:35:30
Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:51:16
Guess you didn't see that coming?

Thank you!!

CMV: There is a lof of talk lately about women being disadvantaged in all kinds of scenarios. But crypto is the best proof that women disadvantage themselves. It's as easy for any woman to sit down, read and learn about this new technology, and invest or refrain from investing, as it is for any man. But most women I hear of scold their boyfriends and husbands for gambling away money. This has zero to do with skills and privilege, it's an uninformed decision women willingly make or a difference in risk-adversity which is also a personal choice. 
Same goes for many other topics - where women only join in after it's already an established, proven, profitable venture. 
There is a pay gap. But the pay gap comes from the fact that men are more willing to risk careers, money, social status and time on new ideas, something which women are not. Higher risk means potentially higher returns.

Oh no, don't worry about it. To each their own :)
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:59:37
Thank you. I believe a topic as broad and amazing as Bitcoin has room for far more than two books. Also, the ebook is free as part of kindle unlimited, too :)
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:12:00
That's a fairly odd thing to say about books in general. Sometimes a good and compact source of researched, bundled knowledge is preferable to many scattered sources.
To address your complaint: researching the contents for this book took well over a year. 
In it, I detail the economic thinkers and theories laying the foundation for Bitcoin's existence as well as their critique of the current financial system. 
I also explore concepts like the byzantine generals problem, double spending and many others in ways that are hopefully easy to digest
Also, the e-book is available for free on kindle unlimited

Thanks for the idea. That'd be quite a bit of additional work, but I'll definitely consider it for the future.

10k/month?? All I need is 2k

That's not the point though. As long as it exists over the next 100 years or longer and assures a completely independent, infallible, immutable store of value and means of exchange as an alternative to other financial systems, the global reforms it will push through will have reduced the influence of the financial leash holders to the point where there are no more hidden taxes - no more inflation, negative rates, or unfettered printing presses.

Sadly, if I recall correctly, he already jumped ship a while ago and found an excuse.
