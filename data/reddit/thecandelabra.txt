No strategy can reliably make money in roulette (think about it - if it existed, why would casinos operate roulette wheels?). Your brother is just lucky. Long term he will lose.

eleventybajillion transactions per second would shatter the 8 megabyte limit. The point is that there is no reasonable number of megabytes that would solve the problem; Layer 2 is required.

"Billionaire" is not plantation slave money. That's Wal-Mart money or oil money or real estate money.

Well, if he really was Satoshi, his kids' coins are worth about 10 billion dollars now. Probably better to keep that under wraps.

My prediction (based purely on this guy's twitter feed and not any inside info):
Upcoming micropayments platform from Microsoft (they should trademark Micropayments™) integrated directly into the browser. Kinda like Brave has, but integrated into Edge and done as open source / Web Standard. Based on Bitcoin Lightning Network. You set up a payment channel to Microsoft, and Microsoft can set up channels to website operators.
This solves the micropayments issue - which is that you can't do them with traditional credit cards because the transaction fees are too high. Solves the N^2 scaling issue of having everybody sending micropayments to everyone - it all goes to Microsoft and they distribute out to websites, after taking their cut. This kinda fucks over Google if it takes off because about 25% of their revenue comes from Adsense (Google ads on third-party sites). It also would probably be good for people who hold Bitcoin.

Makes sense, the twitter guy is talking about identity, so I could definitely see it going this way.
