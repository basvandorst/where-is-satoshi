Still? And you making money from it? I actually have logs from the troll chat at btc-e. And wow some of the ideas about coins and the fortunes that were tossed away and made there before eth came on the scene.

Litecoin over eos!  Now that’s a debate worth having

i signed up today! weeee
What's the deal tho? I have no ETH wallet!

There are better dapps coming online soon , some of the barrier is working with solidity. It’s not hard, but it’s not in everyone’s short list. You have to combine a couple of code bases full stack to d3liver a dapp right now.    
Your observation about the eth network isn’t untrue at all, but some of the other coins are feeling scale pains too like Monero

bitcoin fluctuates on bag holders nervous to dump to recoup fast
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:23:33
yeah - that seems like the dude might be getting over going on TV promoting his company as a the way to buy bitcoins but ignoring the fact that they dont even live up to their quotes
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:28:58
I had this same issue, they quoted me a direct price at buy in.
Why would i get the price ten hours later? They recieved their money from me in ten minutes!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:06:15
Do we have ti wait till tommorrow for the price to be 60 for purchase?

They dont seem to respond to problems at all. The owner is on tv all the time
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:07:43
Im still waiting for a response from the form on the site from 8 days ago. I really wanted to recommend the service to a ton of friends including journalist - but I feel I got shafted at the moment and the no-reply to my customer service submission via phone and email is pretty distressing so far.
