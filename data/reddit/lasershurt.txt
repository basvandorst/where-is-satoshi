It's a fair point. As much as the Bitcoin community as a whole wants to be totally unregulated, unmonitored, and untraceable, we DO currently sort of pay for everything in our countries by taxation/currency. 
The only solution isn't maintaining the status quo, of course, but we DO need to have a solution for financing governance.
I know some aren't into governance at all, but... get over it. Even the most altruistic and effective things cost something to accomplish.

There's a subtle difference between "authority" and "extortion." There's an important difference between "regulating conduct" and "prevent[ing] certain parties from participating in the market."

You insult all of those who lived in slavery in the past, and those who suffer through it now, by comparing your life to Slavery. 
And yes, you are part of society. You can change the government. That's been my whole point. Question norms and push for change, that's awesome. Pretend that words mean things other than they don't to push an agenda, compare your life to slavery? Not so awesome.
Your obligation to society is to help make it better for the next generation. When I say you're obligated, I don't mean obligated to accept the worst parts, but rather to help fix them.

If and when you stop talking about slavery as if that applies to living in a modern society, maybe we can have a conversation. But you're apparently really ticked off about the suggestion that you might have some obligations to the society that gave you protection and education.

I chose to assume that most people have taken History classes in their lifetimes.
@_date: 2014-05-08 02:34:08
Because only at the scale of a modern nation state can you do certain collective tasks. Consider the Military as a fast example (though in an ideal world we'd not need one as we know it).
Also, those are three truly horrible examples for what we're discussing. Society isn't a single product, and it's sure as hell not a single piece of software. It's far, far more complex.
It's easy to say "all things should be voluntary" as an IDEA, but reality is infinitely more complex than that implies. The moment an individual begins to amass too much power, they can start exerting force on others, right? Voluntary starts to go out the window. You could try do to things to prevent or mitigate that, but then you're starting to sound like regulations are coming into play.
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:56:26
Of course you can't just leave. You simply cannot just leave society. Even the most devout "i am an island" off-grid libertarians have had their lives shaped by the world we all live in together.
Having things "done by market players" sounds okay on paper, but nobody has ever shown how that could possibly work. How do you Privately contract police in such a way that there aren't huge spots of friction between jurisdictions or neighboring areas, or different contractors? How do you introduce Market Based law?
When you throw everything to the Market, how do you prevent the guys with the most money from simply ruling everything?

No matter what sort of idealized form you think the world should take, there will be things that we undertake together. We need a way to finance those things that is fair and agreeable.
My point is that while this article's desire to cling to the current system may be wrong, there is a need to develop whatever newer system we think should take its place. Bitcoin can actively help in designing a newer, fairer way to finance public works, or it can try to avoid it and hide in the shadows. I'd rather the first.
Incidentally, pretty much no matter what organization we create to help us govern society will be "government." Saying that something so broad is "financed through violence" does nobody any favors.

I'm telling you that your analogy is bad. You seem to think it's okay to compare it to Slavery when the only element in common is "not voluntary" - there is SO MUCH MORE in play there.
And frankly, I know now that we'll never get anywhere. You've said clearly that all you have is the idea, and no thought beyond that of how it would work in real life. That's enough to tell me we're conversing on two different levels.
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:52:12
By Society, I mean Society. The Society that built the state, and the Society that can tear down and rebuild it if it's gone haywire.
The Society which has increased average lifespan and health, and decreased hunger. The Society which has overseen a continuous drop in violence. The Society which pays in full or part for Police, Fire, Military, Research, Education, Public Health, Transportation, and everything else that made your life what it is.
Without Society, you would absolutely not have the life you do now.
You have no right as a Westerner in 2014 to claim slavery, not even a little.

Full/radical decentralization, maybe. But that's not really in the cards any time soon, and it's not the argument of the "free-marketeers." Maintaining that decentralization would require regulation to mandate that "nodes" (to keep it generic) do not grow large enough to become dangers.
@_date: 2014-05-08 02:59:50
My point is I've already thought past that point. When you get past the ideology, there is still a ton left unanswered.
Like how you work it if there's a fire in your neighbor's house, and you joined the "fire protection" group but he didn't. Kiss your house goodbye too? Or does the fire company show up to protect yours and let his burn? Isn't the cost of homes lost to fires greater than the cost of just putting ALL of them out? etc.etc. 
How do you enforce even basic laws we can all agree on, like don't beat people, don't kill, don't steal? You need some sort of body with the authority to enforce it.
Anti-statism, Libertarianism, etc - all things with very good, reasonable, inarguable core ideas. I mean who doesn't love Freedom? But when you start trying to work out the fine details at the edges... concessions must be made. Freedom for Freedom's sake can actually do bad things.
I feel like it's a smarter idea to accept the idea of government/state/call it what you will, but active engage it to prevent it from hurting people. Make it receptive and responsive to the people who make it up. That's sort of the core problem, isn't it? Unnecessary restrictions or corruptly produced laws hurting people?
Don't think of what the state is now or has been in the past, think of what it could be if we applied the better angels of our nature. Make a state so good that nobody feels coerced into being a part - they're happy to do so.
And maybe don't call people "statists" - its too broad to mean anything. The state can be anything you want it to be. It's like calling me a "housist" and insisting it means I believe every person should be a traditional 2.5 story Victorian home owner. There are many ways to be housed.

I'm not one of the devs, I just run the website at curecoin.net.
It seems like much of the trust issues are out of CureCoin's hands, and in those of the universities in question. CureCoin obviously doesn't have the authority to dictate any terms to Stanford or other universities when it comes to security and avoiding cheating, but as you said there have been no problems historically.
@_date: 2014-05-07 22:47:43
Calling people "statists" is probably the dumbest possible thing you could do. It's absurd on the face of it. It's the kind of thing you do when you've convinced yourself that you really are a self-sufficient ubermensch, and if that darned government would just get out of your way you'd show everyone how amazing you really are.
It's a sign of delusion and immaturity.
BTW, "debating"? Nothing you've done has come close to debating, by a wide margin. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:32:11
That's an entirely ideological response which presumes that the government would go through the effort necessary to learn precisely WHY a product or service is bad/dangerous, but allow it to be offered just in case they can swindle someone into paying for it. Then, I presume, wash its hands of the inevitable consequences.
That's a loss of money from the market going into a rabbit hole of useless loss.
Perhaps I'm simply missing the connecting dots here that gets me from "things that are bad" to "allow them anyway because freedom."
Note, again, I am not suggesting that someone be allowed to arbitrarily decide something is "bad" as can happen now. Objectivity requires that you can *prove* it. Flexibility requires that if there are situations in which it's NOT bad, you allow it then.

I did read the thread, and... well, it seems like professional pride was getting in the way of common sense, in two directions. 
You clearly read into his replies and decided to just stop participating, but you're wrong if you think they're "not willing to work with you." Putting in 3 posts on a forum isn't really going out of your way to be helpful, especially when there are a lot of problems pointed out without offering solutions. And one dev invited you to talk to him more personally, but you seem to have refused?
I think you should reconsider your hurt feelings and be open to more conversations with the team. They're good guys and want to make a strong, secure system that encourages MORE folders doing MORE work. Everyone wins there, so why let your professional pride get in the way of good advances? Some of the best minds I've ever worked with are a little rough around the edges, but their work is important.
We all want Folding to grow, and on our end we want CureCoin to succeed in its mission of encouraging more folders.

It's not the only part that matters. Ideology is NOT the only thing that matters. That's an absurd idea.
And no, I have no interest in Anarcho-Capitalism, it's precisely as short-sited as you are. It's more "do this ideology and everything else will work itself out."
And I think you misunderstand me, unsurprisingly. I believe in using the tools of decentralization to empower people at an individual level - but to do so in order to create a better government, not to "get rid" of it. To take the power from the few and return it to the many.

Once it's up, you know where to find me if anything should be phrased better or otherwise improved.
For the second, I can tell you that I assume the team would be giddy to have the chance to work with Stanford to create a further improved system. You'll have to speak with one of them though - drop by the IRC channel some evening, perhaps? There's a web chat on the website if you want to use that.

I consider it "Mob Rule" to demand that we all begin to label the conference itself and the organizers at "scammers" because they are loosely associated, and to demand that we pull out of or sink the conference for allowing him to still be there (note that it's only 2 weeks before the conference).
I must also disagree that "screaming", "shitty attitudes" and "namecalling" is warranted. It's childish, and removes any seriousness behind the person doing it. It's not acceptable behavior, and it undermines the points of those using it.
I just don't understand why things like "sunlight is the best disinfectant" and "innocent until proven guilty" don't seem to apply here. Normally the community would agree with these things, but there's a hivemind that wants blood now and it doesn't seem to care where it gets it from.

I disagree with the sentiment that we must demand his full removal, and somehow burn the conference itself until we get our way. Mob rule is no way to handle things; the conference added a Q+A session after his talk, something which THIS VERY COMMUNITY suggested. Now people are acting like that's not good enough.
You can't just scream and demand until you get what you want. And even if you could, the amount of namecalling and shitty attitudes in the half-dozen threads about this is shocking.
If you're already going to the conference, go and ask questions. It's going to be taped. If you're not going, spread the word about the issues.

For everything, too, Funny earns Humor cred, etc.
In systems like this, edits or input from highly-accredited individuals in their fields would count for more. The more active a user is, the more credit they can earn for good work or 
Obviously this is a napkin-sketch of something very complex, but I think it would help decentralized systems to have a system of weighting more valuable input in an open fashion.
