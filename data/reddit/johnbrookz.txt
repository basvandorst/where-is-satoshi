After something like this I'd wait. Theres a correction coming no doubt. You'd have to be insane or delusional to think Bitcoin can keep being pumped. That said you can probably make a quick buck if you buy before the 11th

That's why you buy before. The price will rise after the 11th and stabilise because futures contracts and investors hate volatility.

As far as this article concerned, the author believes that CME/NASDAQ futures contracts will temporarily supress the price of bitcoin/cryptos but in the long run won't have impact. Unless I'm wrong.

It's time

Is that it?

Last time I checked coinbase did the opposite of backing them up until they were threatened with lawsuits
