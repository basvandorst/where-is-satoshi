No, it didn't surprise me (which is why I never said I was surprised).  I'm simply answering the question and stating the circumstances.
Also, those transactions happened last November.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:31:19
Connected to Coinbase.  Transactions were never larger than $10k, however I have moved over $10k in a 24H period broken down into several transactions.  Never more than $50k in a 24H period (coinbase limit that as well).

Since I had a bank account with another institution linked to their account, they're sending the balance in its entirety to the linked account.  If I didn't have a linked account, they would have sent a check in the mail.

Did you structure like I did?
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:23:03
The large sums were transactions with Coinbase.  That's the only thing I used the account for except for paying my taxes (ironically) and transfers from my personal accounts.
I think it's a fairly high probability that it was because of all the BTC transactions with Coinbase that did it in.

Both.  Minimal activity overall though.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:24:32
Apparently not.  Ah well, silver lining is that it's a kick in the ass to move the funds into other investments rather than rotting in a low-interest account.
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:16:05
Luckily, I reported all of my profits from BTC, filed as short term capital gains and paid my taxes.  Structuring on my part was out of ignorance, hopefully I'll be seen as the ignorant, small fry I am and be spared any additional fines since my taxes are paid.
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:09:57
There's never been an overdraft and I think the only possibilities are:
1) activity related to BTC
2) [structuring transactions]( (link provided by u/schism1)
I'm beginning to think the structuring was the error in my ways.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:52:14
Oh okay, yeah, that's what I was actually doing with that account.  My only worry is that now they are sending the funds that were in that account to my main account (guess I shouldn't have had them linked).  Hopefully my main doesn't red flag the transfer of funds.

This isn't a crash. Once The Bitcoin sees a number, it remembers it. It will chase that number to the ends of the earth until it finds it again!
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:01:41


Correct.  Although technically speaking it's not the online computer that's "sending" the coins.  It is the transaction being signed and added to the blockchain that sends the coins.


The online computer doesn't "receive" coins.  The public address receives coins through transactions through the network.  Those transactions are recorded in the blockchain and can be viewed by anyone including your online "watching-only" armory wallet.


The number of coins in each public address is recorded in the blockchain which is on every node in the network, that's how the online machine knows how many coins are in the offline machine.


Same answer, because it's recorded in the blockchain.
These are very good questions and I understand completely where your confusion is coming from.  I like to understand everything from a fundamental level so here's an explanation from where I think you're coming from.
Each wallet contains many public addresses and their associated private keys.  When you make a transaction, your client of choice (Bitcoin-Qt, Armory, Blockchain.info) signs the transaction using the private key without you having to do anything except inputting your password/phrase.  ANY public address is available and can be added to the blockchain.  [There are a large number of public addresses that can be in existence.](
When you open Armory Offline client on your offline machine and click "create wallet", the Armory client generates a private key and public address pair from its code.  The code is open source and you can view where it does this [here](  It uses randomness plus other magic to generate random addresses.  It is considered a Type 2 Deterministic Wallet with a Root Key and Chain Code.  Deterministic wallets use a seed to generate addresses.  The way it generates addresses are through an algorithm that has a counter on it, say N.  Each time you click "generate new address", the algorithm runs with N, then N+1, then N+2, etc.
Okay, back to the offline machine.  Your offline machine will generate a public address.  Right now, that address means absolutely nothing to the blockchain.  The assumption here is that that public address has NEVER been generated or used before.  Now you go and transfer some coins to that address from an online account.  When you transfer to anyone's public address, you don't need their permission.  So now you have an offline machine which generated a public address, then you send coins to that address and the transaction is posted to the block chain.  That public address now has coins.
When your machine blows up, BOOM, laptop gone.  Have a paper backup that shows the root key and chain code? PERFECT!  Now you boot up the armory client, click to import wallet from root key and chain code.  What you are doing here is providing armory with the recipe or key ingredients to generate the private key and public address pair that contains your offline coins.
That's the long and long of it.  Electrum also uses a deterministic wallet however with Electrum, the seed is a 12 word phrase that you must remember and with Armory, it's a root key and chain code which is your paper backup.
Feel free to ask me any questions about this and I hope this helped.
EDIT: In the Armory code, do a search for "def createNewWallet" if you want to get to the code for generating addresses.

Thanks, I'm in the middle of determining which method of cold storage to go with.  Would you care to offer up your opinion on the matter?  
I'm most likely going with an offline machine and Armory to create the offline passphrase encrypted wallet, and creating both digital and paper backups to put in secure TBD locations.  
The other option of course is to go with Electrum and remember the 12 word seed passphrase.

Eh, he'll get over it, it definitely is a mental thing.  Especially with btc too and how volatile it is, have to keep your eye on the long term and not care about the ups and downs.  Or, only invest what you're willing to lose.
Personally, I have my savings btc wallet and spending btc wallet.  I can't wait for bitcoin friday (black friday).  I'm hoping to do 100% of my holiday shopping this year in btc.

New question: Do ALL BTC transactions incur a transaction fee?  
BitcoinQT, blockchain.info, &amp; coinbase all have different fees associated with transactions and I believe some sites have advertised no fees when transferring BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:20:31
Exactly, I have my savings wallet and my spending wallet which are completely separate.  My spending wallet was even created much later than my savings wallet.  However I created my spending wallet for my holiday budget and plan on using it for bitcoin friday as much as possible.
For instance, let's say I bought 3BTC for $1k to be my holiday budget for this year (I would've had to buy them earlier in the month).  Now, my holiday budget has increased to $2800 OR my holiday budget is still $1,000 and I keep the remainder BTC in my wallet for future spending once more merchants take it.
It's really the same difference between a checking and savings account.  The point of spending it is to support the BTC community and merchants who take risks to be part of the early adopters and of this growing community.

I'm contacting NYC's WNYC NPR (National Public Radio).  They are having their fall fundraising drive however Bitcoin is not a method of payment.  Any other NY'ers who listen to NPR, I would ask of you to contact them about this and who knows, perhaps they'll accept it for the next one!  I'm going to publish this on r/nyc as well.

Reddit is already anonymous.  If this is as an important issue as you say it is, and important enough for you to mention it, why not provide source information?  Otherwise it's more type on the screen.
You can even make a single account to post the info if you were worried about your post history coming into play.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:44:05
Also, if you do decide to give a tip, adding a verify command will make it more visible IMO.  It looks more visible to me when I view someone's tip and I see the bot come in with its own bold type and includes links for how-to's and set ups.
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:00:24
Thanks for the info.  
Is it possible to send bitcoins without any fees?  This is mostly theoretical and not from a practicality standpoint but I was playing with blockchain.info (web based) and bitcoinQT (software based) and I was surprised when I transferred coins from my QT wallet to my blockchain wallet.  It stated at the time of the transaction that the BTC amount was greater than a certain number and due to this, there will be a required transaction fee of 0.0005 BTC (~$0.17 USD atm).  I understand about the optional additional tip for faster processing but this mandatory fee based on BTC quantity (I transferred 0.0010 BTC) made me believe that basically every transaction greater than 0.0005 BTC would have this fee.  Especially since this was a software client and not a web based service.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:34:24
I'm hoping to do all of my holiday shopping with BTC this year, and hopefully all of it on bitcoin Friday.  I too would like to see the list beforehand but I see the reasoning behind not revealing until the last minute.  
I'm guessing that the organizers don't have a substantial number of merchants just yet and are gaining more and more as time passes.  Perhaps even this week they've gained 100% more merchants then last week.  If the revealed the list two weeks ago or even a week ago and it looked pathetic, it would put off both merchants as customers whereas now that there's more publicity this week from last week, perhaps the list has grown large enough to be shown next week before Friday.
This is of course speculation, but then again, this is r/bitcoin!

Yeah, it's best not even to bring it up.  I have friends of mine who invest in stocks and bonds and who know that I'm involved in bitcoin.  Recently, one asked how I was doing and I gave him my percentage increase.  His response: "WOW, you should sell some soon."
I just responded very direct and clear, "let me handle my investments, I don't tell you what to do with yours."

To add another example for a counterpoint, the dollar gets weaker over time due to inflation.  That means that potentially your dollar will be worth less tomorrow than it is today.  That doesn't mean that you spend every dollar you have because it will be worth less tomorrow.  You still have your spending and saving accounts (assuming you're fiscally responsible that is!).
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:49:17
Early adopters (merchants) take risk and accept btc as payment for goods and services.  The merchant can either gain or lose from this risk (gain if btc succeeds, lose if it fails).  Companies are created that specialize in better and better merchant software to handle the transactions as well as conversion from btc to usd (right now, some merchants choose to collect their transactions in btc while others choose to convert instantly their prices from usd to btc, obtain btc from customer, software takes the btc, converts to usd and transfers to merchant; less risk as holding btc and less fees than CC transactions).  More merchants sign on, better software is created, more customers use btc, etc. etc.  As time goes on, software gets better, volatility decreases, need to convert on an instant basis decreases, less transaction fees to the merchant than with CC.
Quick rundown on my thoughts on the question while on a conference call at work.

16GB RAM baby! (just built my PC...I tend to go overboard)
Yeah, I'm trying desperately to get my offline machine up and running but it's my first real foray into Linux.  I have ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my offline machine but am missing some dependencies.  The software center is screwed up and every time I try and run Lucid Linux desktop 10.04 off of a USB, the machine stops and boots up normally after I select "Try Ubuntu without installing".  Extremely frustrating but I'm learning a lot in the process.  I even tried to reinstall 12.04 completely but that wasn't working out either.  Might just wipe out the drive completely and reinstall like that, the existing 12.04 seems to be screwing with any other OS installation.  Very strange.
My main PC runs the offline process fine but that damn notebook is giving issues, hoping to solve the issue above by this weekend.  Tips/suggestions very welcome.

This is basically user preference.  I like Armory but that's mainly because I've researched it more than Electrum and like their site and software.  Plus I don't trust myself to remember the 12 word phrase.  Also, the 12 word phrase should be generated completely randomly which I believe Electrum does.  If you create your own from a common phrase, someone can just make a ton of addresses from common phrases and see if some of those addresses have coins in them.
Of course, if you use Electrum the way it is meant to be used with random 12 word phrases, this shouldn't be an issue.  I simply don't trust myself with remembering it but can build enough digital and paper back up systems with my armory wallet where I'm confident that I always have a backup somewhere. 
And remember, you have to keep that paper backup secure, that IS the master key to accessing your wallet.
