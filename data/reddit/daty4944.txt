Even if bitcoin goes below $20 per coin, it's still just as useful as a currency as it was last year and the year before. Stability is key, not the value vs. fiat. I unfortunately lost some money trying to invest in crypto currency but I also still USE bitcoin and love it for what it's good at. Anonymous digital currency that is tied to no country or bank and can be used anywhere that has access to the internet.

Good point. I of course hope it goes up but either way it will never be dead. It was alive when it was 10 cents per coin and it had a use then, and still will even if it goes back to that. How else will I order magic: the gathering cards?

You're a beauty!!!

You sound like you're bitter that you aren't making money off LTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:00:09
That's why it's doomed to fail
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:38:18
Sooooo... How ya feeling about this now? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:41:29
Congrats on that! I feel you on the blood pressure and stress.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:13:25
Or embits
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:57:46
I'd still recommend buying now, as hard as it is considering how much you could have bought for.

If you use android, download Mycelium bitcoin wallet. Contact somebody from localbitcoins or find somebody on craigslist who is selling. Meet them, give them the cash value based on MTGox.com, and then they will scan your barcode and you will instantly have bitcoin. 
Then, when you get home, setup a bitcoin wallet using your preferred app. Then, backup your wallet on two separate USB drives and delete it from your computer. Then wait until bitcoin is worth the amount you want to sell at and restore your wallet on your computer to sell the bitcoin on an exchange.
