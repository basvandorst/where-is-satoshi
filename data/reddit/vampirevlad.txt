I agree, but if you look at them you can clearly notice some patterns in terms of guests and format. The same people who promote the same companies or services go to every major podcast available and say pretty much the same stuff. My approach is to allow lesser known but more passionate members of the community voice their views and opinions. 
I do have my share of big names who do exactly what I described above, but I'm trying to keep the content fresh and original. Most of the guests I've had lately have never been to a podcast, but still say interesting stuff about Bitcoin in their countries, laws concerning crypto,  and local meetups.
That being said gentlemen, let me know if you want to join the Bitcoin Takeover Podcast. My DMs are open on Twitter  :)

There should be one involving Mark Karpeles, Roger Ver, and everyone who's ever destroyed the reputation of Bitcoin or launched a social attack, too!

Muchas gracias, senor! I spend most time on Twitter and haven't been around Reddit just because of the karma system and its limitations, but from now on I'll try to post here whatever is relevant.

Well, I agree that we shouldn't have irrational allegiances in a space which aims to eliminate trust in humans, but I couldn't possibly contain myself knowing just how much Greg Maxwell has done for Bitcoin. This is the equivalent of having Elvis personally react to a newspaper article back in the 50s. While it shouldn't affect your judgment and objectivity, it's still a really nice feeling to realize that your work somehow matters.

Hey, thanks. I really appreciate your comment and I'm happy that my work gets some encouragement. I've been doing this for Crypto Insider since September, but I wasn't very active on Reddit due to the limitations of having low karma and the amount of time it actually takes to become a credible redditor. Found Twitter much more convenient, but it's pretty hit or miss depending on the ongoing trends.
"Actual journalism" is what we're aiming for as a publication, and I hope our work will catch your attention once again in the future. There should be more to media than registering to news aggregators where people look for breaking news to influence their trading strategies, right?

Well, those Crypto Twitter influencers were so effective in promoting their hype that I specifically skimmed through the BIPs looking for the words "scale" and "scalability". Anyway, thanks for your comments, I'm blown away now that I realize that something I've written has attracted the attention of THE Greg Maxwell.

Looking forward to your comments, guys. Let me know if there's anything wrong in my reading of the BIPs.

If I were such a brilliant person who figured out the nature of money and revolutionized game theory, but also wanted to remain anonymous, I'd purposely change my writing style to deceive and discourage the type of analysis op has made.
