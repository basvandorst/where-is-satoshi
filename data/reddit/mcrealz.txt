Oh one month ago me. You were so innocent and able to chuckle at such posts with ease.

Come on guys let’s give’em this one then

That sounds like a good idea, keep the investing coming anyway you can. Best of luck!

That took a couple of re-reads but think I get it now, thank you for the follow-up! Hope a bill like [this one from September](  gets pushed through so we won’t have to worry about smaller purchases.

It’s best trust me. DON’T BE ME.

I just started investing in BTC this week and am having the same urge to pull from my savings. If you don’t pull, I won’t. Pinkie promise?

Sounds like your friend doesn’t research that well.
“Bitcoin is the most widely circulated digital currency or e-currency as of 2017. It's called a convertible virtual currency because it has an equivalent value in real currency. The sale or exchange of a convertible virtual currency—including its use to pay for goods or services—has tax implications.”

That is a nice failsafe, thanks for bringing that up!

The signs are all there! HODL

Haha Humble beginnings friendo

Lmao Sorry I couldn’t either, just got .5 BTC
[EDIT]: Update - Transaction didn't go through, perhaps this is a sign to calm down a bit.

So say you have 1 BTC bought @ $1k and the price has risen to $2k. If you need to pay someone $1500, do you send over .75 of that particular BTC and are taxed on the $1k gain?
I have a feeling I’m misunderstanding multiple things with that scenario.

All the costumes and people look straight out of the first Assassins Creed!
