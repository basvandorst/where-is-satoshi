Pretty unbelievable that this is *TIME*, not some random stay at home mom's blog.

I've noticed brits do this a lot with bands.  They will say something like "A Day to Remember are awesome", even though they are only referring to one thing.

Honestly, I think E=mc^2 is made out to be a way bigger deal than it really is.  For one thing, it's a special case of E^2 - **p**^2 c^2 = m^2 c^4, so it's not as compact and pretty as most people think.  
And while this was a big leap for the field of nuclear physics, especially for radioactivity and eventually nuclear power, I would argue that discoveries such as the Bohr model, Schrodinger's equation, and the particle nature of light have had a much greater impact on our lives today.

That's fine, as long as I also happen to like those things.

That's obviously different, since the name of the band is plural.
