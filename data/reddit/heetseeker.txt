In my btc-e acccount info under profile it says:
E-Mail: (confirmed) Hidden	
For security purposes, after a e-mail change your account will be locked for withdrawal within 2 days.
I don't believe my email has been changed by a hacker

Im looking at my login activity from btc-e and there is no entry for feb 24th(that's the date I opened support ticket and received email from btc-e). The earliest log in before that date is feb 15th and then the next one is march 1st. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:28:13
another point is that It didn't actually take 2 weeks to log in. In the subsequent days of my account freeze(Feb 24th) I kept trying to log in and I was getting a pop up message that I would be able to on the 1st of March which is why I tried on that date. otherwise I probably would have waited 2 weeks.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:40:55
first part correct. on the 24th of feb when I tried to log in I get a pop up window which tells me I have to unlock 2FA in order to get in. I then open a support ticket and they then send me an email saying my 2FA is unlocked. I never asked them to disable my 2FA I only asked them why I couldn't log in and what the pop up window said. This is why i suspect they are the culprit

The theft took place on the 2nd of march. I checked mt browser history on that date and there is nothing that shouldn't be there. Ran Malwarebytes pro yesterday and zero malware was found.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:15:17
I would like to think that but it's not looking that way.Many other users same problem.

I didn't turn 2FA off. A window popped up when I tried to log in saying to unlock 2FA. I started a support ticket asking them why I wasn't able to access my account and telling them the message I got. A few minutes later I get an email from them saying:
 "Hello! Was requested unlok 2FA. Your account for safety was blocked by an automatic system for two weeks. Lock can not be undone before the expiration."
two things about this. I wasn't locked out for two weeks and when I was able to log in I didn't need to use my 2FA because they unlocked it. It was the next day when my coins were all transferred out.
I started another support ticket asking them why they disabled my 2FA. They responded with the same message as before:
"Hello! We are sorry but your money was transferred out from BTC-E. We can't refund and return your money. We can provide you IP logs of potential hacker.Withdrawal has been confirmed with your mail"
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:18:53
I did have 2 FA enabled prior to this theft.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:23:31
yes that's the exact wording. Didn't really surprise me much because when you go their site under support there are many grammar mistakes.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:49:23
once you get access to someones email it's too easy.so what's the point of all btc-e's so called security measures if they all fall like dominoes once your email is compromised? But if this is how it went down then wouldn't my btc-e password have changed? I'm still able to log in with it now
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:17:43
thing is i got the message on Feb 24th that my account was locked for 2 weeks. Hopeful that I could log in earlier, I kept trying to no avail until the 1st of march, when lo and behold I was able to log in. That wasn't even a week. How does that figure into this whole thing?
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:43:23
because that was the issue with me not being able to login in the first place and then having my account locked down. I never asked them to disable my 2FA anyway 
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:44:59
I have asked them numerous times why they told me to turn off 2FA and never once have they responded to the question but instead send a canned response. If indeed it was a phishing site responsible for the pop up window then don't you think they should be concerned about that and warn their customers? If it was their pop up window then don't you think they should have told me to reactivate 2FA when your able to log on?
 When I sent them a support ticket about the pop up window why didn't they say you have requested to unlock your 2FA on such and such date if indeed a hacker had already requested that earlier?
From the moment this whole thing started(pop up window) to now I was sending support tickets to which they were responding so irresponsibly and inappropriately that they can't be completely absolved. 
If they had operated their support department professionally then they would have known something was wrong BEFORE my coins were stolen but they might as well have ignored them the way they were responding. So what's the point of having a support dept?

I'm in FL. There are a few entries from Va and Romania so my email was compromised.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:36:24
yes correct. I didn't enable 2 factor because I thought that was somekind of change they had done to their site so I didn't want to enable it and then have to go through it all over again where I would be locked out of my account. 
When this first happened I went to their support page and there is a topic for just this issue where you have to unlock 2FA. It's there now on their site under support.
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:09:35
I checked my yahoo account login activity and there are several entries from Va and Romania which I'm in FL. 
I just checked the link you posted and it says:
"Nope, looks like you're one of the lucky ones.
We haven't encountered your email address in any of the data leaks we've processed. Feel free to run the query again to check if any of your other addresses may have been compromised."

march 2nd was the first indication that i was being hacked. i didn't take any screen shots before that. 
The request to turn off 2FA wasn't in an email but a pop-up window on their site when I wasn't able to log-in on Feb 24th. I did find that strange so I went to their support page and there was an already opened topic on not being able to log-in because of 2FA needing to be unlocked(I'll screenshot that) so I felt that the pop up window was legit at this point. 
I then opened a support ticket about the message I got in the pop-up window(please note that I didn't request them to unlock 2FA). That's when they sent me the email saying that my 2FA was unlocked and I would have to wait 2 weeks before I could log back in. Believe me at this point I was like why did these guys unlock my 2FA but this was still before my coins disappeared which was march 2nd. I was,however,able to log back in on march 1st which I thought was weird because 2 weeks hadn't passed yet.
Interesting that the hacker seemingly could have accessed my btc-e account on march 1st because that's when I was able to. please keep in mind that at no time has my btc-e password changed.
notice the bad english.  
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:11:29
I asked them, they don't respond
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:02:47
So the chain of events is first they have access to my email, then they request 2FA unlock, then they wait for me to log in and phish my btc-e password? but when i wrote the support ticket, that was on feb 24th and I never was actually logged in according to the btc-e login activity.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:34:20
it's obvious you don't understand the meaning of the word obvious ;)
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:28:01
I have the screenshots but how do I upload them on here?
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:32:16
yes correct to the first part. I have 2FA in an app on my phone. 
Once it was unlocked, no I didn't change the password. The theft occured the next day
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:27:13
checked all entries for that date. nothing out of place 
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:44:49
the initial contact I made with BTC-e was opening a support ticket on their website
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:30:12
I was trading frequently almost daily Thats why I had them on there
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:33:29
Yes I received the login confirmation emails but not the coin withdrawal ones. It was only one failed attempt before the 2FA freeze
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:45:54
I didn't leave it there because I was lazy I was a frequent trader almost daily.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:39:09
all screens are posted. you missed them
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:19:08
except for the part that I didn't have to wait two weeks like the email said - see the above post.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:29:29
no problem but how do I upload the screenshots here?
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:21:12
My computer is always on and a window with btc-e site is always open. I am a frequent trader so I never closed that btc-e window.
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:24:04
except it wasn't 2 weeks. My account was locked on the 24th of Feb but I was able to log in March 1st. 
In the subsequent days of my account freeze I kept trying to log in and I was getting a pop up message that I would be able to on the 1st of March which is why I tried on that date. otherwise I probably would have waited 2 weeks.
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:29:44
1) Email compromised by hacker
2)Hacker claims lost password at btc-e and btc-e sends instructions to reset password.
3)Using compromised email hacker resets btc-e password to gain access at will
and request removal of 2FA.(but this doesn't make sense because my password is still working march 1st till now so password never changed) Shouldn't btc-e start getting suspicious at this point? Also withdrawal emails never make it to me but log in emails do.
It really doesn't hold up if we're assuming it was a hacker not associated with btc-e 
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:05:43
1) I didn't remove 2FA, I sent a support ticket and they sent me this email, "Hello! Was requested unlok 2FA. Your account for safety was blocked by an automatic system for two weeks. Lock can not be undone before the expiration."
2) I use yahoo and didn't see any logins that weren't mine and I don't have 2FA for Yahoo. *correction I have accesed login activity and yes there are logins there that aren't mine so email was compromised
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:31:26
When I asked BTC-e why they asked me to unlock 2 FA they responded with this: 
""Hello! We are sorry but your money was transferred out from BTC-E. We can't refund and return your money. We can provide you IP logs of potential hacker.Withdrawal has been confirmed with your mail"
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:07:18
I never received e-mails from btc-e asking to confirm the withdrawals
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:24:33
In the subsequent days of my account freeze I kept trying to log in and I was getting a pop up message that I would be able to on the 1st of March which is why I tried on that date. otherwise I probably would have waited 2 weeks.
