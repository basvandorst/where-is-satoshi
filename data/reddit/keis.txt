To complete the analogy segwit is like building a second room and then putting some of the parts in that one instead
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:05:53
The signature is a unnecessary part of the transaction? wtf
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:24:11
A miner can already set a lower limit than 1mb for their own blocks if they desire. A decrease in block size network could be rolled out as a soft fork as that doesn't require consensus only a majority
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:09:49

@_date: 2018-01-01 04:23:24
Why don't you verify all transactions? that is a core principle of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:44:34
can you name one or is google to hard to figure out for you?
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:58:04
segwit transactions are no smaller than regular transactions. The signature is segregated to another part of the block that old clients can't see which why they accept the bigger blocks segwit produces 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:15:47
Nice deflection. I know exactly what it does but I'm interested to find out what features you don't think is in the analogy. stopping malleability? putting a limit on script ops? versioned script types?
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:21:47
That's the problem with analogies they are not 100% correct or they would just be what you are trying to describe, but I'll bite, what are these important fixes and how are they not conveyed by this analogy?
One point missing from even the original is that we're building one of these rooms every 10 minutes and the problem isn't the time to build these rooms but that we will eventually run out of space to build them in. segwit's 2-4 mb pair and big ass 8 mb room doesn't make much difference in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:14:15
it's not a maybe it's just a question of when even with 300kb. I said nothing about LN and while I have high hopes for it, it too has fundamental (but different) problems. I think we will have to face that the blockchain has to be pruned at some point and if we accept that then 100mb or 1.7mb is not a big difference
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:40:36
Top of google my friend, 
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:34:54
The best source is to read the bip but I think this explains it pretty well even though the text is argumentative 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:05:21
Yeah, this transition period is going to be very messy. It's not two completely different systems but the BIP for segwit describes two different address formats with different encodings. I'm not sure about the ledger app but if you use the nano with electrum you should get new style addresses because the keys behind are still the same and that's what's on your ledger
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:18:03
it works if the other end of the transaction is also using a segwit enabled client. Electrum is the only one I know of but it's pretty popular so it should not be terribly hard to find someone to transact with
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:20:03
I don't see much difference and it's still blatant spam with the intent even in the fucking title. absolute cancer

Who cares about spam and fees when you can hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:38:48
You got legacy addresses for some and new bech32 for others. Some might use both and if you do you will be able to transaction with both groups
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:36:18
They did fix the blocksize issue so there is that 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:33:28
name discovery is not the problem but routing is. So rather than blockchain DNS you would need blockchain BGP.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:10:53
segwit is nothing but a block size increase but cleverly implemented to be retrocompatible. so what are we gonna do in 6 months? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:10:39
When do we soft fork to phase out the legacy inputs? That should get things moving

That's a naive way of looking at it and makes you over estimate to what degree bitcoin is decentralised. p2p scales well but the idea that adding more nodes makes it better is simply not true.

nah, I can't be bothered
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:09:30
segwit txs are not actually smaller but otherwise you are right that it does bring some other benefits but the only feature of segwit that matters at this point is the limit increase it brings
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:28:22
Bring it on!
It's censorship resistant money without government control so lets put that to the test. Maybe they can scare away some of the get-rich-quickers for us.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:11:55
it's not exactly a novel idea as such. There is a lot of speculation and theorising on the implications of that trivial change but very few hard data points. Putting it to the test is a good way of finding out. It was also discovered how NOT to write an EDA. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:51:56
segwit is making the blocks bigger so the limited use is helping the network survive. don't ruin it. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:00:57
The redeem script is the same size as always and it even adds a couple of extra bytes. It is more efficient in terms of block weight than legacy txs because the witness is counted as fewer bytes but that doesn't change the size needed on the wire and on disk.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:51:24
Why is it needed? You could still watch the network for txs spending from the channel even if the tx in question was malleated

Sir, I think you dropped your tinfoil hat
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:16:02
The keys are only stored on the ledger and that's where signing happens. The nano ask you for the pin before doing that though same as always 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:08:39
your source is bullshit. It may be segregated but it's still part of tx and part of the block although in a extension space not understood by older clients. To fully validate transactions you still need to download the same amount of data per tx and even some extra bytes on top.
The conclusion is hyperbole but if you are worried about blocksize using segwit is not helping 
@_date: 2018-05-03 09:51:07
You are consistently dropping significant digits from the mbtc listing. What gives?
@_date: 2018-05-03 11:03:57

it will not be mined by vanilla nodes as the transaction would be non-standard by today's rules. but not invalid so it could be included in a block. but that means it has to be miner initiated

@_date: 2017-08-24 16:08:34
as long as the portion faking is &lt;50% the soft fork will eventually be able to attack the chain out of existence. If it's more than that things could indeed get very intresting

and that's only syncing the legacy part of the chain. sad times. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:16:38
nah dude. segwit could be disabled with a soft fork using a simple rule like "blocks may not contain segwit txs". it's not exactly a reversal but in practice the segwit rules would be redundant 
not the same as stopping to signal like the GP asked but a HF is not the only way 
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:03:26

eh pretty mediocre level crazy for being luke-jr
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:50:25
Sure, I'll try to address what I think is the main confusion here but understand this too is an simplification.
We can view the miner as being rewarded coins by the network for finding the block. But how does the network decide to award these coins? Well, the same way it decides on anything at all; by recording it in a block. What goes in the block is up to each individual miner as long as it follows the rules of a valid block, collectively we decide what block to accept next by proof of work.
when constructing a block you are allowed to include a special conibase tx that pays some newly minted coin and any fees from the block, who gets these coins are completely up the miner and no surprise they decide to pay themselves and thus the output for the coinbase will be different for every miner.  So in a way you can say you award yourself those coins and the network validates it because you have the POW to back it up
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:55:28
it doesn't matter if all start at 0 because your blocks will be different as you will have different coinbase transactions (at least)
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:58:24
u mad bro?
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:11:49
that's just fucking stupid. it's like saying facebook is a denial of service attack on myspace. miners are free to leave and do whatever and it's not illegal to promote your alternative 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:16:28
You're not going to see people calling for bigger blocks here as most people who tried to push for that direction is on bitcoin cash or some other alternative instead. I don't think 1 (or 4 in adverserial conditions) is the magic number to fix the unbounded growth of the bitcoin blockchain but at the same time it's not allowing the network to grow at this point. which I think is a mistake.
Exciting times ahead and I'm not trying to pick winners so my coins stays cold in bitcoin which I'm willing to bet will at least stay around
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:03:44
it is activated now though and it's not like we're looking at months of backlog this grew over the past couple of days 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:57:40
I'm not arguing it's not a shitty move but bitcoin is not built on the assumption that people will be nice. We assume rational players that want to maximise their on gain, nothing else.
it's obviously not illegal and the GP calling for jail time is sad to see and flies in the face of the anarchist ideals I associate with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:03:00
From what I've seen 2x is not that popular with bitcoin cash maximalist because they prefer a "crippled" bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:30:19
Calling it anti-competitive I could see but even that is usually reserved for business entities in a power position abusing that to keep out smaller players. And with how many are talking about disrupting this and disrupting that both in crypto and the tech startup scene I don't think it would fly either. but IANAL.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:17:35
it's still a move in the right direction to help clarify the difference between a protocol and a reference implementation. I agree it would be nice to see even more (spec aligned) clients and even special purpose variants such as geared to miners or geared to power electrum servers

@_date: 2017-11-14 07:59:25
Taking the hashpower away in bursts is a means to the end of establishing "the real bitcoin" as the main sha256 coin. EDA is a means to an end. I'm surprised Peter is being this blunt about what the goals of EDA is but I don't think he is running any real risk of legal repercussions 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:59:38
So would you argue that every miner mining any coin except bitcoin is effectively joining in an DoS of the bitcoin network?
or, is orchestrating this by giving miners incentives (hey, get your free money here) turning it into a crime?
How is this different from, say, offering a discount on pizza to mess with your competitor?
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:33:32
I'm sure it would be nice to dictate what these companies do but trying to force rules on them would not be in the spirit of the bitcoin I signed up for. But you don't have to capitulate to these bank wannabes if you take control of your own keys like bitcoin was intended to work

It's not like nodes are voting on what's an invalid transaction, these rules are fixed and changing them leads to a fork. Your client will verify these rules even when catching up with weeks of blocks when you power it back on.

Well that could be said about pretty much any assets. For sure bitcoin itself and even stocks of a company. Sure there might be more work behind it to give them value but the actual tokens and the stocks are also created out of thin air.

of course it's fair you knew about this possibility when you started using bitcoin. If it's better is highly subjective and being permissionless means everyone is allowed to work towards what they think is better.
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:17:31
Jumping to the hardfork would be very risky. A more reasonable option would be to use the same trick but require the bip148 version bit to not be set which also is a tightening of the rules. That way bip148 would safely fork off from the old chain without attacking it.

hmm, I don't get what the issue would be.
A random nonce string does not represent anything at all. it's not like your signing a contract with a meaning if you were to sign "fweepfZXcPpPJ7N2ioXdGmJVSHb".
A username + timestamp would be fairly unique too but I rather not risk at just go with a totally random nonce string. From a ux perspective it's kinda shitty to see that scary string but that could be helped by some pretty text around it like maybe "Authenticating for session htao213esTNHknth at spamegg.com"

I havn't read that much about StasoshiDice but the gist of what I gathered the problem is that it "floods" the network with small transactions?
I really have no idea what direction I want to take with the game if I ever get around to, but desiging around that should be possible. Like grouping together stuff to one big transaction when you "visit the merchant in town".
Losing control of the address is ofcourse a problem, but if that happens you might also have bigger problems than losing access to some online account. Having the option the provide a email might be a good idea.
