Bitcoin as an investment is strong, but anyone saying it's a sure thing in any realistic sense is delusional.

This foam looks like it says  
that if a person has a different opinion about the efficacy of a 51% attack  
then the general consensus of the bitcoin community  
that means that they don't know about economics.

It's the first large cryptocurrency, no other currency can say that. So at the very least, a bitcoin from today (considering the market says it still has value) has the intrinsic value of being a limited antique.
The average consumer will accept whatever currency they can be convinced has stable and universal value, and bitcoin is being heavily monitored on this front.

what do you have to say about this
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:39:47
the security of cryptography is not a proven science  
and even if theory holds up, bitcoin could at any time tank instantly against some other cryptocoin, because of a perceived bug in the protocol, or for any other reason
investment in bitcoin is faith in the unknown
@_date: 2014-06-28 23:59:17
It might not be irrational, given how much they know about the efficacy of bitcoin.
No matter how you look at it this is a faith-based investment, so you can imagine how most people would be skeptical of what they hear.

I would guess feathered around, probably from around $700-800/btc down to maybe $500/btc (or at least close to the next highest bidder), unless whoever got them didn't want to fuck around with losing.
I assume the discreteness of dealing directly with the usms had a pretty big part in why they bought these coins instead of market coins, but can't imagine why they wouldn't consider it fair to risk losing a few of the blocks by lowballing.
And everybody else was apparently lowballing, from what I'm hearing...

newegg is great news for us  
usms auction is reassuring to us  
but there are lots of coins available for under $700, and until there aren't, the price will stay below $700

Bitcoin right now is only a few years old, and is already starting to be accepted by a few adventurous businesses as 'stable enough'.
Its main goal is to be a currency that can remain relatively safe from meddling by third parties- this may not directly effect you personally at the moment, but it has the potential for powerful effects when pitted against the inflationary policies of most 'normal' currencies, and so far btc has been pretty resilient (we'll see how that goes, after this second round of usgovernment bitcoins).
Bitcoins cannot pander to consumers like creditcards can, but just because you can't get reward points or whatever from using them, doesn't mean it "won't ever garner popularity" or that it "literally offers no benefits"- if you like your currency, you can keep using it. A lot of powerful people are heavily invested in USD and euros, and we've worked preventing economic collapse into something of a science. Bitcoin is just an experiment to run parallel to those experiments.

Imagine you sell child porn on the internet.
Since it's super secure and anonymous, I pay you for the child porn, in bitcoins.
I also pay for a gift for my wife with bitcoins, because I'm just covered in bitcoins.
Since you're a really sloppy dealer and never launder your bitcoins, you get caught soon enough, and your bitcoin addresses are seized.
The cops, in their spare time, investigate the blockchain, and see that some address has paid both your bitcoin address and a bitcoin address belonging to the cop's mother's sex shop.
When they look up the sex shop sales records (dutifully kept for tax purposes), they manage to link that payment with my credit card, and therefore me.
This is the kind of thing they're referring to, when they describe bitcoin addresses and payments as 'dirty', 'tainted', or 'illegal'.
