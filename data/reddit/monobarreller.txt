Then feel free to explain it.

[Cointube.tv](  ) is a great site for free coins.  Just let the youtube videos run in the background.  And to be honest some of the videos aren't half bad.

Fair enough.  I didn't even thing about that particular subreddit.  Although I am surprised by the animosity towards my questions.  It was asked from a purely innocent place.

Just curious but where do you see the value of bitcoin going?  Personally I feel that the sky is the limit given that there will only be a finite amount of bitcoins.

No I can't prove anything it's just something I've observed from the chart Mt.Gox provides.  Take a look yourself and see if you don't notice it as well.

I apologize if my post was in any way redundant.  My intention wasn't to scare people or cause any alarm.  I'm not knowledgeable enough to provide any technical analysis, which is why I was asking the question.  I was just curious to see if anyone else had noticed a potential trend and if anyone had any theories regarding why it was occurring (assuming it is occurring).

Yeah I've noticed that as well in this sub.  It's like how some people are with their favorite bands.  It's like they turn into hipsters.  I don't really have much in the way of empirical evidence since all I'm doing is looking at the Mt.Gox chart and tracking the times when there have been significant drops.  They all seem to occur around one or two o'clock US EST.  I was just curious to know if anyone else noticed it or if I was being paranoid.

That's what I was curious about.  I've only been following bitcoins since the beginning of the year so I don't know if what I was observing is a usual daily trend of say day traders dumping what they have at a particular time or if it's a group of people looking to just muck up the market.

Why on earth are you only doing this on random walls?  Your skills are quite impressive.  You need to be selling your work in a gallery son!  Love the promotional idea, too!

At this juncture the best pitch I could make to someone about using bitcoins would be the concept of using bitcoins for currency trading purposes.  Because it is a decentralized currency it is in less danger of falling due to inflation and downturns in an economy.  Also because it is a worldwide currency, fees most companies charge to exchange a currency with another are almost non-existent.  If your friend is an American for example, it would be a good idea to invest a portion of their money into bitcoins purely as a way to stave off the effects of inflation and quantitative easing.  As the dollar becomes more devalued the value of the bitcoin currency will increase.  I would show them the price charts of bitcoins versus the dollar over the past couple years, the increase in comparative value is immense and will only rise.  Also because there is only a finite amount of bitcoins that will ever exist, as more and more businesses begin to accept bitcoins as a legitimate form of payment, the scarcity of the bitcoins will raise the over-all value as well.  This is a high growth currency which has a great potential to increase in value over a short period of time.

I don't use a window's phone but I'm sure it's a niche that has yet to be filled and I say go for it.  You may actually make something useful out of it.  At the very least it's something you can use in a portfolio.

I'm not trying to be rude or to cause speculation.  It is merely an observation that I've noticed for the past week or so.  I didn't realize people would be hostile towards the questions.

Why do you think Friday will be such a bad day?
