Claiming it's not a bubble is quite retarded, honestly.
The currency is currently floated with millions of lightweight investors who'll sell at any signs of a bubble (people, mind you, who doesn't even know how block chain technology works). The bubble becomes reality if *people* think there's a bubble, regardless of the technology behind it. 
There are loads of ponzi schemes in Africa promising riches for anyone taking huge loans to buy in on the Bitcoin train. There are tons of people in China (as well as US and the rest of the world) taking on loans just to invest in a currency which doesn't have any functionality other than investment. 
That's not even mentioning the energy consumption behind Bitcoin at the moment which is irresponsibly ridiculously enormous. 
Nor the fact that Wallstreet is beginning to bet on the future market of Bitcoin (just like before the most recent bubble in 2008, and the same phenomenon before the first bubble ever recorded, the tulip bubble).  
Let's not forget that there's likely a few hundred people sitting on a great portion of all bitcoins out there, whom all have tremendous power in the outcome of the currency. If they start bailing, lightweight investors will panic. Tadaa.
Let's not forget that legislation could be on it's way in various countries which could fuck it all up. Crypto-currencies are a highly effective way to avoid taxes, which isn't in the interest of most governments in the world. 
Lastly, the main argument in favor of bitcoin is "the technology behind it". What happens when superior currencies reach main stream attention?
