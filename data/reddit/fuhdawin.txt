"Experts" predicting bitcoin's impending doom is nothing new. Does anyone remember Professor Mark Williams, a top economist who is so well regarded that he has been called to testify before Congress many times? In late 2013, he predicted that bitcoin would crash from $1200 to under $10 within the next 6 months [1]. After he was proven wrong, he revised his claim to say that the crash would happen eventually. I guess he was smart not to attach another date to his prediction, lest he be humiliated a second time.
Until these economists are willing to put testable specifics to their predictions (bitcoin will drop to under $X within Y weeks), or are at least taking short positions to back up their beliefs, no one should take them too seriously.
In contrast, the Winklevoss Twins correctly predicted Bitcoin's rise and become Bitcoin billionaires in the process. But they're not selling because they think it will go up much further [2]. Unlike the economists here, the Winklevii are putting their money where their mouths are.
Time will tell if they're right.

Does anyone know the real price of Bitcoin in USD? The price swings make me nervous that it's going to be a speculative bubble.

In the end Bitcoin is so similar to Gold. It is a means of storing wealth and is valued on a shared belief of finite quantities and that it is an effective/secure means of storing wealth.
It is hard for me to call a shared belief a bubble, because there is a clear understanding I think now that there is no underlying fundamental asset value.

I did a quick look up on Coinbase's security features. They claim that over 98% of their assets are stored in offline vaults. - 
I'm not sure how the fallout would be for insurance purposes in the event that they actually do get hacked since cryptocurrencies are not insured by the FDIC.

I think the Tulip comparison is a poor comparison to Bitcoin.
- Tulip mania was concentrated to specific parts of Europe vs. a global market.
- Tulip bulbs are perishable items that you have to repurchase when they go bad so they cannot store value.
- Tulip bulbs have an infinite supply since you can always grow more, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million and there will never be another.
- Anyone can plant seeds to grow a tulip bulb whereas mining a bitcoin has real costs associated with it ($800 to $2,000).
- Tulip bulbs cannot cure poverty and starvation in the world. Bitcoin has already been very useful in countries like Venezuela where inflation of their own currency is causing poverty.

I'm playing devil's advocate here and looking at it from an average user's perspective getting into cypto. Coinbase says they don't provide private keys due to their "cold storage" technology and likely related to their security policies. If most people are using BTC to invest and convert to fiat, why would anyone want to go through transferring BTC to a cold hardware wallet when the company says they already secure it for you on an enterprise scale? Wouldn't it be easier for an average user to convert to fiat or vice versa using an exchange rather than accessing it through cold hard wallet storage?

What's the point of having your BTC on GDAX versus Coinbase? I know about the lower fees and market interface on GDAX but what about security features on GDAX? Is there any point just to have BTC soley on GDAX?

Sorry, noob here. I have bitcoins in a coinbase account. Can you tell me the benefits as to why I should move it to cold storage instead of leaving it in coinbase? 
How would I go about moving to a cold storage account?

Who even knew Bitcoin would even have such explosive growth with it was initially created in the first place? I think governments are watching Bitcoin very carefully because it may interfere with the global financial structure.

When I first bought bitcoin through Coinbase, it took about 7 days for the bank to transfer the money to them. At least when you purchase it, it locks in the sales price of bitcoin at the time that you've purchased it.
