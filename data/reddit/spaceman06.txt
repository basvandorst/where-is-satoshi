This is a wrong joke, with bitcoin the 1500% would be what you would get if you sold it, what you would get from the investment you made.
With school you get education and what increased by 1500% is the price to get education and not how smart you will become if you go to college. So the profit from wasting money with college (unlike bitcoin) didnt increased by 1500%

Yes, you need to pay with taxes, the thing is, even if you dont pay taxes (is a homeless person, o part of a indigenous tribe or is a baby) you will still have acess to the healthcare.

No they dont, you dont need to pay taxes to get the free healthcare.
Homeless peoeple can go to hospital, babies can go to hospital. And there is not "life tax" where you pay tax just because of the fact you are alive, there are tax when you buy something, for owning a car, for owning a house.....

All fiat currencies are inflationary, while bitcoin will have a limited supply of 2100000000 bitcoins. To bitcoin crash hard, the price would need to decrease faster than the fiat prices decrease. Not saying its impossible but to some coin with limited supply decrease his price faster than inflationary coins, they must be doing something REALLY REALLY WRONG.

Yes, the smallest bitcoin vallue is 0.00000001 bitcoin, called satochi. 1 vietinamese dong (most undervalued fiat coin right now) is worth 0.44 satochis.

Of course ICO are cancer, money represents wealth, its not wealth itself. By having ICO the money sent to developer (that represent wealth) still exist and you now also have the coin, so wealth (or wealth representation) was created out of nowhere.
If you want to do 100% premine, just do proof of burn of another specific coin, or let people do proof of X until month Z, with the coins being sent to the wallet only at month Z.

The smallest amount of bitcoins is 0.00000001 bitcoins (called satochi). So unless you are a vietnamese children that have only 1 vietnamese dong (1 vietinamese dong is worth 0.44 satoshis or somethig like that) you can buy some amount of bitcoin.

I go further than that, at my opinion the cryptocoins must be premined (all coins are already distributed when they can started to be traded between wallets, with no new coins created after it), with the mining of transaction fees.
