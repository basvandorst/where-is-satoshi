This would be very very very good for the btc price if it works this way

I think if they arent actually buying btc then it isnt that much of a help.

I just dont see ETF's doing anything unless they are buying actual BTC. If they peg to the price then I dont think ETF's help BTC price at all.

Err mer gahd the market went down 2 %. Fucking shill completely disregards the insane market run up since Trump was elected. The market has to go down at some point.
