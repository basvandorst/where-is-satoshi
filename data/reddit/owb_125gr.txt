If you don't deposit to the same address twice, you can't spend from it twice. 
Don't send money to the same address multiple times.


There isnt a fool-proof way to detect a weak RNG other than copious code review and statistical analysis. I wouldnt worry about it too much, other than to use a wallet you trust.

Why not 2:1 , it seems more accurate than 3:1.
The buyer could be out double the price at worst, (full retail cost of product, plus equal value in coins)
the seller at worst double the price (double the cost in coins)
It still favors the seller in the worst L/L case, because he could be a hostile/fake seller who is
willing to spend 1 btc to cost the mark 2btc. And getting 50% of the original cost back is
more than enough to motivate the buyer to finish the transaction the the W/W case.

First off, bip38 doesnt make wallets, it makes single privates, which can be hard to use safely. Most people use them wrong and I mean even smarter tech-savvy ones.
Also, with a random bip38 private key you lose the paper you lose the money..
I'd recommend using an electrum or BIP44 recovery phrase (such as mycelium) for your cold-storage. Much easier to memorize if you choose to do so, and when loaded into a wallet for return to a hot wallet it is much easier to use them safely.

these steps are missing from the initial images, and they wont work.
They also cause a problem; the buyer is incentivized now to never complete the sale, as he will get his 3btc back, not just 2btc.
I'd instead suggest no refund transaction, but instead using a coin-join in step 1.5.
Formulate the initial two deposits by getting unspent and change proposals for both sides, then sign the initial deposits joined. That way step 2 works, and both parties are locked in with an incentive to complete the transaction.
Also, I think 1:2 ratio would work better than a 1:3.

"Banks" will have a role, in fact plenty of roles
* OBC transactions. This can save huge amounts of coin, especially as txfee's go up. Pay directly in btc for your latte, with no or a very small overhead cost, then settle at the end of the month.
* Multig Escrow Arbiters; When dealing with special cases, like a house purchase or a trust fund, a banker could offer to be an impartial arbiter, for a fee.
* Coin Coloring administrator: for a small fee, they could organize a company's stock and provide them helpful trading tools to help stockholders trade without bleeding color, and the company pay dividends.
I think the main problem is these are not at all what banks do today...

Not if he also gets the merchandise. He is the buyer after all. Pre-refunded escrow is the same
as no escrow; why even post it in the first place if it isnt binding.




Which is a totally safe state. They can either post the transaction to the blockchain or not. If they wont post it to the blockchain, its the same as never signing. If only one party signed, and gets tired of waiting they can sweep the inputs away, making the old signature invalid




Can you elaborate ? I see that it only makes your first use case stronger, and in no way diminishes it. 
Also, your second use case is unworkable, as I illustrated.




3rd party escrow is better for some use cases, such as when there is a trusted arbiter. But I can see tons of use cases for this new idea, i think trustless escrow is a great concept!

You could just as easily create 10 BIP44 wallet pass-phrases, and store those in an encrypted text file in multiple locations. 
Its much easier to use than the individual random privates, which can only safely be used once. And it gives you an option to store BTC in your memory!

Its worth clarifying that step 2 requires a Coin-Joined transaction.
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:48:06
Care to elaborate?
I'm suggesting that if A deposits before B, or B deposits before A, that the funds are now at risk, becuase the other party has no incentive to rectify.
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:40:56


Were you proposing not needing a join to enable step 2 ?
If join-less, refunds wont help anything. If joined, then the refund transactions are superfluous, and pointless.
(you dont need a refund transaction to sweep a coin you own. You can sweep them at will)
Joining is the key part to enable step 2, would you agree ?
You do realize that you cannot post a partially signed transaction to the blockchain- it must be fully signed. Nor can you sweep part of a coin value - you must fully destroy a coin to sweep it.




This proposal is exactly having escrow without having a 3rd party trusted arbiter.
It also eliminates some of the need to trust the other party, because it removes 
the W/L and L/W outcomes in prisoners dilemma, and leaves only a choice 
between W/W and L/L. In that sense, its very clever.

This is why we need BIP70, bitcoin payment protocol.
The point is exactly so that you can prove/verify what you are buying from whom, and what address the funds should go to, and so that you can keep a receipt to prove what you paid for.
Nearly no commerce sites support it as of now, most bitcoin transactions are cash-like with no receipts.

You dont have to reverse the hash.
The elecrum read only wallet, which is held on the insecure computer, has the master public. With that you can compute the hash forwards, not backwards.
With a single given private key, you can combine it with the hash to calculate the root secret, and from there calculate any possible private key in the wallet.

Only if you are bitcoin illiterate.
There are quite a few good and cheap ways to tumble your coins up.

That makes no sense. (you do realize the block reward is not permanent?)
The cost is electricity and equipment. 
The operative  price affecting factor is the block reward:
Since there still is a block reward, there is built in inflation. When the bitcoin economy, specifically new hoarders, are not growing fast enough to account for that inflation, the price drops.

A trezor is a dedicated piece of hardware that stores your private key collections (i.e. wallet) for you.
It follows the BIP44 standard for wallet design, which means its super compatible with other wallet software if you want to switch one day.  It also means you can easily back up your wallet with a memorizeable password in case you ever lose your trezor or it breaks.
The advantage of trezor over other bip44 wallets is that you can use it from windows to some extent. Windows is never going to be really safe for handling money or secrets, but a hardware wallet can remove some of the risk. You can still be tricked into sending money to the wrong place, but at least your private keys will stay secret. 
I think bitcoin wont reach the masses until there are many hardware wallets available, or else windows goes out of common usage.

because they may not scan for unspents again in a single use disposable address.
The right thing to do is not put more than one coin into an address.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:57:04


I see, so the method you are using to form transactions is imperfect.
if you can, try to remember or tract the exact amount in each address, such that
combined with the TXfee, you never have change. Since you are only making
transactions from cold-&gt; hot, and never spending directly, you should be able to make sure
that electrum never makes change.
     


The risk is low, but the damage is high enough (total loss of all private keys) that it is absolutely worth ensuring that you dont re-use an address.

There are a few more things you can do or be aware of:
(1) Never send more than one transaction to and one from a single from an address, even
if it means losing some money. A single reuse can lead to a compromised private, which in an electrum wallet could lead to a compromise of ALL past and future private keys. So dont re-use unless you are ready to permanently sweep and retire the entire wallet.
(2) Dont use the same computer if it ever connects to any network. You can buy a refurb 120$ laptop to dedicate to offline electrum.  if you can, build a USB boot key that has elecrtrum included. (Tails might, perhaps some others)
(3) never export a single private key for any reason.
(4) Dont spend directly from the cold wallet. use very few transactions from cold storage. Its better to make relatively fewer bigger coin moves into a hot wallet, and do your spending from the hot wallet. Have total privacy when you use your cold wallet, and dont be in a rush.

In case (1), a poor RNG + reuse of a private leads to compromised private, this is well known.


Not use as in receiving, but signing transactions from the same private key.


Most people dont share their private keys, luckily. The same thing affects BIP32,
you can read it in the BIP. It is important to understand the risk. For example,
you should never export private keys to paper cash if they came from a deterministic wallet.
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:43:02
Its an alternate child key derivation method described in BIP32 which requires knowledge of the parent private key, rather than only the public part. 
Its not as useful as public derivation, however, so it is usually only used in the path to make different accounts, for example, and not for individual receive addresses.

So far, only with a weak RNG. A user exporting a private, for example by making bip38 cash,
is another possible weakness.

"The blockchain" does have a very specific meaning too, I've seen it used that way, but its not the same thing as the p2p network of fullnodes. Andreas calls the whole technology as "blockchain technology" rather than the more commonly used "cryptocurrency"
I still think the word bitcoin is pretty heavily overloaded, and to deal with the confusion people seem to like to talk about "dollars worth of bitcoin" so they can grasp the amount. 
Its ironic how something as hideously complex as the dollar is considered by most people to be obvious and intuitive while something as simple and straight forward as bitcoin leaves people confused...
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:20:59












Still wont work:
In order for each side to know what they are signing, the funds have to be already
deposited. You cannot sign any hash I send to you, I could be robbing you blind
by making a TX to send all the funds to me. You should only sign a transaction that
you can fully see; not a hash. And for a transaction to be valid, you need the
TxIn's to be fully signed. 
This gives you a dillema, Either I trust you by giving you a fully signed deposit
that I havent yet posted to the blockchain (and hope you dont post it) Or you trust
me by signing a hash with no provenance (opening up any number of crypto attacks)
A coin join works like this: I send you a list of coins and a change address. You send
me a list of coins and a change address. We agree on a minimum depth for the inputs.
I form a proposed transaction which will move our agreed upon amounts into the escrow, 
and provide my part of the signature. You review the transaction, and sign your part
if you agree. You post it to the blockchain, and the escrow is in place. We now both
have a good incentive to complete the transaction W/W

Exactly. Ripple has always been a scam.

Your computer, untrusted as it is, can look up your coins on the blockchain network.
It can also help you find out the address of the merchant from whom you want to buy something, and form that into a transaction which would spend your coins, and give them to the merchant. 
The trezor only has to take the transaction and complete it with a signature. It must trust that the transaction has been formed correctly by your computer.
The biggest risk IMO is a piece of malware on your computer that substitutes a false address for the merchant's real address. and causes you to send money to the wrong place. At least you only risk the transaction at stake, and not your entire wallet.
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:49:24


Yes, agreed. I'm considering making a wallet that gives more control of individual coins, and more precise control over change, etc. Ideally it would need coinjoin built in to every transaction. 
One main feature would be automatically quarantining any second coins received at an already used address, and helping the user to safely sweep/and close down the whole account before allowing the quarantined coins to be spent.
Today I do all my cold storage with command line tools.


Good insight. It is less safe in some cases: each unspent you want to close does need a separate signature. Ideally, there should really only ever be a single coin (unspent transaction) deposited to a single address. 
Sometimes it is necessary to sweep together many smaller coins into a larger one, and many times in which someone would choose to factor a large coin into many smaller ones.  But there is no reason why those ever need to go into a single address. Both for privacy and crypto safety, one coin per address is the best practice in both cases.

If the buyer had to pay a premium over the price into escrow, which is refundable

Step 2 is weak, unless it is a single joined transaction.
This means you need a fancy step 1.5 in which both sides agree on which unspents and change addresses get involved in step 2.
