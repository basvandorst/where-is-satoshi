When you say "saved" do you mean savings? 
If that's the case then don't even bother. If you're bleeding savings into rent, bills and food then putting your **income** into bitcoins is stupid. 
Invest in bitcoin by all means, but only from positive money. If the only reason you have money to spend on bitcoin is because you are burning your savings on expenses, then you're out of our mind.

Most restaurants won't if you **don't** tip. It's when you insult them by giving them what amounts to a scrap of paper. 
And to OP, it doesn't matter what the tip was worth, they're bitcoins. You can buy and sell real things in bitcoin now, but that doesn't meant at all that you can just give bitcoin in lieu of normal cash unless you give a huge amount of information to them. 
Also won't comment on the already upvoted point about you assuming they'd love them some bitcoin just because they're chinese.

There's little pressure for it. If you think about the current benefits of bitcoin:
* Cheaper cost of sending money
* Tax evasion / avoidance
* Ideological opposition to fiat currency
* Ability to spend freely without government interference
Then only the 1st really applies to India. Tax evasion is rife there, India doesn't have a particularly libertarian bent, and what they call "black money" is a common part of life. 
Add to that the fact that the Indian banking system is nowhere near as developed as China and there's not really a hugely persuasive reason to use it. 
More jokingly too, Indians are huge purchasers of gold. They've already got bitcoin 1.0.
