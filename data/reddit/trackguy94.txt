Technically you can exchange any cryptocurrency for any other cryptocurrency, so long as the exchange that you're using allows trading between those specific cryptocurrencies. Like others in the thread have said, I'd stick with using a service like Bitpay and Coinbase. Another good one that accepts bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, and vertcoin is Moolah.io. Moolah lets you either keep the coins you get, or immediately exchange for fiat money. Personally, I'd go with Moolah due to accepting a wide variety of different cryptocurrencies. However, Coinbase has some very prominent investors, and I've also heard really good things about Bitpay. In the end it's up to you, I'm sure with a little research you'll be able to find which service would best fit your business model. Good luck!

Exactly, most people don't have the extra money to go out and buy an off-contract phone because they don't feel like jailbreaking. Nowadays, jailbreaking is beyond easy.

I was cheif executive of a popsicle stand in front of my house one time when I was eight.

That's awesome! He came to my school on Friday, it was a wicked cool experience. His talk was great too. Did you get the Wrecking Ball kazoo/recorder remix?

Ah ok, thank you!

Apple would never cripple html5 on the iphone just to stop bitcoin. That would be extremely counterproductive.

Forgive my ignorance but what's happening on Friday/Saturday?

I was so surprised when that started playing. It has to be some sort of in-joke with him and his book tour crew or something.

If you breathe it in, it can *kill* you.

I love  when my little state gets recognition, especially for something as cool as this.

Yeah, and they can't so they're stuck in that infinite loop. Round and round they go.

No man, he killed himself. Don't you remember? Geez.

The comment section on that article hurts my brain.

If you jailbreak you can get the blockchain app.

You're right that doge definitely does attract a lot of new users. I first discovered bitcoin a couple years ago when playing around with the tor network (unfortunately I didn't get into it then.) But now with bitcoin becoming more popular, I decided that doge would be an easy way to learn more about cryptocurrencies. It's fun, light-hearted, and easy to get into. 
Since then I've gotten more into bitcoin but I still think that dogecoin has more of a purpose than as just a niche coin for meme-obsessed teens. It's good for microtransactions like tipping and small donations. 
Dogecoin isn't taking users from bitcoin, nor is it trying to. They're different cryptocurrencies with different purposes. I think a lot of the hate comes from people assuming that doge is trying to surpass or replace bitcoin (which would be absolutely ludicrous.) Doge is just a fun and light-hearted cryptocurrency that's completely different than bitcoin. I don't see any reason they can't coexist.

I just downloaded it about an hour ago and was able to link it to my blockchain.info wallet.

That just happened to me. I heard about apple pulling it so I went to check it on my phone, and it's suddenly gone. At least I'm jailbroken so I can download the cydia version.

Haha it definitely is attention-getting. I'm loving the book, too!

You're making it sound a lot worse than it actually is. The only thing that this will do is replace coins that are lost or become inaccessible over time, and maybe add a little more. They're not just going to start pumping out an infinite amount of coins to make them worthless. 
Besides, Doge and BTC have completely different demographics. Doge is for tipping, small donations, microtransactions, and things like that. BTC is for more serious purchases, or even regular transactions on a day-to-day basis. Just because there may be a little overlap doesn't mean that two cryptocurrencies with mostly different purposes can't coexist.

I can't remember the exact thread, but the other day an account for Blockchain commented and said that even though the app was removed from the app store, it was still available in cydia.

Another anecdote: I tweaked my back one time, and was having lower back pain for about a year that would get aggravated by bending down or getting up after sitting down. After two sessions I have no more pain, and that was about 6 months ago. 
I think that just like anything else, there are good and bad chiropractors, and you just have to go in trusting the chirporactor's specific reputation and knowing what to expect. In fact I've never even heard of chiropractors that claim to cure diseases or whatever else as some other commentors are saying, I've only seen ones that claim to be essentially physical therapists who specialize on the spine and back.
