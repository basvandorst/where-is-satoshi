You made more than six dollars with this post. I am beginning to understand the power of bitcoin.

Is bitkey.io legit?

Today I suggested to the lunch deli person that she accept Bitcoin to avoid credit card fees. She had never heard of it. She was really intrigued, though, and asked me to write the word down.

Yeah, they should pick a sober, serious, businesslike name like Google.

Everybody loves him, which means he is probably the antiChrist.

Yes. A thousand times, yes.

Simplicity is not condescension. Also drawing association is a powerful explanatory tool.

This was fun.

Then why are the miners evidently OK with it? I keep hearing they have all the real power, and that they remain aligned with core.
It seems safe to presume that the miners want the system to succeed. Therefore the miners must disagree with your analysis. Which makes no sense, your reasoning is sound.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:26:10
agreed. That name really pulls the room together.

Yes. He's just a man and is as corruptible as any of us.

Prove it.

oooh, breakthrough. Come on. Hug it out.

What you're planting could be a tree, or a bomb. You can't tell. When's the best time to plant?

Well, just spitballing here. Maybe CW didn't take the easy path because he couldn't, but not because he's not Satoshi, but because he was trying to prove to the world that he's not Satoshi even though he is. 
If that were the case, it would be consistent with Satoshi's desire to remain anonymous, and also require some gyrations. If anyone can come up with a simpler way he could "prove" he's not SN, then I'm wrong. 
Please understand: I'm not saying CW is SN. I don't really care, honestly. I just think it's possible. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:37:09
haha, why do you keep saying this wrong thing.

Was he...crying...at the end there?

So the problem is that someone is very rich? 
Why is that a problem?

Friedman was an economist, not a computer scientist. Doesn't seem likely.

Are you not aware that gold has inherent value as a mineral, but bitcoin has zero inherent value? Bitcoin is not gold 2.0, it's dollar 2.0. Using bitcoin as a currency (not an asset) is critical to it's survival, because without that it has no purpose and no value.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:16:53
who are the pros?
edit: this was a sincere question, not a test or challenge.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:16:34
They are not a bank, they are an exchange/warehouse. There is no fractional reserve lending of bitcoins. (Yet.)

I'm sorry, that wasn't nearly nice enough. Rejected.

Austrian.

You mean Austrian economics I think.

Everyone, no exceptions, is willing to ignore mountains of evidence to fit their own worldview. Bias is normal, impartiality is illusory.

Many use "libertarian" to mean anarcho-libertarian, which Ron Paul is not. He is more precisely a constitutionalist, since he believes there is a role for government.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:31:56
What does "it does not have equal legal status with currency" mean precisely? 
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:45:04
Correct. Not sure why you are being downvoted. Anarchists, perhaps.
