Its not tied to anything.  If the dollar went away we would tie it to cows.

Gold has been around for a few thousand years and there is probably noone in your area that takes it.

A reply in the post. 
When I started CNET everyone talked about HTML, telnet, gopher, usenet, FTP, etc. When I left CNET in 2000 few people spoke of these terms. Importantly very few people used FTP software in 2000, but millions of people used CNET Download.com each day as a service.
We went from a world where few people used the Internet and all referenced the technologies of the Internet to today where most everyone uses the Internet but few speak of its technologies. That shows consumer adoption.
At Bitreserve we want to revolutionize money the same way at CNET we revolutionized content and Salesforce.com software. We want EVERYONE to use digital currency, including "consumers" and especially the unbanked. I think we all share the same mission so let's not pick at each other when we still have a very long way to go to make this revolution real in the world.

Looks like I'm replying to a bagholder right now.  Unless someone is this bitter just for the fun of it. :D

I skipped through and didn't hear anything about Bitcoin.  How about giving people a time?

Kind of strange that the OP of that thread signed up in June 2011.  
Most of us that have been here that long, and seen the stuff we've seen are just like "meh".

How do you think the playstore will handle it, with its no gambling policy?  Its pretty broad, but they state that games of skill that offer payouts in cash or other things of value are not allowed. 
I only ask this because I am in the middle of making a game that does something like this.  (nothing like your game btw)
