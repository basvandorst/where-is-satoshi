Roger Ver said in his AMA that they would be adding Bitcoin Cash functionality to coinbase 2 days ago. 
And part of the reason for the increase, people like me bought before and right after in anticipation of an increase. Not everyone agrees with SegWit, or wants it.

How do you know where the bottom is? Bitcoin is much like the stock market, it is much hard to predict than "waiting for the bottom"

I have a gmail news alert for bitcoin set up. I have found that is the best way to get close. Usually I buy the shit out of it when it drops below 600.

Do tell me, O wizard of currency and all that is of worth; what makes bitcoin or fiat money have worth? The only thing standing behind money is peoples willingness to use it. Bitcoins "value" is 100% only based on peoples desire to have it. As long as true believers are around, the currency will have a high exchange rate.

What would you call bitcoin exchanges? Is that not a central distribution? And the millions and millions of dollars that pass through them certainly would show they are trusted by some. 
Men with guns in no way puts worth into a currency. A person with a gun aimed at your head can tell you a rock is worth a million dollars; that doesn't value it at a million to anyone else.

I like you.
Edit: I was curious so I did google it. "The United States has the most firearms per 100 residents at approximately 112.6" - [wiki](

Cool story bro. How many people are running a setup like that today?

This should be at the top of r/all
