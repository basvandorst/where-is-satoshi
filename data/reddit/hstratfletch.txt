Government will be the first to set a unique crypto tax to steal our riches.

How long did you wait to screen cap this? Lmao
@_date: 2019-07-30 17:33:12
Definitely a market for it. But I think general sentiment is shifting towards using it as a store of value. Curious how it goes.

Looks to "scammy" with the stock image. I would stick to a more serious color-tone and definitely swap the blue for black and the white text for gold.

It's a shame to see the U.S, once the place of economic freedom and small government be so backwards on digital currency.

In reality you can’t ban it. You can use government resources to try and block coin exchange websites. But banning it would affect its use on a very limited level. With modern computing and half a brain you can access any website anywhere in the world. Best case it would increase bitcoins value.

for the most part yes, I was just highlighting the $500 jump.
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:22:08
Been like this the past year, wondering why myself. I’ve heard the phrase “Bitcoin is an index for all crypto’s” but in previous years they usually reacted oppositely.

I do it myself, just be extra cautious when you buy and imo don't go past x10. Everything after that you can lose you're entire put in a few minutes. x2 leverage is plenty.
