Wow they define fiat currency as NOT digital currency... this is compleatly aimed at bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:40:52
Agreed i skimmed through it and they went as far to define fiat currency as NOT digital currency....
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:30:58
They didnt kill it. They just want money (taxes) from people who use it.

Try running a testnet. Been doing it for a few days and its loads of fun. Irc freenode channel  has a group of very helpful people if you get stuck.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:58:29
Hah! Nice. Keep your channel open i need to route some funds!
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:29:53
Your awesome dude. Keep up the good work the site is fantastic.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:06:00
Now that banking is free and anyone can sign up. This offers a level playing field for the world.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:42:13
First off great site. Second are you making your site open sourced or on git hub. Would love to run it client side.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:08:02
Jokes aside. Why?
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:42:31
Its an issue with development. Its still alittle buggy and the dev teams are working on it. Its been running in testnet for awhile.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:38:07
Whos building this site?
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:03:19
Checkout irc freenode  lots of people over there messing around on testnet.

How about no one elected and everyone has a vote/choice. Not just in the hands of a few.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:09:56
Its not populism, its control. Its always been about control. Those at the top can care less. Those at the bottem, the majority now have a say. Whether or not they have understanding of "monetary policy".
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:00:59
But it changes on the consensus of majority. One guy set it in motion. We all have to agree to change anything here on out.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:08:14
Only if you cash out in dollars. The reason the irs can do this is because they own the dollar. Thats thier jurisdiction. If gold/silver/bitcoin are transacted without dollars in the equation, then they have no right to tax you.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:11:59
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:22:07
And if so who cares. As someone who questions everything. Who cares. if the donation of 37 bitcoins was his own and hr donated it to homself to keep people from know his wealth, then so be it. The guy speaks truth and thats all thatatters to me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:34:31
And he deserves every penny for the amount that man has put forth for this community.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:59:25
:) good. I hope us majority do that. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:54:45
This. As much as roger can be a jack hole about shit. Hes right. In the crypto world the regulation is built in. If an exchange is cought doing insider trading, people will just move away from it, and the company would loose business.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:37:17
So are you arguing that bcash is bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:10:05
Because the 4th would even allow this bill...
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:22:40
Im not talking about the fed and thier way of "making educated guesses" on were the economy is going. Im referring to cryptocurrency, a protocol that levels the playing field for all. And not just 51% can change it. It has to be more. So if every idiot wanted to change it because they dont understand economics. Then so be it. Its still a level playing field. Unlike the fed. Who changes it based on a few peoples decisions.

Interesting to see people compleatly blow it off at first untill they dig around and do thier own research. I can talk someones head off for hours and they'll either not get it or find it bullshit. Untill a few months later when they come back and say it makes more sense than the stystem thats in place today.

Would'nt alts be a option is this aspect? Ie. Bitcoin as a gold standard and litecoin or other be a day to day use. Seems like a free market will adjust it self via fees to the network. Or I mean smaller transactions like coffee and meals will be in alt cryptos and larger transactions like houses and boats will be in say bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-05 05:19:20
Mostly that they are living in the past. They all seem to be an older generation  (baby boomers) and those that are younger have influence from thier parents. Its boggles thier mind that anyone would accept the US dollar because its backed by nothing but people do. And ive come to except that. Gold has always worked in the past because its universal, dollars are the norm now, and i have high hopes that the TPB will ruin the currency giving birth to bitcoin or cryptocurrency. They just havent sat down and thought this through yet IMO.
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:50:02
Its bad i agree, but for people who are struggling to understand bitcoin alone, it makes it easyer to explain an alt currency.

Hasn't  annoyed me yet and i been around here for 6 years. These people are just having fun. We all come on this sub cuz were addicted and excited about this technology. Who cares if it looks unprofessional or stupid. If we all stuck with the idea of professionalism or needed to appeal to the public about how we run things or how we talk,  then were no different from just doing what society has been doing all along and might as well stick with the old system. Maybe im ranting just my food for thought.

Nice. Yeah i saw it at $7 back in the day. Wanted to drop $1000 but didnt trust mt. gox with my information. Back then it was hard for anyone to get there hands on it if you didnt know what you were doing. Dont kick yourself to hard, in a few years youll be thanking yourself.

They want to know why that number. Read about technical analysis, most traders draw lines on a chart and determine were support and resistances is. The more people that draw that line the more support and resistance are around these lines. Retarded? Yes.. does it work? Sometimes....

Yes but because they are different exchanges it takes time to move fait from one to another. And still take alittle time to move crypto. By the time its moved the price could change leaving you in the dust. Its a matter of if the user feels the risk is worth it.

@_date: 2017-06-06 23:22:38
To volatile not to check. When bitcoin was increasing from 300 to 600 took a while no one was paying attention. Now price is moving $300 a day its good to be aware of its moves intra daily.
