Pretty much, and it would be silly to think decentralisation can prevent that.

Are there many bitcoin exchanges in Finland? I am a Finn, but even I don't really know how the Finnish bitcoin industry/infrastructure has been developing.
What would be the easiest/best way to buy bitcoins in Finland?

He makes an educated guess that it will be regulated. I don't read that as implying he wants it regulated.

True. There will always be demand for dollars, since dollar contains the promise that the issuer will take it as a payment for debt (taxes). Bitcoin contains no promise, making the use and acceptance of it voluntary.

Can't remember the last time I saw an actual check. 10+ years ago for sure. Kind of weird that US is so far behind in something.

yup but masadude was talking about price, not value. Don't know why we'd have to make an efficient market assumption. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:15:03
you're mixing value and price
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:21:32
That was all kinds of misleading

Net Asset Value is the current per-share price of the underlying assets in the fund. NAV of 11.47 and current price of 12.04 means investors are paying more for the ETN share than the underlying value of bitcoins. This is indicated by the Premium/discount number of 0.44%.

I find the capital flight part pretty interesting and I've been playing around with the idea of writing my thesis on it. Basiacally I'd like to extend current financial contagion literature to cover bitcoins. Problem is, of course, the lack of data.
I don't see true weaknesses in bitcoin, but I don't believe it is a good option to replace the fiat system. Then again, I'm one of those people who think inflation is not stealing from people, and that having full control over monetary and fiscal policy is an advantage for a country.
Personally I believe bitcoin will coexist with fiat as a great payment system, and we will likely see multiple successful applications including the ones you mentioned.

What's going to happen within a year?

No it's not. It is fundamentally different from a liability. That's why it has it's own little place in a balance sheet.
@_date: 2015-04-16 04:56:21
~~Because it isn't? Unlike traditional currencies~~
edit. legal liability is a rather ambiguous and broad term. When people say things like most financial assets are somebody else's liabilities, they mean financial liability.
For example when the Fed issues more dollars, they make a double entry in their accounting books so that the increase in assets matches an increase in liabilities. All outstanding dollars are at the same time a financial asset, and a financial liability.
@_date: 2015-04-16 04:28:19
That was clearly an analogy.
Btw, gold isn't a financial asset either. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:51:14
Why do you use bitcoins as the store of value of your savings? I assume everything you'd ever buy with your savings is primarily priced in dollars (or euro, rmb, yen, pound, whatever) which creates a mismatch between future cash outflows and current inflows/savings leaving you exposed to exchange rate risk.
Is it because you believe bitcoin will appreciate in value relative to your national currency? So you save in bitcoins because you feel this is the cheapest you'll ever be able to purchase bitcoins. That's called speculation, not saving.

Government doesn't decide what is a financial asset and what is not.
It may sound like semantics but a financial asset, by definition, is somebody else's 'legal liability/responsibility' because financial assets derive their value from a contractual claim. Thus, bitcoin is not a financial asset.
@_date: 2015-04-16 04:58:59
Yeah that's true. Bitcoins are nobody else's financial liability or a legal responsibility. But bitcoins aren't really financial assets either.
@_date: 2015-04-16 04:39:01


well that just doesn't mean anything. I thought it was pretty clear from your post that we were talking about financial assets and financial liabilities.


When people say this, they are:
A. Wrong
B. Talking about FINANCIAL liabilities

So this particular kind of safety


or expected price appreciation.
Which one is it? Or is it both?

Haha, I knew it! 
Hard to say. In Finland we cover modulos in 8th grade, I think, and then again in high school along with number theory IIRC. Then again we don't cover matrices at all which I think is thought pretty early in the US.
Since those people were on that type of lecture, you'd think there is some sort of pre-selection. You don't attend a Math behind bitcoin seminar if you suck at math. Right?

FDIC insured deposits are assured by the federal government. They are backed by full faith and credit of the US.

Modulo five means the 'leftover' you get if you divide number X by five, you know, when you don't want to use fractions. So 12 mod 5 would be 2. He used the table present results for a bunch of different combinations. 4+4=8, 8 mod 5 = 3.
edit. now I'm thinking that wasn't a serious question.
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:13:57
Good call. Not a law, but something Congress will do if necessary.
The primary funding for FDIC comes from the banking system. The fund size is determined quarterly, and the FDIC has a backup line of credit with the Treasury. 1990 they used this to borrow money for working capital.
