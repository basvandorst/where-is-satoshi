It does but you need to deposit via sepa which seems a bit odd as that's in euro and gdax has euro and gbp as seperate markets, it has btc to eur, gbp,eth and ltc in the UK. It shows usd prices but won't let you trade them.

The mempool is also filling up rapidly, I'm calling shenanigans

I can try :)
The mempool is full of the transactions that are waiting to be mined. When it fills up it means longer delays and higher fees to get your transaction through.
It's been increasing at a fair rate for the past few hours, more than normal. The last few times that's happened it has been followed by big market moves. But it could also just be the network is busy and I'm being a drama queen.
Can see it here

With this, the other 25k mentioned earlier, plus if bithump gets its exchange back up and running then things could get interesting. Limits set!

If it was just selling drugs then that's a possibility.
But the guy was a hardcore libertarian who actively wanted to remove the rule of law and power in the country. He didn't just commit an illegal act, he fundamentally believes in something completely at odds with the powers that be and he acted on it in a way that suggests he was doing it for belief rather than for the money.
I just can't see them ever thinking he is rehabilitated and releasing him. I'm not saying that's right, just my observation.
