The exchanges will trade their own holdings in crypto or existing tethers and claim the users $ assets at Tether Limited. The tethers are then destroyed. The users are left with a worthless crypto that's completely deflated. Bubble will be popped. Nothing is free in life. HODL was good 1 year ago. Now it's more like GTFO.

Are you one of them?

It's not dipping. It's still rising.
Remember. Sell HIGH buy LOW.
Take a look at these 2 posts and tell me I'm wrong. Bitcoin is being pumped by Tether.

Where's the withdraw button (figurely speaking)? Withdrawing costs: 20USD or 10BP (0.10%).
However they are not obliged to pay you back:
“Once you have Tethers, you can trade them, keep them, or use them to pay persons that will accept your Tethers. However, Tethers are not money and are not monetary instruments. They are also not stored value or currency. There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell, or redeem Tethers.”

why are you defending Tether. You have no interest in this as a BTC HOLDER? 
The dollars are real. The USDT's are real.
So will their gains be as they claim the USDT's that got traded for crypto. 
This is a classic pump and dump scheme. BTC being pumped with a coin that has a "fixed" value, but can't be claimed easily. Tether Limited reserves the right to "destroy" and credit the "user" their fiat.

Not to stir the pot. But Tether has issued 600.000.000 USDT's into cryptospace. This 20 Billion-whale is nothing compared to what Tether and Bitfinix are doing to Bitcoin by washtrading and pumping.

I'm not saying this isn't backed by money. The creation of these tokens is real! 
The problem lies in getting the money out.
1) user buys 1.000 USD worth 1.000 USDT
2) now user decides to trade to BTC these USDT at an exchange
ex. Bitfinix (which is basically the same company).
3) Bitfinix or any other exchange can now withdraw the fiat from Tether Limited 
4) Tether destroys the tethers
5) User is left with +x BTC
6) Bitfinix is left with +1000 USD
7) By the time user tries to withdraw his 1000 worth of crypto, the bubble will have collapsed. BTC value is in direct correlation with tethers issues.

Fact is $674,810,237  have entered crypto through Tether token's.
That's billions and billions and billions and billions... 
Tether does not have to issue the payout of these tokens to their users. Look at their terms of services.

Ok great. I'd love to believe that. Now... Let's talk numbers: 600.000.000+ enter the crypto space in 6 months time. These are USDT, tether or tokens over the past 6 months. The'yre not thin air. They are "REAL" money. The money is stored in the bank account of Tether Limited. What company moves that much money withouth regulation?
Before that only 60.000.000 were in circulation. From 60.000.000 to 600.000.000 = x 10. Created by a company that states the buyers do not own jack shit.
This company: 
- Tether Limited published their whitepaper on 2016-06.
- After a year they trade 600.000.000 USD?

There's always a small bit of errors they can just solve by paying the duped party. It's better then leaking what causes the issue.
It's called keeping up appearances.

Doesn't this defeat the purpose of BTC? If we need a different layer system to keep the current Tx's going?
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:48:44
Oh look they got hacked now... what a coincidence. Aka 30.000.000 already in BTC thats unaccounted for and unredeemable in USDT. How convenient. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:18:15
Source of the rise is not people buying. But exchanges driving the price. 
600.000.000 USDTs have been issued. I bet they're not even real...
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:08:47
Are you one of them?
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:05:13
Are you telling me 
&lt; 100K there is no option to withdraw?
