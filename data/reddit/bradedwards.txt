Man, I bought OSTK like 5 years ago when Patrick Byrne first started getting into crypto at like $25. They then went down to like $12 and stayed there for years. I just sold 'em a couple months ago, accepting that it was always going to be a loss, and then it shoots up to like $70

Quit playing the victim.
Roger Ver isn't helping the matter much, but the truth is nobody outside of Bitcoin gives a shit about any of this. The real problem is the fact that nobody can get their transactions through. The fees are too damn high!

Feel free to report this post if you truly believe it to be so offensive. There's a difference between "plz giv me bitcoinz cuz i want 1" type posts, which I believe that rule was made to prevent, and legitimate charitable donations. 
If the Bitcoin community wants to be taken more seriously and build a positive reputation, shutting down charitable drives is hardly the way to do it.

You're presenting a false dichotomy. You know, it's possible that people are sometimes fooled by a really good scammer. Hell, Alex Green fooled just about the entire goddamn cryptocurrency community for several months.
If your logic is true, then anyone who invested money in Mt. Gox, Moolah, Bitcoin Trader, Bitcoinica, Pirate Savings and Trust, Butterfly Labs, etc. are all complicit in their scamming activities.

I just got off the phone with Aric Fedida, the founder of Interwallet. He explained to me that this press release is full of misinformation, and was created without their input or consent. 
I've distilled the salient points into an article on The CoinFront. For the real story, take a look

I can do that. 
Basically, MintPal was hacked recently. The hackers tried getting into their Bitcoin and Litecoin wallets, but the security was higher on those platforms so they were safe. 
They did, however, manage to break into their VeriCoin wallet. For whatever reason, MintPal was holding a huge amount of VeriCoin in their hot wallet, and the hackers were able to steal around 30% of the total supply of VeriCoin. 
Because of the way Proof of Stake coins work, having one person in control of such a large number of coins means they're in a position to possibly execute something similar to a 51% attack. And since the thief is an obvious hacker, this spells bad news for VeriCoin. 
However, to have a centralized authority reset everything after one agency screwed it up is the reason why so many in the cryptocurrency space like it better than our current central banking system. 
I go into it more in-depth in my article on The CoinFront:

Brad Edwards here, editor and co-owner of The CoinFront. I'm a one-third partner in the endeavour, along with my two partners Corey and Justin. None of us have anything to do with GAW or anyone involved in its operations, including Garza. Our faces and bios hare here: 
My general editorial policy is to not run articles on mining, especially mining equipment. Frankly, I've never mined myself and don't feel like I can speak with authority on the subject. You will find a few ads on mining on The CoinFront if I found them particularly interesting, but they're not as common as the current events and interview material which we like more. 
I'm happy to answer any questions the community has about our platform.

I'm aware of that, and I'm sure they wanted to have a juicy cover story with which to relaunch their print edition. I don't fault them for that. 
The issue, of course, is whether or not McGrath's story is true. And although seems to have already jumped to the conclusion that McGrath is *lying*, there is no definitive evidence. And frankly, I find it to be pretty disappointing and shows a lack of critical thinking on the issue in lieu of emotional reaction, but I digress.
The whole thing makes me wonder what's going on here that we're not seeing. Things aren't usually as simple as we think. 
The truth may come out in the coming months, or it may forever be a mystery. But I don't want to jump to conclusions because at this point it's simply McGrath's word against Nakamoto's, and neither party has proven they are necessarily trustworthy. 
Take a step back for a moment, and consider, just hypothetically, that Dorian is actually Satoshi. Put yourself in that position. You're reclusive, secretive, and didn't ever want to be found. You took great pains to make sure you remained anonymous, and you probably live with a bit of fear, knowing how disruptive to the world's powers Bitcoin could be. 
And then some fucking nosy journalist shows up at your door saying she knows who you are. How would you react? 
Dorian's actions recently neither prove nor disprove anything. The burden of proof lies upon the party who asserts, so it's up to McGrath to provide us with solid evidence. 
Failing that, we'll never know.

He's hardly denouncing it. . Read the [Quora post](


I'm not sure what he means when he refers to "real money", but his attitude seems to be more "live and let live" than anything. 
And when he says "the people who operate Bitcoin", he could easily be referring to the developers. After all, if Gavin Andresen wanted to increase the Bitcoin ceiling from 21 million to any other number, he could do so (I assume, anyway). Not having such protections in place could lead to a similar situation the American dollar is facing currently, suffering from gross inflation as the powers that be print money like it's going out of style. 
I'm no Ron Paul acolyte, but I do agree 100% with what he's said here.

While I don't believe Dorian is Satoshi, your logic here is flawed. 
It's entirely possible that they do have more information, and they will be releasing it in the form of additional articles in order to keep the interest level up and sell more magazines. 
It's also possible that they were told definitive evidence on the condition that they not reveal the source, and they're attempting to find an additional source. 
There's more going on here than what we're privy to.

There are some significant benefits but also some significant drawbacks. 
Porn relies heavily on the automatic subscription model. If you buy a subscription, the funds get taken out of your account automatically each month without having to think about it. 
With Bitcoin that's not possible, so porn sites could lose revenue there. 
On the other hand, Bitcoin has the pseudonymous aspect which can appeal to those with more, ahem, unusual fetishes, or who live in backward jurisdictions where porn is illegal or frowned upon. 
It's a double-edged sword, and I think the best case scenario for porn companies to accept both Bitcoin and fiat.

The idea with the UFC fight was to generate new interest in Bitcoin from people who aren't already interested. While hackathons and innovation are important and worthy of funding, they're more or less preaching to the choir. 
Bitcoin suffers from a case of awful publicity and awful marketing. Getting average, everyday people talking about Bitcoin would help spread the word and give new opportunities for those who don't understand it to wrap their heads around it. 
That would be more valuable to the cause than yet another hackathon.

I've always liked Roger Ver. I've seen him do talks before back in 2014/15 and he came across as eloquent, intelligent, and well spoken.
He's done a lot of good for Bitcoin over the years. Truly, it wouldn't be where it is today without his involvement in the space, so mad respect for that. I still believe he's doing what he thinks is best for the Bitcoin space, and I commend him for thinking outside the box.
I also believe John Carvalho did not approach this conversation in good faith and was deliberately trying to piss Ver off.
That said, Roger Ver came across as completely unstable and frantic. The fact that he would start screaming, cursing, and flipping off the interviewer over his use of the word "B Cash" instead of "Bitcoin Cash" was deeply disturbing.
The truth is, you're going to have to have a thick skin if you want to be the top dog in this space. You're going to face a lot of criticism, both from the community itself and from the outside world. And you need to be able to deal with that constructively and rationally.
If he's going to become so unhinged over someone using the wrong word to refer to his coin, how is he going to face REAL criticism?
Then again, Roger Ver is a multimillionaire and I'm not, so I guess he doesn't need to listen to me.
