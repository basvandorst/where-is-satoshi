It's hard to believe that Satoshi dreamed of becoming a billionaire or trillionaire and that Bitcoin was his brilliant scheme to make it happen. 
So many things could have gone wrong, and in fact the risk of failure still remains high. The best that Satoshi could have realistically hoped for in the beginning was modest success, perhaps making a few tens of millions of dollars if things went well. He achieved that level of paper wealth when the price went over $10. Yet he hasn't sold any significant amounts of bitcoin as far as we can tell.
No rational person would hold on to every last bitcoin waiting for it to go to the moon - the risk of giving up the chance of being a multi-millionaire is too great. This is what makes me wonder if Satoshi is some kind of nutty altruist (which is hard to believe given the money at stake), or if he's legally bound in some way to not touch those coins. 
If he really is holding on to them, smug in the knowledge that they will be worth $1,000,000 each some day, well then he must know something that we don't know.

As an extreme example, imagine that you're in charge of defending your city from a approaching army. Do you hope that everyone in the city will voluntarily take up arms and contribute their share of opposing force in a generally useful manner, or do you recruit soldiers into a command-and-control hierarchy so that you can meet the enemy with a disciplined and coordinated defense?
We need organizations that have some kind of centralized coordination in order to effectively advocate for Bitcoin and to defend against determined regulatory attacks.

If people want to put their trust in Bitcoin wallet services that have access to their private keys, they can do that. If some other people want to take the risk of being their own bank, Bitcoin makes that possible.
If you want to use regulated exchanges to trade bitcoin for fiat - go ahead. But it's also possible to purchase bitcoin from a guy on the street, or from a friend.
The great thing about Bitcoin is that both models are possible. You can put your trust in services, or you can do it yourself. That's not possible with the old global financial model.

Yes, it will remain the highest valued coin (in market cap) for a long time, as in years. It's where all the investment is being placed. It has the largest mindshare globally.
Money is a social network, and Bitcoin's is currently enjoying a runaway network effect. It's at the beginning of its adoption curve, so it will take a long time for that to play out. Altcoins won't have any hope of catching up until that's done - think 5-6 years from now. Even then, an altcoin will have to have an overwhelming advantage over Bitcoin to overtake it in value.

The problem with "this sub" is that you disagree with me? 


That's merely a consequence of the technology, cheap transactions are not really what distinguishes it from other payment systems. Centralized payment systems could in principle offer cheaper transactions. 
Bitcoin is different because of its decentralization, and that has important consequences. The one that matters most to me is the ability to transfer value to anyone on the planet without requiring an intermediary. Others may place more value on cheap regular transactions, but personally I don't think that's terribly interesting.
Without decentralization, Bitcoin is pointless, because the payment features already exist in other more efficient forms.

I think they're doing the exact opposite. Sidechains allow for permissionless experimentation on Bitcoin. If you think you've got a better consensus algorithm or a better idea about block rates or rewards, then you can create a sidechain, no fork required. And the beauty is that the sidechain will still be using bitcoin. Providing an open market of ideas in the form of side chains is not an end-run around consensus. 
They've stated that their code will be open-source, so I  don't know why you're talking about a non-published code base.

This isolates the important holdouts to Coinbase and Gemini (who haven't said anything).
If Coinbase wishes to list a SHA-256 chain as "BTC", when the rest of the economic majority considers it to be an altcon, well that tells you something about the judgement of the CEO, and one wonders what the Coinbase shareholders must be thinking about now.

The thing is, BTC has been upgraded over the years in a series of safe soft forks. Substantial changes too, such as the implementation of P2SH. 
And there have been substantial improvements made to the Core client itself, allowing it to process the current transaction rate without maxing out node resources (if libsecp256k1 hadn't been implemented, there's a good chance that there'd only be a few hundred nodes running right now or worse).

If I were an investor in Coinbase, I'd be a little bit worried right about now. Perhaps Fred and Brian are too easily distracted by shiny things, or maybe they're just really pissed off that they couldn't influence the core development process by making uneducated blog posts, and this is their sour grapes retaliation. The word "pivoting" also comes to mind, which is usually the end stage of a failing startup.
The fact is that Ethereum isn't a true cryptocurrency - it's a centrally controlled and highly experimental platform for running equally highly-experimental contracts that will likely prove to have limited utility due to the difficulty of writing useful and secure contracts. It doesn't even make a good form of money - ETH units release like crazy and will do so indefinitely. 
Maybe it will prove to be the bestest crypto system out there one day, but it's way too early for someone to make the kind of absurd and overconfident post that Fred made.
Bitcoin's full capabilities haven't even been fully explored or exploited yet. It's really irresponsible for Coinbase management to waste their investment capital on something even more risky than Bitcoin when there's still so much to do to secure Bitcoin's longevity and to open up its potential.
It's too bad that Coinbase didn't try harder to work within the distributed development consensus model. That have no right to bitch about a of a lack of leadership in Bitcoin development when they offered no resources of their own to the effort.

Mike just didn't understand that Bitcoin shines best as a censorship-resistant bearer asset. He wanted it to be a competitor to the best payment networks in the world right away, but he was too impatient to help Bitcoin get there by careful and patient scaling using layers.

I want to believe, but this idea seems to be just as weak as the notion that the late-2013 bubble was because Cypriots were collectively getting into Bitcoin.
Long-term holders of bitcoin understand that it can all go to zero. Is the average Chinese guy really going to convert his yuan into bitcoin given the downside risk, which is surely riskier than just holding on to yuan? Enough people to be the cause of this current rally? It just doesn't seem plausible to me.
The truth is probably far less interesting. But I'm happy with the price increase nonetheless.

MySpace had no network effect - it wasn't an application platform, it was an application. Bitcoin is an application platform that forms the base of a growing ecosystem of dependent applications and users. That gives it a network effect, and as the Internet has demonstrated time and again, the largest network effect wins.
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:06:41
Of course it's not perfect, it just has to be "good enough" to form the base of a large ecosystem of dependent applications, then the network effect will assure its dominance. 
That's why its a waste of time to try to create an incompatible competing system, just as it would be if you tried to create a technically superior competitor to TCP/IP.
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:53:34
Why couldn't Bitcoin fix the same problem? If it's simply a technical glitch, the incentive for Bitcoin to fix itself will be enormous. 
Thats why it likely won't be a technical problem that kills bitcoin - it will be social or political, and other cryptocurrencies won't be magically immune to those problems.

You can't separate Bitcoin from the blockchain, that would be like separating IP addresses from TCP/IP. Bitcoin+blockchain as TCP/IP is the appropriate comparison.

Ripple is semi-decentralized. It's not at all a replacement for Bitcoin, which strives for maximum decentralization. Ripple is much more of a conscious compromise between centralized control and decentralized operation, and this makes it something other than a true cryptrocurrency. 
Essentially, Ripple is a system of federated nodes that's controlled by a single company that also controls most of the native money supply (XRP). That might appeal to banks as a replacement for sopmething like SWIFT, but it hardly counts as a trustless value transfer system and trustless store of value.

It's about practical reality: those altcoins will never catch up with Bitcoin due to its network effect. If you're putting your time and energy into a competing scheme, you're spinning your wheels. You will have a better chance of success if you work to improve Bitcoin by helping to advance its protocol or by building applications on top of it. That is Armstrong's point.

MPEx isn't run by a lunatic. You might not like him personally, but whether or not someone is a nice guy has no bearing on how he runs a business. Pirate and nefario were nice guys, and look how they fucked up.
I use MPEx daily without any hassle or difficulty. It's a very well run exchange with a high trade volume (over 5000 BTC per day). MPEx has stood the test of time and the owner has never shown any tendency to scam. There is no trust issue.

XRPs are meant to be used as a mandatory fee for the explicit purpose of discouraging transaction spam/flooding, so they aren't directly comparable to BTC.
I view Ripple as being complementary to Bitcoin. The most promising use case is Ripple serving as a 
mechanism for decentralized currency exchange.
Unfortunately, Ripple is even harder to grok than Bitcoin, so it has a long way to go before it reaches any kind of critical mass.

$10B is tiny in the grand scheme of things. To put things in perspective: global hedge fund assets are around $2.4T, all the gold in the world is worth $6.4T, and there's $21T hiding in offshore tax havens. 
My point being is that there are huge reserves of wealth that could pour into Bitcoin, easily raising the market cap well beyond $100B.
Also keep in mind that it doesn't take $1B of new bitcoin purchases to raise the market cap by $1B. The supply of bitcoin on the exchanges is very small, so it doesn't take much buying action to raise the price by a hugely disproportionate amount.
This is why I see no problem for Bitcoin to continue the current rate at which the price is increasing, especially since we haven't even begun to enter the main phase of the adoption cycle.

Litecoin's mission was to ensure that mining was always something that could be done by average joes. It utterly failed at that since you can only mine litecoin with GPU rigs. Soon ASICs will dominate litecoin mining. So now Litecoin is without a mission and it is just a pump/dump vehicle.

S.DICE shares should mostly be seen as an opportunity to share in its revenue via dividends. 
In January, it paid out 0.0002 BTC per share. For example, if you had 10000 shares at the time of dividend payout, you would have received 2 BTC. At the current share price (around 0.0064 BTC), that's around a 37% yield.

You really ought to have read the FAQ and common myths (which are linked in the sidebar) before posting something so fundamentally wrong.
The Bitcoin proof of work system is absolutely fundamental to its operation. It's what allows a large set of distributed nodes to stay synchronized and to agree on what goes into the blockchain. 
Mining (distributed transaction processing) is not wasted work in any sense of the manner. It is the essential mechanism that keeps the blockchain **decentralized**, which is Bitcoin's defining feature.
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:50:27
I mostly agree, however I feel like this idea that the price is unimportant is very wrong.
Bitcoin cannot be a low-volatility international currency without it first achieving a very high price. As in, the "market cap" needs to exceed $100B+ in order to be able to absorb very large transactions without moving the market significantly. 
I do agree that the obsessive posts about price speculation are generally a pointless distraction, however we should not forget that Bitcoin's long term success will be closely linked to its price.
@_date: 2013-02-11 19:47:50
This has been the theory, but so far S.DICE revenues have been growing even as the BTC-USD exchange rate has been growing, which is probably due to more users playing.

Bitcoin is following a normal technology adoption curve (see Diffusion of Innovations on Wikipedia). The adoption rate is reflected in the price. There are manias built on top of that, true, but the overpowering force is simple adoption.

Just like in 2011, people who don't really understand Bitcoin have concluded that it's all over.

The issue is with perception. The herd isn't very bright; they think that a litecoin is cheaper than a bitcoin. OP is saying people are buying ltc in increasing numbers as a result. The obvious strategy therefore is to make bitcoin "cheaper" by making mBTC the default unit.

Of course, that's a risk with every exchange. 
I've been using MPEX since August and it's been a very positive experience, and I'm not just talking about the considerable return on my investment. 
Mircea Popescu has been very helpful and responsive to my questions and he's practically omni-present on IRC. 
The site's security (GPG-signed orders and statements, all withdrawals are manually processed) is excellent, and the site is always available (with a few very minor exceptions, but nothing like the disaster that was GLBSE).
If it's a scam, it's been masterfully executed.
@_date: 2013-02-06 15:24:11
I can only speak for myself, but my interactions with him have only been positive. He's been trustworthy and dependable. He's basically a permanent fixture in  on IRC, so he's always available to answer questions.
I invested quite a bit of BTC in both S.MPOE and S.DICE back in August, and so far my investment is up well over 100%. Many other people have similar stories.
I realize that MP himself can be offputting to people who don't know him, but it's just his schtick. He's one of those people who grows on you. 
The only thing that matters in my mind is that he runs MPEx very well. It's highly secure, very reliable, and has a great community of investors with deep pockets. Erik Voorhees chose to list S.DICE on MPEx for those reasons, and he chose well, given what happened to GLBSE.
