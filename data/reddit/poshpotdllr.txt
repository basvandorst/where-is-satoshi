ok lets make it better: 
i want poly-amorous multi-ethnic gay life-partner (legally married) people to protect their marijuana plants with guns printed on a 3d printer powered by solar cells bought on a dark-net with bitcoins on the 4th of July in front of the Jefferson memorial at mid day to the tune of "Born in the USA" by Tiesto (you know, the remix because I'm a fucking millennial) as I drink a cold  sour-cherry acai-mint chamomile-lemonade chia-seed latte.

i disagree. you cannot spend a single penny as effectively on medical research as you can in donating to openbsd. i would rather see openbsd receive a thousand dollars than to see 10 million go to cancer research because it would make a better impact on the world, but only because thats just the economics of it. one is cheap and efficient and effects more people and the other is expensive and inefficient and effects less people.

may i suggest adding a zero to that donation? considering you gave 1 million to the EFF who does far less for privacy and internet freedom i think your well meaning assessment of the value of openbsd is indicative of the chronic lack of appreciation that they receive for being arguably the most productive and influential open source project in the world. that said, make no mistake your donation is hugely appreciated as-is and as a long time openbsd user i am not complaining about your decency and generosity as a human being.
