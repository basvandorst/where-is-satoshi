You two lot who commented are a bunch of pussies.
Do you understand what I'm saying here? These criminals are taking non hacked assets away, that can be withdrawn in full by a selective lucky bunch (USD holders with Synapse).
No, we don't need bankruptcy. We need these assholes to allow everyone to withdraw what they own, and pay up from their cash reserves to those who got their assets stolen. 
Where's your fucking dignity? Your money gets taken away, you don't even have your 64% YET, and you're happy with letting these criminals operate as usual after all of this. 
I don't know who pisses me off more, these BFX scum or all the nerds on reddit who are on their nuts. Stockholm syndrome is bloody right.

Thanks for your time. However I'm asking for further clarification beyond the xyz funds are safe answer. Safe for whom? Will they return undamaged? Zane mentions customer losses, but in this case it's technically not a loss (non btc), although I agree with others that there isn't any customer loss in all this - the platform was hacked. 
But yes, no plan yet in motion, but we would like to know if those who are "safe" are really safe or should we prepare

This is why these BFX fuckers touching other USD people's money is unfair. 
Synapse US based users have been able to withdraw all their cash, but alas those without this have to pay whilst the BFX criminals give us nothing from their own.
And also what's with the shilling for BFX? These motherfuckers haven't been transparent with nothing - investigation, how losses are calculated, what's going on on the inside, etc, etc. And users here defending these dogs left and right. It's a mad world.  
@_date: 2016-08-11 13:48:03
Yup, time to leave BFX to rot
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:59:53
You should get your money back, and these motherfuckers need to pay. People got swindled, not just by the "hacker" but by BFX for not contributing SHIT besides their utterly worthless tokens. 
How is it threads like this are getting no upvotes? WTF is going on here? It's safe to say, these motherfuckers are paying losers to downvote and comment bullshit for their benefit - it is afterall their official PR space.

It's baffling! Create a new account, it will work. Why can't we login?? I can only think it's intentional. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 23:10:12
I logged in too. but withdrawals disabled? I just initiated a BTC withdrawal after making it rain those useless BFX tokens.
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:12:16
Absolutely. Just when you think you've seen it all man
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:31:49
Thanks for checking, guys. It's really frustrating that my newly created account has access just fine, but my actual account can't go in. The arrow just turns and turns. Sigh
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:31:29
It's truly frustrating. Hey What gives? Let us login
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:53:50
I fully agree with you jocko271
I really think, a lot of these people are shills for BFX. There's no way regular bitcoiners, with their hate for corrupt exchanges, or those who lost money, would defend these criminals. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:26:58
How soon can we access USD in our USD wallets since these were also unaffected?
@_date: 2016-08-10 23:42:53
Awesome man. Let's let this ship sink now. With their lack of transparency and all this BS of having no one significant tell us anything, I have a feeling the whole thing was an inside job. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:32:12
Same with mine, only USD and I can't log in. 
Seriously. What the *&amp;^%$*
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:16:36
Thanks for the round the clock updates to people's questions. I've not verified my account before, how long or involved a process is this? What do I need to get ready?
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:50:13
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:03:38
Yes, I can create a new account, but cannot login to mine. Thank you, motherfuckers!
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:31:51
Can you answer this gentleman please? Verification prior to withdrawal etc. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:37:56
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:09:24
a really big question, those who were not affected, Can we withdraw our funds, fiat/alt coins? Those unaffected can be left free? And is your intention to continue operation if the storm can be weathered?
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:30:49
I bloody well hope not
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:08:58
My black ass. Where's the proof? All we have is your words on reddit. Who's investigating that we can contact? Give us all the numbers to everything. Be bloody transparent, it's almost one week. 
Synapse USD holders are able to withdraw all their cash without your theft, what's the justification for stealing others' supposedly unhacked assets? There is none. The responsibility falls on you to fix this, either with equity NOW along with all your reserves if you want to fix this for those who were hacked, but you motherfuckers are trying to have your cake and eat it too.
