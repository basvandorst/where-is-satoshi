Yes, that works too, the same arguments apply, since if they weren't true, people from those countries wouldn't be able to trade at such high levels.

I am not disputing the risks/danger of volatility, I am simply stating that the playing field is massively different than previous experiences, so it wouldn't be wise to draw the same conclusions.
The rate of growth is not a sufficient metric to determine if we're in a bubble, since as I said the internet allows for things to move extremely fast and in higher volumes.

I understand, thank you :-)

You could also argue that due to the nature of bitcoin being open source and owned/controlled by no one, innovation is driven higher/faster than traditional markets, which are bound by regulation, data access difficulties, legacy technology and bureaucracy.
Anyone can build apps or services to further simplify access and grow the market, which has/is already happened/happening.

Thank you, I understand your point a little bit. Does this mean regulation can't really kill Bitcoin's original moto?

Thank you, I didn't want to include the civil war in the discussion, I just wanted to know if the claim was substantial and wanted strong explanations/arguments against it, as it worried me concerning Decentralization, which is one of my favorite aspects of bitcoin.

I respectfully disagree, local owners of bitcoin still need to get them from somewhere and they usually don't have enough foreign currency to do so, plus the restrictions I talked about + the volume will never be enough.
Also, I am willing to wager that the percentage of early miners was abysmal in these countries.
So the same issue persists, there is not enough bitcoins in developing countries for a large number of the population to use it and transact with it, most of it is concentrated outside, where you can't get it.
Feel free to provide some examples of a thriving developing country bitcoin community where the local fiat currency is weak and there are restrictions in the amount of global fiat currencies such as the USD or the EUR that you can hold.

That's a feature, what I am asking is how will Bitcoin circulate in emerging markets if they don't even have the chance to own part of this capital or even exchange it, since as I said, local developing economies have weak undesirable fiat currencies.

Case one: **Not a good enough argument**
Case two: **Can you please elaborate?**
Case three: **But bitcoin wasn't as prevalent/attractive as it is now, how can we consider this as a strong argument?**
Case four: **Can't know for sure since as you said no laws exist yet.**
Case five: **Fair enough**
Case six: **Can you please elaborate?**
Case seven: Fair enough
Case eight: **Not a good enough argument**
Thanks for your input!
**Disclosure:** I am a fan of Bitcoin. I am not trolling, I am genuinely curious about what they claimed.

Also, If you are thinking about mining as a solution, then please remember that it would take a lot of investment/resources to compete with the existing miners and the astronomical Hash rate, so we can't realistically expect citizens of developing countries to do so.

So what is the problem? why are people opposed to it?
