The exposer alone is worth the investment. My bet is they invest the $25, learn more about how Bitcoin works, and become regular investors.

Hopefully your bro doesn’t lose it. ��

Weak hands will fold. ������

Good investors get excited about corrections. Perfect time to buy more.

You’ve made nothing until you sell...
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:09:05
That’s what is driving the price up. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:53:59
I would say mostly true. We’ll all find out at the end of November though. ��
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:31:27
Yep, well said.

I think most people traded out of alts to get into btc before the fork. I can see the opposite happening post-fork, causing the price to come down a bit. Until then the price is going to skyrocket. ��

That green candlestick is HUGE... on the 5m chart. ��

Nothing can stop Bitcoin. ������
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:08:46
Right. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:01:42
Relatively high. ��
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:12:21
I think it’ll hit 6k+ before the forks and then drop back down to 4.5k-5k after. Then it’ll end the year around 6k. Just my prediction. ��
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:59:58
Quit lying... ��
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:10:34
Except high is relative. 6k will be “low” a year from now. Right now it’s “high”. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:42:56
Yeah, good call.
