I'd choose free market rules. Actually this is called the self organized order from chaos. Chaos rules. Natural laws?  
Goes back to the Nobel prize laureate Prigogine and his work in chemistry.
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:39:28
So true.
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:54:34
Ok here's the major improvement.  
Can you finally add the tx fee option?  
It can be a PU option not enabled by default.  
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:13:20
Agree. No ruler.
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:22:18
Thanks. These vids look worthwhile. So the right term is a point of sale.
Myself i'm not totally, i've been into cryptocurrencies  for quite a while.
Now I'd like to introduce a local person and help the bitcoinomy grow.
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:12:52
I had in mind an id.
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:50:23
Android support?
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:12:03
To my mind a contract is something voluntarily agreed upon by both parties. Lots of these "contracts" are imposed by gov. I.e. an id, ssn. Thanks for the link, i've been looking for great videos on libertarian philosophy.

Can it be run on android?
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:36:47
Thanks. All payment processors actually keep the private keys. 
Am i right? Currently there's no multisig solution or anything?
@_date: 2014-06-01 10:27:24
This is very confusing.  Again the trust is being delegated to the 3rd party.  
Truly trustless solution must be build around the master pub key.  
Electrum style or

About the Author  
Bernard Lietaer, one of the original architects of the European single currency, wrote “The Future of Money” and “The Mystery of Money” while a Fellow at the Center for Sustainable Resources at the University of California at Berkeley and a Visiting Professor in Archetypal Psychology at Sonoma State University, California.  
He has been active in the domain of money systems for a period of 25 years in an unusual variety of functions. His first book (MIT Press 1969) de
veloped new technologies for multinational corporations to manage multiple currency environments. He then moved to the other end of the spectrum by consulting to developing countries on how to improve their hard currency earnings. Subsequently he became Professor of International
Finance at the University of Louvain, the oldest university in his native Belgium, before moving on to become the top executive in charge of the
Organization and Computer Departments at the Central Bank in Belgium. His first project in this capacity was to design and implement the single European currency system. During that period, he also served as President of Belgium’s Electronic Payment System, credited as the most
comprehensive and cost effective payment system in the world.  
Before starting work on his current book, Bernard co-founded one of the largest and most successful off-shore currency funds becoming its General Manager and Currency Trader. Business Week identified him as “the world’s top currency trader” in 1992.
