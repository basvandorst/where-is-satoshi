What does that mean -- to go without a government? Local, state, or federal? Does that mean no federal, state, property, sales, VAT taxes were collected for that period? No roads were maintained? No diplomats were sent to the UN? No trade occurred with other countries? Public schools were shuttered? Do you have children? Have you ever depended on social services? I think the problem may be that you're in a 23rd century mindset and it's a bit too early for it.

how would government work if there was no taxes?

I shudder to think of living in a country without a government.

I had a similar question out to the community but didn't get a great answer. I think the big thing the US government could do is to shut down the US-based exchanges (Coinbase, Gemini, etc). 
However, two issues with this. Other countries would still allow you to transact back to their respective currencies and then you could just do an foreign currency exchange to get back to USD. It would be more complicated and probably result in tax complications so it would add friction for US buyers/sellers and would probably bring the price down if this happened.
The second thing to note is incentive. Why would the government want to shutdown something that provides tax revenue? The high price of BTC is resulting in more tax revenue for the US government. The higher it goes, the larger capital gains taxes people will pay when they sell out. As far as their desire to regulate, there isn't really any regulation on gold so why would the US government worry about cryptocurrencies at least from a regulation point of view?

What kind of penalties are you imagining? Genuinely curious.

I would say the huge mining community and the billions invested in mining hardware provides implicit value. No one can come in tomorrow with new technology and take over the transaction confirmation process (execute an attack).
Also, BTC has been around the longest. The longer a piece of technology has been around the more heritage it has, and the more reliable it is. The less likely that there's a hack out there to subvert it.

Gotcha. But can the IRS require Americans to "register" their accounts? I haven't seen anything like that before. Are you thinking Americans would be required to register their accounts on exchanges? Or any wallet address ever created that contains any amount of bitcoin? The latter would seem a bit draconian, no?

Should have been more clear -- 1% of US not the world. You need to make &gt;400k for 1% of US.
Arbitrary numbers are really just to illustrate the point, and I'm not trying to prove anything just highlighting a possible trend in how folks are behaving. (If you think I'm making quite a few assumptions, talk to an economist.)

You wrote a well thought out response, and I see what you mean. I guess the real truth is more general and probably covers all asset markets, not just crypto: those who can withstand large gains and hold the assets long term are the ones who have plenty of liquid money sitting around for other needs. Thus the rich get richer.
As to whether the gains from BTC will accrue to a certain population, that's probably impossible to predict really for the points you made.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:22:56
Yeah I know what you mean. I think the over-40 crowd is waiting for the value proposition -- how does bitcoin improve my life? They possibly don't see the need to faster transfers of money with lower fees since they are more inured to the old slow way of banks moving money around. They also likely have more investment in the current financial system and don't see the value of a financial ledger without a recordkeeper. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:54:05
Sure that's fine to hold a fraction of a btc but if you look in aggregate, in an upward trending price scenario, the majority of the gains will go to those with large holdings. My point is that those people will tend to be the ones who already have a high net worth, not the ones who happen to have bought 50 btc in 2013 and sat on it and have no other major wealth (because it will be difficult for those folks to sit and hodl).

No problem at all. Math sometimes looks harder than it is. 2^25 is just 2 multiplied by itself 25 times. So that means 33 million seconds in a year. You might think 2^45 is not too much more. But it is. It's almost 35 trillion years. The universe is about 17 billion years old. So it's about 20,000x the age of the universe. And that's requiring a billion friends (1/6th of the world's population) with a billion computers each (not sure if you know even a single person with a billion computers -- I definitely don't).

Futures are generally exchange traded (and very liquid) contracts where the investor basically goes long or short the asset for delivery in the future. There's daily margining as well so there's no risk to either side beyond the day's movements. 
Imagine that you go long a 3 month BTC Futures contract with an exchange. The exchange might hold the BTC and in 3 months they would deliver it to you. In the meanwhile, you'd exchange cash daily with them based on how BTC went up and down. Note that you as the investor wouldn't hold the BTC but would have exposure to BTC. At the end of the 3 months you could take delivery of the BTC or you could roll the contract so that you wouldn't have to take delivery. 
Treasury bond futures, S&amp;P 500 stock futures, and oil futures all generally work this way...

See my post below. It would take 35 trillion years with today's technology if you had a billion friends with a billion computers each and each computer could run a billion hashing calculations per second. (why you wouldn't just use this firepower -- and HUGE amounts of electricity -- to just mine the bitcoin is beyond me). In the future, quantum computing might take this down a notch, but do you think computers will be 35 trillion times faster in 10 years? And many times more if you don't have a billion friends with a billion computers?

In order to spend money sent to a Bitcoin address, you just need to find a ECDSA public key that hashes to the same 160-bit value. That will take, on average, 2^160 key generations.
Supposing you could generate a billion (2^30) per second, you need 2^130 seconds.
Doing this in parallel using a billion machines requires only 2^100 seconds.
Getting a billion of your richest friends to join you gets it down to only 2^70 seconds.
There are about 2^25 seconds per year, so you need 2^45 years.
The age of the Universe is about 2^34 years so far — better get cracking!

Agreed, that is not correct. In order to correctly find a private key, it's a lot more than trillions. Try trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of ...  - 10^30 or 10^40 if I recall correctly. Brute force would take millions of years to recover one key

It's funny because I was familiar with the AP but I dumbed it down a bit for the post, which was a mistake on my part. 
But yeah I get what you're saying but to prevent the ETF from deviating too much from the underlying asset, I suppose the same create/redeem process would have to be in place to enable taking advantage of arbitrage. Just interesting to think about.
Edit: Interesting take at

Can someone check the blockchain to see if a transaction like this occurred recently?
