Happy cake day!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:20:56
that's still about a thousand dollars 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:22:02
Idk why people are panicking it's simply a special Bitcoin deal, 10% off.
but in all honesty guys in one month we're still up 86%. When in doubt zoooooooom out! :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:12:57
i'm curious too 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:23:46
hoping it dips again so i can buy more, i have .1 too :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:58:32
Happy birthday!!! :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:57:55
Why not wait 3 minutes!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:22:43
I second it
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:15:43
I'm in, we should also add other promising cryptocurrencys to the bounty to let our winner diversify :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:45:05
Great job!! I'll be busy for a while :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:32:23
Here's my dilemma; I have $100ish BTC on coinbase. The majority of my bitcoin is on a wallet but I'm reluctant to send the $100 until I acquire more and send it all together to advojd fees. It's getting ridiculous how much they are. What should I do?
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:41:35
this would actually be really interesting 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:14:06
Thanks Pineapple Fund!
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:50:46
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:26:00
$1400 from $20???? Holy cow man, you must have gotten in early. Good for you man :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:30:17
, you seem like a really awesome guy

@_date: 2017-12-17 08:03:25
thank you, this makes sense 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:01:30
Don't DM him 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:47:06
Breadwallet, Blockfolio, or Delta. :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:46:32

@_date: 2017-12-17 07:53:12
i'm actually curious though
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:47:07
holy fuck 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:46:15
check this out!
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:33:34
While all the projects he donated to was amazing, I really hope he does treat himself some how or some way. He deserves it :)
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:51:33
Could someone explain why there is such a rivalry?
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:42:17
Honestly this is actually really interesting. I'm intrigued as to how this would turn out 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:45:49
this is good advice 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:59:05

@_date: 2017-11-26 13:34:04
Wholesome conversation :D
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:15:18
Someone baked a wholesome pi :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:54:28
I second this notion :D
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:20:55
No it's just fantasy 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:40:46
came here to say the exact same thing :(
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:02:44
Hey what app is this?
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:07:45
I like this 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:58:23
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:49:41
Really interesting 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:48:24
Bitcoins is the way to go
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:45:14
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:02:25
Does coinbase split them though? They still haven't given anyone their bitcoin cash from the last fork...
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:07:56
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:48:47
me too
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:07:28
Yup. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:55:01
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:11:27
IT IS???
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:26:40
Yikes. Realistically though, if this hasn't happened in a decade, why would it happen anytime soon? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:05:52
ITS AT 9K BOYS
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:08:28
*Nonexistant 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:56:35
is the place to go. Why not buy on coinbase and transfer to a wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:36:31
I like this idea 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:42:02
No, he intended to download it off a youtube video. But still this sounds like a fish for bitcoin donations and is even worded like one of those nigerian scam emails
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:02:01
Jesus man, that's fucking disgusting. Anyways good for you for sticking to your promise. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:36:30
Lack of creativity if anything 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:04:14
hey what website is this? :D
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:27:44
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:53:25
Wow. This was beautiful. :D
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:59:23
Read his post. He's taken every possible precaution, what else could their be that he did wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:39:42
This is really great!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:05:44

@_date: 2017-11-30 20:00:44
Actually, you can view the source code of any google chrome extension. Just download the source code viewer extension (No, i'm not joking. This exists).
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:47:26
Happy ending :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:22:28

@_date: 2017-11-21 09:23:49
You're fucking idiotic. So rude and ignorant, blasting these comments just trying to help you
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:18:11
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:40:15
good point 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:42:31
This needs to be seen more 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:55:52
You should make a tshirt 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:52:09
Damn, I actually sold at 7k and barely made it out w my money. Going to buy the dip again 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:52:26

@_date: 2017-09-04 08:52:35

@_date: 2019-09-30 17:20:11
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-09-30 06:22:19
Where does the fee go if bitcoin is decentralized? I’m sorry i’m stupid
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:59:31
Why do you guys call it HEDL / HODL ? Sorry, i'm still a noob to this. Is that just play on for hold? :)
