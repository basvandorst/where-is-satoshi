Except real damage *is* occurring. Every new issue that pops up is causing damage to the overall acceptability of digital currency. The market cap was just about cut in half. Right now, if your coins are in Bitstamp, Mt.Gox or Coinbase you can't do anything with them, rendering the currency temporarily useless. The more times this keeps happening it's not "a good thing" because it's fixing issues, it's a bad thing because more and more new issues keep popping up. 
Why is so hard to understand that NO ISSUES is a good thing, not finding new ones.

I wasn't able to withdraw my coins all day. Twice my pending transaction was canceled with no notice. Finally around 9pm eastern (6 hours after I first tried) my withdraw went through.

Way to try to polish a turd. First, lets not kid ourselves that when news like this hits that it is a "good thing", it's not. 
Finding problems is not a positive thing. Not finding any problems is a positive thing. 
EDIT-- When I said "Not finding problems is a positive thing" I clearly meant not experiencing any problems is a positive thing. Not sure why anyone would construe that to mean having problems and not finding them would be good.

This... Fucking this. The American government has been way out of control for decades but ever since 9/11 it has been in hyperdrive. They have been making their own rules, breaking existing rules and anyone or anything they dont like they just gets eliminated. Anyone who outs the government on their illegal activity is considered an enemy of the state. There is no sign of it ending, none.

True. I guess I just didn't phrase that right but that is what I meant.

I should have said "not having problems" instead of "not finding problems". We can play semantics but I think it's obvious what was meant.

I don't think I would be the best representative to speak on the topic but I would love if this got a little attention on this sub to make sure that the right person/people are interviewed. 
We all know how this works when some jackhole speaks for the group. Anyone care to direct this to our best voices?

Ive never once seen any Bitcoin news in this sub yet that wasn't declared "actually good news". Why start now eay?

You could always, you know, read the article which explains it.

Finding problems certainly isn't proof that there aren't problems. What you are suggesting is something akin to saying people getting hurt on the job is a good thing because people are bound to get hurt on the job rather than having one of those signs up that says "234 days without an injury". I'd suggest Bitcoin is better off avoiding injuries.
