The recent Android update says that SegWit is implemented, however I believe that you need to generate a new wallet (which will contain SegWit addresses in it) and transfer your funds to it to be able to benefit from  it. I grew to dislike Electrum recently and switched to Green Address with a SegWit wallet.

You can try it out, install it and create a wallet, select "Receive" and look at how the address starts. I think Electrum 3 on Mac has bech32 format enabled, so I assume it should start as "bc1". The addresses I'm given on GreenAddress all start with "3" which is P2SH.
[Quick Explaination](
I'm still a bit confused myself but from my experience, I was able to transact from the old address format (starting with 1) to the new one starting with 3.
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

I used Electrum on mac and it seemed pretty OK, I don't have an iPhone unfortunately so can't recommend anything for it.

Pretty sure you could've sent your funds from coinbase to GDAX (free) and from there withdrawn to Bittrex for free since GDAX pay the fees.

Mainly UI, scrolling is buggy, bu also Electrum doesn't let you choose your fees precisely e.g. jumps from 70sat/b to 50sat/b.

In the age of deep fake videos where any words can be put into anyone's mouth and made into a video (for example: politicians) this will be very important in the future.
