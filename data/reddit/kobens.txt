"$100 worth of bitcoin, which looks paisley"
Everyone starts somewhere :) my first purchase was $15. Welcome aboard!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:13:34
Based off $8K is now $4K I'm guessing you purchased mid-December-ish. 
Did you need that $8K in January? if so you shouldn't have invested that $8K. Only invest as much as you can afford to lose at the time. Maybe only $2k in December. 
OR-- is the answer "no I don't need it in January". Then I would say stay calm. Welcome to the swings of crypto. I haven't been in here long but I quickly realized these wild price swings have long been a part of these markets. Don't sell yet if you're looking for short to mid term gains, as it'd obviously be at a loss. If you're looking for long term gains, 1 month is not long term. So stay calm and don't sell.
Me... most my purchases as of late were at the $16 - $18K range. Those were my buy targets when I sold at $20K. Obviously, I bought back in too early. Right now though, I'm reviewing my finance sheets and looking into the coming months to see how much I can responsibly afford to buy more during this dip. 
Invest Responsibly.

No problem! There's a lot to take in in this crypto world. I feel overwhelmed myself.
Really glad for OP's post. I downloaded the Bitcoin Core wallet about a week ago and was soon preparing to finally move my Bitcoins off my exchange and into my own wallet. Without this post I would not have known that the core GUI does not yet support Segwit (granted I see its command line interface does).
Are you happy with your Trezor? That's a USB wallet right? I am planning to be a long term hodler so maybe I should invest in one of those over utiling a wallet located on an internet connected PC that could potentially be infected with malware.

It matters the address it was sent from. If you are sending from a Segwit address (like the Trezor you just send your coins to) it will be processed as a Segwit transaction (a good thing)
The non Segwit address you send it to, when THAT address eventually sends those received coins, that will be processed as a non segwit transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:47:49
Segwit2x included a block size increase, which would have resulted in a hard fork.
Segwit, was not a block size increase. It does however allow for smaller transaction sizes, which results in more transactions within the same 1mb block BTC still uses today.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:50:11
It at least helps the network for the next time you intend to send a transaction.

Good luck! I started mining last September. Only have 3 cards at the moment. It's a fun pass time of mine now just reading a few articles a week, tweaking my setup, planning my next investment / hardware purchase.
The first GPU I already had (gaming machine of mine), in December was when I first bought two more cards specifically for the purpose of mining.
They are well on their way towards paying themselves off this year. However I don't plan on selling my earnings into fiat, instead I'm collecting a variety of coins I find promising and hope for their future to turn out well. 
The way I see it, my extra electricity costs per month (which right now isn't bad given I only have a few cards) is essentially my "monthly investments". Instead of monthly contributions to a 401K, its contributions to the utility company, but yields cryptocurrency :p
(Small note: I still put towards a 401K, don't want to put all my eggs in one basket so a diverse portfolio is a good portfolio). 
I haven't heard of RavenCoin but now have something else to read into! Good community can also be found on LuckPool.org, on their Gitter chat room. It's an EquiHash mining pool, they helped me with a lot of my Q/A last fall when I was getting started.

If I remember correctly each resulting hash is the result of not only the nonce, but a segment of the end of the hash of the prior block. Therefore it is impossible to find "valid future hashes" because one can only ever find a valid hash for a single upcoming block. Once that next block is found, the hash of that impacts what is valid for the next block. 
This is also part of why it is called a block "chain". Every block is chained to the prior block so to speak.

If you are looking to reduce your costs in fees i recommend looking into an exchange over CoinBase. CoinBase has GDAX. I use Gemini because GDAX is not available in my state.
Gemimi has free deposits and you start at a 0.25% fee per trade.

If your goal is a long term BTC savings account make sure you are buying on CoinBase's GDAX or any or exchange. 
Coinbase.com has higher fees than an exchange will.
Also be sure you understand how to transfer that BTC out of the exchange and into a cold wallet of your own.
Rule is if it's not in your hands it's not your coin. Exchanges can get hacked. It's still an emerging market lacking well established regulations yet. Etc.
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:43:34
If I am not mistaken (and I may be, still educating myself). Bitcoin Core wallet requires the entire Bitcoin block chain, which is 155.4GB. it is known as what is called a "Full Node" wallet. Electrum is a lightweight node wallet. It does not store the entire block chain on your computer to work. 
Full node wallets help assist in the overall health of the network, but not everyone is going to want to download a file that size just to get their wallet to work, thus, they use a lightweight node wallet. 
Once you have generated a wallet, and securely write down on a piece of paper your "Seed Phase", you can effectively copy/transfer that wallet to any other supporting Bitcoin wallet software.
Note that this is not "copying" your money, as your money isn't really anywhere. It's rather... always on the block chain. Your wallet's seed phrase can be used to regenerate the private and public keys, which simply proves to the network that you have the right to spend the bitcoin currently stored in your wallet's address.
I bring this up to point out that you can go ahead an pick a wallet now, with the understanding that if you so choose to, you can use a different wallet later.

EDIT: As others have pointed out my original comment describes a Ponzi Scheme, not a Pyramid Scheme. Thank you to those who pointed this out.
A person / entity running a ~~pyramid~~ *ponzi* scheme uses incoming money from newer investors to payback the older investors. While never utilizing investor money to actually make money in the first place. Until newer investors dry up and it collapses on itself. 
Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme. There is no central authority "paying back the early adopters". 
Many of your other points may be true but I just wanted to clarify this. I see the term "pyramid scheme" used a lot to describe Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but this is an inaccurate use of the term.

You're correct, thank you for pointing this out. I've updated my original comment to reflect this. 
Still, I do not believe pyramid scheme is an accurate description of crypto currencies. If so then the stock market would also be  pyramid scheme... Are the original investors of companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, the "tip of the pyramid"?
Per Wikipedia:


Comparing this to your scenario of recruiting a friend. I would have to apply additional instructions to that friend "and when you go get another person involved, you'll get paid". No one is (or at least shouldn't be) claiming that. 
And for that matter, if I recruit a friend to purchase Bitcoin, that doesn't necessarily increase the value of my current Bitcoin holdings. It is entirely possible that my friend goes onto an exchange, places a limit buy order for under spot price, and thereby does not increase the current valuation of bitcoin. Sure, he/she may contribute to increasing the overall *buying pressure*, which, *may* result in an increase in spot price. But that is not guaranteed (and anyone stating so, is lying). Any existing holder of Bitcoin could come along, and sell their current holdings at the price buyers are bidding at, thereby reducing the current spot price. 
In the scenario above, I would have then successfully recruited a friend into the Bitcoin economy, but because my friend was patient and waited for a seller to meet him at his desired price, my own Bitcoin is now actually worth less despite having added another player into the mix. 
I think it all comes down to a common question I see around here... "What is Bitcoin?" Is it 
* A store of value?
* A currency, to be used for commerce when trading value for a commodity?
* Is it a speculative investment tool, to be used for (the hope of) yielding higher profits in the future?
Which in my opinion, it is perfectly valid to say it is all of the above. However, due to this digital form of currency being very much in it's infancy (sure 2013 and 2017 were both dramatic years of increased interest, but in the grand scheme of things 7-8 years is nothing) it can be very difficult for some people to accept the first two concepts above. 
**A Store of Value** Gold has been around, and people have put value on it, for thousands of years. Also due to it's (somewhat) finite supply it is rather resistant to decreasing in value due to increased supply. Who knows though, maybe when space exploration advances we'll find some huge supply of gold from an asteroid. Back to Bitcoin, due to it's finite supply, and, (like gold) people are willing to place value on it, it can currently be used as a store of value. Will it stand the test of time though? We have yet to see. 
**A Currency** This is still up for debate, however I am on the side that it is. Adoption of it on a global scale however, is once again, in the very early stages. I'd be very hard pressed to walk around and find a single store in my area that accepts bitcoin, despite living in a metropolitan area. Additionally, Bitcoin will never completely replace Fiat. I sure hope it gains significant adoption globally that I can use it in my every day life, but it will not replace fiat due to it's dependency on the internet. I was thinking about this actually just this afternoon while listening to MPR about the current state of Puerto Rico. I believe over 80% of their power grid is out at the moment... Good luck using bitcoin there even if your local shop accepts it.
**As a speculative investment tool** In it's current state, it is obvious that it is being used for this. Myself being one of them. Many people are betting on it raising in value. Some are simply holding for the day it becomes a certain amount, others are day trading on it. Much to your point though that the more people who join in the space, the less likely the later joiners will benefit (as much) in ongoing gains. Come that day though, the stabilization of the price will drastically improve the purposes of it being "A store of value" and a "currency, to be used in trade, for a commodity". And those late adopters while may not see gains they can make use of those aspects much more easily.
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:14:51
Just getting involved in digital currencies for the first time myself, but I'll take a shot at answering this.
The average person, right now, is admittedly not spending their fiat currency on digital currency. If by "average" you mean simply mean a significant % of the population, enough so that you'll probably even find the capability for using these currencies at your day to day retail stores. 
But over time as the community grows and people get educated on how they work, their markets too will mature further and see less drastic swings. 
Right now when I talk to my friends about it most of them have never heard of it or when they have they may say something like "ah, fake money". It's gonna take time for that to change, at least in my region.

Been looking into this a lot this past week and finally picked Gemini.com
With USD you can only buy BTC and ETH but it's completely free deposit and withdraw fees. Because they allow Bank Transfer (most other sites I find have Wire transfer, which as $25 fee from my bank is very expensive for me), I can get my USD into the exchange for free. 
Their trading fee is 0.25% for my trading volume, the highest they have (lowers for higher volume traders). So a $50 purchase of Bitcoin was only $0.13 in fees. Compared to a $1.64 fee on CoinBase I had when I bought $15 worth with a credit card. 
Gemini's interface is easy to use too. Good way to get BTC or ETH at a low fee. If you're interested in other currencies you could then transfer your BTC or ETH to Bittrex and buy your alt coin there with ETH or BTC (I have yet to do this, but I assume it'd be easy to do). Reason for buying on Gemini first is Bittrex only does Wire Transfer for getting your USD into the exchange, which are costly from bank fees.
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:03:49
This question in combination with your username slightly made me cringe. hahaha.
I'll be nice though. 
GDAX, like any other exchange, is a platform where buyers and sellers can come together. They place orders at the price they want. For example, "I'll sell my 1 Bitcoin, for $4,200 US Dollars". So I place a Limit Sell order, of 1 Bitcoin, at a rate of $4,200 US Dollars. If the current trading price of bitcoin is lower than that, the order get placed onto the order book and sits there until either I cancel, or Bitcoin buyers raise the demand high enough that the price reaches $4,200 and someone comes along and buys my bitcoin. 
Same process can be applied in reverse. "I'll buy 1 Bitcoin, at a rate of $3,200". If the price is above that, my order gets placed onto the order book, until sellers drive down the price and a seller comes along and sells me 1 Bitcoin for my asked rate of $3,200. 
In your situation though, since you're looking simply to invest in small quantities of bitcoin over time as a savings method. You could place "Market Orders" to buy bitcoin. The exchange will automatically fulfill your order, at the cheapest rate currently available (which is the lowest rate that any seller is currently selling at). 
This is the basics of any exchange. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:52:36
Wow that article took a look at cryptocurrencies from a viewpoint which I have yet to have ever thought of. Same could be said for language and religion. Very interesting read thank you.
To the topic of market value and stabilization, I'd guess there are still some other points which show that it has yet many ways to "mature". 
Lets reference the global market cap of Gold. 
This article is from 2015, but prices per ounce aren't far off. In the article the price was about $1,100 USD per ounce. Putting the global market cap at $6.3 Trillion at the time. 
Like (many) Crypto Currencies, gold cannot be made "made", there is only so much of it in the world. Bitcoin can only be mined 21 million coins. Others vary in their number as well. While there are some (doge coin) that were "made for fun" and can generate an unlimited number of coins. 
Lets actually apply some of the logic from your article then, to this. May be interesting. Lets assume that as your referenced article states, there will always be a few (but never only one) dominating and "mature" currencies in the market. And lets also put a bet that of these coins that do end up sticking around, the ones that do all are of the type that have a hard limit on what can be mined. 
Therefore, like gold, once the market follows what your TechnologyReview states, there will be essentially a hard limit on how many coins are globally to be born into existence.
If that scenario comes to be true, some aspects are:
1. Not all coins have been mined yet. Sure, not all gold has been either, but gold is getting more and more resource intensive to mine. (It is my opinion) that cryptocurrencies on the other hand will eventually be mined out and we'll reach a point where transaction fees are the only reward. My guess is that'll help stabilize market prices. No data to back that up just a feeling.
2. Right now... I'd say it is still very early in the game for digital coins. I'm no expert here but if coins are certainly here, and here to stay then we're in the 2nd year of "Spurred interest" globally. Last time which was around 2013 if I've been reading correctly. In fact as I write this, prices are crashing. I sorely wish I had waited to purchase the $150 worth I did for the first time ever the other day, but also am keeping calm as I believe the price will restore itself in time. Right now we just saw Bitcoin reach $5,000 for the first time the other day. First time ever. That's a big deal and it caused many to simply "cash out" on their earnings. This is causing a price drop. To me, I'll look at it as digital coins are on sale today. 
3. Crypto currencies steadily decrease in their block chain reward, when this happens, it seems to cause stirs in their price value in a market (if I've been reading correctly). Just another sign in my opinion, that when a coin's reward goes to transaction fees only it may help stabilize prices for it. 
Also... the day for a cashless society is far away (if not never) simply because of the same reasons your article discusses. Gold has value. US Dollars has value. Euros has value. Pesos, etc. Like languages, and religions, no single currency has "won out". Crypto currencies won't fully replace that. Just like one cryptocurrency won't fully replace all others. Other non-market reasons we're not going to a fully cashless society is not everyone gets technology. And signs that show crypto currencies need more time to mature is that they need more user friendly interfaces (much like these ATMs in the picture). It's taken me weeks of reading into it just to finally start buying some myself, and I consider myself rather tech savvy since I work in the industry. Most citizens aren't going to go through that much effort just to pick a coin and learn what exchange to buy it on at the lowest fees, etc. 
Fiat cash, like digital cash, is here to stay.

You drop the coin in the merchants's hand. The merchant puts it into a cash registrar that is consuming kilowatt hours. End of the day a machine counts that coin consuming kilowatt hours. A vehicle transfers that to the bank consuming fossil fuels... 
The energy consumption cycle continues with fiat movement just as it does with digital currency movement.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:13:28
Fair enough. I get what you're saying here.
Still, isolating the fiat transaction to only the point of sale is a bit unfair, since that's not what really occurs in a real world example. The grocery store needs to transport that stored value elsewhere to continue it's ongoing operations.
Now in fiat's defense... the grocery store clerk can use a (once already transfered that day) coin inside the registrar, as change and give it back to a customer who reguires change during a later transaction. That secondary movement of the same exact coin was rather... "efficient" from an energy consumption standpoint.
I love bitcoin so far but have no delusions that it will ever replace fiat. Just like one form of fiat has never won out all others over the centuries. I believe digital currencies are here to stay, but will always continue to exist alongside other forms of currencies. 
Good chat :) enjoy hearing other views and opinions.

I am not sure what point you are making here then. From one angle you just stated that all energy consumption through the use of gold, stops once the gold coin is minted. Then in the follow up to my comment you acknowledge that any transfer of value involves energy consumption.
Moving gold around by trucks, is a ton of energy consumption.

I encourage you to spread your message with less of a self-promoting, and directing tone. As a programmer myself, I agree with your objective but am just looking at how it may come off to others outside of the development community. 
Not everyone will specialize in everything. Yes learning to code is becoming more and more of a valuable skillset to have but many people have busy lives and at the end of the day everyone has "black boxes" in their lives. Devices that work that we don't know the intricacies of how it works.
"You should do your part and become a citizen of the new age" implies that if you don't know this skillset, you are somehow not doing your part being a contributing citizen of society, which is ridiculous and can deter potential newcomers to our community. So if that's the outcome you're seeking there's better ways to communicate it.

Once a gold coin is minted there is still plenty of energy consumption every time that gold coin is used. I work for a company that sells bullion coins. When we sell an (already minted) gold coin to a customer that involves 
1. Energy consumption to operate our website's servers, and/or call center to facilitate the initial sale.
2. Energy consumption to handle order fulfillment, this ranges from creation of the packaging materials used to ship the gold coin in, to the fossil fuels the trucks burn to deliver the coin to the customer. 
3. Since the gold is purchased with fiat, there is energy consumption by the banks to facilitate transferring fiat value from the consumer to our business.
Energy consumption, is inevitable no matter what form of currency we come up with. *Energy is what moves the universe, and nothing in this universe happens without some form of energy transfer. Nothing.* 
Even if I chose to walk the gold bar from point A to point B. I'm burning calories. Those calories are stored energy. That energy came from somewhere.

Yes which he stated specifically that he didn't want to use that.

Please [see my comment here]( regarding how I switched to ActiveTrader. No communication with Gemini was necessary.
Hope it helps.

When I switched to "ActiveTrader" it was just a simple opt-in under the account menu. I do not recall where exactly so cannot give you step-by-step instructions but it was under there. 
It was an easy thing to do however. No communication with their support necessary, just a simple configuration change to my account. I am not a "select customer" of any sort. I do not have a large amount of money in my account (say compared to an actual Day Trader), current notational value of my account is about $3K depending on current prices of assets.
I do very much think it is bullshit that they have these fees so widely varying between now what is Mobile App, ActiveTrader, API Interface, and Web Application. Especially Web Application vs ActiveTrader. They're both web browser applications with just a different front end skin and tooling. And for that matter the old "Web Application" is a dumbed-down web browser interface than ActiveTrader, with less features. So why they'd charge higher fees for an application that's cheaper on their end to maintain (from a development standpoint) is beyond me. If the idea is to encourage people to switch to ActiveTrader, just nuke the old interface don't take more money away from your customers by penalizing them for using it.
Anyways last paragraph was a bit rantish but I hope the first two help you. As a Minnesota resident I have to resort to Gemini since it is one of the few (if not only?) licensed in Minnesota with free ACH deposits.

Interesting. I've seen that for their Sandbox Environment. I must have just been lucky and switched early on during the program.
Which... IMO, is another fail on their part. Their "Web Application" interface was always sub-par in my opinion from any other exchange I've experienced. Why they'd force people to stay on it just hurts their own reputation as a "serious exchange" in the industry.
