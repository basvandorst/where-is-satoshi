I also get about 95 Mhash with a 4890. I'm using SDK 2.4 with the Phoenix miner using settings AGGRESSION=5 VECTORS.
I've heard SDK 2.2 is better, so I might try that later.

I looked up exponential vs. geometric growth and the only difference it seems to me is that geometric is discrete and exponential is continuous. Why would that make Bitcoin better?

No, the Bitcoin network is dependent on using the miners to solve hashes in order to secure the network.

2) On average, pools will payout less than solo mining, but the payouts will be more consistent.

No, the calculations done by miners is used to cryptographically secure the network.

No, that post is incorrect. That would be an arithmetic progression because the difference between two terms is constant.
If you look further down in the same thread, there's a [post]( that says that any geometric progression is a set of discrete points on an exponential curve, which is why I'm confused why you would say an exponential function would grow faster than a geometric progression.
As far as I know, the nth term of a geometric progression is a(n) = a*r^(n-1) which is clearly an exponential function.

I think the 5850 will be the best hashrate per cost, for the forseeable future.
