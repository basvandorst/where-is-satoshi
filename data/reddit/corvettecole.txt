They put a hold on my account to "investigate possible fraudulent activities in accordance with federal law". I literally used this bitcoin account just to buy things off of purse.io and only used it once lol

Hold up, what happened to circle? They told me they had to review my account and would be holding my money for 90 days. I still have $50 in it!

Download an app called Circle. You can buy bitcoin with debit, credit, or bank and it's instant. I love it. Make sure to change your currency in settings to bitcoin though

Aye but it'll probably spike again tonight

Pls no sink

I've been trading between USD and BTC the past few days and I've already doubled my BTC. It's been good. I'm hoping my prediction is right for my amateur trading sake

Purse.io is on the receiving end, my counterparty address is the sender
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:40:58
It says "Transaction fee is too low"
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:26:17
Yes but it's not helpful because it's been over 72 hours and my bitcoins haven't been returned
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:19:21
That's counterparty, sorry. Also why shouldn't I use it?

I'm using Circle and changing the currency strategically

I have a 12 word passphrase to get in as well as a password, I think I saw the key thing in my settings once before so I might have access to that. Also there are multiple different sites that host the counterparty software since it is open source. Additionally, I mostly use an app to access my counterparty wallet. There is definitely an option for "transition to a new wallet" so maybe I can get my private key or whatever through that.

Really? I'm not even verified I just used my debit card
@_date: 2016-10-30 21:02:17
I'm in the US too. Hmm. Maybe mine is just bugged
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:16:37
How do I make sure the wallet isn't re-sending? I don't see a setting for that. I'm using counterwallet.io
