Are you really that thin-skinned, that when someone points out your "hypothetical" is moronic, you go all on them?
I'm hoping you're trying to troll with this, because otherwise its both sad and pathetic.

And.... most people don't care, and they never will.  
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:13:32
.... to exchange goods with *the* other Venezuelan who has also has a sat phone, enough filthy fiat to pay for sat phone, and the desire to accept bitcoin.  
Yeah, you haven't thought this through.

Make sure you have your credit card info ready before you call. They charge by the second from the time they answer.
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:42:08
Mostly because regular people don't have time to dig up their birdbaths.

You might not know this, but the general population doesn't give a shit about oligarchs/corporations.
@_date: 2019-02-08 22:54:18
Same as now.  Drugs, slaves and kiddy porn.
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:53:27


That's exactly the point.  We already *have* money.  Crypto is re-inventing the wheel.  There's no benefits for consumers, so there are no reasons for them to switch.  There will be no mass adoption, because crypto isn't needed.

Am I missing something?  Pointing out that *one* person was wrong about a technology doesn't prove anything.

is dick safu?
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:46:28


Yes.  They often are: Bre-x, enron, worldcom, bernie madoff, tyco
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:20:37
You think consumers are going to line up for making irreversible payments for goods/services that may never be delivered?  With no recourse besides saying SFYL?
@_date: 2019-01-21 04:55:32
What's it like to live with your head in the sand?
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:40:04
Your assertion is moronic.  You asked:


I gave you examples.  Then you changed the goalposts of the argument because reality doesn't mesh with your baggage.  Good luck in the future and SFYL.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:08:55
Its impossible to argue with someone who lacks both self-awareness and life experience.  SFYL and welcome to ignore.
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:21:18
I 100% thought it was satire.
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:42:19


What do you mean by "transfer wealth"?
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:32:39
Of course you did. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:53:57


Enjoy starving to death, while sleeping on the sidewalk.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:40:55
You forgot useless in your list of things those bits are.  That's why crypto is doomed to failure.
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:28:23
The truth is a bitter pill to swallow.  You rush to call me a troll for speaking the truth.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:05:57
Well, I know what's not going on in the world.  That's adoption of bitcoin.

good investments pay dividends to shareholders
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:19:44
If you HODL forever, how are you going to "transact using bitcoin in future no fiat needed"?
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:31:39
It used to be this way.  When the greater fools speculating in crypto stopped coming, it lost its utility.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:21:04
sorry for your loss
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:10:16
Your strings of bits have no inherent value.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:07:51
You need something to wash down the shit sandwich.
