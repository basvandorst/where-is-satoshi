Localbitcoins.com, coinbase.com if you want to buy bitcoin often and more long term.

Very different actually. There are reserves built for tons and tons of gold. Everything from Oil, Currency, Wars, recovering ship wrecks is related to gold. To even compare bitcoin to gold is ROFFLE cake, cya bitches.

I was answering questions for instant or ez verification or whatever so I didn't have to wait three days...because all the last question was cutoff, I guessed and it was the wrong answer lol. I feel like such a newb what the hell is wrong with this site, mt gox works for me fine but after sending btc there they are holding it hostage pretty much donated to those fuckers

since exchanges are a major pain in the ass the only trading I do is on LBC. Yeah amateur I know but you can bet the buy orders I have for BTC if the price is lower tomorrow Ill be cancelling. I have stellar feedback but fuck that shit.

to each its own, I'm here to make a quick buck no shame in my game
I appreciate everyone's motivation and advocating for this new payment method. I just don't see it happening but this is the most fun I had, better than messing with stocks by a million. Just loving the volatility.

There is quite a bit of people with the best interest of bitcoin and it succeeding as a payment option and its evolution for what it is and long term as you mentioned. 
A lot more at this time are interested in its profitability. I started researching, buying/selling more when the rise started around $250-300 and I am more interested in profitability as well. I don't think it will be around a couple years from now, its a short lived fad and the only thing that I can say it would be helpful in, is what the big investment firms had mentioned which it can be used to easily move money, as a small business owner the second part of bitcoin that I can relate to is its merchant processing fees. As someone that pays hundreds of thousands of dollars in processing fees annually to VISA/MC/AMEX, anything that introduces less fees for processing transactions for my business I am all for it, but BTC at the moment is not something I am interested in moving thousands of dollars a day through. I am interested in gambling with it and so far have yielded positive returns 0_o!

I just did 8x after reading your post...thing is it works perfectly fine on my iphone on the same network. I mean it functions but literally its like a 1/100th of the actual page on the very bottom and the whole right side of the screen is blank. When I update account information it is fine but for everything else this is how I have to use it, pretty frustrating guess Ill just have to use my iphone for coinbase. I tried everything refresh etc. Or...I should probably download Chrome and just use it on there...

I'm using windows 8, I registed like a week ago sent an email to support as well. Eventually after messing around with it I am able to finally use parts of the site but it is still partially cutoff like its a new site they just finished or something looks like it was botched together beta version stuff
