Why would that be sarcastic? It is an equilibrium, there is a point at where the profitability of mining a block is zero

I'm not sure this works as you expect. The difficulty will increase or decrease as needed to keep the average block time at 10 minutes
Adding or removing hashrate only has a temporary effect until the network adjusts

I didn't purchase it myself (it was sent to me after doing some work online) but I believe one can trade any amount of money for a fraction of a coin, down to one one millionth of a bitcoin

It might be looking at the total number of blocks, and multiplying it by the size of the block it is currently on to get a rough estimate of how large the entire blockchain is
As it starts downloading larger blocks, the total size estimate increases which makes it look like it's slowing down even if the download is still going at the same rate
For example: if there are 100 blocks and the first block is 1 unit in size you could estimate that the blockchain is 100 units. If you download 2 unit per hour you could estimate your speed to be 2%/hour. If the second block is now 2 units in size, your estimated total size is now 200 units, so your speed would be an estimated 1%/hour if you continue to download at the same rate

I've got a ticker on my phone's home screen, I've also had an IFTTT running for about 3 years pushing a notification of the price to my phone every day  at noon...having a bit of trouble getting my card to verify with coinbase, so I ended up getting these by doing some work online

Smaller blocks force the development to occur faster, for sure, but even with a larger block size (like 2, 4, or even 10X larger), second layer development is crucial to the ongoing scaling. While larger blocks delay the development, it would have to happen eventually.

@_date: 2018-10-20 04:38:39
True...I was most curious about how the Bitcoin network would recover if large portions of it were kept separate for a period of time, and less worried about the solar stuff or how it would happen (that was just an example that I didn't think much about on what would cause the issue)

A while back, someone accidentally misspelled "hold", and now it's a meme of sorts in crypto. Basically just saying that you shouldn't sell your coins when the price is low, especially if it's under the price that you bought it at, because the expectation is that the price will go up eventually

@_date: 2019-01-03 19:07:19
Thanks, I'll try to set it up
One issue I may have is that my laptop (Ubuntu 18.10) doesn't have enough free space to store the blockchain, and my desktop that is running the node is using windows. Crossing my fingers it still goes smoothly
Is there a way to run lightning on one device, but use the blockchain from a device over the network?

Else, I'd recommend Electrum, but there are many others

This is exactly the outcome expected from this event; Shed the weak and shady exchanges and hopefully be left with the better ones.
Also a good time to pull from exchanges completely, and use bisq or localbitcoins to do the buying/selling
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:44:16
Are these nodes at risk for staying on these old versions?

I agree with you, the community needs to lighten up, be more welcoming to newcomers, and foster quality discussions. 
I think more people to should try to be like [Andreas Antonopoulos]( who is a great source of information, or with his [publicly traded YouTube channel]( using [Ravencoin](reddit.comassets (not to mention his contagious laughter and constant positivity) who are actually doing a lot of good for crypto
I love the idea of averaging, but I wish DCA was easier to do, like if it was automated on an exchange
The closest I found has been to mine (cost of electricity over time), or use [Shakepay Change]( (Canadian exchange that rounds up debit/credit purchases to the next dollar and buys BTC or ETH with it...that's my referral link, $30 for each of us if you deposit $100) but neither option really allow you to set a dollar/frequency/limit
