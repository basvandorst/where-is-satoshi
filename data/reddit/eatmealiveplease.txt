you poor poor people.  if you only knew how much Entertainment you have been providing for r/finance with your Circle Jerks and group reaffirmations with headlines like this.  the only guys I know who traded bitcoin,  the smartest traders I know who have been doing this for many years, they figured out a synthetic way of shorting Bitcoin when it was an 800 900 area and they just love watching guys like you who never say die, when you never really understand why you were in, add to a major loser like this. 
  good luck to you you're going to need it. 
you can reply and down vote all you want I had my morning laugh I won't be back here nothing to be learned for a sane person in this forum.

cant feed your family consistently with "win some, lose some"  Was getting $50 to do work and then paying that $50 for food not working that the world needed this invention??? I repeat,  A bunch of bored, uninformed people found something to get excited about will find themselves in over their heads.

i love watching newbies who have ZERO market experience give trading advice to other lemmings.

you used the word capital in two different definitions there.  The sentence is just pure rhetoric and doesnt say much.

I can appreciate the sanctimonious idea that this isnt about you.  Have you commited to donating all your gains to a charity?  Does your heart hurt when the value goes down, do you smile when it goes up?  its about you.
If you really felt strongly about a cause, youd find a company you believed in on the stock exchange and invest in them instead of this "get rich of that sucker's ignorance" ultra-volatile ponzi.

when you look up the definition of "long term investment" nowhere will you find the term 'Over time it should do nothing but go up.'  There is much risk involve din investing, ESCPAILLY when the underlying will drop 77% in 2 DAYS.  Please dont shuffle the heavy risk here under the carpet.  This an option trade.  Either 1000% return or 100% loss.  Lets make sure to call it what it is.  
Ive been a trader for 10 years, i know what that kind of language of guaranteed returns gets, and it usually ends with fools losing all their money.  Im just here for the LOLz.  I tried opening an account to short 200$ but I quickly learned you are handing money to brokerage accounts that have no centralized regulated BD backing it, no insurance, no guarantee. I.E.  Youll wake up one morning with a 404 error and nowhere to turn.

ive been trading for a living for 10 years.  What that guy said was LAUGHABLE.  so no.

Fundamentals?  you guys REALLY drank the Kool-Aid.  When you buy a stock you are buying your share of future earnings and dividend payments.  When you buy bitcoin you are.....??
What currency in the world fluctuates the way this one does?  imagine you are a retailer selling a TV for bitcoins.  You sold the TV for 4 bitcoins ($1000) 2 days ago, by the time it hits your bank its worth $300.  That means you lost money on the venture.  Not exactly what you got into the retail business for.  To give away free merchandise.
 Take a guess if Ill you'll ever accept bitcoin again for future TVs...
goodluck my man.

in the REAL currency market a 0.5% fluctuation in a day is ABSORBED.  77% in 2 days?  no one who has a family, takes themselves seriously as a business owner can viably take this seriously.  This is a big game.  A bunch of bored people found something to get excited about.
