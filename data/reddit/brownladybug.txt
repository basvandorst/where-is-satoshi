It is a worrying situation.  That's why some mining pools have to limit the number of users they allow on their servers for the sake of that..

What you're saying makes no sense actually. There's a difference between direct deposit and wire transfers. Also banks don't charge fees for conversions. They have exchange rates. Finally, a solution like this would be easiest if he can't get anything else working, because he doesn't even need to do anything.

I made a few mistakes along the way, also purchased some extra things. 9 miners plus all my expenses came out around $320. As I ordered my miners I also ordered two USB hubs. When I got the hubs I realized that I had made the dumbest mistake of not paying attention to power consumption on USB ports. You need powered hubs and if they're not the best they won't power more than 5 at a time...I also dedicated some money to heat sinks for the chips. Plus two USB powered fans. 7 of the 9 miners were at $25 and 2 at $35. I used to mine on bitminter for a really long time but recently switched to eligius and I'm making hella more. Each miner makes me 0.0025BTC per week. Also because of merged mining, I'm getting a deposit of 0.005Namecoins every 24 hours ish.

Block erupters are sold online on eBay and amazon. There are other ASIC units you can look into. A few companies make these including BFL and KnCminer. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:36:11
I've never had any issues with them. And honestly all the people who've had problems with then come back happy because apparently they're good at customer satisfaction.
@_date: 2013-12-15 12:03:42
Those are ASIC USB Erupter miners. 
  
They are indeed in two hubs, each hub connected to a USB port. These babies need powdered USB hubs because USB 2.0mports can't power more than, if you get lucky, 2 simultaneously.  
  
They still do a good job! They each make me around $2 a week depending on btc prices :)

Unfortunately I don't. Mainly because they don't have any stats up whatsoever. I purchased my contract in August, and it was a September contract set to start around Sep 17th. It didn't till late October, due to technical difficulties. I did earn my original investment back which is really just thanks to the crazy rise in btc price to be honest. The contract has hashed me around 1.12 blocks. I sold a whole chunk because I couldn't even imagine bitcoins going over $300 LOL so I sold 0.6btc at $300 back a few weeks... *face palmUltimately over two years the scenario will be me pumping all my earnings into more hash power with their revenue reinvestment. I think only time will tell. The income is still ok considering the multiple ridiculous difficulty increases we've witnessed. But the cold fact remains that the longer you wait the less profitable everything gets. Exponentially...
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:35:38
No no, no bother at all! :)You're right, the set-aside revenue makes a new, smaller contract at the end of the month. This one person I was discussing this on a different post said he was putting 100% of his earnings of the month toward revenue reinvestment. I personally think that's wasted mining time. I've been doing okay with a ~990 Mhps baby-contract since last month. Even with difficulty increases I've been earning around the same amount. This month I've set the 990mhps contract to do 100% toward another baby-contract;as well as 30% of the main contract. It's going to be a fat baby-contract this time! My income will hopefully go higher slightly actually!

What was the promotion? Give 2 BTC and see what happens?
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:37:38
Congrats! :D Keep us posted on your payouts and all.

It's been hovering around $850 +/-$30 for the past couple of days.

What is stopping that from happening is the fact that it will have the same fate as Bitcoin. with the exception that they all will lose value, things will get confusing as far as conducting business, and I think fundamentally that would be in contradiction with the whole Bitcoin philosophy. If Bitcoin were to exist freely the way it was always intended, there would never be the need for a second unregulated anonymous virtual currency. There's already Bitcoin.

Make an account with a currency exchange like mtgox or a dealer like coinbase. You can purchase as much as you want. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:55:32
That's impossible because your computing power is put against the computing power of all of miners in all pools everywhere. For instance eligius alone is running at over 920 Thps. You think you can setup something like that? When 3 terahash machines are $13,000? And that's one pool. So yes. TRY to mine your own blocks. Technically, sure. Realistically, impossible.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:45:02
Should you buy them? That's your call.How to buy them? An easy but slower way is using coinbase.com.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:34:57
That sounds terrible. I'm sorry for your big loss. At this moment what I could think and suggest to you is maybe getting more info on how many stale shares and how many miscalculations he's had and how many shares your miner hashed. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 12:08:22
Last checked they were going for $50. For a while they went up to $80. I got most of mine at $25 and 2 at $35. They each make around 0.0025BTC a week :)

A few people have shown interest in knowing more about frequency and amount of payouts by my Platinum contract. It is interesting to note the slow decay in every payout. You can use this data to analyze different things like the effect of difficulty increase on a 20Ghps contract over time, or if you're interested in a contract yourself, or were wondering about their legitimacy, or whatever else :)I will post every 10 days. Dec 1:Payouts=7Total=0.01803388Average=0.00257627Dec 2:P=4T=0.01028473A=0.00257118Dec 3:P=4T=0.01020736A=0.00255184Dec 4:P=4T=0.00999732A=0.00249933Dec 5:P=3T=0.00741499A=0.00247166Dec 6: (weird day. Must've had server issues)P=1T=0.00245902A=0.00245902Dec 7:P=5T=0.01275296A=0.00255059Dec 8:P=6T=0.01488331A=0.00248055Dec 9:P=3T=0.00746712A=0.00248904Dec 10:P=5T=0.01244757A=0.00248951!!A few things to note:- I have set a 20% revenue reinvestment value for my main contract, which is taken out of each payout. So the numbers you see are pure income, after fees and RRP. I also have a ~990 Mhps contract from the first revenue reinvestments transforming into a contract, which I set to send 100% to revenue reinvestment. This should additionally make up for the difficulty increase, as it has. - their interface is very primitive. There is no way to see what blocks were discovered or how many shares you hashed. You also can't see if you're devices have had down times instead of before run 24/7, with honesty. There will forever be suspicion that they take extra from their clients and report false entries in the ledger, knowing you can't verify anything.

No. Unless you find free asic computers lol

It's not exactly clear yet. Hopefully the companies that people buy and sell with will handle the laws and send out necessary tax forms.

Oh thanks for reminding me! I love it. It was so overdue. Since September it was looking all broken, patched up, bare, and ugly. They earned themselves some cred for sure!
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:02:49
Lmao.. There's no way that with your amount of knowledge you've 'made' your first bitcoin.

It's their personal choice as an adult to do what they want with their money. They bought Bitcoins with it at the price they saw.

Not true. The cost of electricity for these is virtually nothing. Maybe $10 at the end of the year. Each of the devices makes me around 0.0025BTC per week.

Yeah.. I have to keep a very close eye on the weather. I'm constantly checking forecast and precipitation chances and whatnot. I know I'm going to ruin it all one day in a rain storm! xD
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:38:17
Yes it's a 2 year contract which goes until October of 2015. I paid $1,035 for it and have made ~$400 from selling what they had mined for me and I'm holding an additional 0.75 BTC in a paper wallet. They allow you to set aside a percentage of your earnings for them to purchase more hashing power for you to add to your contract which efficiently counteracts difficulty increase. At least as long as you know how to tweak things around properly.

In a scenario where say I've been mining for a while and now I want to buy something with Bitcoin, but since I've been mining I'm exempt from the transaction fees associated with my personal purchase? No that would be hilarious! Of course everyone pays fees for transactions.
