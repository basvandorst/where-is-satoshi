BMO *[used to]( support Bitcoin in the form of buying and selling through CanVirtEx at their branches but dropped those services early last year; and this year they basically [gave the shaft]( to Bitcoiniacs and other companies doing business in Bitcoin... now they want to support it again?
I guess I should be happy (any support is good support?) but all I can think is **FUCK BMO**

If I understand your post, you say that you had a power outage or power surge of some kind where you had to use your phone light to guide your way around.. do you know what caused the outage?  It could have been a lightning strike or other kind of surge; was your equipment protected with an adequate surge protector and/or UPS battery backup?

Say what you will but it works... Small gains for a very long time, with the possibility of a catastrophic loss if you hit a bad string of luck. Same works for roulette as long as there is no maximum bet (I play on Bitzino). It minimizes the risk and is fairly safe if you *stick to the rules of the system*, but of course there's no guarantee.  I've gone from 0.2BTC to over 2 pretty quickly, but hit a bad string which took it down to just about 1 and now haven't played in a while :P 
edit: the beauty of Bitcoin gambling is you can start with miniscule numbers like .0001 so you literally CAN lose 20 or 30 times in a row without risking too much...

"Disclaimer: I can’t assure with 100% certainty that the all the black dots are owned by Satoshi, but almost all are owned by a single entity, and that entity began mining right from block 1"
...and has never spent any of those coins.
Yeah that sounds about right
