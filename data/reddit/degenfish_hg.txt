Who is this "four chan"?

Coblee did precisely that in October 2011 when he released Litecoin, which has 4x the coin limit

All I know is Bitcoin Jesus wouldn't have been able to double spend all those fish and loaves of bread

I mean they want it to arrive before the cops find them

Ooh, ooh, I got another one.
Gather round, children, and hear the story of Bitcoin Jesus who once executed an atomic swap between water and wine

"The payment to owners of the computers that verify bitcoin transactions and record them in a public ledger known as the blockchain fell by half in the middle of this year."
Probably could have mentioned that this was by design

Do you have screenshots/text of the ad content or the sales pitch for the scam?

Glad she's safe, but imagine if he didn't really like her
"50 BTC, huh? ...How about 10,000 DOGE and the ETC that was left over in my Coinbase account after the hard fork?"

Also it'll probably be cold by the time you get confirmations

1 sat, as in one satoshi, or .00000001 BTC

I'll give you 1 sat for it if you pay the transaction fees

Wasn't the halvening basically a non-event for the price last year? Wonder how/if things will be different now that BTC is out of the post-2013 rut
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:32:34
We'll know we're in The Future when the "bad check wall of shame" in convenience stores is replaced with a "zero confirmation exploiters list"
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:38:25
As long as we're involving outside institutions, we could build a company dedicated to storing money, issuing credit and verifying transactions

Having seen similar signs about this time last year, I talked to employees at The D and Golden Gate and neither had any idea how to deal with BTC for accepting hotel reservations, purchases, etc. There was a bitcoin ATM at the D that didn't work at all. Aside from that, none of the marked locations for bitcoin ATMs were valid nor did anyone I asked know where I could find one.
I'll have to head out there again at some point to see how things have changed, but I'd caution anyone hoping to see a crypto adoption paradise to temper their expectations.

Great time for transactions to take goddamn forever when lives are on the line
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:36:21
I heard they just activated segwit
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:03:28
Wish I could downvote twice
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:41:57
It's literally just one BTC ATM that didn't work while I was there; I guess they fixed it maybe? Staff knew sweet FA about it
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:38:47
Someone is literally going to die when a hospital tries to pay the ransom and the confirmations take forever. This stupid BTC civil war will have real, human casualties

And if you want to buy altcoins, you can just DDoS an exchange until the prices tank enough for you to get in

It doesn't get past the spot price of gold in 2017 without all the guys in 2010 buying pizza.

Happy Halvening to all, and to all a good night
It's like the Wilson Phillips song, hodl on for one more day~

BTC is the reason my phone's autocorrect recognizes HODL

I meant that people use it as an intermediary wallet since Coinbase tracks deposits to known wallets used by gambling sites. I'm a BTC novice, but my introduction earlier year came from giving up on fiat deposit/withdrawals to US-facing poker sites and switching to BTC
I actually don't know much about Shapeshift integration, but it sounds like something I should look up

Programmable money that you can program to steal itself, what's not to love?

@_date: 2017-06-02 03:16:53
How will they implement segwit?
@_date: 2016-07-11 16:41:35
Any thoughts on Coinomi for Android? I hear it's convenient for people moving money from Circle/Coinbase to poker sites, haven't heard as much about using it for longer term storage
