I'm laughing at you because you seem to think you are the gatekeeper to what "actual investing" is. 
Investing, speculation, and gambling all have significant overlap. 
Stop trying to flex.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:39:16
I do, but what would you care?
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:16:11
Yeah, not related. But hey, you tried. 
Thanks anyway

You're doing god's work, son.

Any good conversation held at length about bitcoin will inexorably lead to the question of the potential existence of your bitcoin.

My buddy told me about them in 2012. I didn't buy until this year because I couldn't understand the type of asset or  the underlying value.
Long time buddy now rich af. 
I'm still here.

And why do you think that it's a bubble? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:12:28
Thank you, Mortimer.

Oh my god. If you couldn't afford to take out a mortgage as an investment (all investments are gambles), then he shouldn't have in the first place. 
He also bought in at the ATH, which is going to be painful with making any investment. If he could just hodl on for dear life, he'd still make fucking bank. According to what he states he should have 3.86 BTC. I'd kill for that, but maybe not on loan. He can still make huge gains if he can hodl.

That show isn't for "nerds", it's for the people who use the term nerd in a derogatory manner who find the show funny. 
The jokes that come from the subject matter that they touch on is *never*   geared towards the people who understand the source material. It has no wit or cleverness in its use, nor do they draw upon it for the plot. They are merely the props for the cheap half jokes that cue a laugh track. 
The show is for people who know or have nerds in their life who can recognize the references to tech and geeky things, etc. 
*"Haha, I've heard of BattleToads!"*

Oh sweet baby Jesus...
He'll still be paying off that 30k difference he lost as he watches the price climb ������

Well, Mr/s. Giverealygoodadvice, I'm inclined to believe you.

I've been waiting for a real dip. I don't have any clue if and when one is coming.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:53:42
....to buy more bitcoin! Brilliant!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:08:12
I started buying this year with the goal of getting one coin by the end of the year. 
I was on track, and close, but now I'm not so sure I can get there.

Holy shit, I've never seen the source gif. That was a good laugh. This made my night

What do you mean by that? I recently purchased some on coinbase and have yet to do anything with it. Should I be concerned?
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:29:23
For sure, I get around to it eventually. I've been following this sub for awhile, I'm not an expert but I'm certainly not new. I'm currently going through a ton moving and dealing with a death in the family, so I don't have all the time to throw into my reading. But, with that said, I do have people both holding and managing money for me. Coinbase is as far as I can tell a verified company operating in the US.
Very briefly, can you tell me why I should be concerned? My understanding was that the bitcoin I was buying from them had keys, I was able to look at keys under the "send" and "receive" tabs.
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:09:04
That wasn't very informative, but I appreciate the reply. You still haven't clarified your original post with either of those videos, but its cool.
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:39:33
Okay, I got you. Thank you for taking the time to get back to me, I really appreciate it. And thanks for the heads up!

This RR thread has been cracking me up

Thanks, I've seen the meme forever and never actually read the post.
