I purchased this bitcoin in an alley for one US dollar.  It appears that it is nothing more than a drill bit attached to a quarter via a used piece of chewing gum.

Coming from I've used bitcoin to buy my favorite game, Battlefield 4.

Bitcoin is a virtual currency where new currency is generated by a gradual, complicated computer process known as "mining."  When someone acquires a Bitcoin, he can trade it online with anyone who will accept it as payment for something. At this moment, one Bitcoin is worth just over $374 in USD.  Over 13 million Bitcoins exist right now.  Bitcoin is not regulated by any country, government, or central bank.
