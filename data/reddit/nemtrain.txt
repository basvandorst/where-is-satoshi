If this is a means of getting people on board to use this tool and process, it's doing just the opposite -- because it's as confusing as heck.  Pure drudgery reading through the details because there are too many unexplained tech terms and abbreviations and programming code references stringed together.
E.g. "Alice creates tx1 paying a CHECKMULTISIG scriptPubKey spendable by the co-operation of her pubkey, A, and Bob's pubkey, B."
Need I say more?

What this dude is saying is true.  It's not FUD.  One can verify it by reading the IRS rules/guidelines on irs.gov.  Look up FBAR and FATCA which are separate rules from FINCEN money transmitter requirements.

Smart!  Better some than zero.

Awesome!  I wish I could convince my friends to buy even 1 satoshi.  Having skin in the bitcoin game changes ones perspective of it pretty quickly.

Yeah, to paraphrase your heartless statement -- "Let them eat cake."

Why is there a perception that the masses have no understanding of the metric system when it's used globally?  1 mBtc is a millibitcoin or 0.001 btc.  "Bits" will be even more confusing.  Lame idea.

Huge news.  If you can customize a SAP solution without depending on Bitpay, Coinbase, etc., you can become a rich man.  Alot of the functionality is already in SAP with regards to exchange rate handling and updating daily rates in the system.  I know b/c I used to be a SAP consultant.

Excellent paper and executive summary.  Puts btc mining in proper perspective and context.
