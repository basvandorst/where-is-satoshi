I’d say if the majority of the major bag holders are Russian oligarchs/assets then you can see how the market can be manipulated.

I mean Vitalik is Russian after all.  Do you really think anyone owns their own intellectual property is Russia?  Everything filters thru the state from education, to the news, to the corporations.
It makes much more sense that Vitalik was supported early on from the GRU and strings were pulled to increase integration.
You only need look at Russia’s sophisticated disinformation campaigns in Western Democracies around the world to put 2 and 2 together.

The world around me?
I’m surprised more haven’t put it together tbh.

Vitalik is a GRU asset.  Eth is a Russian plot to overthrow the western financial system.

The best part were those who “cracked the code” of the opposing factions language and could yell in chat “Y O U L O S E” after ganking you for the 100th time in STV.

He’s pretty smart actually.  Cashing in on that whole “homosexual conservative” label.  Pseudo-intellectual Candace Owens.
