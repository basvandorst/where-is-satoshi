The transactions dont actually clear until 2:30am the next morning.  All those parties have assumed part of the risk and charged both the merchant and consumer a fee but the charge doesnt actually reconcile until later.  So, yes, it's the appearance of an instant transaction.

He kind of proved the concept of Bitcoin as a digital currency and then we started seeing guys buying and selling shit online using bitcoin.  Someone had to take that first step.  We owe Laszlo Hanyecz and jerkos the same kind of appreciation we put on Hal and Satoshi for legitimizing the technology in a real, tangible way.  They are an important part of this journey.

It's the appearance of an instant transaction.  It's actually clearing hours later.  It took 6 parties providing services and assuming risk in each transaction to create that appearance.  The fact is, if it's debit it checks the available balance and approves or disapproves.  In a credit transaction it checks available credit.  This is almost the same as lightning checking a channel balance.
The ultimate point I'm trying to make is this will most likely be how 2nd and 3rd layer service providers will be built on top of Bitcoin.  It will be a bunch of third party service providers competing on fees for service.  So even though the blocks will be created ever 10 minutes and reconcile the transactions, the end user will get the appearance of an instant transaction and transactions can reconcile every 10 minutes instead of every 24 hours.  It's entirely possible for service providers to create a system that allows for escrow or chargebacks somewhere along that stream before reconciliation on chain in a way that is transparent to the end user.

That's probably going to be the norm for most merchants who choose to accept crypto, getting paid in their local fiat equivalent.  Everything they buy or sell, their books, all of it is in that local currency and it makes more business sense to continue operating that way.
This is still great for adoption.  It shows that merchants, in this case an NBA team, believes there is a viable market of consumers willing to pay with Bitcoin to go to games and that tells other merchants they, too, can maybe expand the number of customers they can serve by facilitating payment in crypto.
They might be paid in USD, but what matters is they have integrated and accept crypto as a means for payment by consumers.  That'd be guys like us.  These are businesses catering to us specifically.

FDIC only covers cash holdings not crypto and fees are going to drive customers away.  As far as security every exchange is under threat and I think you’ve forgotten Coinbase has gotten hacked before too.

You can bank using crypto right now.  The DeFi stack on Ethereum is pretty freaking impressive and easy to use.  I actually converted long term savings into DAI and staked it at 12% interest which is better than I can expect from any bond, CD, stock or savings account.  I can move in and out between DAI, ETH and BTC.
Will banks ever be fully replaced?  Yes.  They are under threat just like the music industry was when p2p file sharing and mp3 trading started.
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:46:00






























Lot to unpack here.
Let's start with the fact bitcoin is deflationary rather than inflationary.  It's monetary policy has users accumulating bitcoin rather than using it to spend on a day to day basis.  This is also further restricted by tax laws in larger developed markets prohibiting the use of bitcoin as a daily use currency.  This creates incentive for users to hold rather than spend.  That doesn't mean it cannot be spent for daily or transactions or that people have stopped using it for day to day transactions it's just not the best way to utilize bitcoin given the current regulatory environment and the systems monetary policy.
If we measure how many wallets have been created since the bull run of 2017, we see that there has been a doubling of new addresses created.  Either this is consolidation of existing users into newer addresses or more people have adopted bitcoin and parked their coins on an address from an exchange hot wallet.
1.  You can pay your bills in crypto if you wanted to.  Services do exist that perform this for you.  It's a fee for service and there are probably more efficient ways to pay, but they do exist.
2.  You can shop through ebay, amazon, and really any major store in crypto.  Services exist for this as well like paxful and other outlets.
3.  You have to pay high fees to withdraw fiat period.  There's 6 different providers taking a cut just to pop out a $20 bill from an out of network ATM.  You pay high fees to exchange fiat for crypto when you want it immediately, because you are paying for someone, most likely an exchange like Coinbase, to assume the risk on your behalf.  Vendors can accept crypto in lieu of fiat for as little as 0.5% of the transaction value.  If you pay by credit or debit, you could pay $.35 on a transaction as little as $1.00.  That would be 35% in transaction fees.
4.  You are in control of your money.  If you lose it, it is on you.  My credit card, paypal, bank does have fraud protection except in the event when those centralized institutions defraud you or deplatform you, or deny you access to your money.  We've already seen these same institutions you want to place your trust in defraud the public, steal their houses, take their savings, reneg on pensions and have hundreds of years of history showing they have no interest in protecting your money and in fact will steal it at every opportunity.  Have fun with the bank that charges you $6 for speaking to a teller to make a deposit, or holds that deposit in order to charge you fees for insufficient funds, or opens accounts in your name without your knowledge so some middle manager can make his numbers for the quarter.  Go ahead.  Disavow responsibility and control of your own money.  That's your choice.
What isn't good for the end user is having to trust entities that have constantly and consistently defrauded them.  That rely on a sovereign currency backed by $21T in debt that is owed by the same end consumer.  Bitcoin is being adopted.  It's growing every year.  You insisting it isnt being adopted isnt born out in the data.  Just because price has fallen back to 7k from a high of 14k doesnt after a low of $3500 does not mean adoption has suddenly ended.  The price actually doubled.  Miners dont have to sell their earnings as they make them either.  There's a robust market of OTC private purchases of bitcoin at a negotiated rate far above the current spot market.  There's mining facilities being set up in Texas that dwarf the largest mining sites in China.  People are jumping into the game, not out.  Other countries are openly considering their own crypto services and advising banks to offer crypto custodial services.  The truth is countries are beginning to embrace the technology and Bitcoin remains the most dominant of them all because of it's long term success, security, decentralization, network hash rate and the fact the longer your funds are stored, the more secure they become.
We're at the point where we need front facing applications that demystify the use of these tools so end users can enjoy the benefits.  Just because bitcoin isnt developed to your expectations doesnt mean it's a failure that isnt being adopted.  Bitcoin is just one protocol.  Going back to the internet example, the web browser incorporated the use of hundreds of different protocols to bring services to end users and it happened all in the background of a front facing application that was easy for anyone to use.

Banks and exchanges are third parties.

Price will increase as demand increases.  Where that finally meets equilibrium in relation to the dollar or any other currency remains to be seen.
They all fall apart eventually.  150 years ago the Pound was the world's currency.  In the future it's probably going to be Renmibi instead of the Dollar.  Bitcoin exists in a layer above existing fiat currencies, it's price not tethered to the same macro economic factors as all other currencies.  It's not burdened by sovereign debt, or the price of oil, or the whims of elected officials getting into economic battles with other countries.  It's got scarcity, it's more secure and it's easier to spend and far more divisible than gold.
I get it though.  You don't see the bigger picture.  The internet wasnt very usable and didnt have mainstream or commercial interest until DNS and HTML allowed the web browser to be created in 1993.  Within 5 years the stock market was full of companies ending in dot com.
Bitcoin isn't ready for the mainstream yet.  You need to look over the horizon a bit.

Supply, demand, adoption, size and resiliency of the network, and a whole host of other issues make Bitcoin worth more than Monero.


Yes, it has everything to do with adoption.  Bitcoin grew to be adopted outside of an existing infrastructure with exchanges and ICOs and other things.  To say "almost nobody actually uses bitcoin at the moment" clearly shows you arent paying attention.  People use bitcoin everyday.  A competitor crypto could easily take market cap but they havent.  There's some promising projects, but no crypto, despite having an easier pathway to adoption and listing than bitcoin ever had, is coming close to toppling bitcoin's dominance.


It's the most decentralized, longest running, biggest, most robust and secure network operating.  The open sourced nature also means its development is transparent.  Bitcoin has issues with fungibility and privacy that Monero has attempted to solve.  Monero poses significant regulatory headwinds because of those features.  These issues are being addressed in other projects and implementations and will make their way to bitcoin either as a side channel or get baked into the protocol level.  Monero sought to emphasize privacy at the expense of other areas.  It's not as big of a network as bitcoin is and it has real problems with mainstream adoption due to hostile regulatory bodies that absolutely hate it's most appealing feature.


The mining pool is not where all the miners are located.  Those are pools for the self interests of miners and they can switch where they direct their hashpower.  Mining is not centralized in China, although they have produced a shit ton of miners they are producing the same kinds of miners for most of the other cryptos as well.  Prices were $3,500 at the start of the year.  It's $7,500 now.  You're zooming all the way in.  Assuming demand increases and the halving hits, the value would rise as there is less available supply being created.  So, no, it's not over valued.  I'd say its a little undervalued.  But again, the market is who determines that and the market is never rational.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:52:43
No currency holds consistent value.  That's why currency traders exist.  Your frame of reference is always pegging to a local currency but you dont see how it slides or rises in relation to other currencies.  The value of a bitcoin is always consistent, a bitcoin is worth a bitcoin, it's just that valuation changes when you compare it to USD or Euro or GBP.

The point is its constantly changing in price.  Everything is.  And we already have payment systems that process payments between all those currencies and it hasnt stopped merchants from using them.  There is no reason they cannot accept bitcoin payments when the countervalue is is paid at the moment of sale.  At that point the price of bitcoin in 15 minutes doesnt matter.  The merchant can choose how he receives the payment, its the processor who ultimately is accepting the payment and converting it for the merchant.
@_date: 2019-09-24 05:54:50


I'm saying we live in a dynamic world where all currencies are volatile and entire markets exist just to trade on that volatility.  I'm saying this is not a deterrant to widespread adoption and it is easily mitigated by building services that allow merchants to take any currency input and create any currency output.  How the merchant decides they wants their money to be denominated is up to them.
BTC can rise or slide in value and that has nothing to do with the merchant.  The merchant can accept any form of payment.  That's more about the hodler choosing to transact with bitcoin.  Truthfully I think hodlers are going to treat it more like a savings account than a checking account.  When they need spending cash theyll transfer it to a lightning wallet.  
The US Dollar is just as susceptible to losing 85% of its existing value in months.  Maybe more now than ever based on our debt load and disruption in current markets.  The Dollar is in inflationary currency, it's designed to devalue over time.  It loses value every year.  Bitcoin is deflationary, it's designed to rise in value over time.  Where you store your wealth and in what instruments is up to you.
My point is that has nothing to do with a merchant facilitating payment options to serve more customers.  The merchant can choose how he wants to be paid at the moment of sale.

Yes, all currencies are volatile and constantly changing in price in relation to all the other currencies.  It's not as volatile, but the volatility still exists and traders make money on it.
I never claimed its losing 85%, I'm saying only faith backs the US dollar and yes, it most definitely is capable of losing 85% of its value in the right circumstances.  The only reason the US dollar is stable is the perceived stability of America and America is not very stable right now and neither is the global economy.  We've also got $22T in debt and we're losing our position as the worlds superpower.  At any moment the dominant currency of the world could switch.  Even JP Morgan has stated recently the US Dollar could lose its status as the world reserve currency.
My point was, and still is, it doesnt matter to merchants.  They will accept any form of payment and it is entirely up to them if they want to keep that wealth in bitcoin or any other currency and the day to day volatility does not inhibit them from processing payments in bitcoin.  We already have payment systems that accept multiple fiat currencies and convert to the local fiat currency for merchants, so the input for the payment makes no difference to the merchant.
I never made any claims that bitcoin is a perfect technology and ready for mainstream.  I simply said its volatility has no impact on the merchant who decides to accept it as a form of payment which was the flawed argument that started this whole chain.  You made a bunch of assumptions on things I never actually stated.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:00:18
You set a localization preference in Ledger Live right?   It basically shows you the value in whatever localized currency you use. 
When, or if, bitcoin replaces all other forms of fiat to become the dominant currency is a different story.  At that point, based on a bunch of best case assumptions, it may not be so volatile as it is today since the majority holds their wealth on that chain.  When the suppliers, manufacturers and financial systems all express value in BTC or other crypto well no longer need to compare its counter-value to a dominant fiat currency.

It’s value changes in relation to the rising and falling of other currencies.  
You only base the price on the countervalue at the moment it’s transacted.  The back end can take that BTC and trade it into equivalent euro, usd or gbp on the merchant side.  No loss of buying power.  
USD price changes value by the second,  it’s lost 98% of its value over 125 years you just aren’t paying attention to it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:54:59
Sure there is.  You peg the price in bitcoin to the equivalent value of the local currency using the date/time of purchase.   The backend can do all the necessary conversions to whatever that localized currency and desired output is.
