Time to gift him a year's worth of reddit gold, I'd say.

Fair enough.

I have something for this.  But I'm too lazy to type it out on mobile, maybe when I get home.

A thought on how to get reddit to listen to your ideas on this-
You could gather your thoughts into one of your lengthy, well-reasoned posts and post it somewhere visible, hinting that the more the post gets gilded, the more likely reddit is to give your idea some attention.  Maybe do it with a throwaway so you don't come off as a whore.  
Let people vote with their wallets- if a hundred+ people want to see similar changes enough to drop three dollars (or whatever gold costs now), someone at reddit is bound to notice.

Maybe allow users to attach currency to their upvotes?
Using paypal or bitcoin or whatever a user could add money to their account, and then designate how much money they want to assign to each upvote they hand out (e.g. Each upvote=$.03), which gets added to the upvotee's account and can then be used to gift gold, or just as upvote money of their own.  Maybe let users decide how much money to attach to an upvote on a case by case basis, but I imagine that would get tedious.  Most people- less savvy users and everyone who doesn't want to pay in- would carry on like nothing's changed, except that over time they accrue enough currency to hand out gold every now and again.  Of course the money wouldn't be redeemable for anything but gold (and *maybe* stuffed snoos or whatever), so power users would be able to hand out gold left and right.  Just a thought.

You of all people should not want reddit to implement a friends list.  It would never end (not that it will anyways)

Why don't you make a bot?

Why don't you use bots?


But *why*?  It would make this a lot easier for you.

If you want to give it a shot.  FWIW I agree that this site could do a whole lot more for it's users.
