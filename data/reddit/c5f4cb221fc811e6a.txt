Yup, seems  that way – and further this happened because people (or govt) want "regulated" exchanges i.e. Bfx was forced to drop their old cold storage system (in a hurry I'm sure or else govt will "help" them) and switch to this govt "approved" mess.

In addition to what other people already said (fundamentals), the technicals ("technical analysis"; some people trade based on this) show this to be very important horizontal level (june 2014) etc. etc..

Vipps (Dnb product) is a competitor to Bitcoin here in Norway tho. It is extremely unreliable; it just had 5+ hours of downtime. Not sure how I feel about DnB in general.....but OK, good news I guess..

Bitcoin adjusted for the dollar index ($DXY or $USDOLLAR) is pretty interesting also. In those terms Bitcoin really didn't have much of a bear market.

Imagine this shit combined with an economy that is based on an assumption that Basic Income will be needed to survive.
Hell on earth; complete slavery.

Nice try, mr govt. But I'm never telling you.

Greedy speculation (tho, the tech did seem cool) and a great deal of mistrust of govt and their banks. I don't mind much, but I'm surprised more people aren't interested after getting fucked over during the financial crisis.
