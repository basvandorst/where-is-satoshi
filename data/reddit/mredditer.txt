Sounds awesome! I will definetly sign up as soon as you release it. One question I have is will you make a new post or edit this post, or will we just have to check the site ourselves to see when the game is finished?

Adding computer parts would be great. Would love to be able to upgrade my my mining rig with bitcoins or even just pay for the parts for my next build in BTC
