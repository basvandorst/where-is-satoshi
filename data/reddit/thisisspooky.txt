I've been getting the following as an error with pywallet and the wallets I've got functioning say they don't contain the private key for the receiving address.


Also worth noting this is without bitcoin-qt running.

Your perception changes.

What bills do you pay with bitcoin? You're giving it a lot of hype when it has no physical value.

Doubtful, probably just thinks trading on his own means that he's on Wall Street like an actual company. His colleagues being friends whom he also trades with.
Or it's a case of acting like he's a professional in a field that he isn't.

Hoping I don't get downvoted, but why are people in this sub against Bitcoin being a cryptocurrency prototype on the blockchain? I'd love an explanation, because I've been following BTC since I was able to mine my own block on a shitty Inspiron. My personal expectations for it have been shot down as it became more regulated (as expected I suppose).

For real, things got really fucking weird post 2012.

I totally agree, 101%, I think the amount of cryptos is ridiculous right now, but that's not to say Bitcoin has the perfect infrastructure. In fact I think it will always have value, because it's the first crypto to be so large. It could be a comparison for it's successor even. To me, Bitcoin is a great step in the right direction, but it's original goal was thwarted (anonymity, etc).

Isn't that the main ideology behind the Republican party? Or rather any conservative stance?

Gov doesn't give a fuck if you think it's logical. They want their slice of the pie and if that slice of pie is four figures or more then they'll get that fucking slice of pie.

None of them are US only based on some quick research. I think OP was trying to point out how it was skewed because the numbers are based on USD which is valued based on demand. Honestly I'm not sure, because even if you use another currency it's an arbitrary number that can be compared to the USD. Always possible I missed something!

Can attest for Cedar Point's greatness! RIP Demon Drop.

Yeah, so I've heard. I want to ride it since I don't have as many memories as I would like with it since I was a mere yungin'. All of the new rides at Cedar Point are top notch replacements though!
