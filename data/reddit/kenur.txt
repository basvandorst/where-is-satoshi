I'm not saying it's necessarily justified, I'm just saying that waiters taking a tip for themselves is basically a crime, while taking a finder's fee for yourself might be a dick move, but still isn't the same as the waiter example.

Waiters are paid to serve you, regardless of whether or not they get a tip they'll still get paid. If I find someones wallet and return it, the only thing I'm getting is gratitude. For me gratitude is enough, but I still think your comparison to waiters is invalid here.

What made you think I feel strongly about this?

Then you should go and re-read my comments. I never said anything about it being "almost the opposite".

I guess so, but you know what I'm trying to say.

The difference is that it's not your job to give the money back.

The waiter giving himself a tip in advance is unethical because he is already getting paid. The customer pays for the meal, and some of the money goes to the waiter who serves them. The potential tip is an *extra* payment.  
If you find money you aren't getting anything. The fact that you decide to give the money back is just a nice thing to do, you don't get anything back unless you take the initiative and take some money for yourself or on the off chance that you get a finders fee.

Good for you.  
"You know what I'm trying to say" was directed at dmgd though, not everyone who happened to read my previous comments.
