I was excited, until I saw the price for it. 
I like how they think, but unfortunately it wont pay for itself within a reasonable time.

They dont allow users from most of the world.
Meanwhile, I verified my passport yesterday at coinbase. It was done in 5 minutes.

Thats my guess as well, since it have been a steadily decrease for several days now.

I wish that there would be alternatives. The lack of competition is pretty much forcing people to coinbase (that have worked really well for me though).
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:36:36
I agree! Its to early to tell, but it will be interesting to see! 
I hope that its Coinbase thats testing segwit and/or batching. That would be nice!
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:55:46
Gemini only allow users from six countries in the world, so that's not an option for most people, me included. 
Kraken is an option for sure, but its one of few option to coinbase for most of the world, and they have also had their issues, so it comes down to what platform you prefer between the two.
I must say though, I like the new trade platform that they have released, since the old one really wasnt that good in my eyes compared to gdax.
But still, it would be good if there where more competition.

Thats not really something new the last few days though. Mid december had the same and lower avg block times and alto last week, without anything near this drop.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:26:32
Menpool is a list of transactions thats waiting to be added to a block. The larger that list is the more fees are needed to be added to the next block.
Before its added to a block, its an unconfirmed transaction.
The last few days the pool (list) of unconfirmed transactions have been shrinking, lowering the fees. The feea today are about a tenth of when it peaked a few days back.
I dont know why its dropping, but I guess that some of the larger players are starting to batch their transactions, but thats just a guess.

Yeaterday, I made a payment with Electrum, the slider suggested 240 and even on the lowest setting it was just under 200 if I recall correctly.
However, its possible to change to manual, so I changed to 100 and still got confirmed in the next block, so some of it is likely from Electrum as well.

Well, there are another week left until mid jan, but even that is besides the point. They couldnt manage to buy crypto even if someone told them what to do. Anyone who are correct every time whould be fucking rich though, no need to diversify, just like I wrote, all my analysis are for my own use, you should do your own.
You also seem to have some problems reading and/or understanding, so I'll try to explain what I wrote before. They are curios since they know I have BTC, so they are always asking about whats in the paper. They arent asking because they want to buy. Is that was enough for you to understand, otherwise there are a corner over there where you can go cry.

I really dont care about what anyone else thinks about my analysis, its made for me, but if anyone asks, I’ll tell them what I think.
I’m yet to see a person thats correct every time, that person would be rich. My analysis is simply based on history. Sometimes its wrong but more often history repeats itself. But its still for me and not for you to act on, you should do your own analysis.

Do you really feel that this is a good place for a political debate? 
Yes, we have problems in a few areas in Sweden (even if the "riot" is a few kids that thinks its fun to set a few cars on fire in one of of the areas but that wouldnt generate any clicks), but they are still generaly safer than Detroit or any other semi bad area in the states. We have a murderrate of 0.9 / 100.000, US have 3.9.  
Here are a film of the "riot": 
30 or so kids throwing stones towards the police and burning a few cars. Thats the whole story.
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:09:44
Are you sure? 
My graphs say 9650 and I kept looking out for it back then.. But on the other hand, it could be Coinbase that have another exchange rate, and if thats the case, I´ll change to "for the first time on Coinbase". ;)
This is the graph I have: 
None the less, Its the first time I see it and I´m thrilled about it. 
After all, I´ve been mining for about 3 years now. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:45:13


Dont get me wong, I like to talk politics and usually starts with long posts about it, but I really cant see the point in a pure Bitcoin sub.
I started to writing a long political post about the difference, why we have a high tax rate and what we get in return, but then I realized that this was supposed to be a glad post about Bitcoin. Nothing else.
So that link was actually the least political post that I could make and still show some kind of fact. If you look at the [source]( you will see that most of those numbers comes from CIA. Thats statistics, nothing else. Statistics that comes from your home. If you see them as political, then I guess that you just dont like what you read. 


The who cares part is actually fun to talk about. Sweden is like a magic word today, who gets several Trump supporters to go apeshit and loosing the ability to focus on the subject at hand. 
Whats even more fun is that extremely few of those could even point Sweden out on a map and the only thing they know about the country is what Trump tweeted about it or what you have read in a newspaper that only wants clicks (that however is the same in Sweden). The true story doesnt generate clicks, so it will be tweaked.
Some of the ones that comes here are shitheads, no doubt. As well as some of the natives. We dont need to kick out everyone, we need to kick out the ones misbehaving. The ones that works and generates tax money is good for us. The sad part is that we cant deport the native shitheads. 
You are aware that USA is created by immigrants in a very recent history right? 
Shore we have problems, just like any other countries, but not anywhere near what you think based on a few tweets and news stories. You have elected a guy that is about to spend $35bn on a wall and that takes his "facts" from the same news that he say is publishing false news and you think that we are screwed? Ok then.
This will however be the last political post that I make in the Bitcoin sub, because I truly think that there are better places for it.
Its sad to see that we cant unite over our common grounds in Bitcoin, just because Sweden is a trigger word for Trump supporters. 
Finally, thanks, I will have a good day and I really hope that you will have one as well.

Correct me if I´m wrong, but the peak at Jan 5 was about 9650 SEK and the peak at the end of 2013 was just 7100 SEK.
Edit: I´m guessing that you think of the peak at the end of 2013, but at that time one USD was about 6,5 SEK, today its almost 9.

This is just stupid. Paper money is already a rarity in Sweden, so this is just a way for the central bank to bypass the other banks.
We already have cards and services that allows direct transfers between users with different banks.
So this pretty much adds nothing new. They have pretty much invented wire transfers..
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:12:21
Sure, but those who don’t trust the banks here, also don’t trust the central bank. (And we actually have a regular bank owned to 100% by the government as well)
We have deposit guarantee and if for some reason the accounts for a person would be locked down they would be locked down on Riksbanken as well.

@_date: 2017-09-17 07:46:42
No, not at all, we learn enough in the religions class to realize that all of the religions are just nonsense. 
To take one example the statement that god is all powerful and all good is obviously wrong. Why would there be so much pain and suffering in the world (take cancer in small children for example) if someone was both all good and powerful. If there where a god, then he wither cant do anything (not all powerful) or he wont (not all good).
Or perhaps the fact that the all powerful god needed to get his son tortured and killed to forgive the human kind? If thats true then he is not all powerful or a sadistic piece of crap (not all good).
I can go on with most of the crap in the holy scripts, but the gods tends to get credit for everything we dont yet know, so they tend to become less and less powerful for every new discovery.
So, if I want to know if there where anything substantial in any of the thousands of religions, I would just read about the religions, not about atheism. Read the bible with some critical view and you will realize that its a fictional work and nothing else.
You could also ask yourself, why have you picked the religion that you believe in? Almost everyone only believes in a specific god does that based on what their parents believes in. Not because they themselves have researched anything about it.
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:57:16


We all want to make money by controlling bitcoin, wouldnt you agree? Not a single person that deals with bitcoin wants the value to drop and fights to get it up. If I buy a mining rig for $2500 I sure as hell dont want BTC to fall and make me loose that money. The same goes for a person buying BTC for speculation.
The only difference between for example both chains is how to solve a problem. One side had big blocks in mind and the other have segwit. Obviously a vast majority of the miners are behind SW, otherwise we wouldnt have been able to lock it in and we also wouldnt have been able to keep the hash power in the chain. 
I really dont get all the hate in this sub about it, yes, some of the miners, some of the users and some of the node owners didnt want the same thing you did (not just the miners), so there are really no use throwing hate towards all of us still mining here. Most of us dont have a huge miner park, we are small miners and be a part of this history in the making, no more, no less. Obviously at the same time that we make a bit more than we spent as well.
@_date: 2018-11-11 18:52:31
Just like Swish, that we already have then.
I swish from my phone to another person, store or whatever and it instantly arrives.
So this doesn’t add anything from what I can see, Riksbanken just want to make it sound fresh and bypass the regular banks (who owns swish).
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:48:39


Sorry, but I dont buy it. Since you yourself posted the statement:


Then you really do want to control it. You wanted bitcoin to go down the road that you think is the best road and you wanted it a year ago. 


So are all the big miners, the users, so are all the businesses and so are all the owners of nodes, I dont see your point here? Yes we all are free to do whatever we want, thats not what I´m debating here. 


It might not be intended towards all miners, but still the posts and threads that complains about miners are very general, its not towards anyone or anything specific, just miners in general and I´m getting sick of reading it every day. The bottom line is that everyone involved in BTC wants the value to go up as high as possible. Turn it around, what if there where daily hate posts against you? Sooner or later, you would start to become annoyed about it, even if they really dont are intended towards you. We need a huge hash rate to keep the chain safe.
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:00:24
It was Jesus himself who according to scriptures said that nothing is impossible for god, that must be the closest we can get to gods word. Besides from that, if some parts are the word of man in the bible, and not god, why is it then to be trusted at all?


Yes, thats one of the things, especially when it comes to his own son. The other thing is why the creator of everything would create enemies, that also makes no sense. 
*With that said, I know that neither you or me will change our minds, but I really enjoy discussing with people who have a completely different view than I do and actually knows what he/she is talking about. It really doesn't give anything to discuss with people that have the exact same idéas that I do. :)*
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:56:07




This is the thing here. If he can do anything and sets the rules then he could just as easily have forgiven mankind without the torture and killing of his son. The only reason that there needed to be a sacrifice is because he himself decides that there is that need. 
So, the only reason for his son to be tortured and killed is because god choose to. In the same way he choose to give small kids cancer so that they can live their entire but short life in pain. Why would he let that baby be created in the first place?


Again, if a being that is able to do anything at any time makes a plan that includes pain and suffering for his creations, when he just as easily could have selected not to include anything like that.
Would you accept the same logic if the government told you this? You all shall be surveillanced at all time, every thought and movement you have, but any bad person like a murderer, rapist or child molester will not be delt with directly, but the government promise that they will be judged in secret when they die. Well, unless they regret it and ask the government for forgiveness. The government might also inflict pain and suffering to anyone, including small kids at their will, but according to their secret plan. 
Would you vote for that government? 
Another question that you dodged, is the holy scripts written by men and therefor flawed or is it the work of god and therefor perfect?
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:06:42
If noone cared at all, and didnt want to be part of controlling it, then noone would oppose to any changes suggested making it easy to screw up and for instance adding a central checkpoint. 
Or possibly, we would still be running Core 0.2. ;)
When we run a node we do make a stand even it that is to say that we want to keep it in the same direction and to me thats also a bit of control.
I think however, that we are simply calling the same thing by different names. The important thing however is that we keep centralizing forces away. :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:03:12
I really dont care what imaginary entity you believe in, but I wont ever blindly worship someone or something that causes suffering when it just as easily could choose not to. And again, why did you pick this religion of all that are out there? Why not the flying spaghetti monster or some other than this one?
"Hey, lets torture and kill my own son, even when I can choose not to." How can that not be a sadistic asshole that reason like that?
And dont get me started at the unintelligent design, let me be all powerful a few minutes and we would be way better designed.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:32:57
Ye, we also dont search for round earth, since we dont need more confirmations. 
In Sweden we have about 15% that believes in some religion, so 85% of us couldn't care less about labels like atheism.
Almost all of us dont believe in anything fictional. 
People can believe in the flying spaghetti monster, Donald Duck or whatever fictional character they prefer, I dont care since its just dilutional. So why would anyone search for atheism? Perhaps in a deeply religious country if they need support to get out of the insanity, but anywhere else? I dont see the need. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:51:46


Then you do want to control it to keep it decentralized. If you or noone else wouldnt steer in that direction then whats stopping some large government to start making changes to centralize? 
I would be more scared if people didnt care enough to want to control it in a good general direction. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:20:08


Lets say a few holders are malicious actors. Would it be fair to say that holders are evil pricks then? Or some of the developers? Would it be fair game to say that all developers have a bad agenda? Obviously not, but still thats whats being done towards miners here every day.
I actually wouldnt care what part of bitcoin was being called names, even as a non programmer, I would be just as annoyed if all developers that makes a huge job was called names.
My miners have always been on the BTC chain, even now when its actually still more profitable to mine BCH. My node is a core node.
I really dont think anything good will come from generalizing. Not on any part of Bitcoin or anywhere else. Shit should be thrown towards those who deserves it, not towards those who have some minor resemblance. It will only drive a wedge into the community and I dont like moving down that road. We need all parts to keep BTC strong.

I've looked trough this papers from Riksbanken last week about the e-krona, and they have pretty much invented what we already have. It also seems to be valued to what the fiat is worth. 
We can already transfer funds instantly to connected phone numbers between different banks. So they created nothing thats better than what we have today and really seems to think that someone will care anything about it.
This will crash and burn, but the light side is that they will put the spotlight on bitcoin (that they actually even mentions twice in the papers).
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:31:52
Sure, its your choice. Its an easy route for someone who lack counter arguments. I'm still waiting for someone who can explain how all of this works out in their belief system, but every time it ends up in a "you are narrow minded", "you wouldn't understand" or similar instead of real arguments or explanations. 
I guess that questions are hard for religions.

I dont understand why some people feel the need to divide them and us. I have been running two miners for about 3 years, I also buy and use btc and run a full node. Why would I pick a side? Most miners are also holders, so obviusly they will do what makes them most money, so in otger words, what pushes the price up.
We all follow the money, if I think that I can make more money by holding or mining poopcoin, I would. Hell, I would have been mining Dash today if I had gotten a D3. 
Why fight within the community? We all want to make money, and those who say that they dont can send all of their coins to me.

The only thing that might be profitable is if you run an ASIC miner, anything but that is useless. You also need really cheep, preferably free electricity.
Also keep in mind that most ASIC-miners are really noisy. You will need a separate room like a garage to stand the noise. This isnt an exaggeration, I have mine at work now with a timer to only have it going when its empty, because its disturbing even when I'm pretty far away. That wasnt in my calculations.

First of all, thanks for actually answering, its truly a first time.
Just a few points, according to scriptures, God is omnibenevolent, so everything he does is good. He is also omnipotent, so nothing is impossible to him. Thats in the scriptures (for example: Psalm 145:17 and Matthew 19:26).
For me, that would say that he himself sets the rules for everything, including the cost for any sin. He can make the choice to forgive everyone without any sacrifice what so ever or he wouldn't be omnipotent. This all say to me that he wouldnt need to  have his son tortured or killed if the scriptures are correct. Still he choose to. 
Even if power or love isnt the primal attribute, there are according to scriptures his attributes and as god, he dont need to have one or the other. As all powerful he can be anything and everything at the same time.
There are plenty of stuff that really makes no sense, besides from the one I just wrote about, revelation 6:13 always makes me giggle since the author doesnt know anything about astrophysics. Or some more horrifying parts: Exodus 21:20-21 and the hole sodom and gomorrah-story.

I really dont want to dig to deep into the technical stuff, thats why I've been using coinbase. Its always been simple.

The thing is that I dont care enough to spend about 12% of my btc to get a hardware wallet. The only trezor I can find is about 200$ and I doubt that I'll get it before the end of the month.
Still, its a hige chunk of my money, so i might as well just sell all btcs until august to not have the problem. Even if I import them I still have the problem that I get some money every couple of weeks from my miners, and I actually use btcs every now and then.
For me its a currency like any other but if I need to get more stuff or it becomes a load of problems to use, then I really cant see how btc will keep expanding for that long. I'd rather see easy and good services so billions of people can get into it instead of just those who run a node or have a hardware wallet.
I really think that BTC can become huge, but not with this circumstances. Simply put, I just want it to be easy.
