You answered your own question.


Right there?  What, you don't see it?  Let me wash the smudge...  right.... there.
Any value in a fiat currency is simply one artificially placed on it by it's users.
It is accemptance exactly in the same way that fiat is used.  So why isn't it considered acceptance to you?

Is it?  GDP is often measured in the fiat currency, seems circular to me.  Add into that the central banks who like to print their way out of debt (Hi, Greece!) and how can you argue that the currency is tied to anything tangible?


Take a dollar to someone who doesn't use it to see how much it gets you.  You could argue that the dollar had value when it was nominally tied to the valuation of gold.  But that link has long since past.  The value of the dollar now is tied to just one thing; the faith that people have in the dollar.
Or, as you put it, imaginary.

Hell, I would argue that Bitcoin can be a store of value (gold) is because it can be used as currency.  Any store of value must have some purpose other than that.  Gold isn't a good store because, hey gold!  It is a good store because it has other uses (both practical and aesthetic) and its relative rarity.  Bitcoin, outside its use of currency, has nothing else going for it to give it value.  IE, what confers value onto BTC is what we can purchase with it.  The rest of it is awesome, don't get me wrong, but those features absent the ability to purchase things do not confer value onto BTC in-and-of themselves.
Or a simpler way to put it; if the point is to get away from fiat then BTC must be currency first.  If it isn't, if it is only somehow magically a store of value it means that to do anything with it we have to convert it into fiat first.  That is a self-defeating state of affairs.

Yes.  Steam has taken Bitcoin via Bitpay for a while now.  I just double checked on my phone.  Go to account, add funds to wallet, select an amount.  In the payment method select Bitcoin.  Its the very same payment form that is used to purchase games so it was probably implemented at the same time they took Bitcoin for games.

That depends on the person.  I'm sure if I had 1BTC at today's prices I'd consider that "a larger amount" and would want to be more secure about it than I am now.
On the other hand if I made 10x what I do now 1BTC might not be the break point.
@_date: 2017-01-12 13:59:35
[This]( answer concisely states it, but here's why that matters.
Say you bought BTC when it was $100.  To get a 50% increase in value you have to go form $100 to $150.  So good so far, right?
Now BTC is $1000.  You buy $100 of BTC.  To double in value BTC wouldn't have to go up $50, but $500.
However, unless the graph is in log those two increases, compared to one another, would look radically different.  When the graph is in log, they look the same.
@_date: 2017-01-19 06:23:19




How do you figure?  The longer the chain between fiat conversions the better it is as the value stays in BTC longer.
Let's say I decide to send BTC to a friend and he goes on to purchase something.  Before merchant adoption here's the chain:
fiat -&gt; me -&gt; friend -&gt; fiat -&gt; merchant
Now with the merchant accepting it, even if they immediately convert.
fiat -&gt; me -&gt; friend -&gt; merchant -&gt; fiat
3 links in the chain instead of 2.
No matter how you cut it that is an improvement.
And you damn well better believe it helps adoption.  I've got tech savvy friends who are clueless when it comes to BTC.  "Well, you can spend it here, and here, and here too" is a lot easier for people to see the value than it is "Well, uhm, you can convert it back into fiat later on."
You're looking at this as if it were discrete stages.  It isn't.  It is a feedback loop.  We need people to adopt BTC so that merchants see the value in adopting BTC so that more people will adopt BTC so more merchants will accept BTC.
BOTH are needed in tandem, not one, then the other.
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:47:08
Well, there is that view.
But I'm kind of having an epiphany when it comes to BTC volatility.  BTC is volatile when compared to the $, for example.  But both are not a fixed point.
IE, if our frame of reference is the $ then BTC is volatile.
But if your frame of reference is BTC, then it is the $ that is volatile.
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:32:24


So you're living in statis?  I'm guessing not since you posted here.  That means you're making expenditures every day to keep yourself alive.  Paying for things you are already purchasing in BTC vs. fiat is harmful, how?  You're spending that coin one way or another.
As others point out, top off what you spent regularly.  It's almost as if you could have one wallet for long term holding and another for day-to-day expenses.  If only there were terms for the differences between ***SAVING*** what you don't spend.  Huh, I'll be ***CHECKING*** around for those terms.

Volatility over the long term, esp. in an upward direction, is a good thing, granted.
But you're forgetting that not everyone who is getting into BTC is doing so as an investor.  Many people are using this Crypto**currency** as, you know, as *currency*.  From that perspective can you see how a 10% drop in a week might be something undesirable?
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:24:10
MmmmmmmKinda.  Not saying you're wrong.  Just that people can have valid reasons for not doing so.
For example I'm at the point on my Steam account where I have dozens of unplayed games (maybe hundreds?) so I generally don't touch a game unless it is on deep discount.  Putting funds into my wallet just to have it sit there for 3-6 months (or more) isn't ideal.  I'd rather keep that in BTC so I can spend it on other things in the meantime.
OFC, I also take a different view on fees than OP.  For me to open a fiat checking account would cost me $5/month.  At recent transaction fees (past few months) that's ~30 transactions a month before they beat the fees I'd be charged for just having an account.  I don't do 30 transactions out of my wallet in a month, so money saved, even if the fee on a smaller transaction is, by percent, quite large.
In addition to that I generally gain value between the time I purchase the BTC and I spent it.  That value is about what the fee has been.  So on the whole I am doing better by using my BTC as a games and hardware slushfund.  Much to the chagrin of the "BTC is not a coffee currency!!!!!" crowd.  :)
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:02:34

You're not familiar with Steam, are you?  That has been a thing for years.

Oddly enough, for the merchants I mentioned none of that is a concern.  Because I get that through other means.  Also 3-5% cash back.  Wooo!  That's impressive!
Now let's compare to what I use BTC for.
Every other week I drop $60 on BTC.  I then spend this on stuff for me (its my play money) over the next 2 weeks.  I don't always spend the full $60 before my next injection.  But I basically use it as a checking account.  No need to worry about hitting a 30% APR because of a carried balance.
Based on the very short time BTC sits in my wallet on 2016 I made just shy of 3%.  If I didn't spend so quickly and let it sit longer that would be higher.  In fact that was with me purposely ignoring the volatility and presuming that over the long term I would either break even or take a slight, but acceptable, loss.
So I get extended warranties on purchases on which they make sense, price/fraud prevention is easily avoided (be honest, how often do you use those features) and the cash back is mirrored by the performance of BTC over fiat.
My point here isn't that holding is wrong, or wrong for you.  Just that people who have the elitist hold uber alles mentality looking down upon others who are using BTC in a perfectly viable way they might not wish to engage in should stop with the condescension.  Because part of what makes BTC viable for holding is the people who do treat it as currency; and vice versa.
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:53:54

You think that Reddit is where normies would flock?
How quaint.
Also, hi.  I'm here because Steam and Newegg accept BTC.  Being the two primary vendors I do business with on a personal level, and wanting a simple way to separate my finances from my household's, I looked into and adopted BTC.
Then months later came here.
And people like you, every person who misspells "hold", the constant cheering about minor fluctuations with "to the moooooon" damn near drives me off, too.
You are in an echo chamber here.  Your echo chamber is not representative of the totality of BTC users.  Hell, it probably is a fraction of it, at best.  So just because *you personally* don't see something doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
But you know what does signal that it happens?
Have those companies drop BTC?  No?  Huh, then maybe, just maybe, it is because such offerings continue to bring in revenue for them?  I'll take that as a better indicator of the adoption of BTC than a random reddit poster who is bitter than people didn't flock to his playground.  Or, if they did, his ignorance of how insipid his playground comes off to others probably drove them off.

Isn't speaking of the volatility of a currency in and of itself kind of moot?  Currency volatility is kind of like measuring speed/time; it all depends on your reference frame.
For example look at the jump on the 8th from ~$700 to ~$740.  Was that BTC being volatile or BTC being stable and the $ being volatile?  Flipping over to the $ we see that it fell at the same time.  But because the measure of BTC used was the dollar it was the volatility of the dollar that was reflected in BTC.  To call BTC volatile in that case would be silly.
That is but one case.  But in the relatively short time I've been using BTC whenever there has been a large change in BTC's value in relation to the $ I often find that it is a change in the $ that is the cause of the flux.  Thus if you make your reference frame BTC it isn't BTC that is volatile, it is the $.

Uhm, there is an end in sight.  Moore's Law is not that computing power doubles every ~2 years.  It states that the transistors in a densely packed circuit doubles every ~2 years.  The consequence of that doubling is computing power goes up.
However transistors have gotten so small, and are so tightly packed, that to make them any smaller or tightly packed are pushing into the realm where quantum tunneling between the two sides of the transistors will make them unreliable.
Furthermore you're conflating two very different things here.  Computing power vs. data storage.  Moore's Law is about transistors, not data density.  ;)

In total cost?  Maybe.
I, too, buy games with BTC.  I have to pay in transfer fees.  Oh noes, the horror!
But wait, I am using BTC as a ledger to keep my money separate from the household money.  I could do that by opening up another bank account which, since the financial collapse, would cost me $12 at my current bank.  Or I can spend pennies on the few transactions per month and spend less than a $2/month.
$2/month which BTC has been beating for at least the past 6 months.
So, yeah, when you look at the total cost BTC is coming out ahead.

Not his point.  The above applies for a purist like you.  But you are not the mass audience.


This is what the banks are doing to address the mass audience.  They don't care that it is open source, libre, deflationary, permissionless, global.  They care it is internet and simple-to-use, period.
Look with the migration from swipe to EMV one of the largest complaints out of the public and the businesses that serve the public is that EMV takes longer to process a transaction.  And by longer they are talking less than 20 seconds longer.  They don't care that it is more secure, cuts down on fraud and thus cuts losses and lowers costs.  Why?  Because in the long run that additional ~20 seconds per transaction is costing them more.
Banks don't need to be all those things you say are important; they just need to be easier and faster to use.

@_date: 2016-10-25 08:23:47
Another alternative is to push some of your spending over to BTC.
Here's an example.  My wife and I have an agreement on finances, we each get a small amount of funds to spend as we please each month, no questions asked.  I was having trouble keeping track of what share was "mine" from the joint account.  I didn't want to open up a 2nd account and spend $5/month for accounting purposes.  Nor did I want to use a CC; we went through a decade of 30% interest bullshit, never again.
Then one month it dawned on me, I could use a BTC wallet as a method of accounting.  Sure, there would be some losses on the fees getting the funs into/out of the wallet, but if they were reasonable it would be cheaper than the monthly fees on another checking account.
I decided on Coinbase, opened up an account there.  Then I found the Shift Card.  It is a Visa card that draws directly off a Coinbase account.
So now my personal play money is routed to a BTC wallet.  I purchase games, books, videos, computer equipment, and other various sundry stuff and pay for it with a debit card.  None of the merchants I go to know any better.  Well, a few offer BTC as an option (Steam, NewEgg most notably) and I have utilized that for payment from time to time.
But by and large I just treat this like any other account.  I get a dead simple way of knowing what is mine vs. the household's, cheaper, help BTC by just using it for normal good/services on the regular.
Though I must state that I went into it knowing that looking at it from day-to-day there will be times when I may lose a little, other days where I gain a little.  I expect over the long run the short term variances will cancel each other out.  But as mentioned, don't dump more in than you can afford to lose.
