Thanks for the post, I like Andreas and his style a lot, he was pretty rad on the Joe Rogan podcast as well.

I couldn't find a SoCal medical dispensary that would take BTC, but I did see they are accepting BTC in some of the Colorado stores.. Pretty rad, wish it would filter through to SoCal!

No doubt, sometimes forums become so hostile to "n00bs" that it can really destroy the culture and enviornment there.  Every time a discussion starts it just gets spammed with memes and trashtalk to die a slow death..

Preach on brother, I feel you and I feel blessed to have learned a lot and had some great fun with BTC.
But don't forget, there are other coins out there and plenty of mining to do ahead! So don't lose faith on cryptocurrencies, its gonna be a wild ride over the next decade!
