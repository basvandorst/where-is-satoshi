So I'm kind of confused. Will bitcoins forever be compared to other currency in order to determine this sort of thing? Or is that just a symptom of the newness?

I find they are full of hippie alternative types who would love bitcoins.

For sure. I like to imagine a future in which many of the objects that we acquire and use day to day are created by crafty individuals in other parts of the world, printed at home on a 3D printer and paid for in bitcoins.

Yeah I know. It recovered really fast though. I still haven't even sent canadianbitcoins a picture of my visa bill and all that stuff yet.

They could receive a large payment in bitcoin and then hours later watch the entire currency collapse if it turns out to be a giant scam.

I'm worried by the fact that bitcoin's creator is a secret and that they apparently own a large amount of the total bitcoins. Wouldn't this allow the creator to scam people out of their money?
What would be the impact of the FBI attempting to exchange silk road's btc into USD? Would prices drop?

Looks like litecoins it is!

Good grief, just feeling it out, looking for pointers.

I'm thinking of buying in $4,000 CAD. Should I pull the trigger now, slowly buy in or wait for a drop? What do you all think?

Funny enough when I've talked to a friend about moving some investment cash into bitcoin he said that 3D printer companies are a better bet as far as speculating on the future of the web.
And yeah, I meant Canadian.
