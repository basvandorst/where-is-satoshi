It’s not one or the other. Venezuela’s government helped themselves to billions of dollars in wealth for them and their families, abolished liberty, and thought they could magically plan the economy. And the US imposed crippling economic sanctions that made everything that much more desolate. It’s both.

You think a system with more than two parties would alleviate the government’s leeching off of the fruits of labor of the citizenry? The problem is the state itself.

There isn’t a material difference for those the mafia controls whether two or five families are vying for power.

Of course I agree with your fundamental point, but there’s one problem with your characterization of Trump: a lot of the invested oligarchs and a good chunk of the deep state seem to genuinely loathe him. Although they also seem to be adjusting to him, eg Pompeo and Bolton, and he has had Goldman Sachs oligarchs with him from the beginning. 
I suppose he just brought in a new wave of psychopathic oligarchs, but I can’t help be happy the old wave got vanquished, even if my satisfaction was fleeting.

You have to understand, that the soft revocation of firearm liberties is the strategy being used to abolish the second amendment ultimately. So I don’t know if you really believe in a citizen’s right to own firearms, but if so, understand that you are aiding in the long term abolition of gun liberties by propagating the notion that we have to sacrifice a few liberties here and there. Also your comparison to the subtleties associated with the first amendment is not very illuminating. Finally anyone proposing the banning of “high capacity magazines” cannot be described as anything other than anti gun liberty.
@_date: 2019-07-31 12:52:32
Police have no constitutional duty to protect you, see Warren v. District of Columbia. They exist to protect the state and enforce its monopoly on legal violence. The military serve to knock over foreign governments who impede the will of the US government. They are just the state’s bodyguards. Intelligence agencies divide the people to keep us at each other’s throats so we never think to question whether the genesis of society’s ills comes from the state. They manipulate us into agreeing with whatever they want by controlling our mental streams, so that they can manufacture consent for evil wars for example. 
Public transportation is very nice. It could be built and run privately. Government is not some magical force required for large scale projects. Most scientific knowledge funded by the government lies behind a paywall, so bad example there. Local communities can offer aid to people falling on hard times out of altruism. Again the government is not magical.

This is kind of a facile argument. The Silk Road made those things you list against the rules. The fact that people who deal drugs are more likely to be able to hook you up with violent services is only a function of the state’s war on drugs. If drugs were legal in the first place they would not require a culture of violence.
 Its not the silk road’s fault that people may have met contacts capable of violence, especially when the Silk Road shut down things that were against the rules.

Yes. The deep state refers to the mass of unelected, unaccountable officials who spend their whole careers with the government and thus wield tremendous power, shaping the direction of government policy without anyone really knowing who they are or what they are doing. For example the head of the NSA, or even the second command of the NSA, CIA, etc. Can you name the third in command at the CIA? These are the people who truly direct the flow of tax money and the direction of foreign policy and they ain’t looking out for you and me.

He was never convicted of contracting a murder; in fact, it was not even brought up in trial because multiple people, including corrupt feds, had login credentials for the account making the statements about contracting a kill.

Typical advice is, if you are curious and understand to a reasonable approximation the technology, make a wallet and buy a small amount, like $50. You’ll be invested in the market and will be more inspired to learn more and follow the market dynamics. Then decide if you want more. Don’t invest any more than the amount you typically spend on fun, eg your restaurant and electronics budget.

The idea of a “social contract” is just a meme the ruling class made up to justify their power. Contracts require two willing parties to come together, set up terms, compromise, and come to an ultimate agreement. Did you ever do that with the terms of your “social contract?” I’m pretty sure I never did. That’s no contract.  That’s just others making up abstract concepts to control you.

Thanks for the response, I spent about twenty minutes trying to wrap my head around this. I figured it was illogical. Because you can buy two cryptos for fiat as a non taxable event, then moving those assets around is taxable? That doesn’t make sense to me. Fiat gains never come into the picture. What is being taxed? 
I saw the example of trading platinum for gold but again, what is being taxed here? Even from a practical level, not to mention how insane it is that the state thinks it deserves a cut of trading one metal for another. I mean, if there is a trade (1:1), there is no gain made if both parties agree to it, and any gain one party makes in the future upon an exchange to fiat could be subject to gains tax but only then.
