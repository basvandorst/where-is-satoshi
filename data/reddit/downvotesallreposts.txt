What about Coinbase? Haven't bought anything yet, but it seems far easier to work with than Mt. Gox, at least in terms of getting money on my account.

You're more than happy with 500 khash/sec? I tried out mining last week with my laptop, getting 10 Mhash/sec, and I've only made about 5 cents so far. Am I missing something?

That would make a lot more sense...

I guess that makes sense. So it takes a few days to put money on an account or take it off, but how quickly can you use money already in your account to buy BTC or sell it and put the money back in your account, and how much does that time vary for different exchanges?

Any reason you use Coinbase to buy BTC and transfer it to bitfloor, as opposed to just buying it with bitfloor directly?
EDIT: Dafuq? On the Buy page of Coinbase, I have 10 filled in for the number of BTC I'm buying and the number is greyed out. I only want to buy about $50 worth of BTC, not over $1000. Why can't I change the amount?

To clarify, I'm running GUIMiner, not CGMiner. I have a Lenovo Thinkpad W530, and I'm using the built-in Quadro K1000M graphics card.

Thanks for the response! Do BTC transfers happen faster than bank transfers? And which trading service(s) has a quick turnaround time for buying/selling (i.e. not 3-4 days)? Sorry for all the questions, I'm just a little out of my depth here. This is my first attempt playing any kind of market.
