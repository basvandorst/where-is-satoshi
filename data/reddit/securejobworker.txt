I think I'll file this under "humor".

I'll be damned. Well I guess it is Friday... better crack open a couple of cold ones.

Someone snagged some coins for $1651. That was pretty lucky.

I don't think the correction is finished yet, it can go a lot lower. But if it doesn't one explanation could be that we are very much in the early adoption phase of cryptos, the people who are currently invested are generally more tech savy than the average person. They know that cryptos aren't to blame for ransomware and hence they don't panic.
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:25:32
I agree. But it's the same argument as "guns don't kill people, people kill people" and right now media could spin it anyway they want. This event will certainly bring more light onto cryptos, but I can't tell if it's for long-term good or otherwise.

I agree in large. However, right now BTC is the "gold" of the crypto world, it is the currency which all other currencies pivot around. If it continuous to serve this function the fundamentals for BTC will be extremely strong even if other cryptos overtake BTC in terms of tech, adoption, usability etc. If Ethereum, NEM, Dash or Ripple are "crypto dollars" then BTC might be "crypto bullion".

If a computer has been hacked it's better to do a drive wipe, bios wipe and then re-install from scratch. How else can you trust that the ransomware isn't still on there? No self respecting IT guy would pay such a ransom. And if a user lost one week worth of work because they stored it on their desktop? Well... now they will learn to store it on the server.

Good fair write up, also non-conclusive. I myself don't believe BTC to be in a bubble just based on the amount of new money flowing into the crypto market.
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:42:27
You might be right. BTC is showing a lot of strength here, more than I expected at these levels. Lots of volume, lots of interest. This might be all the dip there is and then we go parabolic.

If Bitcoin is a black hole then let's also talk about the infinite expansion that is the US national debt: 
Going for 20 Trillion.

The case has not been dropped, it can be re-opened should he set foot in Sweden. There's also the question of skipping bail. This comment section should shed some light on everything: 
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:02:53
Individual users are just now beginning to be aware of and trust BTC, what you want is investment banks and fund managers to trust BTC. We're still early in the "trust curve". Which is also why the BTC ETF is such a big deal, if that happens you'll see some real shit.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:27:26
I approve of this comment section.

If it really does crash that low I'm buying more, but I don't think it will. This is a new scenario, there is a lot more people around this time, there is a lot more media attention, cryptos are becoming a thing. BTC might dip south of $2000, there is support in the 1800-1900 range. But I'd be surprised if it dips further. It could.. and I won't panic, in fact I'll be happy, but I don't think it will.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:29:30
On the plus side that laptop will only go up in value.
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:31:21
It's going to take a few more years for BTC to establish itself as a stable investment class that you can trust. But after that... the sky is the limit. What many people don't think about is that gold is actually also inflationary, 2500 tons are mined each year. The market putting more money into BTC is about psychology and trust, but if we don't hit any major roadblocks and BTC is seen as a safe harbor a 1 Trillion market cap should be pretty conservative. That's +$50.000/BTC roughly. Of course, this is the favorable scenario. There can be setbacks.. but hopefully not.

I don't think BTC is in a bubble right now, but there are a lot of altcoins which are in a bubble. The unique thing about BTC is that it's recognized and functions as a proven store of value, it really is the "gold" of the crypto world.
However, a lot of shitcoins will crash hard when people realize that A) They will never become a mainstream way of payment B) Their fundamental tech idea is flawed or C) They are not a good store of value
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:18:28
Bad news in the short term for BTC, we were overdue for a correction anyway and now I expect the correction to be more aggressive. A $1200 correction isn't off the table with this kind of news. Long term the impact of something like this is hard to predict. Hope they catch the fucker, what he did is immoral. Cryptos are good tech, they shouldn't be an instrument of evil.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:00:53
Well... depends on how much you have really. If 1% of your current bitcoin holdings could pay the difference between a nice second hand car and the one you have then why not. You're not going to live forever and you can't live on bread and water. But if you're happy with your car there's no point really.
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:18:29
It can also go to absolutely fucking zero if they mess it up.
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:06:22
There will be no hard fork or segwit, BTC is fine as it is. Other currencies will come and serve as payment for trivial items.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:17:49
Should Bitcoin classify the US legal system as economic?
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:56:04
We're probably in a small bubble, a correction might be coming.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:20:13
It's not going to happen without the miners. They might do it... but only if they get scared that some other currency will overtake BTC. If BTC drops to $1450 (which it very well might from here) you could see a lot of miners panicking. They will realize that BTU will never happen, so they might go for Segwit. But as it is right now they are happy with the status quo.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:32:38
"This court is not an expert in economics, however, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, that bitcoin has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money," Yes... yes, indeed.
@_date: 2017-05-10 06:05:57
That's always possible. Did you understand what my post implied? It's the classic battle between an unstoppable force and an immovable object.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:13:10
What I hate most about this situation is that the miners are so shortsighted. If BTC does well and gets mass adoption they're all going to get filthy rich no matter what. But instead they're holding up progress to earn a few more dollars each month. It's hard to make a case for them actually believing in the technology.

Lol. BOTH companies will be making money on this and BOTH stocks will go up.
