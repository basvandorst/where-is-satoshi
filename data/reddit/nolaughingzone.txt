Because the question didn't sound well-intended. Legal vs Illicit..? How can this be even measured?  You would have never asked this question for USD transactions. Your question had an implicit assumption that most of it must be illegal.  
IMHO - it doesn't matter!

EDIT - 33 hours after the post: Happy Thanksgiving day everyone! Here to tell you that I am going to eat a humble pie today and accept that $5000 seems less likely by end of day. The rally on 21st Nov. wasn't strong enough.  Overall, still bullish for next few days.

Just because something happened in the past, doesn’t mean it will happen in the future.

Oh I am definitely smiling. I am a Bitcoin investor since 2013. I booked profits in some and continue to hodl majority of my portfolio and was able to diversify as well. I am at a point where daily swings in my portfolio don’t bother me. I was a professional trader - and really  enjoy trading daily swings with a small portion of my portfolio during my free time.
This post may be a joke but also a reminder of the flawed logic we have been following. “BTC has crashed and recovered so many times that it will definitely happen again”. The fact that this is considered sound logic and people upvote this just baffles me.

Just realised that anyone with approximately $20bn of cash can buy all bitcoins and destroy them, thus eliminating all competition whatsoever (assuming price will go up when they buy). Are you listening Western Union, Paypal?

I didn't but I learned my lesson. Now I record every conversation.

But we do understand that Bitcoin is not something everyone should store, right? People need to use it. The only way  bitcoin will reach its potential is when people start using it. My only suggestion: use some of the bitcoin you have. Spend it. Save the rest.

How does the pricing works? I get the coins as per price on the time when I send you the receipt, right?

EXACTLY the same the thing happened with me last week! Lost $1350 because Citibank (US) decided to reverse the transfer. I feel sorry for you bud. If anyone knows what action I can take in US, please let me know.
More detail: I sold BTC on LBC. The buyer did a citi global transfer. Straight away, I called Citibank service and asked them "Can this transfer be reversed under any circumstances"? They said - "No, no way Sir, the money is yours". I called again 10 mins later. Same answer. So, I released the BTC. Checked my account next day, and my money was gone :-(... Citibank has refused to help me

Hey will, haven't heard anything from you in last 7 hours? I sent you the receipt at 1.30 pm EST. What's going on?

Well, I am pretty sure any smart chap can easily hoard at least 70-80% of current bit coin market.  And it can happen. Here's how. Assuming that you have the cash and access to all exchanges.  At any time, there are 2000-3000 BTC at +/10% price on the offer side. All he needs to do is continue to lift the offer (with breaks) over the period of one day. Price will shoot up.  New sellers are likely to come in at that price. Price will stabilize. Repeat the buying after couple of weeks. Also, lift every offer from all Localbitcoins traders. Hit the daily the limits at coinbase. With BTC in very few hands, over the period of few months, you will see the price coming down automatically. Continue to buy as people sell. May be everyone wont sell. But you have technically destroyed the BTC market by  hoarding majority of it. Just remember that there is a price for every seller. 
Edit: Just one more thing. Lets assume the price is now $100,000 per BTC because of some massive buying. The buyer owns, say, 90% of the market and has smartly divided it into thousands of wallet addresses. So no one knows that one guy is hoarding 90% of the market. I bet last 10% would sell it at some point, may be at $120,000 or $200,000? But remember that the hoarder is not using the BTC. Less BTC in circulation = less adaption=less long term value.
