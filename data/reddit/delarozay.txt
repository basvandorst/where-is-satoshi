Can I safely transfer funds from gdax or gemini to a Segwit address/wallet? I'm concerned that the transaction may fail or not go through since those exchanges are currently 'not supporting segwit'

anyone have opinions on their personal favorite desktop &amp;/or android wallets from the ones suggested above?

no need to feel shitty. you'll get your money back and then some in time. in the meantime, if i were you, i'd take a piece of that $500 and get a bunch of alts. even with this week's "correction" my alts have kept me up (like way up)
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:28:00
So we agree, theres still obvious interest here.
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:26:36
thats why im still buying. we hit 20K less than a year ago. we will surely see that again. 12k is not crazy to imagine

I'm just shocked people can still actually make money off selling mugs, good job bro! (And hey if you're actually a girl, please don't take offense, still a bro in my book regardless)

Youre somewhat saying, 'i dont do or believe in Netflix cuz it needs a TV (monitor) to operate, ima just stick to investing in TVs'. Why not have Hugh and the GPS?

Nice, $2/day is great (seriously). Anything special running in the pc?/What program are you using?....i've got that Free BTC app on my phone, 500 satoshis every 10 min + another 500 for each ad viewed. You can cash out at 500,000 - im a bit over 50,000 in just a week, its just pennies but I'll take it

Which alts did you have and consider as junk? / how long did you hold them? There's gains to be made in more places than BTC. Diversify your bonds bro.

Before heading for thanksgiving dinner I threw $150 into $90BTC/$40ETH/$20LTC. Kind of kicking myself now that im seeing this slight drop, but at the same time im not too bothered. The hope is that 5 years from now $8kBTC/$400ETH/$75LTC were steals.

Overstock converts $ amount to BTC. I was looking for things that stick to BTC price regardless of fluctuations in value.

chances are he does

With this recent drop, are there any great deals available online for items/services sold in BTC? I picked up a subscription at CoinTracking for a price that I found reasonable. What other items/services are currently 'on sale'?
