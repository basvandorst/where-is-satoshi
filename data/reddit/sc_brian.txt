This seems quite similar to [Flattr]( with the difference being automatic payment to the sites instead of via some a button.  In principle it's an interesting concept, so curious how this works with the support and reach of Google.  The reduction of effort for this kind of micro/distributed support model is key in adoption.  
It will be interesting to see if the idea of supporting creators is enough to drive adoption here, or if there is an effective way to build in a user benefit to those that are using this system on the sites they visit.

A little background - we are a growing startup working on the problems of data accessibility and visualization for networks and markets both in Bitcoin and across the larger cryptocurrency space.  In the course of our work, we end up reading and indexing much of the academic and industry research that is published online.  Recently, we realized that this internal resource we had created might be of value as a reference for researchers everywhere.
As entrepreneurs and engineers ourselves, we understand that access to research and to data lays the foundation for much of the innovation and development we see in the news each day.  As such, we are pleased to announce the public release of the Smith and Crown research index.
We look forward to your feedback, comments, and submissions.  We hope that you find this resource as useful as we do.

Thanks, this is a great resource.  The hope is that as this space evolves we will be able to get the majority of this information all in one place that makes it as easy as possible for people to find important and relevant research.

For those looking for access to academic research in the space we have put together a searchable, tagged repository that we update on a regular basis with new papers. You can find it here: [smithandcrown.com/research](

Great - always good to see more work in the space.  Looking forward to learning more.
