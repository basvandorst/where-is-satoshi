Why is anyone still trading at gox.
@_date: 2013-04-21 03:31:34
I believe this is true. When I started investing my everyone in my family mocked me and told me to get a real job, now they ask for handouts.
@_date: 2013-06-14 00:52:45
I think this is good advice but only time can tell what will happen. I think the odds of bitcoin plumetting to $10 are very low.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:54:34
I would say steal it back from him. You have enough evidence and you have already confronted him. Personally I would have not told him and just taken back the coins and *then* see if he said anything. I really hope you get back your coins. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:06:05
god damn I wish I could short Bitcoin so bad.
@_date: 2013-07-08 20:46:56
I transferred directly from a libertybit account to my cavirtex address. Did I do something wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:54:22
It makes sense though. You'll never be able to make gains of 100% to 10000%
@_date: 2013-06-14 00:59:27
I know about it but hate the 3% fees. I'm wondering if I should transfer my bitcoins out of libertybit immediatly or wait a bit.
@_date: 2013-04-30 05:03:42
Just got into Bitcoin. I'd love to get a tip to get me started.
Here's my address. 18EBHJDyktKqQJQsnZYULDzFxLgUg19YkC
  and  Thanks for doing this.

He's twelve not 6.
@_date: 2013-05-30 02:33:43
lol probably from srs
@_date: 2013-06-19 18:40:42
more like $500.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:02:12
As much as this advice sucks, it's probably more effective than calling the police. If you know the roommate has exactly the amount of bitcoins you lost then you have fairly solid proof. If you were to go to a lawyer you might have a better chance but It would not be cost effective.

Does bitstamp work? Their prices and rates seem great.
@_date: 2013-07-14 08:40:55
yes I know some of these words.
@_date: 2013-06-01 03:36:56
shieeet. did you just give him $1300.
@_date: 2013-07-09 07:43:04
I thought these were anal plugs. woops.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:41:45
I haven't been following news recently but why is gox not doing withdrawals and how do you get your money out when you sell your coins.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:08:35
I realize that but I have some cash in my paypal account I want to turn into bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:59:53
Which is exactly why bitcoin will not become common anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:10:27
Is it possible to get these in canada.
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:47:42
It will be even more when bitcoin goes up a crazy amount in 10 years and that guy is crying.
@_date: 2013-10-26 03:52:51
It's going to be much harder to see the same price jump in the past 5 than in the next 5.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:50:24
Damn that is almost perfect. Teach me your ways.
@_date: 2013-04-27 05:01:38
This is brilliant, time to get searching.
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:52:39
Cookies! Is it ok if they're 10 cents over the limit?
@_date: 2013-11-12 10:40:05
what about canada?
@_date: 2013-07-09 07:41:44
What exactly were you doing.
@_date: 2013-07-12 00:10:39
This is exactly what this subreddit has been missing.
@_date: 2013-07-12 20:38:30
I just hate this particular meme more because it's everywhere on facebook for everything imaginable.
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:25:35
ok thanks that makes sense.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:18:25
I'd say 150+ would be a large trade.
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:46:03
I`m really sorry to hear that. If I were you I would track him down. Perhaps find sufficient evidence, see if a lawyer will consider your case and if all fails beat it out of him.
@_date: 2013-06-10 13:51:23
Does this mean you should transfer all bitcoins out of your account immediately and what type of storage do you consider most safe.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:47:07
I have the same problem. I can't help but think that anything more than $150 is ridiculous. My predictions were completely wrong too. Would have never guessed it jumped to $600 this fast.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:26:48
what do you think of bit stamp. They seem very user friendly.
@_date: 2013-07-09 07:41:10
Think about it you could have bought a very nice house right now upfront if you had saved your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:02:10
I just freaked out. I thought you meant the price crashed to single digits. I haven't checked the price in a while.
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:21:29
Man I`d be ecstatic If I had 3.5 bitcoins.
