Nocoiners fomoing at the mouth. The thing that people don't understand is that it has crashed well over a dozen times already. Imagine the stock market lost 50% of its valuation in one day..

Crypto is risky, but really think you'll be fine. Just pretend you've already lost it and hodl until it's either worth 0c or $1m. Don't sell - it's emotional.

I feel your pain man. The thing about imbeciles is that their ignorance is relentless, and the have no idea how insufferable they can be.

Nocoiner FOMO. Now imagine if there was no bitcoin? How would you spot dicks like john?

Are you a fucking dumb shit or what? It's January, not December - and "estimate" implies a guess. It's not exactly unreasonable to assume it will follow the current trend, and even make conservative estimates based on that.

And planes fly because of magic, building stand tall because god made it so. Shut up man. It's anyone's guessing game. There are clear patterns involved in trading, anyone that doesn't think so is a fucking imbecile. Shit can go south very quickly and nobody can foresee it - agreed, but only if there's a catalyst. We've been here many times before.

Well, for a transaction you wouldn't send the private key, you would sign it. Your private key should really be kept in a secure hardware wallet - where it never sees the light of day.

A mobile app, it was a joke

Or we can just use decentralized exchanges already - isn't that the point of crypto? The peer to peer economy?..

That's what the article states. It's a pretty hacky solution but it works.. Wasn't there a bitcoin satellite?
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:03:04
I have an app that does that - it's handy
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:04:44
Absolutely never. If you look at Bitcoin's history it has only ever went up. The sky is falling, SELL SELL SELL!

Most people don't know that you can buy small pieces of gold - they say it's too expensive.
There's literally no point in trying.

The whole crypto market is being manipulated. I even doubt the humble origins of crypto now.

Yep, fuck..the past 3 years have been a blink of the eye - I get 10 more blinks and I'm gone.. Definitely blowing my stash on cocaine and hookers
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:54:45
Yeah, because their fiat is no good here.. Amirite?

What version are we talking here? I'm on Debian, we just got v3 last week.. ;)

Why is it vulnerable?

Look at APIs - if you need a tutorial, then you need to stick with the fundamentals first.
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:04:26
You're not late. Don't expect a million back - look at ICOs for that.

Quote of the day.  Down with this sort of stuff.
