Absolutely but as the saying goes...only as much as you can afford to lose.

I used to live around palmetto park and military trail.  Good times down there.  To the moon!

Thank you slush!   Keep up the great work going forward.

Yeah, that's not happening on chain even if centralized.  No one on the other side likes to look into the future at this very fact because it spells doom and gloom.

I would test the waters so to speak making purchases with bitcoin on Amazon.  But at the same time I am a true believer in hard money such as bitcoin and would replenish bitcoin with easy money such as USD as I spend it.  If Amazon would incentivize crypto use with a small discount on each purchase it could go a long way.  Their subscribe and save incentivizes me with a discount to be patient for that one day a mont to receive items so surely a discount using crypto would help push people to spend it for purchases.
I know it creates a bit more of a tax headache at this moment but that can be mitigated with tax software incorporating ways to track your crypto spend.
I like how you described bitcoin as a ‘plan B’ as you are spot on because I see my credit spend being censored at times when making purchases at smaller less know web stores.  Just the other day I ordered a tool and Amex asked me to confirm if I made this purchase before they let the transaction go through.  I know they are trying to provide some protection for themselves but it was annoying because I had to type in all my information again and reorder it.

It’s almost as if they are doing a courtesy to the network by waiting for scalable 2nd layer solutions before jumping in.
