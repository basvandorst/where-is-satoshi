Not really. Just put the private key in your will. Grandma just need to understand what a private key is which might be a challenge itself. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:28:53
Agreed. Still need a super simple point of sale system.

Bank of Canada already tried to compete and failed (Mintchip) so now they want peace?
Also Bitcoin is already more stable than some countries national currencies. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 19:50:41
How does this solve the problem? Wont they just switch to a different encryption algorithm? 
@_date: 2016-04-04 17:37:41
I dont know. But i do know that every stock to hit that site crashed and burned along with my coins. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 20:36:54
But you could totally notice the cut trace? 
Also if they were smart the trace would be between 2 layers.

First thing I spotted was gmx.com mail server. Shady email host known for scammers so the trust level is already low. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 18:05:22
True enough. Sat comms are like 400ms latency on a good day so I can see why the miners hate but. Still not an excuse to butcher bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 08:39:48
Quadrigacx doesn't offer EFT Direct Debit. So getting CAD into your account is limited. 
That being said I really dislike Cavirtex. After several phone conversations. They always appeared shady and only interested in the bottom line for them.
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:55:04
So on the Chinese front. Couldn't they just use satellite comms to get around the firewall?
@_date: 2015-12-21 21:00:06
Still cheap as hell. Average fee is 0.00009BTC ($0.057). That a small amount for currency transfers.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:15:06
So pay a higher fee? Not sure why are you complaining about 
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:46:21
These guys are dealing in USD and CAD deposits will be traded at "Bank rates". IE. if your a Canadian wanting to trade bitcoin your exchange rate now includes the banks overhead. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:51:26
this link is dead fyi.
Missing the php part.
@_date: 2014-07-22 04:36:33
Truecrypt is fine. Since nobody can prove why its not secure and the audit didnt return any results my assumption is they got paid to stop. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:07:32
I feel like the coordination to do that would fall flat. No way to get every pool to agree without paying them. You would also need to track down all the solo miners as well. 
I cant find it now but somewhere there is a market spread of bitcoin wallet versions and there are people still running ancient version of bitcoin-qt. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:07:52

On another topic. Where did you sell the miners? Not many online places accepting of such a transaction?

The plane crash and bitcoin are unrelated. Just a reporter grasping for attention.

Not sure what your getting at? The Vault is a Canadian company following 
Canadian rules just like Virtex.
@_date: 2014-09-02 19:58:35
I think in this case its simply called Darwinism. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:09:42
You should submit your findings to these guys:
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:55:47
Agree with if you touch the money supply the whole system goes out the window. This will be self regulating once fees start going up. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:35:44
check out the vault of satoshi first. lower fees and better website. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:48:39

Or don't. That's ok too.

The block chain is public. Im sure reddit will find out who won soon enough. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 20:23:50
P2P in its current form doesn't really work for massive sets of data like the internet as a whole. You ever use bittorrent? even sharing more than 8 files and your network is overloaded with connections.
My point being that data centrers are much better at serving data and re-serving data that is accessed often. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:24:34
I won't say scammed. They are a shitty company but I was delivered a product in the end (BFL 60 Single).
Almost everyone who paid got the item however it was the year+ delay and the shitty customer service. 
Not sure how they are in business either. I wonder if they will close up shop after the monarch ship has sailed.  
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:35:32
Haha I didn't realize you had self posted the article. Both topics are interesting I'm not here to argue that. 
So while I have your attention, your article didn't really explain the connection between Bitcoin and the crash. Why would Branson make such a comment?
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:35:07
The Vault is quickly surprassing them in volume. I get the sense they put some thought into their strategy unlike Virtex who was the first investor with a code monkey.
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:16:32
The word bitcoin doesnt even appear in your ad.
What is the price in coins? or how are you determing it?

I think your stuck with blockchain.info or Armoury. 
Also you shouldn't be reusing addresses. Send all those coins in the 50 addres to a new wallet and start fresh.

It will test $300 before it goes up again. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:37:51
The issue lies with 501(c) tax excemption. If they take dontations and the US decides to ban Bitcoins then they might also revoke thier not for profit status as well. Its high risk for small dontation. 
The TOR project has just started taking coins so we will see what happens when they file thier taxes. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 20:37:31
Probably the smallest. Monaco and Isle of Man or something lol.
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:54:32
I don't see any reason to address this. Market forces of bitcoin should sort this out. Transaction fees will increase and miners will take them. 
However this is bad for the system. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:45:06
Why is a "Canadian" Exchange dealing in USD?
Much as I dislike CaVirtex they are still the only true Canadian exchange. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 17:13:24
I cant speak for others but my unit arrived factory fresh. Not a speck of dust on it so unless they thoroughly cleaned the unit I doubt it had more than 24 hours mining time on it. Which they admitted to for QA testing.

as said. IF nobody adopts these changes then the branch will fail. Everyone needs to adopt it or the blockchain will fork. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:30:08
Sorry bud. Lantern can't send. Only receive. However they have already stated that the blockchain will be transmitted so people can still receive and authorize transaction you just cant broadcast it until you have outgoing connection.  
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:16:32
Maybe so but they would still not be able to advertise this.  For a big organization like the wiki foundation they need to keep risk low when it comes to risking not for profit status and (currently) undefined currencies.
Id assume they want to take donations but the bean counts will say no until the U$ decides how they are going to regulate coins.

Yea. It's been a fun ride but if a few chinese companies can run the system it's basically over. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 17:04:07
No your completely right. If they can discourage enough businesses not to use it, it will fail. However if business can see the benefits they will ignore the law. 
Remember, laws are only good against 20% of a given population. See Uber and Airbnb, the benefits of ignoring several laws are too good to pass.

They need to hire an industrial designer to give it some work. Soft touch plastics, silk screen printing, and internal USB come to mind right away.

@_date: 2016-10-07 16:09:28
Yup. Nothing wrong with TrueCrypt.
@_date: 2016-10-07 16:46:32
Correct. But I would urge you to investigate this more. The security risk comes in the form of compromised DLL files that allow the execution of arbitrary code. BUT if an attacker already has access for code injection your hooped anyway. They could just install a program to wait for you to open the disk and copy everything. 
IMO. I'd rather trust Truecrypt versus some random cloud storage like BitLocker that could have who knows what backdoors. 
But I also didnt know about this Veracrypt which apparently fixes the DLL bug with Truecrypt. 
EDIT: In its 12 years there has be no document cases of a truecrypt file failing. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 16:20:36
Bank of Canada already has Bitcoin. They called it mintchip and it a really stupid idea. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 23:35:00
BitLocker is a windows program. Encrypts the whole drive and works in the background. Its highly recommended but the whole Automagic of it makes me question its real security level.

Propagation speed becomes a big problem. If you mine a nice big 10MB block it might take 10ms longer to get adopted by all where as the 1MB block will get adopted faster and become the "true" block. Because it was mined first. Other yea, clients don't really need to be involved in it too much.

I just received a dividend for HMF. Seems like the backend is still up.

TIL there is a sales tax on digital currency in Japan.

So get this.
In Alberta we accept credit cards at the Registries (American DMV?) . And they charge you a 2.99 fee to do so. How do they get around this? Well they are actually secretly selling you a gift card through some weird sketch company called "Option Pay" who then redeems the gift card to settle the balance. So sleazy.

skang has it. This method seems over complicated. If the locks loop into each other you get the same effect. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 16:50:14
Oh did they? All I know is it never saw the light of day and was basically no better than Interac. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 16:51:04
Agreed. People will always need stuff shipped. Postal service is almost an essential service. You wouldn't download a box of dildos? Wait. maybe I would...

No? Transactions are propagated almost instantly.
Confirmations are another matter for debate but if businesses want to accept bitcoin then they need to accept 0 confirmation transactions and assume that some level of double spending will happen. Just the cost of business like scumbag who walks out mid meal.

Gotta learn about weighted average price.

I doubt one person would be able to cash out the entire sum but it is still possible to siphon a huge amount of money. 
Depending on the level of control you would want to slowly steal a percentage and cash out over a period of months or years. That would yield the best return before people catch on that the system is broken. OR better yet someone redirect such a small portion that nobody knows what going on while you make a tidy free living.

I'm trying to remember when Visa had a 0.00015000 btc fee
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:42:54
As an electrical engineer i'm going to call bullshit on that. They probably experience high returns because miners operate these cards one next to the other in hot environments with poor airflow.

Tiger Torch. Like $30 at home depot.

Agree. Whats wrong with one time addresses?
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:20:18
Won't really have an impact till we closer to the next reward halving. Approximately 2016-07-25.

This exists in some concepts already. I believe blockchain.info has extra features if your sending to another blockchain.info address.

I knew a guy who sold 50 coins at $120 to pay for his honeymoon and party of the wedding. He regrets nothing and if you ask him, he got a free honeymoon.
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:54:53
Wait. Can someone explain this better. So does this only cover the purchase of bitcoin? Or does it cover all transactions? If I buy a physical good with bitcoin do they need to pay tax?
@_date: 2016-05-26 16:49:33
MORE altcoins! Superior Postcoin is better then all other altcoins!

Lol good luck Hong Kong. It'll go about as well as shutting down the cell towers during the Occupy movement . Lookup FireChat for anyone that doesnt know.

I mean technically your mining other peoples business...

I thought this too. This man is like the Rob Ford of the internet.

So funny enough. Putting a circuit in a steady thermal state is more conducive to a longer life span than the burst stress from gaming. 
Circuits usually don't "wear out" like car tires. Shock loading on components like MOSFETs degrades the internal materials plus all the expansion and contraction of the PCB/ Components results in fractured connections.

Yes but he has to wait until spring to plant them.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:54:44
Gotcha. That's kinda what I thought. So in essence Japan has decided to treat bitcoin like other foreign currency?
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:15:59
42 = 101010
148 = 10010100
Nah. Just seems wrong.

I bought one of the first BFL singles and was able to recover around 500%. Solid investment for me. I was actually thinking of tearing it apart and mounting the PCB as a trophy haha.

Idk what your talking about. We are almost past $4,000 Canadian peso. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:19:45
You would never get a block accepted to the chain through TOR. Latency is king in mining. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:33:48
The analogy of Digital Cash works really well for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 03:52:27
Your right. But technically less miners with the same difficulty will give you a better chance to get the lowest hash first. I just might take longer than 10 minutes 
@_date: 2016-07-27 20:13:26
I think Japan is in a better state now than in the late 80's.

Can we not just boycott the client that adds this as a function. The users determine the network based on the clients we run. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:28:17
I think they are just mad that Mintchip failed.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:32:59
The ability to move other currecny in and out of the exchange. Or higher fees.
Look at the difference between CaVirtex and MtGoxCAD. more than 100$. Just because it takes like 3 weeks to get CAD out of MtGox.
