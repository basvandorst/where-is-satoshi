i didn't know this, if this is the case and it doesn't just work behind the scenes then how can it possibly achieve mass adoption, I'm shocked to hear this.

whenever I see Ver and MtGox mentioned together, I can't help but think of David Koresh and the Mt Carmel Center at Waco.

If you look at the bigger picture, since the 23rd it's been ever slightly going up, and has been more and more stable, but yes, as time passes, these quick sells are getting more and more puzzling, i find myself asking, who is selling now? Do they not know the selling was two weeks ago and the bear market is coming to an end.

thanks for the response, a response back:
1. I don't think Bitcoin can afford to not do this over the fear of being centralised, if it doesn't it could fail, and it could be done in a decentralised way, it doesn't have to be one organisation, it could be many, the important thing is that there are people that are pursuing this goal.
2. My argument is that a unit such as the satoshi becomes the common representation if it Bitcoin is to achieve mass adoption, to the layman all you see is 1 Bitcoin is worth xxxx, and on the exchanges for the masses such as Gdax/Coinbase 1 Bitcoin is how the price is displayed.

cheers, on point 1, I agree with that, and that happens and can happen even more, but my point 1 about a lobby, about encouraging governments, institutions, this is something that can happen as well as that, Bitcoin needs both, the peer to peer influence has taken in so far, but for me it also now needs something else to take it to the next level
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:58:09
i'm pretty sure computers are now used by the masses
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:45:48
yes, and there needs to be a concentrated effort by everyone involved in Bitcoin to have it adopted as a storage of value by countries, banks and institutions.

you need to do more research before investing. At least look on the back of the box, or read the card that comes with the box of chocolates.
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:49:33
soon ish, no fixed date yet, lots of miners are on board, i think once the direction of the market is upwards, it'll be released.
@_date: 2018-09-04 13:41:53
in which ways do you see it not being descentralized, it uses Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin nodes, and has it's own RSK nodes. RSK will reward the decentralisation of the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:45:14
I agree, it has a lot of serious backing, at the moment it looks like Eth has served it's purpose, and a lot of alts will disappear, it makes far more sense to use BTC and RSK / RIF to do these things
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:12:34
this is such an exciting project, so Bullish about this, not just for Bitcoin but for all Crypto. Read up on RIF as well, the Rootstock Infrastructure Framework, that works with this, RSK will allow smart contracts, RIF will allow DAPPs to be built on Bitcoin, and also allow other crypto's to operate on the network like Wanchain does. We're entering very exciting times. The use cases for Bitcoin are about to explode, things we can't even imagine yet are going to happen on the Bitcoin network and it's associated side chains. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:50:22
it only turns your arsehole irritating if you snort it out of there. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:25:30
to a point, and yes i hold a lot of traction with that view, and this: 
But there are arguments that a computer specifically designed in a similar structure to the human brain could become conscience. Also at this moment there is no way of knowing what will happen when computers become way more advanced than they are now, whether there are different forms of conscience beyond what humans experience, it does seem that conscience is something hardwired into the universe

I do, I'm posing questions, not making any statements.
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:38:12
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:46:58
i'd be more inclined to think it will, there are so many factors in it's favour
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:40:32
check out this post about RSK and RIF
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:04:32
What will it take for Bitcoin to become self aware, as the computing power of the Bitcoin network continues to exponentially grow, will it reach a certain point where it naturally becomes alive and self aware? Or will it require more than that, human input and programming?
@_date: 2018-09-15 09:15:23
i thought I head somewhere that RSK can utilise the lightning network as well
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:30:21
my microwave doesn't have quite the same computational power as the Bitcoin network
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:46:36
There's Rootstock RSF and Rif coming out that is Bitcoin blockchain with smart contracts, operating on a sister chain that is linked to Bitcoin, non of the load effects the main Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:12:01
the reason why Bitcoin will never succeed, they taste too good, but on the other hand, eating your Bitcoin will lead to scarcity. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:08:44
no, it's everyone throwing tomatoes at each other today, the bull run is next year
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:37:20
is that Roger Ver in the photo with Tim Draper?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:25:37
Bitcoin really needs to attract more institutional and financial investors, so this extreme doesn't happen, both the extreme reaction to FOMO and the extreme reaction to FUD it's getting rather tedious.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:47:30
if this is true, then if North Korea do start something with the South then we in the west should stay out of it. This is betrayal, IF this is true.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:44:32
relax, get a grip, it's here to stay, beyond our lifetimes
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:32:53
hopefully, what a buy opportunity
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:30:11
there most probably will be a trap, and a chase with the police following, but if we HODL Bitcoin in our bike basket, will get it on that rocketship
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:35:13
cool if it's $200 forever we'll be able to buy steadily for the rest of our lives and accumulate thousands, and it'd be great as a payment system if its steady, it's a win win either way
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:05:48
i think it's slowly coming to an end, the drop yesterday was more people reacting to some news and specific fud. There's lots of positives, positive regulation in Korea, legitimising Bitcoin. China preparing to allow regulated Crypto again.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:36:42
what ban, what country is banning Bitcoin? there is no ban.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:32:03
if it's the apocalypse it's going to be great, just imagine how many we'll be able to buy
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:40:11
you are an embarrassment, you should be ashamed. If you cant day trade, and i'm not good enough to do that, then HODL. It's people like you that have helped to create this situation, what a waste.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:49:04
not at all, if you can day trade and make money, great, if you can't then invest in the longterm and hodl. If you invest and then sell at a loss, pathetic, you do have to stick with it i'm afraid, the other option is to betray, and let everyone down.

Blockchain AND BITCOIN, he talks about them both, blockchain was created for Bitcoin, blockchain is a CORE component of Bitcoin.
