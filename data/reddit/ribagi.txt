The more I read about Mt. Gox the more I think that Mt. Gox was acting grossly neglect.

Bitcoin isn't a virtual currency. It is a crypto currency. There is a difference.

There is a difference between the Bitcoin and a bitcoin.

&amp; Of course they have to drop some anti-bitcoin propaganda besides talking about its history.

It talks about the Mt. Gox hack a year ago, I lold'. It is like saying the USD dollar is crap because Wallstreet got hacked.

That isn't 100% true. If you will run a high electrical current through the bar and test its resistance you'll find out if it is gold or not gold. Some problems comes in if the gold is rose gold or some other type of gold alloy that was used in coins from the late 1800s' to 1930s'.

I find it funny that the closest store that will have the magazine to me is a Hospital.

And even if you brute force it, it might not even be worth the cost of electricity.

It is still hard to determine what those words are. There are something like 200k words in English. So that means that the possible word combos for the smallest English sentence (3) will equal over 8 quadrillion, which is greater as an 7 character password with any combo of anything you can use on your keyboard.
I know your next rebound would be something like 'But you can predict where verbs and nouns are'. Even if you count up all the verbs, all the nouns, etc. you'll still don't know what place they are in the sentence. Given two senteces, "You are tall" and "Are you tall", they contain the same words, however they are placed in a different order. If you some how knew that the sentence is 3 words long and you had a cracker that only cracks in a SVO, you will never get the right password even if you had a quantum computer. So the best and easiest way, if you would go around doing this, would just stick with a brute force of words rather than a brute force of verbs, nouns, etc.

Really? Because my version of the Bitcoin Social contract says that SatoshiDice is ok, however it also says that I must have 10% of all winnings.

You are going to look into every book ever written and going to be written? That would take up alot of space. The reason for the first sentence is so it is a easy place to look for. Besides going to page 534 paragraph 4 sentence 3, you can just open the book. 


That is even more absurd than what you wrote above.


I think you are assuming all sentences are equal in length. Also, I don't get where the power of 53 comes from.


I am trying to think of code that can check for grammar, and all I am thinking of is something that would waste a lot of time. Not all sentences are created equal. Some are short, some are long. Some don't have subjects, some don't have objects. Some have 1 verb, others 3. It would be hard to predict anything. 


I am just showing how it scales up in that a basic sentence is better than a good size password.
You give me the sentence that I wrote and i'd believe you. It is in Sha-128.

I am asking why. Deal with it.

Go to random book, take first sentence out of it. Use that as password. If you are even more paranoid, convert it to Base 64.
