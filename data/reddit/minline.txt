Every fraudulent investment operation is 'used' in some way. So the mere fact that bitcoin is 'used' proves nothing. I am saying that bitcoin on its own cannot be practically or legally utilized and the only way to benefit from it is if new investors enter the scheme.

There is no conspiracy. Banks don't care about cryptos. Banks care about loans, and how the borrowers will repay them. Bitcoin is a faith based scheme and it will kill itself:

A promissory note, sometimes referred to as a note payable, is a LEGAL instrument. 
Since it comes from debt, and debt must be paid, English £10 Note is a LEGAL instrument. It is not a mere promise people make in everyday life, but legally binding promise that legally obligates - borrowers are forced to use it until all their debt is paid off. Crypto legally obligates no one.

E-mail is also very practical. You only need a password, an internet connection, and easily available software to send e-mail to another in any place on earth based on your sovereign decision without any interference or incompetence by a third party. Does that mean e-mail massages are worth thousands of dollars?  No. Means of transfer cannot give value to the thing transferred.

Well, I am saying that it is useless because it cannot be practically or legally utilized like economic goods or fiat money. This has nothing to do with my time on reddit.

It is backed by legal obligation of borrowers to settle their debt. In other words, even if people completely abandon Pound Notes as means of exchange, the borrowers are still forced to use them until all their debt is paid off, since non-acceptance of Pound Notes won’t make the debts go away. Meaning, holders of these notes have something that entitles them to property of borrowers. On the other hand, holders of cryptos are not entitled to property of miners.
