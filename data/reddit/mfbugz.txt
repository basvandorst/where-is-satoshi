A throttle control can be set by cruise control and that's all you would need to hack at a very specific time, say, a specific long dangerous road that leads to a sharp curve which Los Angeles is full of.

Im sorry but that is not the sort of theory I was referring to. This is the sort of theory I was referring to. And explains it much better.

What would make you accept that they were experts? Or even knowing about a possible hack when the rest of the world doesn't even know what the CIA is capable of? 
I'm not trying to be argumentative here I just find the leap on logic, well illogical.

Firstly you can just cam down right now, you apparently don't take arguments that oppose yours too well.
Secondly this is new verifiable evidence to the theory that it could possibly be an assassination, you know now that we know the CIA can and will hack cars. 
Lastly you keep trying to negate it as a theory. Everything you're saying is trying to down play it as nothing even when there is some evidence that could lead to the possibility. That's what theories are for. You take what you feel is the evidence and then you test it in order to find stronger support. You seem to not quite understand that concept too well.

A good assassination would be exactly that, a hard to physically prove that it was one. 
Just because there's a lack of a complete picture to prove it, doesn't mean the theory is invalid.
