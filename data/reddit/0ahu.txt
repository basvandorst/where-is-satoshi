How much BTC did that get you?

as the original creator of this topic, ive learned the truth now.  some would benefit from not being so quick to dismiss criticism without looking into it, because when you do, it might support your case even harder!  which seems to be the case.
it seems that yes, it takes up energy, but i didn't realize the context of this energy.  it's nothing compared to other things in the world taking up far more energy.  and upon learning that, i empathize with those quick to kneejerk with 'shill/BS' but not actually address the issue -- because it does feel pretty BS/fear-mongering type of logic, now that I've looked at it closer.
and if BTC develops as a utopian currency for the entire planet, 1/32nd of all the websites feels like a miracle.  YES that's worth it!!

When you say you've made profit, in what way?  Do you mean selling and re-buying and selling again?
Thanks for your time

isn't it making progress?  seems like it's only grown since i've first heard of it and every time i check in it feels bigger.

It's always been obvious even when I was in college I knew it would hit but you really do need money.  Borrowing isn't an option for many, especially if they already have a situation of debt.

I invested at 300.  It's now worth 5,000+.  But I've held every penny..  By your logic I should've cashed out 25% by now, sevearl times over.  And by invested I don't mean a lot, I mean I only have one THIRD of one bitcoin.  but still, by your logic i should cash out some of that

You think US government will use BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:10:35
When do you think that will happen?
You don't think there will be a transition?
I'm saying in that transition a lot of BTC "diehards" are going to lose their resolve and cash out.
