Sooooo is that supposed to be a positive thing? Because it doesn't sound positive to me.

Well I don't see why borders are necessarily a bad thing. Also the way it is phrased made me think he implied that people would violate other peoples rights to resources by not recognizing their borders. Corporations don't recognize borders or people, they are driven by profit and that is why some would bleed an area dry of its resources at the determent of the local people. Borders help keep communities safe from outside pillagers and incompatible cultures that might lead to conflict. Also the brain drain phenomenon that can be seen occurring in India where a good proportion of their best and brightest leave to work at their benefit else where, in no way can I fault this behavior as I too would do the same in such circumstances, however India as a nation of people would benefit from holding onto their best. Not that I am completely against open borders I just see how they can be damaging to communities and may lead to conflict. I like the idea of being able to go where I want to live, but I feel that it can be a abused.

Yes we are all human, and humans clash with one another over everything. Us against them. You against me. This dynamic is never ending and we shall always be divided. For as long as we have an ego that distinguishes ourselves.
But that was not my only concern, my concern also rests with that which is not human. The opening of boarders to a globalized market would see people losing their resources to corporations.
