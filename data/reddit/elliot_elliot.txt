I am leaving them on the exchange wallets :/, sadly I only have an economic background, not really technical or computer science related hence I feel a little bit uncomfortable dealing with wallets etc. 
Read about hard wallets (Trezor e.g.), what is in your opinion the best way to store BTC safe and secure? 
Thanks :) -

Thank you for this article. My parents are really environmentally conscious and skeptical of Bitcoin hence they heard if Bitcoins "high" energy consumption. 
Now I might change their opinion and every word spread can be helpful.

Thanks you, just watched a bunch of videos, think I go with a Trezor hard wallet.

Maybe not a country yet, but thousands of people gained financial independence from opressing leadership for sure.

Please be my mentor. That was the best response I've ever had the honor to be a witness of.

You mean like "the US cheats on the whole world using the Dollar as a weapon" kinda cheating?

Institutional investors are also slowly but steadily coming in the crypto space - especially and foremost BTC. 
Why? 
Bitcoin is almost completely uncorrelated to other asset classes, this is incredibly impressive and significant. BTC enabled a new asset class for investing. Putting BTC in your portfolio can actually increase your risk/return rate in some cases which is incredibe. 
Some investors even go as far as claiming 'not investing in BTC is irresponsible'. And those institutional investors oversee trillions of dollars, only a small piece of that can push BTC up x-fold.
