I purchased them on cryptomate and they sent them to my blockchain wallet. The transaction shows double the ammount I ordred amd I used half to move to another wallet. The remaining funds it wont let me send it says I don't have enough coin. In my wallet even though my blockchain balance states I do. Also the recipient mever received the original coins I sent :(

Thank you for your answer it was massively informative. so i let GUIMiner run for 5 hours and i made the equivalent of £0.01 using BTC Guild. I tried using Mt. red but it said connection error. I was planning on running the GPUMiner when my pc is turned on anyway so that the cost of electricity might not be that much more than if GPUMiner was not running. Will being part of a pool increase my chances of a bigger payout?
EDIT: As part of a pool is I see the number of bitcoin i earn increasing all the time, is there ever a "jackpot" moment where the collectives of the pool come across bitcoin and it gets shared between us? I have read up on this but it confused me and I could not understand the answers i read. Thanks again.
