The media thrives on drama. Most of the articles were just as bad when the price was going up dramatically last month.

This is starting to become a big issue and people need to start taking it more seriously. Most of the answers here are either flippant or incomplete. 
For instance, saving your 24 words in a separate location seems pretty insecure as those words can be used to recreate the original keys, so you haven't solved the problem, you have multiplied it. Putting them in a home safe and suggesting that a robber wouldn't know what they were is naive, obfuscating them and telling your partner how to rearrange the words correctly is great until you both get killed in a freak accident and your kids have no way to access the money.
Some sort of multisig is probably the way to go but it needs to be really well thought out.

To be honest if these coins are from forks of bitcoin that you are holding long term I would just leave them until they are better supported by reliable wallets. I know some people here are dumping bitcoin cash because they think it's toxic waste but you never know which way things could go. It's like making a small investment in an alt coin without having to do anything.

No you can't. You would have to recreate the whole mining infrastructure including hash power. Even that wouldn't be enough since everyone would know it wasn't decentralised and would only use it because they were forced to.

So you're saying there is going to be another bull market in tulips?

One day it will be understood that bitcoins 'Carbon Footprint' is a feature not a bug and the bigger the better. When bitcoins energy usage hits 1% of world usage we'll know it's basically taken over. Probably end up being 10% or more eventually.

Pretty well every business I have dealt with for as long as I can remember has a no questions asked money back guarantee. This is an overrated benefit of credit card chargebacks. I have never in 45 years had to charge back or even threaten to charge back.

Please make sense.
Bitcoin has dropped way more than 1/2 plenty of times. Hell it dropped more than 2/3 just in the last month. In my opinion bitcoin ''will either be worth a lot or not much at all" i.e. you will either make a lot or have next to nothing left. Bitcoin is highly unlikely to just chug along bouncing between 5 and 15 thousand dollars for ever.

Is there any way to see how much transacting is going on, or is that hidden by design?
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:25:47
A lot of people disagree

OP claims the statement " you will either make a lot of money or you will lose all your money" is completely wrong because Bitcoin will never be worth nothing. While I agree Bitcoin will probably never be worth nothing, you could indeed lose all your money. In 2015 Bitcoin was worth at one point about $200. It's now worth $11,000. If you bought 1 BTC now and it dropped back to $200 you would indeed lose all your money - or near enough. Even dropping back to $1000 or $2000 permanently is you basically losing all your money.

is it possible to find out how much has been lost, or just when someone shows up on reddit to tell us about it?

I actually wouldn't mind some sort of systems where larger amounts of bitcoin could be stored in say a 3 way multisig address. I would have one key, a trusted organisation such as a bank would have another and a seperate secure location holds the third key. If I want to transact a larger amount I go to the banks website and enter my own key and get an sms verification etc. and they sign the transaction. They can deal with the security etc. I would pay for that.

I just wish I could buy a cup of coffee. One day maybe.
@_date: 2018-12-27 03:09:23
I have often wondered about that. There are thousands, if not millions of coffee shops in the world, many of which have an 'alternative' flavour to them. I am not talking Starbucks here, but at least here in Australia there are a lot of small  coffee and food outlets run by non 'establishment' type people. Chain coffee shops are not a really big thing here. None, or virtually none offer lightning as a payment method. Yet a $4 coffee and maybe a slice of pie seems to be the ideal use case for lightning.
