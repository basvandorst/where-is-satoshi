I never even said my mother had a position on bitcoin just that literally everyone and their mothers are talking about it. You proved my point of this place behaving like a cult just because my position wasn't "OMG EVERYONE WE ARE GOING TO BE BILLIONAIRES WE ARE SO SMART" so you and others just went straight to roasting me. I have no idea how a schnorr signature will affect bitcoin.  I have done my Due diligence, as I do with anything I may potentially invest in. Just because it doesn't line up with your exact views doesn't mean im a fool. 
Also, don't use twitter for your investment decisions, look at their finances, who's in charge and other similar things. Oh wait. Bitcoin doesn't have any of that lol.

Keep in mind, how many people have access to technology, have extra income to "invest", Are willing to take the risk, etc.

Wall street hasn't entered for a number of reason's. One being that the market has had an unreal year and The amount of risk in crypto isn't worth it in such a bullish market. Also Wallstreet has seen this shit plenty of time before, eg tech crash early 2000's

Fair enough point I may have a stronger confirmation bias then I realize, regardless it seems to be in the news everywhere.

Ah sorry for the misunderstanding. It is refreshing to see someone with an outlook based in reality. So many people think that this trend is sustainable and it just isn't.

That is an incredibly dangerous mindset, saying it "has to go up". No it doesn't. Also what technical's exactly? I love hearing Bitcoin "investors" Trying to act like experts when they clearly don't have a shred of knowledge in regards to trading. I'd love to hear your technical analysis for the mid/long term. Short term It may see a small bump and don't worry it won't be over my head I have been trading for a few years now. 
If an economic crash happens most people will flock to gold/long term gov bonds.

So what are you saying? This is eventually going to be a vertical line up? Sorry but that's not how economics work.
