Waitwaitwait .... it’s free to buy btc in the Square Cash app?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:13:05
Yeah ripple and iota
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:20:02
Yup. I am.

I like GDAX the bet but it only has 3 currencies and I’m lookin to diversify. Been using CEX.IO but I’m not very happy with it
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:36:07
Yea took a little over 2 weeks for me on bitstamp
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:06:22
Yea, I don't think there's any other way to buy instantly without a eligible card.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:13:22
I guess I asked the wrong question. I meant to ask why they dont have USD/EUR wallets built in? Like on GDAX I can trade BTC to USD for example, and then can cash out whenever. Other exchanges I have to move my BTC (or other crypto) into, trade  back and forth for whatever, and then if i want it in USD i have to withdraw it to another site (along with a decent amount of fees) that lets me cash it out onto a card or into my bank.

Okay I guess that makes sense. Basically to avoid regulation and everything else that comes with the government being a part of it eh?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:45:19
I just got onto it. Been using GDAX, but Binance has pretty much everything and they charge a fixed fee instead of a percentage, which can be discounted if you buy and pay the fees in their own currency. I like it so far

Hey what exchange is everybody trading on that’s not Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:33:21
Yea. Read the restrictions though. Some countries aren’t allowed or are only allowed for certain amounts. I believe the fee is a little bit lower than Coinbase. But there is a warning that says your card must be “3D secure” whatever that means. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:47:39
Why ETH and not BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:52:00
Bitstamp (Also has a credit card option) and GDAX (which only supports bank transfers and wires)
Edit: Forgot to mention CEX.IO. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:36:14
Do you have a bank account? If so you can just deposit $ from there
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:47:07
Binance is good
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:26:13
Yea, I guess really it just makes it easier for me to visualize when I can see the XXXUSD amount. Even tho I know it’s not *for* trading, I do trade it and I wanna be able to withdraw some easily without absurd fees between exchanges. I wonder what contracts Coinbase and CEXio have made with banks to be able to do this...
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:38:18
Why don’t more exchanges have a built-in USD/EUR wallet like GDAX, Coinbase, CEX.io?
Edit: Clarification
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:03:13
Yes it does, it only has BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, and BCH though, and everything trades with USD, EUR, and BTC. 
When I started trading I used that same “model” but now I see the potential benefits of trading to BTC or ETH and have stopped using fiat as my main pairing currency. But if you’re just hodling, fiat for alt works great.
