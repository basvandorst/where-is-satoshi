Ok. NoSQL could help them better scale their data needs, right?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:19:38
Real PR owns up to problems and talks about what they're doing to fix them. They're also sensitive to people they've done wrong.
Edit: I find it amusing that I've been downvoted for this. ha!

OK, fine. I read other parts of the thread and see how the cloud may pose security issues for a private exchange. But, Openstack principles could still be used internally  to scale. 
But really, the point is that they have loads of cash to pay for consultants to build out their infrastructure smartly. It didn't happen. We'll see what the future brings.
No sense in making excuses for this company, I figure.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:50:21
They need to hear the cold, hard truth and get their acts together. If they can't take it, they shouldn't be in business.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:54:47
Umm, you do realize this is 2013 and you can scale in the cloud immediately? Ever hear of Amazon EC2 or Rackspace? Something tells me you guys could use some infrastructure experts on your team as IMHO you're undermining the Bitcoin economy with your ineptness.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:32:10
You're right. If the exchange is down, you have no choice to buy or sell. But then again, and by definition, it's no longer a market because you can't fucking trade.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:08:07
There is a difference between public and private companies. Yo.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:50:42
troll alert. perthguppy, do you work for mtgox or associated with them in any way?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:22:00
Your last post said the last few days in Bitcoin has been epic. You do know that the word "epic" relates to heroism, right? Just wondering, but what's been heroic about the last few days? Not trying to be snide, but there are more accurate words to use.

I think he provided rationale somewhere but they also profit of the buy / ask spread.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:33:57
If MtGox volume is public, just multiply it by the average trade's corresponding fee. That's their profit.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:45:51
It's not a micro-percentage. They take $60 from a one-way $10,000 trade. At OptionsHouse it would only cost you $3.95. The time is ripe for better exchanges that charge reasonable fees.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:12:09
So you're too small to do things the right way? Like everyone else, you have access to Amazon EC2 / RackSpace and can scale dynamically without having to wait a month for servers. Don't tell us that elastic cloud solutions aren't made for large scale operations such as trading systems. At least, you should explain why it doesn't apply (and as far as I can tell, there's no reason why it shouldn't). 
To me, yours is just an ill-informed response and you should quit if you're responsible for MTGox' technology solution. I know I'm being harsh here, but a lot of people are pissed off with the lack of professionalism from MtGox and it's severely lagging or down exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:44:33
Oh my, this is the first I'd heard of this. "Magic the Gathering Online Exchange."
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:15:49
The proof is in the pudding. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:45:10
Exactly. And I find it amusing that MtGox downvotes you for that.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:35:23
Could you please remove the, "Trade with confidence..." tagline on your homepage? This is bothersome. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:48:41
Price is one thing. An exchange you can't trust is another. I've broken up with women that had better reputations than MtGox.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:58:30
Ever hear of Amazon Web Services or Rackspace's OpenStack? They scale immediately as opposed to a month, yo.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:09:00
Ok, well do we trust MtGox as an exchange based upon their poor uptime and lag? I'd trust them far more if they could scale appropriately so their service was actually up and not lagged severely.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:59:22
I know about OpenStack and how easy it is to ramp up new servers in the cloud instantly. Do you? 
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:21:25
A market is supposed to just work. How price changes in any market is inconsequential. MtGox failed pretty hardcore.

One does not simply walk into Amazon. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep, and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust, the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:04:57
Actually, it's not difficult. Not familiar with AWS, but with Openstack you just write scripts to help you scale and balance load. As far as money, it's tons cheaper than building your own damn server farm.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:54:11
Infrastructure issues would have been lessened if they hired experts to both help them scale efficiently and prevent DDOS. And you say for me to have respect... Do you consider their communications to be professional/respectful? I think not. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:38:36
Sure, and that's different from the website being down or incredibly lagged because they can't scale or prevent DDOS.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:25:40
NoSQL scales better and could be applicable. The bottom line is that customers don't care how it's done -- just that it's done.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:29:13
Supposedly they only had $11 million in Bitcoins. Whatever that means, as the value has been cut to one quarter of its value in the last three days.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:03:06
What's so hard about it?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:51:45
No, decentralized means every exchange can run how it pleases. I would pay more fees to trade on an exchange that works, unlike MtGox. Besides, we need more exchanges. MtGox takes 0.6% from every transaction??? That's highly excessive when traditional places only charge $7.95 per trade. They're f*cking us over.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:27:16
If you're buying more than a miniscule amount, you're fucked. I'm pretty sure traditional exchanges know what they're doing with pricing. They've been at this for many, many years. Like I said, Mt.Gox just needs more competition to bring them back to reality.
Basically, who wants to pay $60 for a $10,000 buy order? That's plain ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:23:16
I'm pretty certain with the millions of dollars that Mt. Gox is raking in with their obscene transaction fees of 0.6%, they can hire experts to figure this scaling thing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:55:57
It's not about the money, for me at least. It's about an exchange that can't stay open or is lagged incredibly. You know why? Because by definition it's no longer an exchange... This just brings down trust in the Bitcoin economy, and that's a shame IMHO because I believe many of us are passionate about it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:48:30
It's like they're run by teenage kids that fail to take responsibility. "Hey, we lost our customers millions of dollars because we can't keep an exchange up but this a great thing because it means our market is so popular!" F*ck you.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:44:55
It is legit because I came here from their posting on Facebook.
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:38:42
Well maybe they're not really sensitive -- just give the impression of it at least. These guys sure hadn't. Bunch of bozos...
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:19:27
If you know the average trade volume, you can multiply it by the corresponding fee. Then just take the calcs the rest of the way. Also include the spread between bid and ask. No need to be so brash when ill-informed.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:06:54
You make more than a micro percentage. At OptionsHouse it's only $3.95 per trade. That's a far far smaller percentage than what you're taking. Your fees are obscene and I hope that competition brings you in line with reality. You sure raked in the millions for a while though.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:04:42
See, that's another PR failure by MtGox. They don't even say what they're doing to combat DDOS. As far as we know, they're doing nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:44:13
What DDOS prevention methods do you utilize? CloudFlare does an amazing job for real websites. I bet you use nothing. Why? To kill Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:23:14
Only 50k shares? For a $10 stock, that's 500k! And 4k options is actually the option to buy 400k shares... For only a 3.95 fee nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:11:18
I don't see what's so bad about it. Don't you wish you bought in at $15 and sold at $250?
