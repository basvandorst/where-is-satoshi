Tax laws in the US make it a real chore to spend BTC on a regular basis.

This is the paper-bitcoin-can-be-inflated argument.

Percentage difference is all that matters, which is what log chart shows you.  Nobody in finance plots anything long term on a linear chart.

Block time would increase in proportion to the amount of hash power lost.  So if half the hashing goes offline, the average block time would be 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes for a few weeks.  Not exactly a huge problem.

This might be simplistic,  but I assume there is a lag between price increases and hashrate increases, because:
1. Price goes up
2. More machines are ordered.
3. manufacturers take time to respond to increased demand and build new machines.
4. Machines are finally delivered and put into service.
And the faster the price goes up, the greater the lag time.

Nice that they are responding to community concerns.  I’m amazed that they were even aware of them.  
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:48:19
No, I am not implying that.  Just summarizing because the article was disjointed and unclear.
I don’t have a solid opinion on this topic yet. 
It’s pretty clear that the price of bitcoin will rise more slowly if bitcoin is sold through a fractional reserve fund than it would if the same number of bitcoin were purchased outright.
It’s also likely that the vastly increased reach and legitimacy that would result from the existence of such a fund would still lead to greater adoption and large price gains.
I need to go read the source, which I believe is here:

Ok, this article is actually interesting.

I saw someone write on here that altcoins are th inflation.  There might be some truth to that.

Why not just say why?
You could probably sum it up in 10 words.

My iPad autocorrect does weird stuff like this when I leave the keyboard set to Swedish.

Scary thought, you idiots being in charge of everything... :-)

This is nothing like the early 2000’s, when absolutely everyone wanted to day trade stocks.

All of those except bitcoin are creatively structured middle men.
The real trend is towards true P2P interactions, which will make Facebook, etc. obsolete.
Bitcoin is an example of the kind of true P2P interaction, enabled by encryption technology, that will eventually become the norm for most  industries.

Are you sure about that? I can understand them not letting you deduct a net loss for the year, but surely your gains can be reduced by the amount of your losses, as long as you don’t go into net loss territory.
What you are describing makes little sense from a tax policy perspective.
Genuinely curious...
**Edit:** so, [this page]( seems to say that your losses are deductible if you acquisition cost for each lot is greater than €1000.  You should definitely review this with a tax guy if you haven’t already.

This is an age-old argument against day trading, and it is applicable to most markets.
In my opinion it is simple-minded because it ignores the fact that day traders work differently than investors — they use much higher leverage and get in and out quickly, keeping a very close eye on their risk.
Personally I believe that day trading is not advisable for most people, but the argument put forth in the article is not the reason why.

So he made it easier and more convenient for people to destroy their bodies and lives with heroin and meth.
I’m not seeing how that makes it any better.

You keep trying to bring the govt. into this when we are talking about Ulbricht.  Legalization is a separate issue.  
Drug dealers are bad, how hard is that to comprehend?  There was no regulation or quality control on what was being sold, and the proceeds were certainly going in large part to gangs, cartels and terrorists.
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:01:04
Ulbricht is, at the very least, an amoral enabler of drug dealers and worse. He profited from the misery of others.  In short, a scumbag.
He should not in any way be held up as a mascot or poster child for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:52:42
Keep in mind that this probably represents less than $200 million of funds flowing into bitcoin.   Still good news though.
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:36:09
Don’t let the idiots get to you.  Most people here are young, male, and absolutely convinced that nothing bad will ever happen to them and that *they* will never require any help.
Either that or they’ve already been screwed by the capitalist system (e.g. student loans), and don’t want to see anyone else get something for free.

Dumb question... If I put up a lightning network node will people just start using it?
Can I do it on a Rackspace or Amazon cloud server?

The safest way is to build your own Trezor, with parts that you ordered yourself.  Then inspect the source code to be sure that there isn’t any way that the keys can leave the device.  Finally, build the source yourself.  Extra points if you disassemble the binaries and inspect those as well — your compiler may have been compromised.
If it were me, I’d use a processor that is slightly different than the one they specify.  That protects against the possibility that the manufacturer is compromised and selling chips with trezor-specific malware already embedded in them.
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:01:28
They’ve declared a set of source files to be certain version, which means that version is done even if the binaries haven’t actually been placed on a website for normal people to download yet.

You have way too much faith in the anonymous dark web vendors.
A case can be made for legal drugs, but like in every other industry there needs to be regulations, inspections and consumer protections.

He should be punished because he is a scumbag drug dealer who profited off of the misery of others, and who enabled terrorists, gangs and cartels to more efficiently raise money.
Life in prison is probably excessive though.

Sound like you build your own android.  How do you trust the code for that?  There’s no way you could review it all yourself.

The fallacy here is that you are conflating historical authoritarian “leftists”, who only used that ideology as a means to an end, with modern day liberals.
Today it is the republicans who are the authoritarians who lack compassion and lie to the people to advance their own narcissistic ambition.

Well excuse me for asking about your hobby.

These days you really can’t trust that a clean machine won’t be hacked.  If it’s internet connected you have to assume that it is compromised.  Worse if you use Linux; distro servers have been hacked before and will be again.
