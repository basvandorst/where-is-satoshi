Alibaba is a company backed up by China government. So is Bitmain. If bitcoin is a threaten to China’s government, then Bcash is the perfect solution to put it under control. Just a thought.

Yes no worries. It happens to many times.

In the same sense? So politicians holding amazon or google stocks and tell them what to do, otherwise, they will kill them. Do you mean “same sense” by this?

This is the most expensive bitcoin I ever bought. I bought a bit last week when it’s 8000, thinking this is so expensive now.But that bit money has already doubled. We will see about this one!

The price hasn’t reach my moon yet.I am keeping on buying :)

I feel like everyone made some mistakes at some point. I sold some of my coins to pay rent cause I was out of jobs for 3 month. I was desperate. That rent makes the most expensive rent I have ever paid. Even that, I am still grateful for bitcoin. Otherwise I would be homeless.

This made my day 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:30:54
1 year ago, I spent 2 bitcoins on my rent. Kept me stay from homeless. Hope this makes you feel better.
