I was doing some research on Flying BTC and there seem the be some articles claiming it is a scam, like :
People are saying it fits the profile a Ponzi scheme due to offering unrealistic returns. A 40% monthly return for life?? so that means if you gave them $100 they would give you back $40 every month forever. That would change the entire financial industry, if that isn't "too good to be true" then nothing is. 
It also says that the company started in 2013 but their domain was just registered in July of this year, that doesn't make any sense...
Also their address on the site is not a real address, it does not identify a  building it is just in the middle of the street next to an abandoned building. Which is supposedly their main office. 
Their mining location addresses don't look that great or verifiable either. Their phone number is from the UK where they don't seem to have any offices. Kind of strange not to have a number from any of their actual offices. 
The domain was registered with a Gmail address and doesn't provide any name and the street address was just: "chicago".
Their website is also full of typos, which is a huge warning sign. The design looks nice, but anybody can fill in a template.
Some people are already claiming they are having trouble drawing money. 
It's starting to sounds ultra sketchy, if you've invested you might want to considering trying to withdraw all your money and seeing what happens. I mean if it's legit and stable you can always re-buy.
