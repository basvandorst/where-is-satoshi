Hide that TV wire inside the wall, then, I'll ask you about bitcoin.

I found the transaction on Omniexplorer. I'm just trying to figure out how to transfer it back to BTC.

Think as if you just asked that question to a five year old. I saw it disappear from my binance account after the transaction and the rest was a wild goose chase, trying to track it down. Somebody well versed in "blockchains and tethers" might be a click away, but I'm an idiot when it comes to this stuff. Your knowledge of this field is lightyears beyond mine.

So, I still have the screenshot of the whole transaction. It includes the address and txid.
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:09:52
So, I found the Amount, Property, Sender and Recipient. If what I'm saying sounds like gibberish to you, just imagine how confused I am. I downloaded a tether wallet. Now, I'm just trying to figure out the process of finding this transaction.

I was trying to withdraw and convert the funds from BTC to USD. Somehow, I clicked on USDT, not USD. I'm the first to admit I have no business in the bitcoin world. It's confusing.

It was a year ago and I basically had no business even dicking around with bitcoin at the time. I was keeping it stupid simple with coinbase and doing simple transactions. Then, a guy I knew said to start using binance and then this shit happens.

I don't see anything about a private key. Let me search Binance to see if it's on there.

I get the feeling like the funds are gone forever and I just find it hard to believe. It's not a lot of money, but still. I feel like there must be a way.
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:04:33
But that's the thing, it's not in my account as my funds. It's like I sent them away. It's in my withdrawal history.

Not legit? Like I'm running some elaborate con to solicit help?? Dude, I'm a pretty straightforward person. If what I'm explaining sounds like gibberish, than it's safe to assume that I don't speak "Crypto". I'm sorry it sounds shady, but I did this over a year ago. I haven't even looked at the damn price of bitcoin since this happened. So, without actually showing someone my account, I'll probably be SOL.
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:18:08
Unfortunately, no. I messaged Binance support. I'll let you know how that turns out.
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:22:02
Please don't think I'm being a smartass towards you. I'm pissed at myself for being so ignorant about the ins and outs.
