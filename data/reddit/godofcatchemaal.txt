The "Big Bang theory" will be featuring BTC in an upcoming episode this week in order to pull in more "dumb" money into BTC to keep this ponzi scheme going. If the BTC price does not continue to rise... quickly... people will get nervous and there will be a big sell off.

Its hilarious to keep hearing people calling BTC decentralized when 95% of the hashing power comes from a handful of giant mining pools. It's so painfully obvious, an lluminati psy-op. They took control BTC by crashing MT. Gox and have been hiding in the shadows ever since. Do a little research on OCCULT SYMBOLISM and you will see all the same symbols being used by all the transnational corporations and almost all of these so called cryptocurrencies. Just look at all the hexagonal patterns and numerology ie: 666's in the logos of crypto... Count the dots in IOTA's logo it's so obvious... The "all seeing eye" is so pervasive in the logos along with pentagrams and "as above so below" everyone should watch Michael Tsarion's videos on occult logos. 
Do a little research... MT GOX = magic the gathering... same company that manufactures Pokemon trading cards... same company that manufactures "The New World Order Trading Card Game". That game correctly predicts all major geo-political events including the staged 9/11 attack on the WTC, pentagon and correctly predicted Trump president. The game was made in 1993... All of this is completely controlled whether you wanna realize it or not...
