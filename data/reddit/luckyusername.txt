You're absolutely right.

For how long exactly are they going to hold them? Why do you think they won't sell? Maybe periods when the price is dropping mad are needed to cleanse Bitcoin from hands that own it for wrong reasons. And I imagine them dumping their coins just as we've seen it done at 600$ recently with a huge sell order. If YOU think Bitcoin is going to fail because of it, certainly criminals aren't going to hold on to it too, they wouldn't wish to lose money, I imagine. I'm not sure about the scenario when criminals own 40% of Bitcoin and hoard it. You have to have certain beliefs to hold on to it when it's tanking. Is it better than politicians and leaders holding as much money and power as they hold? Is it better than when 1% of population is infinitely richer than all other people? I'm not sure about that.

Also, I'm pretty sure that Internet connection was down more often 13 years ago. The one I'm using now is much more stable than what was available back then. More downtime, much more downtime. So the fact that Bitcoin sometimes doesn't work flawlessly doesn't tell us that it isn't going to be better with time. Although I really understand that it sucks to have a bad experience.

We're assuming no more than you are assuming when you're signing your transaction with your private key. It is not based on assumption, it is based on fact, whether you have the right key or you don't. If you don't, then you can't send your coins, as simple as that. There's no ifs and buts. Either you have a key and you control your Bitcoin address, or you don't and your coins in it are gone forever. 
Yet somehow when we read news we're supposed to trust every piece of information to be 100% truth as if nobody ever concealed anything throughout the history of the world.

You can't have one that will magically solve Gox issue. Every new cryptocurrency will have the same potential problem, that you can't trust unregulated exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:35:23


I don't see how. This is just one shitty exchange that was having problems for *months* before this, it's so clear that it's just a publicity stunt by them. Just look at their freaking Facebook page. There's nothing going on there for months. Do they look like they even care? No. It's not like humanity didn't have any problems with banks or financial institutions.

People should stop being dumb and tie 3rd party payment processor ban news with recent news, because they are not related. Those are supposed to be banned long time ago. So by fitting them all together and by naming a post CHINA APRIL 15TH SUMMARY you're misleading everyone more than you're clarifying anything, because news were not about 3rd party payment processors banned, but about banks being banned from sending money to exchanges. These are *totally different things*. You should have just posted this:
"you can still deposit CNY directly through your bank or use BTCC Code to fund your account. CNY withdraws are not effected at this time."
"We have accounts with the banks listed below. Information from the branches of those banks is that they did not received any memo about Bitcoin in the last three months."
That's it. Biggest exchanges are the most important, not Bter and FXBTC.

@_date: 2014-03-01 00:05:10


Immaterial? You seem to be one of the few here who think that. It's important for some people to have more BTC, even though if you buy BTC for cheap, then at the same time you can only sell them for cheap too, most of the time.
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:38:49
Truly shocking would be if at least 40% of accounts (let's say with 2000$ or less, to counter a possible argument that more men just have more money) on coinbase.com would be owned by women. Like something is stopping them. Anything at all.
@_date: 2014-01-10 10:42:31


For how long one has to have 51% to do it, and how likely it is that miners won't disconnect from a pool in that time frame? To me it looks like it is unlikely, given that every miner risks his money if an attack succeeds.

Like Karpeles, right? Is he good at maintaining it? Is he succeeding?
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:00:42
Yep, good point. Solution is on seller's part to protect themselves better when selling expensive items. Also, I think it's possible to check block chain for signs of double spending before completing a sale.
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:54:43
I don't think that the possibility of double spending is going to kill Bitcoin. I might as well assume that it's possible and that it's going to happen. If those aren't going to be my coins double spent, I don't think it's such a tragedy, based on what I've read so far. To me it looks like miners switching from a pool is going to prevent any serious damage. I think one person double spending 1000 isn't serious. I'm not sure if it can be fixed/made harder by changing a protocol, but from what I know it is possible, and so far that's enough for my piece of mind.
No guarantees that alt-coins don't have weaknesses too. Everything has a weakness.

3rd party payment processor ban is not in any sense breaking. It was due January 31. Misleading title. At this point I'm wondering why wouldn't Chinese spread FUD when it's so profitable and people are so easily played.

"Reputable". Do you realize what reputable means, all things considered? Mt. Gox is/was a reputable exchange, and look what happened. Same shit is happening in journalism. 
Not saying that Reddit will not have bias and will not downvote something good, but if those titles are true  then Reddit is better, because  it is less biased.

Look at the price appreciation history of this thing. If this isn't enough of catalyst for you, then I don't know what is. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:56:56


It's perfectly clear. 
But most people don't now where the price is going. They don't know when to sell. Also, I'm interested, if there is a clear pattern to a price of Bitcoin, then why more people don't become rich by following it, knowing the right time to buy and sell?

That message is moronic. What was a person who wrote it thinking about?
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:28:28
Can't we simply have a software that looks at the block chain and checks whether the money from the same address was sent two times to different addresses? I'm thinking it should be easy for a seller to request it to look at the blockchain and see if the same address that sent them money wasn't sending it to someone else. I'm thinking it may be cheap and quick and automatic. No?
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:10:28


As a way for working around this possible weakness, how about waiting for 20 confirmations or more if an item being sold is very expensive, for example?
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:54:43
Gox don't answer media inquiries for similar reasons why Satoshi doesn't answer media inquiries, if you get what I mean. Similar, but not the same.

This is bullshit, unless you say what is your "good news" assessment is based on. Personal opinion cannot be based on nothing, and so far you sound just like Gox statement, of which we've seen many. If it's based on nothing, then it's useless.

Does it matter if you got lucky and your buy order of 1000 BTC for $1 suddenly went off, you just woke up, opened your exchange account without even looking at news, and 1000 BTC are there?
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:23:52
Finally, found an explanation that is satisfying. That's what I was thinking. This attack is overvalued. Even if somebody manages to double spend several thousand BTCs, in a grand scheme of things it's not going to make all BTC holders sell it and call it the end, just as people robbing a bank do not make people lose faith in a dollar. The most important thing is that other people's coins can't be spend and that coin can't be created out of thin air.

Yeah, and now women obviously don't have access to a bank account (requirement for buying BTC on coinbase.com or other exchanges). I guess they still can't psychologically recover from all that oppression from beginning of ape days. Got it.

This. Mark Karpeles, if he has 200 000 BTC, is an unbelievably greedy asshole and full of shit.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:56:23


I suppose it will only work while someone has the majority of hashing power. Once they have less than 51%, all those unconfirmed transactions will start to be confirmed, just later?


Even if someone double spends a million of coins (which they have to have first), will it be as serious as you make it sound? So what if some hackers using the Internet steal some credit card info or something? People don't suddenly decide that Internet isn't good anymore. Another example: Silk Road gets closed and their funds confiscated and nobody says that Bitcoin protocol lacks security if it was possible. I may be wrong (and I'm not even a programmer) but what if a couple of double spends aren't going to crash BTC to 0 necessarily? I think once it is known that some pool was related to serious double spending, most miners would disconnect from that pool overnight, leaving it with 10% of hashing power. 


How is it possible?
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:01:35


Judging by how fast Overstock and Tiger Direct jumped in, I think not. Of course, it has a long way to go, but I hope it will grow fast enough.

Well, you knew what the fees were and you knew buy and hold strategy exists for a reason. Why would you even trade if you knew that if you sell and then buy, you will lose on fees? I've lost some on fees myself, but I was dumb and I've learned my lesson. If you would just buy and hold, you wouldn't lose that much on fees.

Here's what I think happened: under pressure the man didn't even care what she thought he was referring to when he said "I'm no longer involved in that". He thought that it will stop the questions and that's why he said it. He wanted journalists to leave him alone.
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:35:14
Even thousands of BTC double spent (I don't get why would anyone do it if it's going to devalue coins they'll be trying to keep if a scenario of completely losing faith in BTC is real) isn't going to be the end or the Bitcoin. If someone steals a $10000000 (or whatever the currencty you use) from a bank, do you run to change your currency? No. Just because a currency isn't absolutely bullet proof in all situations, it doesn't mean it's not going to succeed. That's what I'm thinking. Most currencies can be easily destroyed. You can't double spend paper currencies, but it's possible to spend fake notes. In Bitcoin it's impossible to create a fake, but it's possible to double spend it.

Maybe you didn't want to see it, because it was convenient. Surely, you thought, a world's most popular exchange can't go to shits and if it does, surely somebody will reimburse me. I don't think anybody deserves to lose all their money, but it was foolish to have so much money there, that's for sure. People who had all their BTC there either risked knowingly or were clueless and didn't know what cold storage means. Everyone had to know that their money there wasn't insured, which means that yes, it was foolish no matter how you're going to spin it. 


It is possible to reduce risk by wiring money in portions, buying and then withdrawing BTC, and from that moment the risk is entirely managed by you, not by an exchange. 


What guarantees have you had before sending them BTC that they will deliver in time and that you can get your money back if they don't? I think you had to know that you've had no guarantees, hence you knew the risk and you took it. I wouldn't trust anyone that easily myself and I would be very careful to send BTC to anyone and would make sure it's a company that couldn't just disappear or not deliver. Companies like Overstock look like they can be trusted to at least give money back if they don't deliver, because if they don't, it would hurt them. Smaller companies look like they don't care as much. I think people who are too trusting are going to get robbed a lot in the coming years, as it's very easy to take money in BTC for anyone in the world, and very easy to disappear with them. So I'm guessing there will be a lot of scam sites selling various things and so on.

Sounds bad. Bitcoin.de don't require anything to buy or sell your first 4 btc or a certain amount in Euro. That's enough for your 3000 to invest, but if you want to do more or sell them afterwards, their identification process seems even more shitty. They require you to print a form, fill it and then mail it somewhere. Fuck that shit.

I don't question that it's going to happen. Only question is: how much is it going to matter. From where I'm sitting, bank closing down your account isn't exactly good way to appeal to customers.


I think it will only prove to people that banks are shit. If your bank closed down your account, would you be happy with your bank? It's not like they have a right to not give you your money back, they will have to explain why they did it. And when people start writing about it online, they'll have to get their shit together if they want to seem trustworthy. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:49:21
Really hope you're right. It can be extremely difficult psychologically to believe in something when you see absolutely opposing opinions like "BTC is going to be worth $40 000" and "OMG China's out it's crashing OMG SELL SELL SELL" and "finance expert: it's going to be worth $10 by middle of 2014".

If by divisible you mean that in time in can be made divisible even more, like up to 0.00000000000001.

I seriously don't understand how is it more convenient. When you create a wallet, if I understand correctly, you can only open it in a program that created it. A wallet is something one may not even need. All that is needed is a private key and a public key if you just want to store bitcoins.
The process of importing the private key. What is hard about it?
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:03:08


I agree. If a bank needs to freeze account every time they think it might not be a user using it, then their security sucks as it is. They should have such a security that they should know it's a user who is sending the money.

Sounds right. But then isn't there some trading knowledge that only experienced traders have? So far it seems to be that price indeed goes down at night (where I'm sitting).

He probably meant that he would like those early adopters to not get such a high reward, and that he doesn't see other incentives to buy or use bitcoins other than to get some free money. In other words, he doesn't understand why on earth early adopters become millioners and how such system can be liked by people.
So far the biggest problem I see in bitcoin is that so many coins will just be lost. Not sure if that's a very high percentage, but to me it looks like about 20% could be lost or made inaccessible because of various events. Maybe even more. I'd like to know if there's any way to do anything about it in the future.

Sad to hear this. Is your bank statement signed by a real person? In my bank they have monthly statements they sent out every month, but they also can sent out on demand"statement for transactions related to account for any given period of time. It gets signed, as opposed to usual statements, I guess, because I doubt they sign every one of those. I may be wrong though. If not, maybe you should try to request one of those.

How would the process of dividing bitcoins even more look like? How would bitcoin users go about making a decision like that?

Alt-coins seem like rip-offs with slight improvements to me. Haven't heard about any breakthroughs so far. Not that I'm looking.

Sounds like you are based US. I'm not sure if Europeans here share your opinion about fiat (Euro). Would be interested to know. Which price have you bought BTC at? I'm guessing you didn't buy for $900 or higher, based on how optimistic you are?

It assumes that this currency is only good for gambling.

I think speculators are helping to push Bitcoin forward. Most of the time, it seems like the people who bought in hopes of making some money are also the people who believe in value of Bitcoin for the long term.
