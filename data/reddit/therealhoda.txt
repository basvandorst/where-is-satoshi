What did Coinbase do to make you think this ? Besides some minor from tech issues and the potential insider trading that they detected themselves internally it’s been a pretty decent broker.  
They even said (long before crash ) people  need to be reasonable and responsible with investing.  It’s not in their short term best interests to say that but they did.

If you can’t explain the movement then it’s random. No one can explain the movements but that doesn’t prevent fools from trying.

If 1 btc = 1 million then a satoshi would be 1 cent USD.
Your numbers were off by a factor of 10

Ah , no.  That would be 1 million dollar bitcoin as the previous person stated. When 1 sat is equal to .01 USD, multiply .01 by number of sats in a bitcoin. You get 1 million to the dollar.

No it’s not analysis. Odds are 50/50 in the short run.  Longer term slight edge to longs. Don’t make this scientific because it’s not.  Random movement for random reasons - that’s all this is.

Care to explain what random means?

Market is never wrong. It’s worth what it is trading for not what you want it to trade for.
