One less way for them to get funding, though.
Maybe you'll donate paying $30 as fee?

A translation for non Hue-speaking people:
The bitcoin withdraw system has been modified. Transactions will now be processed per batch and per mined block. Added to SegWit support this will optimize bitcoin  withdrawals and will reduce the network fees in the near future(short run) .

Bitcoin Cash is a great alternative too. Your reaction is what should be questioned 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:25:58
I think you should post this. This sub is just mad
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:57
Sometimes this /r/ looks a lot like a bunch of conspiracy theorists. Every significant dip is now BCHs falt, but people fail to address the real issues that cause the network to be bloated.
I have both BTC and BCH and I would be happy if both thrive. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:22:10
I just paid 23$ @ Coinbase to transfer bitcoin to my wallet. I'm waiting for an hour for confirmation. This is absurd. This is not BCH guys fault. This is not the dream of low fees and fast transactions I believe and preach to my friends to this day. 
I would be much happier to see the community around bitcoin regain focus. What this guy does should not take that focus away from improving the and scaling BTC.

PayPal and Visa are basically used for common purchases. The way it was written implies Bitcoin is a match for them, but it's clearly not there (yet? Who knows if/when) 
@_date: 2018-06-28 04:01:31
I was running some tests with &lt; 0.001 btc. Maybe 20 tests, maybe a bit more. I had some of those routing issues.
It's all very new to me and information is scarce. I'm trying to understand LN to see if I'm even able to defend it or not. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:41:23
Very informative. Thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:43:10
Also, bitcoin is still unable to prove scalability. Even LN has to yet prove it can solve what is proposes to solve. December showed how little the network can support in global terms.
This was the "keep going"
Let's hope the technology can support the load of what it proposes to solve: to be money

Thank you for your reply.
I saw an article a couple months ago that showed some math to prove LN could not work well. A special problem would be channel degradation. It would need large funding for some channels to be useful as intermediaries without degrading too quickly.
Can you share any of your knowledge about this issue? As far as I could study, it's a serious problem. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:47:46
I don't know.. maybe 2 errors in more or less 30 tests.
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:28:22
Like real money? 
@_date: 2018-06-28 03:13:00
My head is spinning right now with all this complexity
It's like doing accounting just to accomplish the capacity os keep doing transactions... 
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:37:20
I get... Indeed, total privacy is a good thing.
I'm a developer myself. Everytime I want to understand some software I look at the numbers and, if needed, I build more metrics.
Using them, I apply the best of my skills and rational, scientific thinking to understand it.
If its not possible to open the LN hood and see the wrenches turning to tune it, is there any math to support its hipothetical capacity to handle numerous, micro transaction in the future? Maybe not now, but that it is at least feasible with more a more mature tech... If math says so, it oughta be true. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:56:42
Thank you for your time and politeness. I'll take a proper time to read more tomorrow.
It's very late down here already :D
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:30:51
Please downvote this math
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:54:30
Woww... I was way out of my way there. It's even worse.
 Thank you.
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:15:55
Thank you for the kind reply.
If it's impossible to get numbers about how effective the network is, do you have any ideia about what the devs could use to track effectiveness?

@_date: 2018-06-28 18:59:36
At least we hope. If it fails we are in trouble
@_date: 2018-06-28 03:32:04
Hummmm now it makes more sense and I can understand your first answer better. Thanks for the effort.
Is the channel limit set by the initial funding? 
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:57:47
When people first told me about bitcoin they would say it was "digital money" or "internet money"....
We are certainly not there with this kind of attitude. Spend and replace is better.
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:19:55
Indeed. I took it wrong. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:04:21
What is there to celebrate here? It was a single transaction.
If that amount is moved in small, 10 dollars transactions (the kind we do all the time and Visa can handle) the network would certainly feel it.
~~300mi / 7 tps = more than 11 hours of 10 USD transactions~~. (please see u/fullheap 's answer. My math is crap)
(please point out if this math is sound, but this celebration is very misleading, like it can already beat Visa)
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:03:14
Can you tell / have any info about what standards are aimed by this tech? I find it all too confusing to judge with people acting like children in many threads. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:20:43
I just love this one! Can someone point me out to the original movie/video it came from? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:28:54
It is known 
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:05:36


Are you aware of some roadmap for that?
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:13:05
At the same time, if LN proves to be a mistake, the consequences for adoption are going to be even worse than, let's say, the size of the block was a little bigger now and LN comes later on top of it.  
I never fully understood the black-and-white point. Even if you take the premisse that you can't raise the block size forever, the fact is that we can raise a bit now and accommodate this historic moment: that people were interested in what bitcoin is and how to use it. After the blow of $50 fees last year adoption took a major blow. That is undeniable with many big companies dropping btc adoption.
If we can't raise the block size forever, it's all good. We now would have a bit more time to implement 2nd and even higher layers on top of the chain to handle more and more txs being made. And that with more USERS and COMPANIES actually using it.
One solution could go for the short term and the other for long term. We don't need to raise the block size to a wooping 1Gb right away, but we need high, proper adoption as soon as possible. I want to purchase my coffee with BTC, even if with a slightly bigger block now and LN next year.
