I'm being completely serious, which sub are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-02-17 19:26:52
If you look at his reddit board it literally is constructed like a cult. 
I'm still waiting to see something positive relating to BTC from him. There have been a lot of promises and I was really disappointed with this Dodd Frank EO, it was essentially all fluff. That has been the theme with him, all fluff with no real effort put in getting things done. Everything is for a fight and camera time.
I mentioned that to one of his cult members and it was met with their typical "Stop watching cnn it's biased, watch fox news dummy!"

Dude you have dragged this off topic. You asked specifically for sources. What exactly am I suppose to do when you ask me to list sources to back up my assertion? Am I going to find a quote of him saying "I hope to use my ability from decades of 'winning deals', to promise the American people things that I know I can not deliver on each and every one of" ?? 
For someone being so pedantic you're boxing yourself in more and more.
Additionally, if you look at this "successes" you will find similar comments and sentiment. 




Do **you** know how he feels personally about anything? How would you be any more right than I am? I provided direct quotes showing that he expressed no sympathy for people who lost a lot of money in relation to a business dealing with him. But as a second point, why are you taking one line out of context to my general point? You're being super petty, which I deal with a




You're not even making sense. I commented that it seems like bullshit (as in the birth certificate thing), I'm not talking about Joe Arepadios specific take on it you posted. And I actually have looked at it before, I didnt see anything convincing and since then even Trump has at least stated that he does not believe the birth certificate is fake in effort of hiding Obamas heritage. 
Besides, I can find a video right now claiming that 9/11 or the holocaust was a hoax, what point are you proving by posting an extremely biased take on it? And I'm not talking huff post/breitbart biased, I'm talking about a guy that has a very long and very well documented personal vendetta against Obama. My "sources" were all at least mainstream publications, I could easily find a Michael Moore article about Trump saying all types of crazy shit but what's the point? **What does barrack obama have to do whatsoever with the original point of me believe trump is a fluffer with things he claims.** I never mentioned Barrack Obama, you dragged him into this for some apparent reason. I will repeat this over and over, for someone who just discovered the phrase 'strawman' your entire response is riddled with them. Please explain what this post and my initial or subsequent responses have to do with Barrack Obama?




Notice how I put "america less safe" in quotes. And if you for once read the entire context of the statement you can understand what that means. I was saying its not as black and white that trump will have a heavy push for it because one could make the argument that it makes "america less safe" as it leaves a blind spot to "terrorist financing" that so many of our financial laws seem to be beholden to. I am not backpeddaling one bit, again you're using your strawman or tinman or whatever you decide to call it, my point was in no means personally attributing btc to terror. Just humor me and read this explanation then read the original comment and tell me you honestly don't understand what it is I'm saying.




You aren't even trying anymore. For someone who loves using the phrase strawman you've back to back used one for me. I in no way said Bitcoin funds terrorism. Go ahead and google AML, and once you do you'll realize what I'm saying. "I know first hand most things all circle back to AML and terrorism financing" as in anything that involves money in this country does. It's not that hard to read and understand what I'm saying but you're making a strawman argument that I'm for some reason anti bitcoin because I fear it'll be used to fund terrorism. The point is very simple. Financial regulations in this country are currently beholden to the boogeyman of terrorism financing and money laundering. 
My point is that for all the positives of bitcoin, even someone like Trump may balk at full adoption because of this boogeyman. And why did I put forth that this point (the whole thing not you taking it out of context) ?? Well because my point is that even if he does deliver in returning the power to te people, there are mitigating factors such as his strong interest in national security, which could complicate things. How do I personally know this? Hmm, could be the years in law and finance I have where I see this stuff behind the closed doors. 
Again, just read what I'm saying for once instead of trying to take every single line with no context to it to argue with for the sake of arguing.




How is this a strawman? I said "i doubt" as in my opinion. And for the millionith time, you're taking one sentence out of my general point to nitpick at it. When I said I doubt he has a personal interest it was to the larger point that if he does not have a deep interest in it, its impossible to plainly attribute how he'll act on it. And for someone saying "read my original point" you sure love to drag this off topic considering I have at no time indicated that I don't think he will make moves on it.


You end with something entirely off topic. Did I ever advocate or imply that he needed to be a career politician? Did I ever say career polticians are better than him? Did I ever imply that institutional and washington insiders are needed and those without that are not to be trusted? Did I ever say that my criticism of him is because he is not a typical politician? Did I ever imply because he is a republican he is inherently not as good? Did I ever say that Hilary or Barrack are better because they're democrats and lifelong politicians? Nope, I was referring to him specifically as a person, the rest of that is you projecting that being critical of him means I'm a brainwashed liberal.
I'm in airports for the next few hours so please feel free to grab half of one sentence and respond to it with a full paragraph to try and make your point. In the words of your boy, 'you dont have the stamina', I do this for a living.
@_date: 2017-02-03 02:45:52
Owes people something more than opportunity? No not at all, im talking about some of his failed business ventures where he misled developers, investors, and regulatory officials. There are numerous first hand accounts of him screwing over tiny contractors, and most blatantly his scam of Trump University. Stop acting like he's infallible even if you support him, youre being as dishonest as he is when he calls all non conservative media "fake news". 
I do agree he is a job creator, but this blind faith in a guy who has made a living of bragging about manipulating people is pretty quality stuff.
@_date: 2017-02-03 14:00:41




Well when I stated that he has a long, factually backed up, and even first-hand confirming history of making bold statements with little to no intention of delivering on them. He all of a sudden turned into robin hood when he started putting his name out in public? Do you really think for 4 years he thought Obama wasn't born in the US, or rather was he saying that to rile up his base? We don't even need to get into tit-for-tat politics but I said it was rich to take him at face value when he says he's acting for "the people"


You made the strawman argument that I was implying he owes me or anyone else more than opportunity, my statement was in response to your assertion. I replied by stating that over the course of his life he has shown that he has repeatedly made promises while promoting things when it turns out he was only acting in his best interest while puffing his intentions. Call it infallible or call it lacking healthy skepticism.




Maybe blind faith wasnt the perfect phrase, but again I'm dealing in his actual tangible history. I'm not saying he has only done bad things and is unfit to lead, I'm saying he has written a book about manipulating people and has bragged and done such over the course of decades. So when you say "seems to fit his stated agenda" I found that humorous considering his actual history and his tangible actions, not a new found altruistic message he happened to adopt 4 years ago. 
In fact my post wasn't even disagreeing that there won't be a probitcoin agenda, I found that statement rich. I am pretty sure he doesn't really understand the area, as he calls stuff "cyber" but you are right that the people around him are for it. On the otherhand, pushing for a probitcoin agenda without the regulations this board hates also makes "America less safe" so its not as simple as pushing the extreme that he will enable it because he is for the people.
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:07:27
You're going so far off-topic to my original point. I'm at the airport for a lovely work trip so I have a second to type this out. As I know about these in general, let me do some googling to provide the sources you want. 


Citations please.
Ok, here we go:
When before a NJ commission, trying to sell his idea to get approval to build, [Trump said, under oath, banks were willing to give him loans at 9 percent interest or less, “prime rates” far below what other developers could hope for.](
“I also, as I said before, don’t have to use junk bonds. I can use my own funds or I can use regular bank borrowings, so I can build at the prime rate,” he told the commission....*
*...I’m telling you that whether it’s General Motors or Procter &amp; Gamble, or any other company, if they have to go out and get junk bonds to do their borrowings, they are not a strong company,” he said. “They make them junk. So it’s like a self-fulfilling prophecy almost.”*
Funny because he then financed the casino almost exclusively through junk bonds.
At that same hearing he said: *"“It’s easier to finance if Donald Trump owns it,” he said. “With me, they know there’s a certainty they would get their interest.”*
Trump said he held another appeal for bankers: *“I get it done, and everybody is happy and it turns out successfully,” he said."*
Is that so? Sounds like puffery to me. He missed his very first bond payment and had to have his father illegally “lose” $3million in his casino in an attempt to loan him $3million untaxable.


Let's see. On my entire theme of him acting in accordance with his history, good **and bad**, lets look at some of his failures that show a track record to me where you can easily say he's full of shit, or you can look at the other items and see the glass half full. 
He did indeed create jobs in Atlantic City. That I agreed on, its indisputable he is a job creator. He was seen very favorably temporarily, but, he traded the short term win and puffery and caused far more pain in the end.
In fact he [even brags about his time in Atlantic City]( as if him doing well was not at the direct expense of others. 
If you look at the opening back at the end of the 80s and the 90s, he promised a lot and when he picked over these assets it was all in his self interest before its ultimate bankruptcy only 7 years ago. In fact, the workers lost their pensions and health benefits they agreed upon up front when Carl Ichan raided these casinos. So when DT promised so much and created these jobs, he failed, made out with some money and left his old employees to languish while Ichan lowered their benefits **after the fact**. 
So again, I'm dealing in tangible items. I'm not saying he wont do anything with bitcoin, I'm saying he has a long history of bullshitting. And this isnt all just stuff in the 80s and early 90s, it has continued with people feeling the repercussions even until BO's presidency.
"Bill Gamble, a carpet installer from Atlantic City, said he had to go to court after one Trump casino shorted him about $22,000.
["He's a real conniver," Gamble said. "He's ruthless."](
[He puffed the Taj Mahal as the 8th wonder of the world, and when the go to analyst questioned him, he got the guy fired and threatened to sue-does this bullying sound familiar?]( And guess what? The analyst was 100% dead on and Trump missed his very first bond payment. 
So does he feel bad that "the people" got screwed over while he used bankruptcy laws to benefit himself and leave a worthless dead carcass for investors? Who are those investors? I would imagine they are US citizens that he cares so deeply for:
[Trump, ever defiant, makes no apology. "That's part of the process," he told CBS MoneyWatch, conceding that bankruptcy has real consequences for small businesses and other unsecured creditors. "I wanted to use the bankruptcy law to my own advantage. Should I have used it to somebody else's advantage? These people may have gotten clipped at the end](
Or how about the more recent Mexican resort and two Florida projects? This was not directly his project, but only 8 years ago he licensed his name to three bad deals, and then when the deals went bad he claims he is not involved and is not liable. While I agree with the courts ruling, he takes credit and admiration for other projects where his name is licensed but has a similarly loose connection. These are all within the past decade but years apart. For someone who cares so much about the people he sure seemed to have no problem licensing his name to bad projects which resulted in people losing tens of millions of dollars from placing condo deposits. 
These are not clear black and white and I don’t think he actually had malicious intent, but within the past decade he was completely fine with profiting off of shitty investments and showed little to no remorse for hundreds of American citizens who lost their money. He doesn't "owe" them anything I agree, people investing a lot of money should be responsible. But I am again reiterating a long and demonstrated history of having no problem conniving people for his own benefit. Of course he won't have the skeletons of someone like Hilary Clinton, she was an awful candidate, but she's also been in the public office for 30-40 years. DT has been able to somewhat shield himself, so the information we do have you can see whats there.




Honestly this all looks like bullshit to me, but I don’t know enough to really comment. I will just notice that citing a video from Joe Aripado for something that many other of BO own intense adversaries admit is unmerited is dubious at best.




This isn’t my opinion I actually think its bullshit. But all the AML complications that are currently holding Bitcoin back in the US stem from terror financing. There isn’t some deep desire from republicans and democrats alike to make things as difficult as possible, but I know first hand most things all circle back to AML and terrorism financing. With bitcoin those two areas are more or less completely and entirely unguarded for. This is not my argument, I was merely pointing out that this isn’t black and white for Trump as there are mitigating factors.


You're projecting what we both agree is the benefit of bitcoin and picking and choosing how you can attribute statements made by Trump. I initially didn’t even reject the idea that he is for it. However, for a person who calls stuff ‘cyber” I doubt he has too much of a personal interest in it and the whole “returning the power to the people” is as general as a liberal saying Obama will ensure no prescription drugs are overpriced since he is against big pharma and for public health.

Maybe that came out wrong, but what I'm saying is if "fiat" becomes illegal and bitcoin is adopted like we're all hoping for, it will be transformed into fiat. We're not going to go back to gold, so something is in line to be replace "fiat" as we call it.
My point is that its not fiat that is the problem, its the people controlling it.

These assets are peoples homes, businesses, pensions, etc. It is equally as not-fair to use this to assess their holdings in terms of a fine. I'm actually in favor of more criminal action as opposed to monetary punishment. You know why? Because this money is recouped by screwing over working accountants, tellers, mortgage brokers etc and does not deter because the people at the top arent held accountable. 






That's what the penalties should do, they need to make the victim whole and punish the actual wrongdoers, not reduce share price and cause a reduction of employee benefits.

The Fed is a central bank. There is a central bank in practically every nation outside of North Korea.
This whole "audit the fed" to me sounds a lot like "abolish the fed" because there all they will find is shady stuff that will justify getting rid of it. 
I mean lets take this one step further, we audit it and there are misdeeds. I surely don't want that to be the case, but once we find that out what do we do? We make more things more public? 
Then again I get back to my point that this line of thinking gets down the path of contradicting the very advantage and fundamental  principle of The Fed. This isnt an endorsement of The Fed currently but that statement is short sighted and only used by DT for personal gain only.

Can someone explain a simple and basic process that happens.
1. Let's say I buy 10 bitcoin on coinbase and move it to an exchange (thus a sale as stated here)
2. I moved it before brexit and sell at the peak and bring back 15 bitcoins.
3. Of those 15 bitcoins I sell to coinbase and cash out 10 of them and keep 5 bitcoins in my coinbase wallet.
What is the tax liability according to this logic? (ignore the exchange part and tax implications from using one, its just a random example).
Is that 20 bitcoin since I moved some out then brought back more and sold them? Is that only 10? Do I come in at a net even?
