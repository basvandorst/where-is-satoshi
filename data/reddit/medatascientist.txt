Genuine question: What edge do you think You have over the rest of the humanity so you can escape the “long route” of financial independence?
Is knowing about Bitcoin in this day and age the “edge” because I would say, though it is not mainstream it is not so well hidden either. Early coiners took a huge risk on sth that had plenty of unknowns, while today Bitcoin is a platform that has proved itself that it can stay alive, thus is much less riskier. You only get huge returns if your risk allocation is also huge, otherwise everyone else would get rich too.
If you think 20 years is too long of a time frame for retirement I have sad news for you, with current risk portfolio I doubt that Bitcoin will go 100-1000x in 5 years. Why should it? I think it will over perform compared to traditional investment assets since it is still riskier compared to them but it won’t take you to Moon, unless you personally enlarge your risk rate and put everything you own on it (which imho is a terrible idea).

Yes there are counter arguments: you need to go deep down and understand in what conditions stock-to-flow is applicable.
Ie if tomorrow I forked Bitcoin code to Spitcoin, it’s SF ratio would be the same, but it wouldn’t be worth a dime. So why does SF apply to Bitcoin but not Spitcoin? That is because in order for SF to work there has to be demand. This is the elephant in the room nobody talks about.
For Gold you historically had no alternative with the same SF ratio, therefore any demand for store of value used to be parked there. Likewise for silver but with weaker SF ratio. They did not have much competition (platinum or palladium doesn’t really count).
For bitcoin however we do not know if this assumption will hold yet. It is indeed scarce, but will it be demanded the same way or will a competitor with same or stronger SF ratio take over?
so far it looks like Bitcoin is the king and takes the lions share of the demand, but we do not know if this will hold: and that my friend is the counter argument.

Well in practice it is probably not going to cover your small expenses. For instance online shopping was a taxable event for years before 2010, yet almost nobody reported their purchases from Amazon. It only became a thing once state forced the e-commerce sites to charge you for it.

That would have been true if buying bitcoin was not heavily reliant on the bank transfers. Localbitcoins/Bisq/ATMs and such and not very prevalent, most people buy and sell through KYC exchanges that has the money funneled in and out of bank deposits.
So I am not sure as it stands it is a better way to transfer yet. Once I am able turn my Bitcoin into stocks and stocks into bitcoin, and I can buy the house/car I want with Bitcoin without first turning it into fiat which is deposited into my bank, I will believe Bitcoin is a better alternative.

Doing shuffle is not without risks btw so I would prefer it not being default. After all you might be tainting your coins with the ones used in illegal activities.

The only way to get rich using few bucks is buying lottery tickets, however this should not stop you from keep investing your money somehow.
If you have 10k to spare for Bitcoin, assuming you are only putting money you can afford, it means you have more than 100k in other non-volatile assets so you are already in the top 1% of the world. You don’t need Bitcoin to get “rich” in that case you simply keep your head down, work 30 years and you can retire.

You do realize that HPI has no inflation adjustment built in, right? It is calculated by the dollar value of resale of same property, and guess what,  in order to resell your house you have to spend time, during which US dollars will lose value. So it is perfectly reasonable for HPI to keep rising as USD loses value, because everything else does too!
Apart from big 2008 swing look at the last 4 decades, despite every recession HPI still rose. The only reason why 2008 is an exception is because it was a mortgage based crisis.

Well 3150 was a instantaneous dip, so I don’t know if that would constitute since it didn’t hold and went back up almost immediately.
Think of it like this: if today price was to dip to $2000, then tomorrow went back to $3000, by the same calculation we could say there is 50% appreciation so can we call it a Bull Market? I don’t think anyone would.
On the counter side of this view we have been holding 3600-4000 level for many months now, so if it reaches 4700+ and holds there people would probably consider that as a bull market.
Just my two cents.

I hate Tether for other reasons, but honestly USD is fractional reserve too, so by this logic any existing asset denominated by USD is inflated. 
Case in point: margin trading, which is done on a loan on dollars that do not exist since they are loaned through a bank that operates on fractional reserve. Should we say stock market is also inflated in this case?
Case in point: housing. Most people in US buys their house using mortgage, which is a loan from banks ... and so on.

Aren’t they providing a service by creating a marketplace for these orders to take place? Why do you think someone who exchanges 250 bitcoins per day deserves all the profit s/he makes without paying the platform that allows it. You cannot execute these levels of orders in Bisq or Localbitcoins for a reason: because there is no liquidity with stability. Clearly they built this platform to make money so I don’t see why what they are doing is considered unethical.
This is free market so people are free to move their bitcoins and do their day trading on any other platform, it is not like they are preventing the day traders from it.

Not necessarily true. Currently USD is a major reserve currency in most developed world central banks. If we print money unreasonably it would make the currency unstable and thus can lead for people to drop this status quo, which in return would hurt the US even more. The extreme example of this is post WWI Germany, where they were in incredible debt and started printing to pay it off, which at some point made other countries not accepting their currency since it became worthless.

Yeah X can be any number to be honest. I meant 1 year because usually if you have lump sum and decided to invest it over DCA you likely won’t do it over a year no matter what asset you are buying. Usual term for index funds is 6-12 months. Regardless, let me see if I can put it together, I just need a history of closing prices, shouldn’t be too hard to obtain.
Edit: seems like coindesk has this api.
Edit2: finished the analysis. The code is here in case you want to double check: 
For 1 year $1 everyday total of $365:
- DCA final owned amount is 0.065 bitcoins
- over 365 days 197 of them lump sum under performs while 168 of them it overperforms
For 2 years $1 a day total of $730:
- DCA final owner d amount is 0.11 bitcoins
- over 730 days lumpsum underperforms 430 days and oveerperforms 300 days.
So it seems like for both ranges DCA is slightly more advantageous.
Next we can look at how big of a variance we can expect these over/under performances are but that is for another day

Well what you are doing (earliest) will of course make lump sum outperform as historically Bitcoin is rising over long term. We don’t even need a simulation for it.
The point of my script was to figure out the impact of actual single day purchase over variance reduction. 
What we can do is perhaps meet the halfway, where variance reduction is still enabled but opportunity cost is minimized: ie shorter term DCA (like 45 days) while keeping the “earliest day” rule you have. This actually sounds like a legitimate strategy.
As for your last paragraph, that is what I was hinting when I said that is the next step, and I think a weighted approach like that would be more useful.

There are very few places on earth where no strings attached $4m cannot buy you your financial freedom for life. Assuming %25 long term capital gains tax that means if you have 520 or above Bitcoins today you are set for life.
Anybody who has this amount and more yet is still HODL’ing are the true believers, since they are clearly not in this for cashing out. Anybody else who thinks they are Hodl’ers are going to be subjected to a harsh test sooner or later and some will sell out for sure ^_^.

There is an easy way to conclude this argument: simulate! Assuming we have enough to DCA over X days (say 365) we can look at what it would result in if you bought every day and see how many of the said days would outperform that entry point vs how many underperform, since that is precisely the variance issue.

It depends on what emergency fund should be covering and what you might expect in the near future.
Ie if a major accident happens would you be able to borrow from relatives within few weeks? If you lose your job would you be able to survive until you find your next? ... if you do not think so then you should always keep the emergency fund as reliable as possible.
Bitcoin is volatile, so sure you can make money but there is no direct time frame. It can go sideways for 2 years (which is ok in your case), yet nobody can guarantee you it won’t go below $2000. Will you be ok with liquidating your funds at half the price you paid to pay for an emergency? 
In general having emergency fund is more important than “missing the train”.

Much like this but it is not exactly pegged to USD, so technically it can go up.
According to whitepaper when you buy Libra they use that money to buy safe investments (ie US treasuries bonds, TIPS etc) and Libras value is the total size of assets which might make it slightly more valuable or slightly less valuable (if they buy junk bonds that cannot payoff).

First, you don’t have to buy at the bottom to profit. In fact almost nobody buys at the bottom and profit apart from few lucky folks. Question is whether it will be worth more in the future or not. In the investment world, 7% year over year appreciation is considered good, translating to doubling in 10 years. Bitcoin is riskier so it has to justify doubling in a shorter period but it it goes above 8k in the next 5 years or so it would already be considered a great investment for many. It doesn’t have to reach to 80K.
Above is for people who just want to make money. There are lots of people who are buying bitcoin for greater purposes.

Well, the sub has over a million subscriber, some of which have hundreds of coins, so I think you are right, since otherwise we would have over a million coins here alone, which is currently over 6% of circulation.

Sure but why should they stay the same in sat/byte? Fee structure is like getting a spot in the rank, you only pay higher to get ahead of anyone paying lower. Say if you are OK being in top 3000 transactions and Mempool has 63000 you pick the sat/byte amount to beat bottom 60000. Today that can be 15 sat/byte or 150, all depends on what others picked. If Bitcoin rose 10x, most of the transactions might be picking 2 or 3 sat per byte so 5 sat/byte might beat the top 60000.
TLDR; sat/byte impact is not static

Well highest cap is 20%. You can optimize it to keep it lower but in the event of fully cashing out like I mentioned most of the income gain will be taxed on 20%, and when you include the state taxes 25% is a realistic average.
Problem with cashing out little by little every year is that in the unlikely event of Bitcoin tanking the executor would not be able to keep his/her financial freedom, thus paying extra taxes and making sure is the safer approach.
Yes you are right that moving to Florida or Seattle or overseas might be ideal but I was making this assertion under the assumption that the executor does not have to make any changes in living conditions. Otherwise you can be financially independent with $600,000k in Nepal for instance.

This is not entirely true. The negative interest rates indeed make people put their money into investments to pump the economy, but by pulling their money out of the banks they literally lower the amount of available loans banks can give without exceeding their reserve ratio. I.e if reserve ratio is 0.1, a bank that has $100 billion in deposits can loan out up to $1 trillion to businesses etc. if half that money is pulled out, the available credit goes down to $500 billion. Without those loans many companies cannot thrive which in turn hurts the economy further.

Anything above %7 *consistently* after taxes is crazy good imho. It just means doubling your money every 10 years. It also means you consistently beat S&amp;P 509, which is not an easy feat. If S&amp;P keeps going like this (avg %7 after taxes) for another 30 years I would be a very happy grandpa.
%22? Insane! It means you will have 7 times the money you invested originally in 10 years. 
To put it into context for normal folks like us assuming we need to save 25x our annual expenses and assuming we can save %20 of our our annual expense per year it takes decades to be able to retire in peace. With %22 though you can easily retire when you are 40 without a worry.

Well it is not just what your bank is collecting from you though.
Say I’m a grocery store owner. Every time a customer buys with credit card I have to pay a portion to the bank. How do I make sure I stay afloat? I basically sell my stuff a bit more expensive then I would have otherwise to cover for it. Thus, as my customer you are indirectly paying for the cc transaction.
That being said unlike most people here I do not see a widespread adoption of btc like credit cards so this conversation is all hypothetical in my mind.

@_date: 2018-11-28 18:05:30
Correct me if I’m wrong but as long as some portion of it that is enough for short time liquidity changes hand, why should it matter what percentage is hoarded or not. Ie it is estimated over a million btc is totally lost (even worse than hoarding) but since supply is already meeting the demand it does not make any impact on the transaction quality. Even if 10M Bitcoin was lost immediately today, transaction volume of the rest would be enough to keep btc as a non fiat alternative payment network. On top of that we have tens of thousands of coins mined per day for the foreseeable future, and Clearly not everybody is going to hoard.
Am I missing something here? Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:27:12
Firstly, we are all adults here let us not lower ourselves to ad hominem.
Secondly, I do not know how far it would go down. It could reach $3200 and I might own 2 BTC or it might bounce back from $3500 to $4500 and I might miss my window to buy the first one. It is basically averaging the cost on risk and supply at a price I’m comfortable at. I’m comfortable below $3800 because I feel like most miners not being able to profit at this price would be a pressure in general in the long run. That being said I am not delusional to think it won’t go further down so I am taking a position.
Also for your comment on owning only few. Everything has risk factor in it. I.e. Even if sth is %98 likely to go up %5, you should not put all your life savings in it, because there is %2 risk you lose everything. I believe in bitcoin, but I won’t risk the future of my child on a belief that might just be proven wrong at one point. Thus I invest my excess savings to it. That happens to be 1 btc for me, maybe I’m not as rich as you. Frankly I do not care.
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:20:21
What you are saying is not contradicting what I am saying. 
As long as some amount of it keeps changing hand for transactional purposes which meets daily/weekly/monthly volumes you do not need the whole thing to be actively used. Do you think all printed US dollars change hand everyday? Does that make it fail as a currency for transactional purposes?
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:11:50
Nope. Just bought 1 BTC and cannot wait for it to fall further so I can buy more. Have been keeping about 12K liquid waiting for this. Next time I will buy it if it hits 3200, then lower and lower until I use up all 12K.

I do. That is why I’m not worried about the price and thinking of it for the long term. My main reason of buying is because I see it as an alternative tot he current world order and if people start challenging it as masses btc is the best tool for it.
That being said my 2 btc won’t make that much difference to be honest. I plan to reserve a percentage of my excess income to buy it every month. I might lose money on the way for quite some time and am prepared for that.

But that is rarely relevant for most sizable altcoins. I can buy Ethereum with USD just as easily without needing Bitcoin as an intermediate. Same for LtC, ZRX, BAT, ZEC,, MANA, LOOM, GNT, DAI etc etc
Even if that’s were not to be the case it means one simply hold bitcoin for a very short amount of time just for the sake of conversion so I do not see its’ impact on the actual value of bitcoin.

Well most people do not keep their excess cash in checking/savings account either and convert it into something (preferably liquid) that can keep its value and perhaps further appreciate. Same can be said for Bitcoin too, though it has higher variance. It is technically not so different than converting your money into something that you hope would overperform cash (which has a 2% inflation rate average for USD). Whether you choose Bitcoin or stocks or CDs all depend on your risk tolerance and your expected rewards.

Not exactly. You do not buy a diversified portfolio of coins when you put in an order of 1 bitcoin. You simply get 1 btcoin. Saying otherwise is equivalent of saying existing of Silver is inflating the Gold. They are different commodities.
Sure there is a limited supply of money in the world but if you cut out all the silver from the world today magically it wouldn’t necessarily impact price of gold significantly.
What the comment above is suggesting when an alloy is made fraudulently, meaning trying to pass silver as gold.
All of that being said i hate Bitcoin/Gold comparisons. They simply are very very different, people should stop trying to relate them to each other.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:56:03
Well that puts it around 1.8 trillion dollars, which should suggest that it is only feasible with worldwide adoption of at least %10, preferably little more on the Western world.
So if 1 in 10 people start using/collecting bitcoin seriously (not keeping few tokens here and there) it is a possibility. But we should ask ourselves why such adoption would happen? The way it is right now I don’t see such demand, so bitcoin community needs to work hard and make it better and more accessible to achieve this goal.

And they have been proven correct 9 out of last 10 years. If (a big if) bitcoin reaches 20K in 2020 they will end up being correct about it during 2018 too.

You misunderstand my comment. They said HODL, it’s gonna be worth more. They said that in 2013 as much as 2014 or 2016. At the end we ended up higher so they ended up being right. 
Now we question what they said in 2018, and time will tell but if price rises above 20k then their suggestion will be proven right again.
One does not have to predict the exact pattern in a year to be right about “it will be higher in the future”, only has to be right that at some point it will surpass the value the suggestion is made. This is why making HODL prediction is relatively easier until the last big bubble, and if 2017 was not that then they will be proven right again.

I have zero bias on this topic. I am stating mere mathematical facts. 
Today I can give you 1 million people who have zero prediction record in the past with a wide range of predictions of bitcoin price for end of 2019, and eventually when one of them ends up being correct, which it will, I can simply state the winning prediction. It is that simple. This is called survivorship bias.
The only thing that gives the predictions’ correctness some credibility is the repeated success of its’ source, suggesting it is not a mere guess but has some underlying assumptions being correct. This is what the success rate is. the longer the track record is, more reliable your trust into prediction can be.
Unless you believe everything is ‘I.I.D’, which in this case is not this fact holds the ground.  Similar to my plumber example, those who have a long track record of successful prediction thus suggest that they are basing their assumptions on some underlying correlated factors that impact the end result. This can be the plumbers skill and knowledge, or the market predictors understanding of larger market factors. It doesn’t matter what it is.
Now tell me oh please tell me what my bias is, because all I am saying is this.

Not sure why you are butthurt buddy.
1. I am saying predictions without long track records are meaningless. You can have 1 million people predict 1 million different values and one will be right. And say only way to give credit to predictions is if it is consistently done well by the same individual (thus track record)
1.response. You respond with a memorized blatant phrase as past performance is not relevant.
2. Responding you I prove you that past performance has impact on future provided it relies on context (ie skill, knowledge about the subject etc)
2.response. You try to attack me individually even though I made no indication that I predict stuff or that I have a track record let alone showing any interest in the field.
I think you need to first address on your biases before teaching me how my thought process is wrong.

At most 18 million people can own a single bitcoin in today’s standards. Frankly much much less because of the whales who own thousands and early investors who have 50+ as well as all the lost coins.
Unless whales and earlies decide to sell in mass quantities I don’t see most commonfolk owning a single bitcoin.there are over a billion people in the western developed world alone, and at most 1.5-2% of them can be in that status. It just seems like an unreasonable goal to me.

Ok let’s walkthrough your points, year is 2005 and Facebook is at its’ infancy. I decide to value it because:
1. Human capital invested in its use and success, like the Harvard dropout or all the smart engineer he hired and our day and night of effort into the platform
2. Actual users: the tiny amount of university students who simply use it for silly and insignificant reasons
3. It’s pretty. Actually I am saying the beautiful in a design point of view, so a network where people share stuff on each other in a semi-private point of view (unlike MySpace)
All three points you make are valid, but as an investor it is not stupid for me to see value for this product either just like Peter Thiel even buying at idea stage, which is much earlier than the point I am referring to here.

Though you are correct, GDP is not necessarily an ever growing metric.

I can ask why you don’t see value in it.
It is still what it used to be prior to 2017 hype. There are still people using it, albeit not as a main source of transactions. There are many uses of it where traditional banking system is inferior to (ie moving money internationally on third world countries). 
Sure it was used as a ‘castle in the sky’ scam to pump the price, but honestly I was willing to buy it back in 2016 if I had the excess cash, and all those reasons are still true today. Why should I base my decision on what happened during 2017-2018? If anything most news on bitcoin were progressive even though it did not justify the valuation.
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:52:51
Really nice. Not because correct price predictions since that is bound to happen at least once among thousands of predictions, but because how you read the flow and predicted the stages.

The thing. Is bitcoin always gave enough time window for people to recollect their coins after a successful sell off. Sure they could have sold when it went to $300 but then bought back again the same amount if not more when it repressed back to $150. Only ones who could not do it is the ones who sold at the bottom of any of the last 4 exponential rises.
This is why there are still plenty of people with 1000+ coins, we can see that there are at least few thousand addresses with that much coin in them, and frankly most people spread their coins in 10+ different addresses if they have that many. So we are probably talking about over 10,000 folks who can liquidate at will then recollect later at panic.
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:45:04

What I do not understand is why people worry about it. We might not agree on timeline or price but most people here agree that it will go to new highs at some point. Whether we buy from $4000 or $2500 is a small optimization since everyone will be a winner to some degree if we are right.

I am not saying because they are both unlikely to succeed that they are similar. I’m saying they are similar despite both were seen unlikely to succeed.
Facebook is a better example than g+. It created the new paradigm and had the network. G+ tried to add few pretty features and move the masses. Bitcoin also created a new paradigm, a decentralized exchange with a network of dedicated users. Comparing BitcoinCash to g+ is more accurate.
What people miss is that Bitcoin is still young. 10 years might sound a lot to you, but in this domain where current banking system is established for almost half a millennia it is pretty young. Only 50million users out of potentially billions that might (a big if) be using it. Technically 20 years down the road anybody with an IoT device can use Bitcoin as a side wallet if there are enough incentives (again another big if).
Now I already underlined this is a high risk investment, thus should be allocated a small part of your portfolio. If I were investing in the next Facebook I would also do the same.

Back in the days (like 6 years ago) people thought 1/10,000th of all bitcoins, meaning 2100 was enough and anything above that was being greedy. This was known as Vladimir Club membership. At the time it was about sth close to $25K I suppose.
Obviously it is too late to join VC, but If you move from the same proposition by usd amount I guess 8-10 bitcoins can be “enough”. 
In reality however there is no right answer. Personally I wish to own 10 bitcoins but hey, not so easy to do anymore.

Not sure why people assume debt system is not feasible with bitcoin. Fractional reserve with bitcoin is very much a possibility, just like how it worked for gold.
A bank like structure can easily own say 1,000,000 bitcoins and lend out 9,000,000 bitcoin worth of their own coin, pegged to bitcoin price.
The only thing changing here is that inflation of the amount of bitcoins is not under control of anybody, and simply a fixed amount by the algorithm and rewarded to mining.

Imho btc should be used at some point, fulfilling its’ original purpose. I prefer to do that when adoption caught up with our daily use cases and I don’t see that happening tomorrow, but certainly happening 5-10 years down the road. Timeline I have is constrained on that dimension.

I won’t say that, but glad we are at least discussing something rather than tossing random quotes at each other :)
Alpha is a weird measure of performance imho, because the market itself is an ever-evolving entity, just like a river. Thus it is never the same at any two points in time. There are just way too many variables globally to estimate the direction of the stock markets, thus most one can do is “guesstimate”. Sometimes they can have high alpha other times they won’t do track record becomes a blurry thing. This is why your quote of “past performance ...” actually applies there. Only few exceptions I know against this (like Buffett) but that is mostly because of isolated calls on his end.
What I am suggesting on the prediction of static or near-static entities however is different. There you can actually pinpoint why the prediction is made and what basis it has. If it depends on mostly correct assumptions than you should see positive or negative correlations on the end results. This is true for plumber case because it is skill based. Sure there might be really rusty outlier pipes here and there but if you have enough number of data points your model will converge to sth meaningful. Similarly bitcoin so far is a closed space entity, so if somebody had long track record to call the directions successfully it might, just might, mean sth. Without that it is completely meaningless, and only pops up on survivorship bias cases.
That is all I am saying essentially. Thanks for listening.

The way I look at it is not the digital bits your wallet represents but the infrastructure, the continuous development and the network that makes it valued.
There are literally hundreds of really smart developers constantly improving the tech. If you were to have a Silicon Valley startup with VC fund and hire these folks, that company itself would probably be worth billions in terms of “acquahire”. I guess closest equivalent I can think of as a company would be Visam its’ early days, but think of all the revenue coming out as a dividend and RSUs.
Then you have the network of people who actually use, trade and exchange bitcoin. Though niche there are already few use cases it is better than its’ alternatives like sending money overseas, buying stuff online with a discount etc.
Finally there is a beauty in its’ design. Proof of Work, immutable transaction chain that is decentralized is something we were not used to and even as a small variation worth keeping.
Note that I only keep a very small percentage of my savings as Bitcoin so I do not advocate it as a safe or sound investment. I believe there is value in diversification though so keeping a bit of it sounds like a good idea to me.
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:40:16
I disagree. 1 in 10 people using it doesn’t mean they would park all their net worth into it. Probably they will use parts of their savings as Bitcoin. On top of that Bitcoin is not a debt based leveraged system, so it is not like you would be using Bitcoin mortgages, bitcoin car loans etc. therefore we cannot use the adoption models for fiat vis-a-vis for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin was valued at 20K at the time due to greed of get-rich-quick people, not because it was adopted to those levels. That is why we had the pullback. There will be a day when adoption would catch up so bitcoin price would be stable over 20K to justify it but 2017 was not that time. If adoption was the reason like you suggested it would not be going below that level similar to how it doesn’t go below $1000 now, or wasn’t going below $150 few years ago.
To be more specific when you compare bitcoin marker cap you should consider a model based on “narrow money’, not the “broad money” nor the “debt circulation”. Global money supply of narrow money today is $37 trillion. Bitcoin being %5 of it with %10 adoption imho is very realistic.

This is not generally applicable to everything.
Say you have a plumber A,who out of 1000 last visits fixed 999 without a problem, and it lumber B with the numbers of 820/1000. Would you say past performance is no guarantee and treat them equally when picking a plumber? 
Priors matter. In fact there is a whole science of Bayesian statistics that show for many situations ‘conjugate priors’ exist (prior plus the new info = posterior) and how important priors are.
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:54:58
So anybody who holds over 3 bitcoins will be a millionaire. Sounds a bit hard to believe considering all the people who have 1000+ coins just because they mined due to random tip from a friend in the right time. These people do not need to wait until price of bitcoin to rise to 300K, heck even 100K. This means along the way there would be a lot of downward pressure since most of these folks will liquidate their asset when bitcoin gets 40K+. This would suggest at least an equal or more powerful urge to buy is necessary, and ordinary folks’ savings won’t cover that. We are talking about institutional investment as a must here. Not sure how I feel about that.
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:41:29

@_date: 2018-11-25 11:30:50
Imho support levels, technical charts etc are all physiological barriers.
For many support levels are what they saw as normal before the hype of 2017. For me it is correlated to mining costs etc. I cannot claim to know who would be profiting at what price and who would be willing to part with their bitcoins when, so I keep any possibility open.
Though unlikely If it reaches $2000~ish I would happily buy my 4th bitcoin. If it never crosses 2800 I will only have 3. It would just mean I am investing less, so losing opportunity. I do not think it is sth to lose sleep over tbh.
Now if indeed it reaches to those levels and it is utter chaos, even better for me since then I can buy bitcoins with my monthly savings :). I do not plan to part ways with my coins in the next 5+ years. I made sure to invest money I do not desperately need for a specific purpose so I can be ready to deal with some lengthy number of rainy days.

1-2% is a huge market penetration though, since what matters is the addressable market.
Realistically what percentage of people on earth hold gold or stocks, and among those how is the distribution? By that measure we could even count stock holding as early phase since overwhelming majority in the world has yet to have significant stake in stock market investments. But we already know that addressable market is pretty much saturated on that for decades.
Question is: what is the addressable market of Bitcoin? If it is 6% of whole world population, we are almost at 1/3rd meaning it probably is not early phase. If it were to be 36% then it indeed is still early phases.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:43:36
First of all you (most likely) cannot mine by spending 6.5k, it is not just risk premium, because
1. Your electricity cost is most likely not in the bottom 10 percentile of the world
2. You need to invest in depreciating assets like miners and eat that sunk cost, and unlike most miners you cannot do this at scale so your sunk cost will be much higher than theirs
3. Once you start mining it take a long time to accumulate the bitcoins, which means unlike just buying it you have to wait.
Second, let’s say enough number of people decided to buy, but the bitcoin supply is at a fixed rate, meaning now mining costs will increase due to payout being lower (aka hashrate increase), so effectively making this proposition invalid for vast majority.
Tl:dr: there is a reason why you don’t grow lettuce at home and buy it from the store.

Theoretically there is no minimum, since you can even choose to pay 0 fee and hope some Good Samaritan miner to include your transaction.
Realistically, the minimum would be sth like 1 satoshi per byte, so roughly 255 satoshis (about 2 cents in today’s prices). The downside of this is that your transaction would be in the lowest priority group and will only clear out once mempool gets empty (which is generally over the weekends). Since you are sending this to yourself i see no problem setting the fee as low as possible.
In general I set to 8-10 satoshi per byte and unless it is a really busy day it clears in a reasonable time.

Would Gold whales (ie world central banks) willingly execute a mass-sell order upon a single person’s whim? It is certainly possible for a Bitcoin whale to sell 400,000 coins in 2 days and then buy them lower when the market panics while sitting on his chair munching donuts without asking anybody else’s permission.
Let’s stop comparing gold with Bitcoin people.

Think about your credit card transactions. You have a predetermined credit line. Then you keep spending daily using this credit line. Your checking account is unaware of them until the pay date (say once a month), which is then balanced.
The only difference is that unlike credit cards the original credit line is not vapor money but is coming from your original wallet with an on chain transaction and the “paydays” are the reverse where you close the channel and keep the remaining balance put into your checking account.

So I bought a Ledger Nano, and was moving the coins I bought from the exchange every week for at least a few months now, but for convenience I saved the address to the exchange so I didn’t have to plug my ledger to computer just to receive coins. 
I recently found out that i should have been using a different receiver address every time, yet all these months I moved to the same address. How screwed am I? Should I be worried about how this can bite me back?

Think of it this way: coal based energy generation is “demand oriented”. Ie logistically speaking they will generate amount as close as possible to what demand there will be and if it is beyond some capacity they have to deal with logistics and storage of the fossil fuel. Therefore apart from small amount of excess capacity they won’t be selling it for cheap.
On the other hand if you have a hydroelectric central, the capacity is supply based. You set it up on a strong river you get plenty of electricity. Sometimes you have way more than what is needed, thus you start incentives for industries to use your excess electricity for very cheap (it goes to waste otherwise anyways).
Miners can choose where to open shop, and it is for their benefit (not really due to green initiative tbh) to do it near these locations where electricity is dirt cheap. The result actually makes them use clean energy though.

Assuming bieeekly salaries, fees would be 2 tx. Since moves are known at least 24h  before the date and you don’t need next block fee, at most 50 cents would cut it, doubling that is a dollar.
Tax? Why would they pay tax when there are no gains yet? If employees received coins are sold at profit, sure they would have to pay tax but that doesn’t reduce the salary.

To be fair that was back in 2012 so 1 bitcoin was like $11 or so. Still a substantial amount but would translate to 5-7 bitcoins today ignoring inflation.

Doesn’t that automatically happen?
Ie today you have $1000 invested, where say bitcoin dominance is 60% and everything else is 40%, so you have $600 in bitcoin and $400 in altcoins.
Tomorrow Bitcoin rose %10 and altcoins stayed the same, you now have $1060 in total, while bitcoin dominance now is 660:1060=62% which is exactly $660 out of your $1060 since your total amount and the denominator is the same.
So by doing nothing you keep % in bitcoin equal to its market dominance.
Am I missing sth here?

200% wrt what currency? If you are measuring them by Rial this is not surprising since Rial is losing crazy value with real inflation being way too high. Same for stock market, the “points” you remark is pegged to local currency. Here is how it plays out over long term: when I was young (less than 20 years ago) one USD was 1800 Rial, today it is over 42,000. That is 23x value. and this is despite USD itself losing value, since back than 1 USD could have bought you much more in America.
Second, value is not the only determination. An assets liquidity is extremely important when things go south. If an extreme financial crisis hits where people cannot buy food do you think houses will be sold in a week or so with high prices? They are very hard to liquidate in such conditions. Look at what happened to Syrian house market after 2011. Just because houses look like safe investment today doesn’t mean same condition will hold when major recession/war hits. This is the unfortunate reality of Middle East. You might be too young to remember Iran-Iraq war, but the burden of that to the economy and non-liquid assets was mind blowing.
In an extreme example one can say house prices, stock market goes up in Venezuela too. Do you think it is a safe asset for Venezuelans? 
Euro/Dollar also has two problems. First, it attracts attention if you try to buy mass amounts and governments can control the purchases after some extent. sth similar happened to Turkey just 9 months ago and it was barely a financial mishap not even a full blown recession, no embargo etc.  second, those currencies also have inflation so they do not hold their value. Americans try not to keep their investments in cash USD for this very reason.
Finally, I agree that gold is safe for Middle East and the main way of securing your assets. Certainly the most popular one for all these years. securing physical gold however is not an easy feat and not surprising for young Iranians to take refuge in assets like Bitcoin despite its’ risk and variance.

Well, I don’t see why income taxes should complicate things. The company would still be able to keep the portion of your income for tax in fiat as they do today, and pay your net salary in Bitcoin, which makes it tax free.

I don’t understand why people are thinking altcoins are lacking in value progression. Off the top of my head Litecoin was like $27 few months ago (75 now), ethereum was around $90s (170 now), BCH was also below $100 I think (280 now). During this period lowest Bitcoin value I observed was $3170.
It seems to me altcoins rose pretty well as well, why do people think they are consumed by Bitcoin?

I used to think like that too (efficient market theory) but then I realized what market can do with this information.
Ie if market were to know Apple will stop producing iPhones they can project supposed losses to occur. In this case though it just means the available supply will dry, so if demand stays the same people who are currently not willing to sell needs to sell (for likely a higher price) or demand should decrease (for less bitcoins with higher price) either way knowing halvening will happen earlier does not have a huge upside, except for maybe hoarding the coins now and selling them for a premium to meet future market demand, which also has upward price pressure only spread over longer time.
To put it simply, we know halvening will happen. What do we do with this information?

I would not say it has a Goal since it is not a hive mind. The creator of it had a goal ( the whitepaper), and people who have it might or might not share those goals.

Can’t talk for everyone but one of the legit reasons why one might want to keep funds in exchange is to setup “stop-loss”. 
Another party is probably daytraders and speculators.
Finally the last part that matters is people who are not too familiar with the tech. It is a scary thing to be  fully responsible on sth you might mistakenly ruin easily.  It might sound simple to you to have your words securely stored and keep things in hardware wallets since you heard it millions of times but for a fairly untechnical person these things are very confusing.

I don’t see how purchase power is a good metric to call for deflation as it really depends on what it purchased. I would argue USD’s purchase power increased significantly over last 3 years (compared to most of the world items you can buy) but it decreased in some parts of the world or some particular items; yet it clearly is inflationary.

I don’t understand how that can be a viable option.
To flood the pool they most likely need minimum of 50,000 tx everyday, and to achieve actual transactions to be impacted they have to have higher sat per byte fee set for those transactions so that anything lower is blocked. Even if they set it to 10 sat/byte it makes each transaction on average cost 2,500 sat so somebody needs to waste about 125 bitcoin everyday. That is a lot of money (especially for that time frame when ATH was closing in). Is it really worth spending that much just for a feeble attempt to mud Bitcoin’s name?

You don’t even have to remember all 24 words. You can technically keep 18 words in a safe but reproducible place and just remember last 6. Even if someone hacks on your belongings and managed to get the 18, guessing the last 6 would take 2048^6 trials. Assuming 1 trial per second per computer it would take 2^14 years. You can scale it up all you won’t they still won’t be able to crack it.

About $7600. Makes sense for people who are putting their money on the next halving to buy as much as possible at least 6 months prior, but everybody who bought at todays’ levels would be selling for a quick buck. Including the shorts above $8000 does not sound likely to hold for 2018.

I wouldn’t say it is banned, but highly regularized since it is considered betraying your own economy. Ie just 9 months ago Turkish government implemented a similar ruling into its‘ banking structure to regulate and prevent people from converting their liras to usd above some threshold (100k or sth). Basically in today’s banking structure who trades currencies is logged and some governments have all the control. Same Turkey for instance can mark you as an enemy of the state for keeping your money on a bank affiliated to some religious sect. I met people who were imprisoned because of such a simple “crime”.
