The 90 day moving average is $4.03. The bitcoin market is complicated, so take that as you will.

Only invest what you can afford to lose. Sure, if it goes up 1000% in the next 6 months, you'll feel real smart, but if the opposite happens... not so much.
Right now, with few exceptions, the only useful things you can buy with bitcoin are USD or other currency. If that stays the case, people will have to or want to sell sometime, which will push the value down.

$500 for 200Mh/s? You could build something faster for the same price, and you'd have the hardware at the end of the 3 months, or could sell it if the price of coins makes mining unattractive. You might not even earn $500 worth of coins in 3 months the way difficulty has been increasing.

This guy is nothing if not optimistic. While I like that he's made some well-thought out points, he seems to completely ignore some common sense points and some negatives of bitcoin and go on to estimate that the size of the bitcoin economy will "realistically" increase 12,500x in the "forseeable future".
I guess if I put all my lifesavings into bitcoin, I'd try and be optimistic too.

Curious how you convince anyone but the very technical to accept bitcoin. As near as I can tell the steps to receive bitcoin are:
1) Install program
2) Give buyer (you) a long, impossible to remember number that realistically must be emailed
3) Wait several hours for bitcoin program to download entire blockchain
4) Get coins
If you want to exchange them, this involves setting up several more accounts, waiting a week or so, and potentially seeing the "value" of your coins change by 10% or more.
Far more hassles than dealing in cash, fees if you want to exchange, and unpredictability in value is going to probably make this a short experiment for the few vendors you convince.

17 mins after your comment its already to $20.01

Notable changes:
* Client will accept and relay TX's with 0.0005 BTC fee schedule (users still pay 0.01 BTC per kb, until next version)
* Non-standard transactions accepted on testnet
* Source code tree reorganized (prep for autotools build)
* Remove "Generate Coins" option from GUI, and remove 4way SSE miner.  Internal reference CPU miner remains available, but users are directed to external miners for best hash production.
* IRC is overflowing.  Client now bootstraps to channels  - 
* DNS names now may be used with -addnode, -connect (requires -dns to enable)
RPC changes:
* 'listtransactions' adds 'from' param, for range queries
* 'move' may take account balances negative
* 'settxfee' added, to manually set TX fee

Probably not a popular opinion for the more libertarian-inclined bitcoiners, but I totally agree that an exchange run by an established financial institution with a track record of handling large amounts of money and, you know, not getting hacked would be great.
@_date: 2011-06-27 18:01:15
I dont see why not, but: 1700Mh/s is with a pretty extreme overclock and 6990s are an awful value for money.

As an addition to the only sane comment here so far: running a TOP500 super computer should cost hundreds or thousands of dollars an hour, and shouldn't ever be idle. In fact, people sign up on waiting lists to be able to use this power. Why would you think you can just use it for even an hour for personal uses?
I suspect its either not in the top 300, you're trolling, or you dont really have "regular access".

Miners: USD/other currency or nothing.
Everyone else: nothing.
But, I don't think that means a disaster is necessarily looming. It is tough to start a business with a currency that changes value multiple %/day. Once the market finds a stable value for bitcoin, I think it will be an attractive currency for transactions for small businesses. Why small? Its not liquid enough right now to support large businesses, and the largest exchange limits you to $1000/day, and $10k/month in transactions, which is rather small for almost all businesses. Bitcoin also presents a tricky tax situation: don't think the government doesn't care about commerce going on in non-USD/etc currencies. If you are making a lot of money via bitcoin, they will (rightly, IMO) want a cut.

There is already a project like this going on in the forums to build a [modular system built with FPGAs](

US/Japanese governments by claiming that it facilitates money laundering/narcotics purchases/tax evasion, or something like that. There are sane arguments as to why that is silly, but the government isn't always perfectly rational.

Err I meant bitcoins or credit cards versus cash. There's no transaction fees for cash, which is what I would expect to use at a place like that.
Additionally while bitcoin may not charge transaction fees for most transactions, there are fees if you want to exchange bitcoin to another currency, which for now would be the reality for business owners that have expenses in other currencies.

Something I've been thinking of lately: do any sites allow unicode characters in passwords? There are over 100,000 unicode characters which is so so many more than alphanumeric+symbols. It seems a couple unicode characters within a password would render it more or less impossible to brute force.

While I doubt bitcoin will ever be adopted to the levels speculated on in the article (something the author freely admits as well), it is interesting to think about what would happen to current large holders of coins if it did.
As of somewhat recently the largest wallet had 250,000 bitcoins, and given 2 of the estimates of value at the end of the article...
250,000 * $20,000 = $5,000,000,000
250,000 * $90,000 = $22,500,000,000
They would join the list of the world's richest people... for running a program on their computer (or possibly inventing it, there is speculation that satoshi, whoever s/he is, is the largest holder of coins).

I hope you get free electricity, or youll be in for a surprise when you get that power bill.
@_date: 2011-06-18 00:55:37
Very cool. I see you mentioned you are keeping the details somewhat private, but do you think you'll be able to release this at a price that's competitive to GPUs without needing massive volume (10-100k units+) to recoup startup costs?
@_date: 2011-06-07 02:07:57
70-75C should be fine, but honestly with the fans at 100% that sounds a little high. It your case extremely dusty? Is it extremely hot in your house? My 5830 runs about 65C @ 65% fan (I have it set to 1% fan/C).
I find blowing dust out of my case after a few months can lower temps inside by a few C. You'll find a much better improvement if its been longer, or you've never done it.
ninja edit: Underclocking GPU memory speed can also drop temps without costing you much performance.

While it is probably not profitable to build a new rig right now, assumption  "The difficulty grows at a constant 25% per period, forever" is silly. Difficulty will eventually stabilize. Where that happens is hard to say.

I think it depends on publicity. The reason (IMO) why it has gone up so much recently is that there has been a ton of news stories on bitcoin leading to more demand to buy than desire to sell, which pushes price up. The market is extremely volatile, and a relatively small amount of money bought or sold could change exchange value a lot. A major news story will push it up, a lack of publicity will probably lead to a stagnation or decrease in price and people selling off to take profits or reduce their risk, which of course could push things down farther.
Absent any major press or government action, I predict $15-20. Since neither of those is a given, I can see anything between $1-100.

CPU mining is inefficient, it would take months or years to generate a block solo with with the main client's CPU mining code, and there are better CPU miners out there.
If you must mine with the CPU, use a different miner, and join a pool. And dont be surprised when your electricity bill is far more than you  make back in BTC.
@_date: 2011-07-20 03:28:43
You can't mine from the "default" client anymore (if you mean the bitcoin client from bitcoin.org), but there are several well established miners to pick from now such as phoenix and poclbm.

Very cool. I always thought this was a cool project, and the reduced fees mean I will probably be buying a card soon, I really like the idea.

The thing is the majority of of network power is coming from GPUs, which don't cost anywhere close to the same /GFLOP as a traditional compute cluster. Per the same article, a 5970 generates almost a TFLOP. It surely costs less than $1800, even when accounting for other components in the computer its installed in.
True cost of all the hardware running the network I'd guess is under $50M.
@_date: 2011-06-12 22:15:58
You better check that math.
12k/year / 365 = ~$32/day
~$32 * 12 = ~$394
The [Bitcoin Mining Calculator]( suggests you need 1200Mhash/s to make $32/day @ $15/coin, and you aren't building a rig for $394 that gets 1200Mh/s. Just the GPUs needed would be that much, or more.
I didnt even factor in power costs, or difficulty increases.

Simplecoin wont last. The terms of service looks like it was copy/pasted from a form that they forgot to fill their own name into:


There are numerous other nonsensical bits like this.
Even if that's an oversight, the first people to buy $1000 of bitcoin on credit then issue a chargeback will sink them.

Not sure if you're trolling, but I think it does have a place at a real-world currency, especially for smaller, online, tech-saavy businesses.
However it does have a lot of hurdles to be more accessible to everyday folk, and I think in some cases the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. For example, I'd no sooner expect someone running a garage sale or a farmers market stand to accept bitcoin than to accept my credit card, there's just no advantage to the buyer or seller there IMO (which is all it is, an opinion).
