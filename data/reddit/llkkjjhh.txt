Pens will make a rally, everybody should get in on it while it's still undervalued. Great team, proven tech, real-world uses. I'm all-in on pens.
Crayons are a fucking scam. Totally unprofessional, they have no idea what they're doing. The price is only propped by the idiots who keep buying into it.

They have no obligation to support new forks. Where are the people whining about not getting their bitcoin diamond? They only reason you guys are complaining is because you feel you missed out on free money.

Public addresses are public... You can find every single public key with money in it on the public ledger.

Doesnt matter, they are not making the switch for political reasons. If bitcoin becomes cheaper to use, they can easily swap back. What matters to businesses is the present. They have a real need for low fees right now because they actually use cryptos as a currency, and not just as an investment/gamble/political ideal. Promising ln for a few months away means they lose business right now.

It's possible the website or account was compromised in a way that doesn't require knowledge of the password.
Admin access, sql injection, forgot password hack, etc. Many possibilities.

Somebody waited years for that RSS feed to light up with unread messages. I like to think that over time, the subscriber has been adding alarms and emergency lights and fireworks to the system for when he gets alerted.

No no no, I don't want you to finish it for me. I just need you to hold this part here for a few minutes and don't move until the glue's dried.

If he wanted to stay anonymous, he wouldn't even be in this situation. Why should he wait for things to blow over and disappear again when he was already completely anonymous and unknown and could have just stayed hidden and not talked to a reporter?
Newsweek is full of shit.

I agree with this. "Original" chain died long ago, everything now is a fork. But whoever is trading with BTC symbol is the real bitcoin imo. Pretty simple. Social consensus and all.

He means when it goes to the moon, it will be so fast you don't even notice. So hold on to your butts.
