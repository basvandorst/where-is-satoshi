"Known unknowns"

I don't know what's going on but I had to sell a few. I'll either buy a new vette or buy more coins when it dips. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:50:30
Because that seems way easier. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:38:23
Thank you. Even I can understand that. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:58:09
Fuck off. Not wanting to jerkoff a chick is transphobic? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:03:28
This /s tag bullshit is getting silly. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:02:39
Thank you

One dollar bill no. I put a bunch together and bought a jet ski though. My Honda dealership isn't on bitcoin just yet. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:58:28
This is so fucking stupid. I love it.

Or he could just learn to get a joke like a regular human. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:38:54
"Nope, it's gone." 
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:04:11
See, that's the thing that bothers me. I'm pretty dumb, and even I can use cotext clues to get jokes. 
Edit: "Foreigners with no respect for the local culture lol."
If you can't tell that's a joke you might really be "special". It even says lol.

No, it's not just you. It's all stupid people. How was sarcasm depicted in books for so many years before the s/ tag? I agree, sometimes it might be tough, but this one was certainly easy   to someone with any common sense. Using the /s tag is like having to explain a joke to the dumb guy. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:06:09
Maybe for you. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:38:56
You're goddamn right. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 19:14:56


Then I'm not sure why this conversation is a thing. 


No, your English is great.
