Care to explain why NOT to buy it from Amazon. What if the seller is the supplier?
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:43:17
You tell 'em.

I'd give him my address for verification.

Define "crashed". Bitcoin started off @ $0.003.

Edit: You did a good job btw.

Whales are unloading, at least 240 million dollars the past 48 hours give or take.
Just hold. Add more and more as it dips to "average down".

Lock them up! ����‍♂️

Check out this calculator... 
Here, you can see what your holdings of BTC would've looked like today had you purchased "X amount" of BTC on any applied date.

From here on out, my habit will be small weekly injections of 20 dollars for BTC. 10 years from now, I hope to have a big smile on face wishing I would've put more.

Where's @ pkrocin today?

I read if 7400 doesn't hold, major support is 6800.

Wow, that's BS and something that would sever my relationship had it been me. ✌�� I hope you get it figured out sooner than later.

I'm stinkin' rich, just bought every banana in my city at a 50 miles radius.
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:48:34
What app/program did you use to create it? Btw, good job! ����
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:49:56
Happy Birffffffday. Enjoy!

That 9:13 Pacific drop nearly gave me a heart attack.
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:30:49
After the 100% increase to 8k, a 30% pullback was expected. So "they" say. Who's they you say? ����‍♂️
