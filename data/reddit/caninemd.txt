I was actually considering doing that at one point but I think it wouldn't completely go through because technically you CAN get your money back through mining and make a profit - but it would take months or even years. He gets you by not saying WHEN you'd turn a profit. He's smart...

Zen pool is the most profitable pool in the world? Really? If this is the case, then at the rate that it's going, then zen hashlets are just not a good idea at all then. Also, when I bought the prime, I couldn't have bought it for 16.95 because at no point in my entire time with GAW have I ever seen a prime for that low of a price on the hash market or when they were just selling them. I came in within the last couple months. That price was NEVER an option for me. I'm seeing the price go up and it's already past what I paid for it so I got that going for me which is nice.
If I just sell my zens, I won't get my investment back. I bought them from the GAW site two months ago when they were 20 each. Now on the market, they're hovering around 11. And I didn't buy that many hashstakers for that reason. I bought 5 of them because I was convinced that I would start to see profits that I initially was expecting form GAW.. or at the very least payouts that were there when I first started. But I'm having my doubts.
I asked on the hashtalk forum about if we can sell hashstakers. We will indeed be able to so I'm happy about that.
You seemed to be quite defensive and I didn't mean to come across as rude before. I was just stating my thoughts and feelings about my involvement and wanted an exit strategy.

To my understanding, when it goes public, there will be an exchange thing between paycoin and USD just like BTC and USD or EUR and USD.

Thank you for your story. You're right, it is difficult. I didn't want to believe it. An acquaintance of mine who was a part of it from the very beginning got me into it - of course HE did indeed turn a profit. Quite a major one at that because the Zen payouts were pretty high and the BTC value was pretty high as well. I was thinking "wow if I am even a fraction like him, I'll be happy."
Well I got in at the wrong time. The glory days were over I guess. I read somewhere that a ponzi scheme typically could have large ROIs for initial investors just to get MORE people involved. I think that's exactly what happened. My acquaintance was one of the initial investors, and I was a later person.
I think I'm going to stick it out for a little while until their mysterious paycoin launches and I can/might be able to sell them for USD. Either way, some of the hashlets I bought about a month ago are up in value so I'd pull a profit THAT way kind of :P

Are you saying that we won't be able to pay 400 HP for a paycoin and then exchange it for USD?

It would be stupid to buy products from them AFTER I came to the realization. I admit is was a mistake of mine, but there's a difference between being stupid and being ignorant.

Thank you for this screenshot. I'm building a personal case and will be posting it on a bunch of places once I'm done. I'll be using this pic.

I don't think it's actually by GAW. Maybe a fan made video or something. But there's a comparison to be noted here:
Paycoin's level of reliability is the same as this video's level of flashiness.

I like this a lot. Thank you. I'll be using some of this information when I build my own case as well.
