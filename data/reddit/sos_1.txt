Think about what you're actually saying. You're saying, with essentially no evidence except "the majority of their posts are directed at attacking Bitcoin", that banks are secretly paying people to go on r/bitcoin, and disagree with you. You think it's more likely that a bunch of bankers feared the rise of bitcoin so much that they thought it was worth their time to pay a bunch of people to leave comments disagreeing with the image, as if it would actually have any noticeable effect at all. That's more likely to you than those people just being people who sincerely disagree with you?

There's obviously no way that people could disagree with you without being paid to do so.

I’m talking about the “imagine when it gets big” bit.

How are they politically biased?
@_date: 2019-01-08 02:07:15
Maybe idk. I think there was a post about it yesterday in this sub.

In what way is the US bankrupt?

They absolutely could have done it without permission. Wikipedia is free to use. Here’s what the article says:
”However, Wikimedia — which hosts the Wikipedia site — released a statement on Wednesday saying it wasn’t given advanced notice of YouTube’s announcement.
“Neither Wikipedia nor the Wikimedia Foundation are part of a formal partnership with YouTube,” it said on Wednesday.
That seems pretty clear to me.

Apple is such a valuable company because they make huge amounts of money. Just because you personally don’t like their products doesn’t mean they’re not innovating, or they’re a bad investment. As for Tim Cook “blaming it all on Trump”: they’re clearly not going to lie to their shareholders about the cause of the slump in sales. Obviously the tariffs are going to affect trade between the US and China. What did you think was going to happen?

Apple is a gigantic company. This argument makes no sense.

That doesn’t make the US “bankrupt”. If that was the case, people would stop lending the US money. Clearly they haven’t, because they know the US can pay it back. They’re in debt, not “bankrupt”, if you can even apply that word to a state.

No, I’m saying that comparing the two things makes no sense. If that makes me a “tard” then fine.

The argument is that because Apple’s market cap dropped by more than bitcoin is worth in one day, this means that bitcoin is “still small” and has a lot of potential to be worth exponentially more than it is now.  It’s a bad argument.

The apple watch is the [best selling watch](  in the world, just to let you know. Apple manufactures their iPhones in China. Please explain how the tariffs don’t affect them?

I think you mean legislation, not legislature.
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:29:54
I don’t understand. Is there an example?
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:04:09
So.. wikipedia had literally nothing to do with it. They weren’t even given prior notice.

I think it’s implied by the “when” rather than “if” that he thinks bitcoin is going to be much bigger. It’s not the first time I’ve seen this argument anyway. Maybe I am misinterpreting the comment but I don’t think so.

The housing market will never crash.
The bit coin bubble will never burst.

Underrated comment in my opinion.
