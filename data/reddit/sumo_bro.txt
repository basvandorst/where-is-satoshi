IT'S OVER 9000!
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:08:21
Bitcoin coming back from the moon, with all kinds of stories to tell!
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:15:50
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:49:25
I can’t believe the fabulist reality TV guy tricked us!
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:54:03
what up, bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-30 12:54:29
It’s like a stock or bond except you don’t earn dividends or interest.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:17:12
It's over 9000?
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:24:45
Never surrrender!
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:35:34
Man Bitcoin is only down a few k and everyone is acting like it’s the end of the world. WTF
@_date: 2019-07-27 18:13:48
They were wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:15:04
That... seems like a bad idea...
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:32:37
Huge if true.
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:35:28
It's over 9000!
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:51:19
Good morning, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:23:19
There once was a dream called “bitcoin.” It was so delicate you had to whisper it.
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:53:04
And party on, dudes!
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:52:23
That’s because everyone is pulling info out of their asses.
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:23:55
Wales! I knew they were up to something!
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:10:48
Cut your losses if you need the money, man. Don’t gamble with money you can’t loose.
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:17:11
Whale Steve in the house!
@_date: 2019-07-24 04:43:27
what happen bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:00:45
Goodbye, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-13 16:40:04
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:50:26

@_date: 2019-07-10 20:49:53

@_date: 2019-07-31 14:48:09
Citizens of Bitcoin, give me your energy!!!
@_date: 2019-07-29 14:08:56
what about bitcoins
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:04:21
Welcome back to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:37:55
It tastes minty fresh.
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:06:19
Bitcoins, yo
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:00:15
I missed out on the bitcoins.  :(
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:00:54
I like the chill party atmosphere in here.
@_date: 2019-03-05 13:24:14
Did the world become radically less socialist since November of last year?
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:20:55
I request more songs!
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:54:20
Good thing you and I are smarter than all those millionaires manipulating the market.
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:05:43
good luck!
@_date: 2019-03-27 11:49:14
yeah crap, too bad I sold everything
@_date: 2019-03-27 13:35:08
Damn bro, no need to get all agro. Just chill and talk about bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-03-01 14:23:26
If you want to help out Bitcoin, start by helping yourself out. Go for some self-care, chill and read a good book, go out and buy a nice dinner. Don’t use Bitcoin to pay for it, regular money works perfectly fine.
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:02:36
Sure, Jan.
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:51:19
aaaaand it’s back under 4k
@_date: 2019-11-14 13:53:52
It’s the holiday season dip, everyone know about that.
@_date: 2019-03-25 14:14:38
Yo, fuck pants.
@_date: 2019-03-08 14:44:51
Shit, those rhymes are fierce!
@_date: 2019-11-01 16:10:29
Fuck scammers!
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:52:44
I’m gonna chill out and play video games, so that’s a pretty cool weekend I’ve got lined up.
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:09:18
Good night, bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-06 16:55:35
Peace and love to everyone in the land of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:21:36
People always ask me "What's up with Bitcoin? What's gonna happen with those Bitcoins?" Like Bitcoin is some giant coming down from the mountain to chill out with us little people. I say, Bitcoin is basically the people. Bitcoins is you and me. So instead of asking how Bitcoin is doing, I say how are you doing? How are the people doing? If we're all doing okay, Bitcoin is gonna be okay. If we're all spaced out and babbling about BAKKT lambo moons, that's how Bitcoin is gonna be.
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:53:28
Wow, fuck scammers.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:13:48
Too bad about those Bitcoins but at least it’s Friday!
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:01:24
Then people would think it’s The Flash.
@_date: 2019-03-12 15:27:37
You can buy a pizza with it maybe
@_date: 2019-03-07 15:26:19
I have been to space, it is very chill.
@_date: 2019-03-15 20:05:21
Nah, I’m pretty sure Jordan Peterson is a fuckwit charlatan.
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:58:18
Is sad.
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:51:45
It’s almost Friday!
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:52:24
Plural of “crypto” is not “crypto’s.”
@_date: 2019-11-05 12:55:23
What up, citizens of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:06:19
Happy Friday, BA!
@_date: 2019-03-12 22:48:34
Oh man, I might swing by sometime.
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:49:34
It's Friday!
@_date: 2019-03-28 11:59:13
Good morning, bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-11-18 18:43:38
Whale Steve at it again!
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:49:12
Hello there, citizens of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:35:07
I hate Tuesdays!
@_date: 2019-03-27 13:47:52
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:31:18
Everyone just chill and enjoy your bitcoins, no worries.
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:58:02
What up, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-11-12 12:56:06
What up, Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:45:34
@_date: 2019-11-08 12:51:51
Plus, Chinese New Year is just around the corner.
@_date: 2019-11-01 15:19:26
The money of the future!
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:58:15
Nah, I’m just chilling.
@_date: 2019-03-24 16:32:25
I would like a couple of haikus, tbh.
@_date: 2019-03-25 13:17:45
I heard you can buy pizza with it.
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:17:34
They’re almost like Mondays.  :(
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:41:36
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:43:43
Seems legit!
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:16:43
Last chance to buy below 7.5k!
@_date: 2019-03-05 14:40:54
So the world got more socialist and BTC went down? Not much of a hedge!
@_date: 2019-11-14 13:52:52
Sure, Jan.
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:08:59
Hello, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:50:31
It’s my internet friend, BA!
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:00:50
People of Bitcoin, keep up the energy!
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:10:05
Sure, Jan.
@_date: 2019-08-15 10:27:28
I bring positivity no matter what happens today to the Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:10:40
Damn dude, chill the f out.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:37:28
It’s almost Friday, just be chill and enjoy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-14 10:26:28
There is only one Lord of the Bitcoin, and he does not share power.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:50:55
Not all heroes wear capes.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:41:33
Bitcoin in an elevator, livin' it up when I'm going down...
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:53:10
Citizens of Bitcoin, brace yourselves for hard times!
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:47:16
From the blockchain, cousin, you know the drill
I'm nine hundred and ninety nine thou short of a mil
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:06:02
Dogecoin is so far ahead of the competition it’s just crazy.
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:59:59
!lntip 100
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:32:57
I don’t even care what Bitcoin does, tbh. Life is too short to worry about that.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:01:06
Bitcoin looks fucked.  :(
@_date: 2019-10-18 17:40:03
But today is not one of those days.
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:01:21
Good job, citizens of Bitcoin. You kept the energy super mellow today and everyone got a good chance to chill out and relax.
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:31:01
This guy knows what’s up.
@_date: 2019-08-28 11:51:14
No worries, only Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-22 12:57:19
Good pep talk!
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:57:28
Good day, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:53:36
What up, BA?
@_date: 2019-08-01 13:09:08
Bitcoin, that’s what up.
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:52:29
Oh, it’s those Bitcoins again!
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:46:58
wow Bitcoin sucks ass today
@_date: 2019-08-21 11:50:52
No worries, just Bitcoins!
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:54:21
Good morning, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:06:33
He fixes her plumbing?
@_date: 2019-08-12 16:24:58
But at least we had fun on the way.
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:32:17
When we all pull together, our energy can overcome any obstacle!
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:02:54
Bitcoin needs a mascot. Like how USD has George Washington, people need a goofy image they can associate with Bitcoin. Maybe Bitty the Bitcoin poodle or Splash, the Bitcoin whale.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:05:26
No one knows what Satoshi looks like, you can’t make a mascot out of that.
@_date: 2019-08-10 14:34:49
Goodbye, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:17:09
I’m just in it for the memes.
@_date: 2019-10-15 13:39:59
Good morning!
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:00:21
@_date: 2019-10-29 17:54:49
I just talked with Whale Steve and he is buying big this evening.
@_date: 2019-10-29 11:51:00
Good morning Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:42:42
It’s Friday, that’s what’s up. Citizens of Bitcoin: focus all your energy on getting through the day and stop fretting about the markets.
@_date: 2019-10-31 13:12:49
Shits about to get spooky!
@_date: 2019-10-02 17:37:39
Tune for me to buy the dip!
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:40:49
Hello, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:08:03
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:14:25
Not those Bitcoins :(
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:33:17
Wow, Bitcoin looks fucked.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:00:34
Sweet Christmas
@_date: 2019-08-08 11:50:47
Good morning, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:36:43
What up, BA?
@_date: 2019-10-15 12:55:05
What up, BA?
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:16:45
Okay, everyone just relax and get ready for the weekend. Don't even think about Bitcoin for 72 hours.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:07:38
Okay yeah party people, everybody just chill for a while and enjoy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:03:47
What up, BA?
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:45:12
What up, BA?
@_date: 2019-10-10 13:36:32
I’m spreading wisdom and joy to the people of Bitcoin today.
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:50:01
People of Bitcoin, I have an announcement: **ALL** bodies are beach bodies. No more diets, only riots!
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:10:52
The heck is going on in here?
@_date: 2019-08-05 12:53:02
This is a critical week for Bitcoin, everyone needs to focus their energy on positivity and harmony.
@_date: 2019-10-02 17:37:23
What up, BA?
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:14:33
I know.
@_date: 2019-10-25 12:04:20
Happy Friday, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-16 11:49:16
If BOFA is enacted next week, the extreme volatility could certainly return.
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:12:30
These are dark times for the people of Bitcoin. Stay positive!
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:32:54
Do not be tempted by this dark sorcery.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:07:51
Just don’t tell the IRS and it’s cool.
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:56:16
Good morning, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-09 13:34:18
I think you’re full of shit.
@_date: 2019-08-29 11:50:27
It's over 9000!
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:24:21
I wish I got in earlier.
@_date: 2019-10-18 13:14:49
Everybody so grouchy today. Just enjoy the weekend and nice fall weather.
@_date: 2019-08-01 12:15:54
Citizens of Bitcoin:
Yesterday, I asked you for your energy, and together we made it to $10k. Today, I call on everyone to just chill out for  a while and have fun.
@_date: 2019-10-23 11:53:09
Why didn't you buy it with Bitcoin?
Oh... right...
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:47:53
Happy Friday, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-29 17:12:34
As some random guy on the internet I can 100% confirm there is definitely a big pump coming.
@_date: 2019-10-15 11:52:36
Happy Tuesday, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-08 13:20:04
People still watch South Park?
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:33:17
What if I just want to make easy money?
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:44:38
What up, BA?
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:35:40
This is an amazingly dumb take.
@_date: 2019-10-10 13:00:10
A whalepump!
@_date: 2019-10-10 12:59:36
Quote of the day: “Everyone chill out and enjoy the long weekend.” —Me
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:10:29
What up, BA!
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:55:07
I meant your take is dumb. Ofc gov’t could make it illegal to use bitcoin if people really wanted that.
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:08:54
Good job, Hong Kong!
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:51:52
I’m so baggy I shit Litecoin.
@_date: 2019-06-04 14:21:52
Man, chill the f out and enjoy bitcoin, dude.
@_date: 2019-06-18 16:29:49
TA is bullshit
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:11:06
We got some movement!
@_date: 2019-08-27 12:02:38
Good morning, Bitcoin!

Hello, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-06 16:36:16
What up, BA?
@_date: 2019-02-06 16:43:00
That seems uncalled for.
@_date: 2019-02-05 13:52:38
HAPPY NEW YEAR Y’ALL
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:07:50
I got to thinking: what if I’m the real Satoshi and I just don’t know it?
@_date: 2019-02-26 16:23:10
My crypto rhymes flow rap it up like Bazooka Joe
@_date: 2019-02-05 14:44:42
Good day to chill out and enjoy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:03:01
You actually heard this conversation?
@_date: 2019-02-08 22:51:40
Just ignore that haters and buy as much Bitcoin as you possibly can, imho.
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:48:54
I wrote a poem about Bitcoin. It wasn't very good, so I deleted it. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:18:58
I don’t see any US dollar books at all, makes you think.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:27:30
Guess what, I don’t care! Life is too short to worry about those Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-02-15 15:14:50
It means we can all pretend Bitcoin is taking off. 
@_date: 2019-12-06 14:06:45
Buenos dias, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:21:52
I think this place is pretty chill.
@_date: 2019-12-20 14:47:41
Feliz Navidad!
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:01:34

@_date: 2019-10-06 20:36:29
Too scary for me, I’m just gonna watch from afar.

@_date: 2019-02-13 14:39:00
What if this is actually the moon and we just don’t know it?
@_date: 2019-02-07 13:03:55
Can't fleece the sheep a second time.
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:36:36
Bitcoin went down 10%.
@_date: 2019-12-18 13:59:23
What up, Lemo?
@_date: 2019-04-01 11:51:37
Wow these bitcoins are the real deal after all. 
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:35:33

@_date: 2019-04-12 13:27:32
Whale Steve is not your dancing monkey. He does what he does.
@_date: 2019-04-11 11:50:49
Goodbye, moon!
@_date: 2019-04-24 13:18:24
Good morning, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-04-09 13:20:05
The whole thing falls apart, but let’s not worry about that now.
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:33:48
Wow Bitcoins
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:01:24
Told you guys we’d see a pump after Russian New Year.
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:20:52
That’s more than as many as four tens.
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:59:46
Forget it, Jack. It’s Flippytown.
@_date: 2019-01-28 14:51:46
Dogecoin isn't a private entity with a capitalist agenda. It's a new form of currency with a lot of copycats, which confuse the issue to the layman and cause him to cautiously decide to to get on board. When we see the Alts (especially scam-coin Bitcoin) dying off, I think DOGE will take off.
@_date: 2019-01-10 14:10:52
The git up and go just got up and went.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:10:24
Waiting for everyone to flood the market with their bags of bitcoin. Then I will sell my bags and be rich!
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:53:11

@_date: 2019-01-21 15:19:15
I remember when Bitcoin was a thing.
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:47:14
How about don’t play the amateur financial advisor game with people you work with.
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:07:58
Wow, bicoin looks fucked.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:42:43
Second floor, menswear and —oh hello, Mr. Bitcoin. Going... down???
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:43:15
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:07:31
I don’t even care, tbh, I just chill out and enjoy the fall weather.
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:59:08
I love that meme!

And the steak on your plate is filled with chemicals.”
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:52:58
That’s a sex joke!

My prophecy: Bitcoins will be awesomesauce in 2020.

Who knows quantum, only Bitcoin.

Seems legit!
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:58:00
I don't even into Bitcoin, to be honest.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:45:19
That’s what everyone else is doing.

Nobody. Ever. Knows. What’s. Going. On.
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:18:20
That’s a great show!
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:06:05
Bitcoin looks like it caught a prison yard beatdown.
@_date: 2019-09-06 11:49:11
Oh dunk, here comes those Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-09-27 11:51:12
Happy Friday, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:15:36
I guess we all have things to account for.
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:54:04
That thing from Johnny Mnemonic where he plugs a Zip drive into his own brain.

Can’t stop won’t stop smoking mad ‘ism.
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:37:03
Don’t feel bad! As long as you learn you will make mistakes!
@_date: 2019-09-05 13:41:10

I’m dumping everything at $5,950, that’s the smart way to beat the herd.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:05:18
Who cares about shorts, just chillax and enjoy bitcoins.

Who cares about the price in dollars. If you wanted dollars you should have HODLed dollars. You buy bitcoins for frictionless smart contracts and technology and shizz.

Seems totally ethical and cool to me.
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:24:48
Screw that I just want to be rich
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:46:43
Who needs money when you have bitcoins and smart contracts and shit. Just chill out and enjoy your bitcoins.

Good morning, Bitcoin!

This guy knows what’s up.
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:51:28
Fuck that noise. Borrow as much as you conceivably can and HODL.
