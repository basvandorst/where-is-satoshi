You think BTC wont be back at 20k in 20 years?! Why are you here? And what do you know? Not much if you really think that.

btw: Nice shades! 
@_date: 2019-03-30 12:17:15
Nick Szabo, solved Double spending and created Bitgold (referred to in BTC whitepaper.) Maybe he didn't code it (he certainly could have) but at least he created the pieces of a puzzle that was solved by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi Dorian Nakamoto (who is math wiz at local university) lived a few blocks away from Hal Finney, who received the first mining reward, after Nakamoto himself. They where all linked to ''Cypher punks''. Do i need to say more?
@_date: 2018-10-29 09:14:12
Not that I'm a pro, when you opened bitcoin core there was an option to restore a wallet, then you can choose your wallet.dat file, if its not password locked it should retrieve the wallet and start updating the blocks. Thats what I think. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:13:56
So if you trade your way to riches for example, thats by doing nothing? or buying bitcoin in 2011-2018 is doing nothing?I never said that one would get rich by doing nothing or owning bitcoin for that matter. Let the time tell us what will happen.

Great Post!

Depends who you would ask i guess? People who sit out this bear market don't do it because they want to go to zero and it's not like btc(-trading) is easy to understand, than it would be obvious for alot more people. And there even wouldn't be a bear market now, ''normal'' people don't ubderstand economics/fiats and the true value of bitcoin.  
Time will be our (seg)witness.
@_date: 2019-04-27 19:53:08
I think it's not really a bad idea (since there is not much left to save fiats), but it's a good advocate for a Bitcoin standard. People shouldn't be the ones suffering from austerity. It should be them, the bankers and the upper class, using this fiat system to milk the public dry.  
People with power will be able to lock their wealth away in a tax haven. Just as normal tax, the people will suffer, not the rich dudes.

Bitcoin is a device for banking the unbanked, whithout intermediaries and 3rd party centralised entities. 
Thats what its aiming to be when tech matures, keep that in mind!
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:02:52
Congrats!! You have a bright future ahead, im sure :)   
Long way to go for me, but i enjoy the ride and I'm grateful for the experience, hehehe!
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:45:25
hehehe, Yeah I know thanks for reminding me, thats part of my point also. You dont want to go to the moon with CZ so before block halving you have time enough to buy a hardware wallet and steer your own rocket!   
Binance withdrawls will open soon, They don't want a bad rep as some other exchanges.  
Lovely song isn't it!
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:18:37
These people have the opportunity but they miss the balls and understanding, thats why they have that attitude, not about the potential financial gains, because if it was only that, they would ask the info to get in, but they already tried that and figured out its above their heads.  
I bought my bulk close to ath, fml, but I'm glad to say I survived the bear market and I'm here mostly for the tech, not the quick gaines, so I'm curious where this next cycle takes me, my spacesuit is on.   
Godspeed people.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:21:30
I'm sure you all are aware of the genius 4 year cycle, Hodl or go home and cry to mama.  
since I bought at 16.600 euro on 17 dec. '17 I want to thank you for your sympathy and your encouraging math, i'm at 50% now. was to afraid for the bears to trade, now the bulls also start to scare me, but lets thank them for that!
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:15:09
How is this not confiscating; ''The interest rate cut would transmit to bank deposits, loans, and bonds.'' ?  
I see the point you make, but what you say aplies now (because of inflation alone), not with the proposed ''negativ interest rates'' linked in the article above.  
Its simply another way to steal from people, instead of rewarding them for saving, they reward them for consuming, and if you dont, you pay extra for your savings.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:42:06
Ok thanks, its only half the answer though ;)
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:22:10
The potential to be used one day, i'd rather spend 0.1 btc on a lambo then 20!   
Here in The NL btc is unknown on the streets, so hard to spend anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:04:31
Well, i guess you are right. And I understand your argument. But I dont want this, its what capitalism is about, right? People should have capital to use, so they can make choices in consuming, saving and investing. The banks are the non-productive ones here, all they do is steal a share of the hard earned money from the people for their ''service'' (shady practices)

He uses historical data, facts and statements to come to a narative that was successful in the past for a previous technology that has similarities to crypto, but whats fundamentally insane about crypto that its an asset class on its own.
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:52:17
Ok great! Thats what I'm focussing on aswell. Still considering to buy his TI indicator though. Did you take his workshop and do you use his indicator?

your harddrive can store malware that can steal your private key or something like that and its vulnerable for hacks because its online ''hot'', a hardware wallet, is offline ''cold'' and has a UI to send and receive funds, the same as electrum, with the great benefit of the encrypted cold storage. You can only send funds by manually pressing a button, so not hackeble.

Plot twist, They allready produced them and are mining themselves, q4 2019 they will come on the market as new.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:01:40
yeah but this is not public rate. Its from the central bank to commercial banks. They try to stimulate the economy by paying them for more lending and spending. So they print extra money to give to the banks ontop of what they want/have to use as liquidity &gt; for mortgages/personal loans/business loans and so on. This is the only reason why construction is busy, because borrowing money for development is at an all time low, all for stimulating. Its madness.  
The fiats have started a race to the bottom that is unstoppable, they can only delay, and make life harder for them who dont have the power to print their own money. Inflation will devour us all, Luckily Satoshi found a way out!

Why bitcoin?
my short answer; A-political ''currency'' (Bitcoin can be what ever we want it to be), secured by math, code and miners instead of incompetent banksters and their promises and armies.
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:30:58
I agree, And I'm not joking!   
When you look at the Stock-to-flow ratio &gt; deflationary aspect of mining, its a no-brainer. 
That the price will reflect the drastic effect of the halvings.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:01:27
100k around Christmas, dont know which yet though. (Eventually even 1 million, i really think that, no joke)
Why; you allready know if you're here i guess. If not; First digital cumshot in the bullseye.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:42:13
They plan to make negative interest work, so savings will be confiscated, can you believe it? I can, BUY BITCOIN!!
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:27:33
Fiats (usd-eur) won't survive in this system without war, lets hope next 10 years bitcoin will prove its a way to come together by understanding the effects of an A-political currency (when we do the price will reflect it), where no army will have to defend the values of its currency and its power.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:03:20
If you mean PART of history then Yes.
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:32:42
I hope I can/will a few years later maybe. If the usd will still be there at least!
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:03:17
It can always be worse broh! The glass is half full, still.  
Did you take a loan around 19k, or fomo'd in around the same price NO, YOU tried to do the right thing (in contrary to some people (dont name names)), so don't blame yourself!
I think you only spend money you could afford to loose (in contrary to some people (dont name names))
Epic meme though :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:31:32
Yeah you're right. I thought there was an extra step. It's insane to go from 2 to 3 then right? Looking at the seize of the milky way.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:29:03
aah sweet, did you learn yourself by practice, or joined a course or something? 
What are your favourite indicators? 
Do you still trade pennystocks or all-in crypto now?
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:25:54
Soo, in your title you say ''now'' and in the meme its ''never'' thats not cool!  
Besides anyone selling or shorting bitcoin, is not in his right mind, lights are on green for moon.   
Countdown is starting, T minus 378 days  
If your coins are on Binance you hitch a ride with CZ as pilot, I trust him as far as I know him, but I rather fly my own rocket!

I like your ambition! Currency or fashion are no must to get to 1, allthough it'll speed up the process to get there.
Harvesting the power of our planet is needed to get to 1. 
sun is 2 (with a [dysonsphere]( for example), solarsystem is 3.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:39:59
Imo, BTC is what tcp/ip was for internet. Bitcoin = Blockchain (decentralised-trustless-global-p2p network), the rest is simply not, except for the forks (but they don't get the developments or penatration BTC gets)
When? As hyperinflation kicks in, during next big economic crash, when people will drown in rising prices and learn they have been fooled by banks and governments, like Venezuela, Greece, Cyprus or Zimbabwe.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:32:47
