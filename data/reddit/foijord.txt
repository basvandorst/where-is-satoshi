Bitcoin is not affected significantly by PR in the long term. Bitcoin will succeed or fail based on the algorithms behind it, i.e. it's true value. What the bitcoin community needs to focus on is better clients. Bitcoin will not go mainstream until the client software becomes easy to use. Think of the average person. Think how stupid he/she is. Then realize that half of the people out there are even dumber than that. For them to use bitcoin, it will have to be user-friendly. Simple as that.

I'm shocked that Krugman doesn't seem to understand this; he simply doesn't know what money is. Gold and BTC is money simply because of their properties. Paper is only accepted as money because the government can send you to jail if you do not pay your tax with it.

That wiki is what has me wondering. It says that miners doesn't have to accept the transaction and include it in a block. If you have received lots of small amounts, and then combine them to a larger transaction, you will have a transaction with a large data size, and if you don't pay the fee, why would any miner accept that transaction? This also means that all bitcoins are not equal; if someone pays you with 1000 fractions of a bitcoin, instead of with 1 bitcoin, it will cost you more to spend those fractions, meaning they are less worth.

I don't like that you're supposed to put folds across the private key. That could make it hard to read many years from now, when the paper is unfolded again.
