Perhaps.  
But that's analogous to asking "why do I have to pay my barber to move those scissors around my head (when I can do it myself)?" or "why do I have to pay my employees to push keys on a keyboard (when I can do it myself)?".
What's the answer? Because that's what they politely ask in order to do something for you? Because both parties are free to ask what they want from the other party in order to provide a service?  
At this point I am not sure what he's __really__ trying to ask.  
Perhaps he's simply demanding that people give him free stuff.

No, I would not say that.  
Most protocols improve in small incremental steps. If you check the RFCs you can find out that all the suites of protocol used in TCP/IP got modified/improved/refined a lot through the years (and it's still going on).


Well, I have no idea what your parameters are for considering two protocols "independent". E.g. TCP and UDP seem pretty independent to me, but you can still find ways to make them work together for whatever reason (e.g. encapsulating protocols within protocols).
Also consider that, as far as I understood so far, Sidechains will not allow the decentralized coupling of Bitcoin with just about __any__ possible protocol. But only with protocols specifically designed to be Bitcoin-Sidechain-compatible.  
So Sidechains are not a magic card that will allow Bitcoin to possibly incorporate any hypothetical blockchain-related thing that will be invented in the future.


No idea what you mean here.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:24:46
I like that. But I still think that bitcoin.org should somehow hint to the fact that the "open" in open source refers to modification and not just reading. Otherwise people who don't know what "open source" mean might still think "the source is shared, so it's open source!".
So, perhaps, something like: *Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet is a restricted shared source wallet for Android whose source code is not open for modification but is available for inspection and it's designed for security, speed, and ease of use.*

In information technology, you should not base the security of a network on the fact that to you it seems irrational for an attacker to attack the network.
You cannot exclude that:
1. An attacker might have so much money that they do not give a shit about losing money
2. Circumstances might exist that could make attacking the network more profitable. Being unable to imagine such a situation is not proof that it cannot happen.
And, I forgot number 3:
3\. The attacker might simply be irrational. (IRL analogy: suicide attacks do happen)
@_date: 2015-06-16 08:51:45
I would write it as clearly as possible, since many people do not know the official definition of open source:
_Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet, while not being strictly open source, is a wallet for Android whose source code is available for inspection and it's designed for security, speed, and ease of use. [...]_

Where in the book does it say he had not tried heroin because he did not like the pusher who was trying to sell it to him?
I only found this:


when you could afford it. Not smack, though-Micky, my potential initiator, had been just a little too eager for
me to go through with that. Said he could do it blindfolded, but he was shaking like a faulty engine when he
said it. Maybe he was just cold; we were standing in a meat freezer in the back of the deli where he worked,
and it couldn’t have been more than twenty degrees in there. But he didn’t look like he was shaking from the
cold. Looked more like he was sweating, his face shiny and tight. He had pulled out the needle and the
tubing, and I’d looked at him standing there, surrounded by big slabs of salami and roast beef, and right
then an image popped into my head of an air bubble, shiny and round like a pearl, rolling quietly through a
vein and stopping my heart….
  


Except the highs hadn’t been about that, me trying to prove what a down brother I was. Not by then, 
anyway. I got high for just the opposite effect, something that could push questions of who I was out of my
mind, something that could flatten out the landscape of my heart, blur the edges of my memory. I had
discovered that it didn’t make any difference whether you smoked reefer in the white classmate’s sparkling
new van, or in the dorm room of some brother you’d met down at the gym, or on the beach with a couple of
Hawaiian kids who had dropped out of school and now spent most of their time looking for an excuse to
brawl. Nobody asked you whether your father was a fat-cat executive who cheated on his wife or some laidoff
joe who slapped you around whenever he bothered to come home. You might just be bored, or alone.
Everybody was welcome into the club of disaffection. And if the high didn’t solve whatever it was that was
getting you down, it could at least help you laugh at the world’s ongoing folly and see through all the
hypocrisy and bullshit and cheap moralism.


were beginning to play themselves out, the difference that color and money made after all, in who survived,
how soft or hard the landing when you finally fell. Of course, either way, you needed some luck. That’s what
Pablo had lacked, mostly, not having his driver’s license that day, a cop with nothing better to do than to
check the trunk of his car. Or Bruce, not finding his way back from too many bad acid trips and winding up
in a funny farm. Or Duke, not walking away from the car wreck….
Extrapolating from it that he did not try heroin because he did not like the pusher who was trying to sell it to him (and not a bunch of other more important reasons) is rather silly.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:06:17


Need, yes.  
Should? Not sure.
By simply removing any reference to "open source" you miss the chance to potentially educate an uninformed reader about the difference between "open source" and "source available".
As you can see from this thread alone, many people mistakenly interpret "open source" as in "open for reading" instead of "open for modification".
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:04:33


Possibly, because people just claim "network effect" just to sway opinions in favor of whatever product they are being fanboys about?  
They are not trying to be objective or factually correct, they just want to appeal to your emotions in order for you to do something (i.e. join their ranks).
They will either cite examples where network effect worked while ignoring examples where it didn't, or they will simply reinterpret history (in the case of TCP/IP) as to hide the fact that it's some ever evolving protocol (just think of how different IPv6 is going to be from IPv4, even if they decided to baptize it with the name "IP" for obvious reasons).

You are making a mistake here: the attack is insanely expensive __for somebody who is not already a miner__.  
If somebody is already a miner attempting this attack will cost him only the missed revenue in case the huge mined block gets orphaned for being too slow to propagate: the cost of creating 100k+ transactions is completely negligible (you do not need to recreate them at each attempt, but only every time the attack actually succeeds).

In this subreddit, the general mood is that not recognizing Bitcoin as your one and only currency is analogous to attacking it.
@_date: 2015-06-05 12:58:56
Good question.  
I have no idea, especially since, sometimes, the difference between "this is a new protocol" and "this is a new version of an old protocol" gets quite blurred.
For example, I think that ICMPv6 is quite a different protocol from ICMP(v4) because ICMPv6 is way more integral to IPv6 than ICMPv4 is to IPv4.  
So, perhaps, that might one be one of the latest addition to the thing we label "TCP/IP".  
I don't know how long ago it was added, but probably not more than 20 years ago since that's the time IPv6 itself was taking shape.
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:59:27




The difference here is that you cannot even provide a probability estimate.
On the other hand, it's not that difficult to come up with situations in which a miner could profit from attacking the network.  
E.g. if they are paid by a competing network to do so.  
Or if they have a debt in bitcoins with somebody.  
Or, even, if a mining pool gets taken over against their will (e.g. security compromise).


That sounds interesting, especially since this argument begins with the idea that Bitcoin as it is now must be changed because it risks collapsing once blocks get filled at full capacity all the time.  
So, technically, the side of "let's not change anything" is the one that is not worried.
@_date: 2014-12-15 09:46:23


Yes, I understood that.  
The change I meant was only graphical: as I see it, the value for each month is centred within the horizontal span of the month, and they are all connected with lines that act as a form of visual interpolation; I think it would be cool to have such visual aid at the beginning and end of each year as well (plot a line as if a virtual January exists to the right of December, but trim it in half; do the same with a virtual December to the left of January).

I actually pull Bitcoin sources from git, and compile them myself.
This whole mess of enabling arbitrary blacklist patches by default is making me want to abandon Gentoo altogether, though.  
Because now I wonder what other sort of arbitrary blacklists I have silently enabled on my whole system.
And, no, making the purpose of a patch explicit is not a good solution, in my opinion: an average desktop install has thousands of packages, and having to watch out for notices about unexpected deviation from upstream behaviour is not feasible.

Not only that: even if a TCP connection were a pure download with no data sent upstream, TCP itself still requires you to send ACK packets to acknowledge data reception. If your uplink saturates, your ACK packet rate slows down, thus slowing down even your download-only connections.
PS: in theory this can be mitigated a lot by using a very good router with decent rules for upstream packet prioritization... in practice all consumer-grade routers I have seen suck at this.

But this answers the main question: yes, it will increase centralization.
But on the other hand I cannot see how this can be avoided at all if we expect Bitcoin to grow, given the *every-node-must-record-everything* nature of the blockchain ledger.


I am not sure how that contradicts what he said.

But, eventually, transaction fees will have to rise: by procrastinating their rise in the name of attracting more people who expect no transaction fees you will actually end up entangling more people into a system they do not really want to be part of.

~~You would not need to be a miner to perform a one-to-one version of such attack: since full nodes should verify all blocks received in order to tell if they are valid or not, an attacker only needs to connect directly to the victim node and send a huge block (even one with an invalid nonce) and have it run out of memory as it attempts to verify it.~~

Indeed, but except for changes in the protocol to allow a shitload of transactions per block (which is supposedly in the works), either we will have "less security" than now (in the form of hash rate compared to technological achievements) or we will be paying that much in transaction costs.

Signing a message requires revealing the public key associated to your address, the same way as when you send out BTC from the address.

@_date: 2015-08-29 13:33:18


It would not be at a known fixed rate.  
It would be at a known but ever-decreasing rate, inversely proportional with time.
E.g. imagine creating 100 coins each year:
* Year 0: 0 coins exist, 100 coins are created
* Year 1: 100 exist (inflation compared to last year cannot be computed, because you would divide by zero), 100 are created
* Year 2: 200 exist (inflation compared to last year: 100/100 = 100%), 100 are created
* Year 3: 300 exist (inflation compared to last year: 100/200 = 50%), 100 are created
* Year 4: 400 exist (inflation compared to last year: 100/300 = 33%), 100 are created
* ...
* Year n: n*100 exist (inflation compared to last year: 1/(n-1))
So in 100 years, inflation would be 1%, and in 1000 years it would be 0.1%, etc
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:12:42


It's not like that.
The issues here are two:
1. If you do anything that can somehow tie your real identity to one of your addresses (e.g. signing a message and sending it from your real IP for the whole world to see) then your bitcoins lose anonymity because from that moment onward they can be easily linked to you.
2. If the asymmetric cipher used by Bitcoin ever gets broken (by math) in a (possibly remote) future, your public key might get used to retrieve your private key. This could happen years or decades or centuries from now, or perhaps never. This is why it's better to never use the same address twice: it's an extra layer of future-proof security.

And you cannot even blame the central headquarters. And there is no restructuring the central headquarters could do to prevent that except, perhaps, being extremely stingy to everyone and not letting them have a reserve to begin with.

Technically, it's possible that for extremely low targets (i.e. very high difficulty) there might be no possible solutions.
So, yeah, it's possible that some blocks cannot be mined. It's, of course, difficult to prove or disprove.
Now that I think about it... once we ever reach extremely low targets, the relationship between __actual__ difficulty and target (i.e. nominal Bitcoin difficulty) might stop being linear anyway, since the number of `possible solution` / `acceptable solutions` would slowly deviate from 1.

Even if Bitcoin were using MD5, this chosen prefix attack cannot be applied to Bitcoin addresses (public keys have fixed length, you cannot really append an arbitrary string to them) nor to mining or the merkle trees (same reason: they use double-hashing so the second hash is the hash of something of fixed length, and you cannot know what the first hash is unless you also break preimage resistance, which this attack does not break at all).
PS: actually, Bitcoin addresses also uses double-hashing, so that's yet another reason why it won't work.

It's also even less likely that a preimage of SHA256(SHA256()) exists for all values between 0 and 2^(256)-1
Let's call these impossible-to-invert images "gaps".
The lower the target, the more "gaps" there might be in your acceptable range of solutions.  
So, the lower the target, the more your actual difficulty diverges from the expected difficulty (because the expected difficulty that is used to compute the target does not take the occurrence of these "gaps" into play).
PS: It's also even more unlikely that a preimage of SHA256(SHA256()) exists for all values between 0 and 2^(256)-1 and such that the preimage looks like a Bitcoin header.

From what I understood so far, for Sidechains to actually work in a trustless and decentralized way it would require Bitcoin script to be Turing-complete in order to be able to verify any possible altchain verification algorithm that could ever be invented.
The only way I can see Sidechains to function otherwise (i.e. without Bitcoin script being Turing-complete) is by trusting 3rd parties to verify that the equivalent altcoin has become unspendable... or by limiting what sort of protocol the altchains can use.

Note that I am talking about ridiculously high nominal difficulty. For example, in case the SHA algorithm gets completely broken, causing miners to become optimized to science fiction levels.
Anyway, even in such case: no, it would be only temporarily.  
You can still fork older blocks and create a new chain. Older blocks would have an easier difficulty.
If what I am saying ever comes true, it simply means that cryptography and technology have reached the "maximum mining speed" of Bitcoin, and the hashrate cannot increase further without stumbling upon impossible-to-solve blocks.

I partially disagree.
There is another factor you are not considering: mining centralization.
Back when I first got my BTCs, the idea of mining your own BTC was still viable.  
Then even after the first ASICs flooded into the market, it was still relatively easy to find people willing to sell you their BTC for EUR.  
For example,  was still full of people wanting to sell. Now on bitcoin-otc order book, there is only one serious person that's selling BTC for EUR.
I finished spending all my BTC a while ago, and every now and then I consider getting some but I always end up being discouraged by how much effort it is __now__ required to get BTC. And I am not even a newcomer.
TL;DR: there are also technological/design/non-political reasons, and it also affects old users.

I fail to see how the internet is "dumb" and "decentralized" when compared to the phone network.
The only substantial "decentralization" I see is that, on the Internet, routing devices can also act as source/destination devices, while on the old phone network only the end devices can (as far as I know).  
On the other hand, the Internet is much more "intelligent" than the phone network when you compare the amount of features included in its basic protocols (ip/tcp/udp/icmp) alone.
A better example of decentralized network would be a mesh network... but I am not sure he could claim that to be "dumb" either.
TL;DR: this argument is not convincing me that "decentralized network" implies "not intelligent network" or vice versa

But it does not need to be done one customer at a time.
Picture a multi-sig anonymous but centralized market.  
For every genuine vendor, the market can also create virtual vendors that act as middlemen.  
When the virtual vendor gets a buy request, it accepts and then creates a sell request to a real vendor. And then let the transaction run with no scam.    
This can go on until the exact moment when the total amount of pending transactions from all the virtual vendors exceeds a big enough threshold and then the market closes down and runs with the pending money.
To prevent identifying vendors as virtual, the market could add slight delays, and add a slight variation in price across all its virtual vendors (to average 0 in total).
PS: this could be prevented by having vendors send a "signature" with their goods when they ship them, but I am pretty sure vendors would not like to do that when they are selling something illegal, cause it actually decreases their anonymity.

That does not let you "see" that the chronology has not been tampered with.
Think of it this way:  
I know I will receive a message A and after a month I will receive another message B.
After the events, how could I "prove" to you that I received A and B in that order and roughly one month apart?  
Showing you just the stored messages will not work.  
On the other hand, if I used a PoW algorithm to "stamp" the two messages over and over I could at least give you a rough estimate of how much time/resources I spent on the messages, which can demonstrate some chronology up to a certain degree of confidence.
A private blockchain could be used as a timestamping machine that lets external observers see (with a certain degree of certainty that is never 100%) that it has not been manipulated.

But, you see, if ultimately the orders are finalized between the two users transacting with each other, how can you enforce that a matched order goes through without either party quitting?
I can already imagine people using that technique to pump the price up or down: create buy/sell orders at a higher/lower price than your desired sell/buy order... and don't finalize them when matched. That way your competitors that are offering a lower sell price (or higher buy price) will get matched with your useless orders and will not know that until it's too late.

By using that point of view, I see the smarts in the phone network as being the users.  
The telephone network does not understand speech.
Or, let's use fax machines.  
The telephone network does not understand the fax transmission protocol, only the fax machine knows how to render the image.
If the Internet is a "dumb" transport layer I fail to see how the phone network is "smart" since phone switching seems to have even less features than an average Internet node.  
And both networks are hierarchically shaped, as far as I know.


But, notice how in this example, the intelligent feature you want to add is nothing but a routing feature.  
You could implement a non-routing feature, like HTTP over pure telephone lines (it would be clumsy, but possible, like a glorified fax machine).

Not all 27 EU countries are in the Eurozone. So some of the intra-EU commerce (i.e. some of the 70%) will actually involve the exchange rate.

The way I imagined it, every genuine vendor would still appear normally. The virtual vendors would be additional vendors that simply forward to real vendors.




Yeah but sending such a signature would help identifying the vendor's identity if some entity is able to inspect multiple shipments. That's why I think it would not be a perfect solution for an illegal market.
Now that I think about it, perhaps it could be solved this way:  
Seller publishes his public key on his profile. Buyer generates a key pair for the transaction. When seller ships the goods, he includes a signature made with his private key and encrypts the whole signature with the public key of the buyer.  
Now the buyer can verify that the one shipping goods is the same entity he transacted with, and anyone else inspecting the goods in transit cannot even read the signature.

In the light of all this, I think that, to be ideal, your patch should:
1. Always have a manually editable list. I think the performance loss due to a dynamic list is quite negligible. Even the most lousy computer should be able to handle that overhead, even with hundred of thousands of transactions per second.  
I am saying this because, like I mentioned, I kinda agree with your reason for filtering some of those transactions. But, for example, I disagree with your choice of blacklisting the whole 1bank* range of vanity addresses: "bank" is a too common money-related word.  
When I saw your patch months ago, this is one of the things that put me off from using it. Such issue would be completely solved by the list being dynamic (not to mention, it would give more freedom of choice to everyone).
2. Always pop up the settings tab at first usage __and__ whenever the list is changed, so that a user can review the new filtering rules.
3. I think it should be best if as little as possible were hardcoded about your filter: e.g. it should be able to pull from various user-specified lists defined as URLs (like AdBlock works, I think).  
Then you could just hardcode the URL to your personally maintained list as default choice for the user.
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:10:58


That's not overly relevant.
SpamAssassin and Postgrey are spam filters that a user consciously installs.
What you are doing with Bitcoin is adding a filter on a program that, generally, is not expected to filter by address like your filter does.  
A better analogy would be, for example, a distribution packaging Firefox or Chromium so that the browser automatically refuses to connect to certain hostnames, according to some hardcoded list.
Now, your whole moral defence seems to be all about how your patch is entirely optional, since it can be disabled.  
Which is technically true.  
But you perfectly know that a lot of people will not notice your patch, and therefore will not disable it.  
And that's exactly why you want it to be on by default: you are exploiting ignorance in order to spread your personal view on how Bitcoin should behave regarding such "services" that use the blockchain as a communication channel.
Now, I actually agree with that point of view: if I ran a full node I would gladly block those addresses myself.  
But I completely disagree with your modus operandi. You should let people choose to apply those filters on their own: announce that your patch exists, announce the optional use flag, but do not turn it on by default.

I think I understand his point of view.
Calling a set of private keys "a wallet" is a bit of a misnomer if you compare it to how all other Bitcoin "wallets" work.
What I mean is: a Bitcoin "wallet" is, generally, a program or a device capable of generating an unlimited amount of addresses.
If we call "paper wallet" a limited set of addresses backed up on paper, it would be unsafe to use them the same way we use any non-paper Bitcoin "wallet" (because address reusage).
On the other hand, the backed up seed for HD address generation is functionally equivalent to all the non-paper Bitcoin "wallets" out there (e.g. bitcoin-qt).

E.g. a box with a single rock in it: takes any input, and gives the input + one rock as output.
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:33:24
I partially disagree.
Language is not immutable, and Bitcoin is still obscure enough in the grand scheme of things: pushing for a change of definition might alienate some of the current users, but it could avoid confusion for future users (especially those who do not care about the intricacies of how addresses and wallets work).
I agree that "paper ECDSA private keys" is a horrible mouthful, though. Perhaps just "paper key" vs "paper wallet" could be enough?  
With "wallet" representing "something that can retrieve/generate potentially infinite addresses".

Bitcoin does not transfer funds to/from your bank account.
On the other hand, if you are considering your Bitcoin wallet as the equivalent of a bank account, why are you not considering your PayPal wallet as equivalent of a bank account? After all, you are able to spend directly from your PayPal balance, with merchants who support Paypal.  
In that case PayPal has always been instantaneous (what it lacks compared to Bitcoin is trustlessness).

I have no idea what you are saying here. Can you elaborate?
I do know that Bitcoin filters off most scripts except those who fall within some accepted categories (found this out when I wanted to understand the scripting capabilities of Bitcoin).
But, what do you mean with "addresses do not exist at the spamfiltering level"?  
Isn't your spam filter comparing the first 4 bytes of an address in order to decide whether to exclude it or not?
E.g. last time I checked your patch, it refused all addresses from `1banjzGrdzQGVEyfRwBtvfeAS2tB9cA5Y` to `1banm2uSECcbQLbKtBoZSGcapxmkyAvwX` (so, all the 1bank* vanity addresses plus some accidental ones).


Seriously? That's something I didn't know.  
Can you point me to the source code of FF or Chromium where this blacklist resides?  
Or, give me some notably blacklisted hostnames so I can test it and/or grep the sources to find them.


Efforts such as? A notice during emerge?  
Or have you done something so that a user will be warned of the presence of your patch at least during the first execution?
Also, have you considered giving the users the possibility to see and edit the blacklist at runtime?


What sort of method have you used to determine how likely users want your patch?  
Do you have any statistics?
