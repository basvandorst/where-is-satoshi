@_date: 2018-08-18 12:54:36
What are the cons of using this wallet in general, my friend uses this wallet to store his bitcoin and ethereum
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:58:14
Is it segwit compatible?
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:25:59

Haha, friends were convincing me to sell all of my BTC when it hit the lowest but i bought a tiny bit more. HODL
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:17:16
Risk of falling or risk of selling low? Its bitcoin, once you sell, either it can come crashing down or it may rise, everything is un-predictable.
