I dig it! The only thing I'd say is to just be aware of it being there if you entertain often/have parties where friends of friends or others that you may not know too well come over. It's probably safe to say that if someone sees that, they'll most likely assume you have some coin. Might not be too big of an issue now, but when we keep climbing and climbing, getting closer and closer to the moon, it may. ;)

It's ok to be scared of revolutionary things. ;)

That increased "harsh rate" though! ��

I see what you did there. ��

Very well written, eloquent, and explanative.

I completely agree. It's amazing how people can't seem to understand that things change with time and so can your views of them. When I first learned of WikiLeaks I thought it was a good thing for transparency and to drive proper behavior of various governments. Later on, I realized its mission wasn't unbiased transparency, but rather manipulation of certain sides, primarily, the Russian government and the right-wing factions of the world.

Exactly. Only the tinfoil hat whackjobs living in their mothers' basements truly believe Assange is a hero. He is a coward. There's a clear difference between transparency for truth and blatant disregard for laws in stealing documents and using them to perpetuate a foreign adversary's puppet candidate for a sovereign nation's election. I hope Assange gets life in jail. He deserves every minute of it.

So many tech stocks are overvalued. Remind me in a year which one was a better investment.
