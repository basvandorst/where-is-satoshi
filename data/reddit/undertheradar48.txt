Nope, read them closely. The two articles referring to $3B and $18B are both how much Bitmain is rumoured to raise.  The $18B raise would have valued the company at $40B+
@_date: 2018-09-08 01:44:40
It’s from Hut 8 financial statements. But I think you’re looking at it the wrong way. There’s nothing to say high mining profits is going to lower prices in the future...miners have been profitable since Bitcoin’s inception. Instead, I like to think this data means that Bitcoin’s hash rate is likely to grow and that new miners will join in to make BTC’s network stronger.

Bitcoin goes directly from a buyers wallet to a sellers wallet. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:29:20
Sure it does. For all sellers, they're denominating their sell orders in BTC (the asset they're selling). When prices are cut in half, so are the volumes.
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:50:36
Yes, and for Venezuela that's an issue (although their BTC volume is still way up in 2018). But for Peru, inflation is basically flat so it might as well be the US dollar. Not sure about Chile/Argentina inflation, but it's nowhere near Venezuela right now
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:24:08
From the Coinbase Commerce blog: "Note that all payments made through Coinbase Commerce are truly peer-to-peer — when customers send money from their cryptocurrency wallet it’s sent directly to a merchant-controlled cryptocurrency address and processed on-chain by the respective blockchain. This means merchants never have to pay transaction fees to accept payments and always remain in complete control over their funds."

Yes, that's correct - this chart only considers the coins and banknotes issued by countries. Just saying BTC is already worth more than all the circulating coins and banknotes in Great Britain, which is really cool.

Bitcoin actually has a product people use and solves a major problem. Seems like people are starting to lose patience with altcoins not delivering actual value and solving problems.

So crazy. I still have trouble comprehending it, been thinking about it all day
@_date: 2018-08-17 22:38:06
Mining companies are for-profit businesses. They wouldn't enter the BTC mining space if they anticipated losing money. And the fact that hash rate continues to climb means they're adding to the network mining pool, not replacing miners who aren't profitable anymore.

Patience... these integrations just launched this summer (and Coinbase hasn't really done anything to promote them)
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:48:11
Yes, I hope so too. But what really excites me about Square is that they're so focused on building great products that small gains/losses don't even register on their radar. Everyone else is looking for a margin, Square is playing the long game.
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:17:34
But the volume is denominated in USD - so since prices are lower, the  tx volume is too.  But it's still way more than gold markets
@_date: 2019-03-17 15:21:42
If you're faking volume and the overall volume is low, it just means the actual (non-fake) volume is even lower.
Also, we're talking about exchange volume here... not on-chain tx volume.
@_date: 2019-03-16 17:51:02
If it can be faked now, it could also be faked throughout the entirety of last year.
@_date: 2019-03-16 18:56:20
So why should one assume that today's high level of volume has more *fake* transactions than 6 months ago when volume was much lower?  The low volume figures from October could have been faked too. Works both ways.
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:20:35
Again, if that's happening now, what's to say it wasn't happening in Summer 2018 when volume was much lower? Unless there's reason to believe fake numbers are *growing* specifically in March 2019, then the data is still valid. Don't mind the absolute numbers, the growth here is what matters.

In the past it has typically been true, but if we see prices go much further down we'll begin losing hashing power from smaller/less efficient miners
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:19:14
Haha not sure who came up with the saying, I just wish I knew how to pronounce it...
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:55:16
Yes, but I'm not sure if Coinbase can actually do anything to stop them.  Any legal pros on here who can chime in?
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:52:35
Not a 300% increase in 6 months - machine efficiency has improved ~ 50% per year
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:47:38
As in building crypto projects... it's become a bit of a twitter slogan for a bunch of the crypto project founders this year
@_date: 2018-06-17 14:46:18
That's correct, but we're also seeing more pools come online to take some influence away from the top pools. Top pools still have a lot of influence, but not as much as they did 1 year ago.  51% attacks are prevented by a combination of having hash rate and high decentralization, and we're moving in that direction on both fronts
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:27:39

Also allows for shares in Robinhood!
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:31:43
I agree with that, but I'm more curious to understand how profitable some of the big miners around the world are... how low do prices need to go before some of them stop mining?
@_date: 2018-06-17 05:38:21
I hope you're right, but the future is so difficult to predict. I'm just happy to know that despite the bear market prices, Bitcoin's fundamentals have never been stronger
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:51:21
Yeah I feel like Venezuela is going to be the first country to go fiat-less
@_date: 2018-06-17 14:47:21
It's not only coming from one person.  Look at mining pool share in 2017 vs today. Trending towards more mining decentralization, not less
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:09:48
I don’t think that’s a good parallel. It’s not asking how you’d feel if your money disappeared, just about using the particular coin. That being said, I do see your point. Still feel like it’s a really strong data point supporting bitcoin’s long-term adoption
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:28:41
The 'transaction per second' critics all miss this point.
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:48:16
I don't know how it will impact other states, but it does set precedent... so it's definitely an uphill battle for Genesis

Bitcoin is sound money. It's incredibly valuable for transferring large transactions. People trust Bitcoin with their massive transactions.

It's great! Every major bank is probably meeting right now to discuss which exchange they are going to buy up
@_date: 2018-07-29 01:59:00
Good point - does anyone have a simple analogy that works better than this for newcomers to understand bitcoin nodes?
@_date: 2019-09-12 01:02:23
Do you have any accurate measurements on the cost to produce a number of hashes and how quickly that is changing over time?
@_date: 2018-07-20 21:19:57
Yes, I believe so - not so sure about the details and how "open-source" it will be though
@_date: 2018-07-26 03:05:13
This would make such a cool comeback story!

Square adding Bitcoin would be a great thing - you're right!  Because Jack Dorsey is such a strong believer in Bitcoin, I have no doubt they will follow through here.
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:03:45
Instantly Square could enable Bitcoin acceptance on all of their existing customer POS systems... mind blown!
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:56:26
That video wasn't arguing electricity costs vs computing costs.  The argument was that miners will continue to find cheaper and cheaper electricity over time - and this electricity will come from places with a surplus of power.  Did you even watch the video?

Agreed, just trying to stop the FUD here. If the title wasn't clear, I'll say it again. Bitcoin didn't die in 2011, it came back stronger than ever. Mining difficulty adjustment was a genius idea.
