Like i said before, using normal wiring options , means that the transaction is under the governments eye. They know which accounts the money is going from and which one it's going to. Additionally, these types of transactions can be undone if it's deemed to be "stolen" money, or seized. 
If a mobster were to steal $400 million in bitcoin, the government wouldn't be able to do jack shit about the stolen funds. This makes it much more desirable than other means

Actually Jesus definitely existed. Even historians agree on that. Whether or not you believe he could perform miracles is another matter.

Do the notifications work without the widget? How often does the "notifier" process check the price of BTC? Is there any way to change how often the notifier checks the price?

Seriously he is in serious danger at this point if he still has those coins. If the mob got to him, they could likely force him to give up some of his fortune through torture. And a mob would love to steal a horde of bitcoins vs dollars because of the natural benefit of them being harder to trace and impossible to undo transactions.
A mob can't just get any old millionaire off the street and have him transfer a million dollars because it would all be traceable and easily undone once they realize what happen.
This Newsweek article might as well have said that he has $400 million in unmarked bills stored away in his house. This is going to end badly if he doesn't get protection.

Is "good enough most of the time" really good enough when you're dealing with bitcoin?? 
Go look up the detection rates of MSE (they are awful), and come back and tell me how comfortable you are logging into your bitcoin account/wallet on your computer?

ANY unresolved debt hurts your credit rating. The credit rating is just a measuring stick for how likely you are to pay your debts. If you abandon $1K in debt at PayPal, you might also decide to not pay your car note. Or your phone bill. Or your mortgage. Or yes, even credit card. 
Whenever you refuse to pay something you promised to pay when you signed up, you lose the trust of all financial institutions.

The problem is if you can't spend it, then it's SOLE value is because it's a limited commodity. However, with the number of other crypto currencies currently popping up left and right, everyone will be able to own one of one type or another.
It's like investing in beanie babies. Each run was limited and they were valuable at the beginning, but then they kept coming out with hundreds of different limited runs. In the end, none of them were special because there were millions of *special* ones, and everyone lost interest.
If you can't spend Bitcoin, then the ONLY thing holding it up is the interest of people and the current limited availability of the coin and similar virtual currencies. If it ever gets to a point where there are 1000s of crypto currencies and you can't spend any of them, the the value is essentially worthless.

Now we know why some banks are refusing to deal with Coinbase and other Bitcoin transfers. People are tying up the lines with complaints about these companies (whether justified or not). They just don't want to deal with it anymore. 
At this point i think what is done is done. I'm not sure you can stop /block the payment but goodluck. It definitely stinks when your coins aren't in your possession yet and they've already lost 25% of their value 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:37:00
I don't think you can subtract the initial $1000 from that. It's based off a percentage. So right now to get $1500, you'd have to sell about 3 bitcoins. If you initially bought at $50/coin, the it'd be $1500 - $150 = $1350 in profit. 
And you'll need to claim it on your April taxes. Not now. And I'm not exactly sure where cash investments would be recorded. With stocks i get a tax form.

I'm not sure I'd trust $50K on an old thinkpad, regardless of security around it. Hardware malfunction? Gone. One fire? Gone. 
If i had to trust a wallet like that on my own, I'd have to keep it stored in multiple places on site and off. However if it's offsite, you have to trust who has your offsite backup. 
In your senario, a fire would fuck you over big time.

Or really as valued a customer as you seem to be. I would imagine most of their customers have less than 3 bitcoins total. You're paying them a bunch of money, so they want you happy longterm. 
Their costs are much higher than other exchanges. Crazy what they charge customers. The fees are almost twice as much as Bitstamp.

Most Android phones/browsers leave the flash disabled unless to click on it to enable the specific flash video. Because really you only want it to watch videos. 
I'm not sure what browser you were using, but if it automatically showed flash for everything all the time, then they implemented it horribly. 
Considering 80% of websites still use flash video I'm not sure what iPhone users are doing to see them.
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:37:25
Eh, I guess your mileage may vary because I'm able to use it to watch videos all the time. Especially liveleak.
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:03:50
Hmm. Interesting. I have to click on a window to get it to load the video player, so thought that was flash.

They can't do a credit check without your social security number. Did you give that to them? 
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:29:49
Yea they obviously can't just lock you in to a price before you actually buy them though unless you want it to be a "limit order" (which they don't provide) .  Limit Order means that if the market price is higher that your purchase price, then your order will never go through. You are essentially setting a "max limit" on what you're willing to pay. 
The stock market works the same way on Scottrade. It's always best to keep a bit extra in your account to cover fluctuation.

Just like online music/movies that had its start with people solely pirating them, it has become a legal and extremely large market with a lot of legitimate businesses around it (Netflix, iTunes, Pandora, etc). 
Bitcoin may seem like an area where only drugs and illegal behavior revolves around it. This can/will change as more and more legitimate businesses begin to take advantage of it. It has a lot of potential to revolutionize the way transactions are handled.
Please don't be scared of it because it's a new and unknown territory that can have long term benefits/consequences.

Really? That's pretty weird and kinda freaks me out. I mean $160k is really nice to stumble upon, and while it'll change your life, it's not enough to where you're just going to give chunks away. 
Don't reveal to your friends/girls that you're "rich".

Eventually you are wanting the money in your local country, so even if you sell the bitcoins there, you have to get the cash across the border. If its a significant amount of money, you are taxed on it. Period. 
To state it clearly: Through the buy/sell process you are making money. You are legally required to pay taxes on that. Any attempt to hide this income from the government's eyes is an attempt at laundering the money. Is that what you're basically asking: How you can launder money?

If you're truly validated through them, then you can sell immediately as well as buy more immediately. It may take a month though to truly verify. 
If you aren't verified, it'll take a week i think to get your money. But it will be for your selling price, not the "7 days later" value.
