Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. When a network reaches it's full capacity it will have to drop the less important &amp; less valuable use cases, there's no other way.

Sure I do, what I also understand is that the technology to handle everyones transactions on a decentralised blockchain doesn't exist yet. So until we have the technology to handle everyone, we have fees to let people bid for a spot on the blockchain. Everyone else will just have to use something else (less decentralised) or wait for the technology to catch up.

That would reduce the decentralisation of the network, which is the whole point of bitcoin and it's biggest strength. So I doubt that's ever going to happen anytime soon.

You should ask that to the people paying the high fees. My guess is that they want to use bitcoin because it's a good way of transferring high values around the world and/or to store some of their wealth outside of the traditional financial system.

It's irrelevant what I want/think bitcoin should be used for, it's simply not a valid use case for bitcoin right now to be buying small things or doing low value transfers.
Maybe in the future, 2nd layer solutions will provide the capacity needed for more use cases, including buying things.

There's no congestion, you simply didn't pay a high enough fee. As the usage grows, less important use cases will no longer be feasible with Bitcoin, it's that simple.
Also the fact that people are willing to pay such high fees only validates the value of Bitcoin, said differently, if people no longer value it, then fees will go down automatically.

The network is running at full capacity, so space on the blockchain is given to the highest bidder. When it's not running at full capacity fees go down.
Don't transfer your coins before looking at what fee you will be paying. You could also consider using other coins for transfers that have less high fees.
