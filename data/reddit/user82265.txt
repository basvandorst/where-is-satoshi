The world doesn't need two internets. That is the nature of *the internet*. It's *one* global standardized network of communication. There's a reason the internet was a big deal. If we had incompatible networks, we wouldn't have the internet. We'd have just a bunch of specialized networks.
The internet's killer feature is that I can communicate with anyone in the world with an internet connection. I don't need to worry or make sure the person I want to communicate with is not on InternetY since I'm on InternetZ. No developers want to make sure things are compatible among handfuls of different competing standards. This slows progress down and unneccessarily taxes resources for everyone.
If you fail see the significance and importance of having a single open global standard blockchain, then I don't have time to explain it to you.
We don't have two incompatible internets *for a reason*.

I don't understand either how any libertarian minded person who reads your comment would still scoff and bitcoin at think gold/silver are superior. I guess some people just fail to have that "aha" moment. Usually it's because people get set in their ways and don't want to change. If you've been hoarding gold or silver for 20 years, you don't want to be told that the hobby you're so overly invested in might be a misguided path. And it's not just dumb people who do this. Intelligent people with too much ego always find a way to justify their ideology and behavior. Yeah, I guess the same could be said of people heavily into bitcoin! However bitcoin is a genius new way of doing money in the digital age while gold and silver are relics of the past. I consider myself forward thinking, not backwards thinking. That's why bitcoin excites me.

The following is not super technically accurate, but I find it helps layman understand *what* a bitcoin is and how it can be used.
Bitcoins are a finite number of digital tokens that cannot be counterfeited thanks to a novel approach to cryptography. Bitcoins can be sent to someone anywhere in the world over the internet like you can send an email. Computers on the internet mathematically verify transactions and get paid for doing so accurately. Bitcoin gets its monetary value from its scarce supply coupled with market speculation.
Bitcoins can be stolen in a number of ways, but the most common is when a person trusts their bitcoins with another person. For example, if you send bitcoins to an exchange for trading, you are trusting the exchange with your bitcoins because you do not have control of the bitcoins when you send them to an address where you do not have access to the private keys. A private key is what is needed to unlock your bitcoins in order to send them to a new address. When you send bitcoin to an address where you don't have the private key, it is like handing over cash to another person who is behind a bullet proof window. If this person says they will give you the money back whenever you want it, all you have is their trust. That person can easily run away with your money if they so choose.
If this person wants to run away with your bitcoins and cash out, all they need to do is sell those coins for paper cash. One way to do it is to send the bitcoins to an exchange, sell them for USD or another currency, then wire the USD to a bank account. This leaves quite the paper trail, (and here's the evidence).
That's how I'd lay it out.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:09:23
The total supply doesn't change, but the "accessible supply" does. If you increased the accessible supply by a factor of 10, there are now 210 million bitcoins, but also everyone's holdings increase by a factor of 10. So someone who had 5 bitcoins now has 50. The only reason to do this would be if the smallest unit, the satoshi, were to have significant value and expanding the accessible supply is deemed warranted.
Also I would argue that consensus is a form of voting. And to make such a change to bitcoin would indeed require concensus.
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:06:40
Bits is short for **bi**nary **d**igit**s**. Computers count in binary, and a digit can only be one of two states, a 0 or a 1, "on" or "off", "true" or "false". With a little bit of math you can use binary digits to perform binary logic.

Bitcoin is a consensus network. Should a single satoshi ever have enough value that it is worth processing, and bandwidth and hard drive space is incredibly cheap, then the consensus may be to let it through. However it may cost you another satoshi in transaction fee.
Bitcoin wasn't really intended to do micro-transactions. Bitcoin could be better thought of as a "closing house" for settling off chain transactions. A service such as ChangeTip will handle the micro-transaction, and when you withdraw the money into a bitcoin wallet, you are settling a month's worth or so of micro-transactions in one big lump.

Imagine the year is 1998, and you get wind that a few tech companies have started a project called "the new internet", which turns out is completely incompatible with the current internet. So you decide you want to get in early on this new internet. You create an online business that can only be reached from this new internet, and you also buy a bunch of killer domain names like sex.com, but they only work on this new internet.  A new internet that hardly anyone uses and very few companies are investing in. Most everyone is instead sticking with the old internet. And as time goes on and more and more people sign up for internet service, they choose to use the old internet because that's what everyone else is using, and that's what's easiest to get. Old internet works perfectly fine for pretty much everyone, so there's no reason to use the less used "new internet" that is harder to sign up for. New internet is ultimately useless and therefore worthless.
Old internet is bitcoin and new internet is any altcoin. There's little reason people will want to use altcoins, especially the ones that are just copy and paste clones of bitcoin. Some of the more innovative altcoins may gain traction, but that's a huge gamble. If you don't mind gambling and risking losing all you money, then by all means place a bet on an altcoin. But don't let greed get the better of you. Look at all the fools who got suckered into Paycoin.

We need a hard fork solution (bitcoin software update) to the 1MB limit to roll out *now* or *very soon* so it can smoothly take place after block number whatever that will occur roughly 6 or 9 months from now.
Kicking the can down the road on doing a hard fork also has consequences with trust to the bitcoin network. It's absolutely retarded to wait until the very moment we outgrow 1MB blocks as a time to implement a hard fork. How is that good software development? Wait until your product breaks and infuriates users and diminishes their trust in your product for you to roll out a fix? Da fuq? That's even more of a disaster.
All the major and competent bitcoin companies will be using the up-to-date software when the hard fork is set to happen. It's really not an issue to be scare mongering about. Waiting until we *need* it is the worst decision. How people don't see the stupidity in that is beyond me.

Signing a transaction offline is the most secure way to send bitcoin.
Bitcoin is great because you can be your own bank, but that also means you're the person in charge of your security. You probably wouldn't feel comfortable having $10,000 worth of cash sitting under your mattress. Most people put that kind of money into a bank. But if you are your own bank, you'd want to put that kind of money into a big fireproof safe.
Cold storage is like having that fireproof safe. You must protect your private bitcoin key with absolute care, because if anyone else ever finds it then they can unlock your safe immediately and quickly steal your bitcoins. Since computers connected to the internet are more easily compromised by malware and hackers, having your private key touch a computer that is connected to the internet means the real possibility of losing all the bitcoin that key unlocks.
So how do you send bitcoin without an internet connection? Sounds impossible, right? Bitcoin is a technology that operates on the internet, so that private key must touch a computer that is connected to the internet at some point in order to send bitcoin, yes? Actually, no!
Instead you can use an offline computer that has your private key to sign the transaction. Signing is a cryptographic mathematical algorithm that proves you own a private key without actually revealing what the private key is, and therefore not compromising the key\*. Then all you need to do is take that signature you generated on the offline computer and use the online computer to broadcast that generated signature.
\*Well actually that's not entirely true. There are some vulnerabilities in ~~ECMA~~ ECDSA (mixed up my alphabet soup lingo, sorry) encryption that make it possible to guess a private key the more you sign with that same key. The solution is to only want to sign with a single private key once, then never again, which means you must spend all the coins in that address and have the change go to a new address and private key.
Yes, this process is not quick and easy, but that is the cost of high security. There are more streamlined solutions that use offline signing such as Trezor. As time goes on more new innovations in ease of use and security become available and cheaper. Personally I find it fun and fascinating.

You could spend a lifetime studying market forces and still never understand it completely. There are so many variables, many of which are impossible to know, that end up affecting the market. That's the crux of it.
Basically the current market forces want the price of bitcoin to remain low. I hypothesize that the reason for this that higher prices simply are not currently sustainable. In other words, you need more buyers than sellers for the price to go up, and there just aren't enough buyers. I'm confident that will change in the future. All we can do is wait for the ecosystem to continue maturing, or help it mature in your own small way.

The problem is companies can't yet deal exclusively in bitcoin. They have bills to pay, inventory to purchase, employees to pay, and so on. Even if a company wanted to deal 100% in bitcoin it's just not possible due to other parties not wanting to deal in bitcoin.
Also, commerce doesn't exist in an isolated bubble. Relative shifts in value of bitcoin to USD do indeed have an effect on the bottom line. There's no escaping it. (the relative effect can be on the upside, by the way)
Everything is volatile, including the US Dollar. Nothing in this world stays exactly the same forever. Even the ground under our feet is slowly shifting, meaning the continents will look much different several million years from now. Stability is all relative, and timescales are also a factor.
I believe bitcoin has the potential to be the most stable store of value that has ever existed, but it will take decades for that to happen (should the experiment that is bitcoin not fail). There will be more bubbles. There will be more busts. Bitcoin is a shift in public consciousness and understanding of what money is. These things take time.

Of course not. There's only need for one blockchain in much the same way there's only need for one internet. Any potential intrinsic value Litecoin would have is completely negated by the fact that it isn't necessary because we already have the bitcoin blockchain (which is by far what most people care about). Litecoin provides nothing more than what bitcoin already provides which is why Litecoin is worthless.

Which is a silly argument. People will always need to spend money whether the currency is inflationary or deflationary.

The bitcoin itself is not a thing. It's a ledger, like a balance sheet put together using an Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet has an account number in one box and a balance in the other and goes on for millions of rows. And every time one account sends a portion or all of their balance to another account, the ledger gets a new entry showing that.
Did you know that most U.S. dollars are digital? That is to say, if a bank says you have $1000 in your account, they don't actually have a physical box with your name on it and $1000 in cash sitting in that box. They have a digital balance sheet inside a computer that says you have $1000. And you trust the bank enough that if you want to go to the bank and withdraw that money they say you have, you'll get it all back.
The way bitcoin works is that it eliminates the need for us to trust banks to maintain the ledger because the ledger is appended and verified using mathematical algorithms, and the whole bitcoin protocol incentivizes the computers that do this ledger verification by paying them for their honest work. It turns out this verification process is what creates more bitcoin for the system, though there is a very finite supply of bitcoin that will ever be created.
In the end it's all just numbers on a balance sheet. But it's the scarcity of these numbers that give bitcoin its value. Bitcoin is harder to counterfeit than paper money and even gold (see: tungsten filled gold bars).
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:52:18
Well fiat relies on expensive printing equipment and an expensive banking system, and gold relies on expensive mining and refining equipment.
The fact that it takes work to mine bitcoin and that it is not easy is part of what gives bitcoin its value. In other words, if it wasn't expensive to mine bitcoin, that would be because bitcoin is worthless.

I wouldn't let a clichéd mantra dictate one's investing habits. Yeah there's some truth to that saying, but it misses a lot of the big picture. Bitcoin's a completely new asset like no one has ever seen before, and hardly anyone uses it yet.
You're either the cynical type who thinks no one will ever use bitcoin or you're the optimistic type who realizes it's still early and things will one day hit mainstream. And you know what happens to people who get into a good investment early? They make money.  Doesn't matter what type of investment it is.
Also, going back to that simplified mantra, if it's only poor people who will buy bitcoin, there are still *billions* of "poor people" who have yet to put money into bitcoin - an asset far more accessible and divisible and tradeable to the common man than gold is.
