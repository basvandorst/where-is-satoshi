Compared to others it looks like a good deal. 10GHS/year for $108.30 with the calculated expectation of revenue of ~$350/year (per  calculator), is a good deal WHEN YOU CONSIDER that cloudhashing.com charges $1k/12 months for the same 10GHS speed contract.

Say what you will, but I never took bitcoin seriously or even had desire to learn about it until I heard about and went to see Silk Road. 
That was September 2013. I was all set to buy 1 btc (damn I wish hadn't waited that week!), then boom, the seizure happened, the price quintupled+, and all the attention hit, that's when I started buying, mining, and learning. 
If it hadn't been for the intriguing idea that I could buy drugs anonymously on the internet from the comfort of my living room, I'd have never taken BTC seriously, and now that it's moved past that many people are now taking it seriously for better reasons.

Apologies. Let me correct for the low-info commenters. 
"It is the more versatile, valuable part of the technology. As many have stated before (source below), even outside of bitcoin entirely, the blockchain would be immensely useful as a sort of global ~~free~~ notary/certification service for things like wills, contracts, deeds, patents, and copyrights that only costs about USD $0.0000060161 (1 satoshi) per entry."
So yes, not free, but marginally cheaper than the thousands you would spend on such services. 
Of course, as I also meant free of external governmental controls, which it entirely is, the original comment was entirely correct. 
Here is the required homework for those interested in how the blockchain has more use outside of and basically without bitcoin than with it.

EXCEPT that Forbes just posted an article confirming the OPs claims (or at the very least that google has refused to deny them)..
"Google Lets Slip That It's Exploring Possible Bitcoin Integration Plans.
When Malik posted Ramaswamy’s response to the Bitcoin forum on Reddit and immediately got an positive response from the site’s bitcoiners, Google Wallet exec Ariel Bardin followed up by asking Malik to serve as a moderator on a Google survey posing the question “What would I want to do with Bitcoin?”
I reached out to Google, and the company responded in a very different tone, **but didn’t deny that the comments Malik posted to Reddit were real.** “As we continue to work on Google Wallet, we’re grateful for a very wide range of suggestions,” a spokesperson writes. ”While we’re keen to actively engage with Wallet users to help inform and shape the product, there’s no change to our position: we have no current plans regarding Bitcoin.”
Malik isn’t deterred. “They’re not dismissing it,” he says. “Maybe this will force their hand.”

Oh, you mean like the example from the article/below comment:
    According to Bitcoin tax expert Tyson Cross, the IRS ruling will create a significant burden on Bitcoin users, as every transaction they ever make using the digital currency will have to be reported in some way. (WSJ)
    Purchasing a $2 cup of coffee with Bitcoins bought for $1 would trigger $1 in capital gains for the coffee drinker and $2 of income for the coffee shop. (Bloomberg)
    This clarification means that people who use bitcoin in small amounts, such as to buy a meal, could face onerous record-keeping issues. The ruling takes effect immediately and covers past and future transactions and tax returns. (WSJ)

Got it, so an exchange has zero relation to a bank, even if you purchase and store currency/value and/or convert that value to multiple currencies in that exchange, or transfer/receive money in your exchange account, like a, you know, that one thing.....oh yeah, a BANK. 
Just trying to call a spade a spade. And I'd bet regulators are thinking the same thing.
If anything I thing the flaw in BTC this whole debacle revealed is not malleability, but the fact the entire system can be basically put out of commission in large part by one single entity saying "Sorry, we out." and boom, the price collapses and your cash/BTC is just gone/trapped 
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:40:23

Winkelvii, $40k/coin
Celente: $1 million+/coin
A few others I heard bullish enough to claim even higher than that. Of course their predictions were predicated on a total collapse of the dollar and US government, so there's that, which we could see. Although in that scenario BTC will be about as useless as paper money or gold. For that end, your best investment is steel, polymer, and copper jacketed lead, WHICH I do have quite the portfolio in and has seen several hundred % value growth over the last year to 18 months.

Agreed. That is a popular subject in tv/film theory today, the shift toward having all 'grey' characters, such as anti-heroes and somewhat-relatable villains, rather than the black and white distinctions preferred by past audiences. 
We are slowly realizing the reality that there really is no such thing as an all-good hero or all-bad antagonist, that things are almost always more complex than that, and our entertainment is reflecting that. 
Quick, dirty example, the latest Superman movie, Man of Steel. It was quite controversial, and even shocked me as someone who'd watched Superman vehicles since childhood, when, spolier alert since the bleep-fing code won't work, Superman snaps Zod's neck.

If it's determined the seized assets were gained in the commission of a crime, or they are held as evidence in such an investigation, the funds will probably never be returned, they'll be kept/auctioned off just like a drug lord's seized yacht and Ferraris. 
Silk Road is a good example of this. The FBI seized 144,000BTC as part of their investigation, and for all intents and purposes those 144k coins are gone forever.

Maybe he'll correct it and give you credit and you can feel all happy about it. 
"Silk Road 2 moderator Defcon reported in a forum post that hackers have used a transaction malleability exploit to hack the marketplace. The hackers stole over 88,000 bitcoins worth $41,474,415, emptying the site’s escrow account.
The site used a central escrow service to send bitcoins from buyers to sellers. The hackers exploited the transaction malleability bug – essentially a way users can mask transfers and ask for the same amount of BTC multiple times – to clean out this wallet. This is the same bug that forced Mt. Gox to halt all withdrawals and recent updates have made average bitcoin wallets secure against this sort of attack. According to the site, hackers used the Silk Road’s automatic transaction verification system to order from each other and then request refunds for unshipped goods. Hackers were able to use the transaction malleability bug because the Silk Road used only transaction ID to confirm the transfer of bitcoins."

If I had $25K dropped in my lap right now it would be gone by this afternoon on exactly what I just laid out. Wish I'd known what I know now in the past when I was getting that kind of money, I wouldn't be scrambling and scraping/worrying so much about the future today.

@_date: 2014-01-15 18:56:22
the part I don't understand of this, and this is also directed to You have to pay fees to convert to BTC to then use it to buy stuff. 
So if I have an item in front of my priced at $10, and I have a $10 bill, would it not make more financial sense to pay the $10, rather than take that $10 bill to the bank, deposit it, go to coinbase and buy BTC at a 5% fee, add another $0.50 of fiat to make $10, then buy at the total cost of $10.50?
Seems obvious to ME to save that $0.50 if you could, especially of you could skip all that hassle I laid out in the process. 
The only way I've seen this trap be circumvented is when websites begin offering BTC payments AND offer discount for paying that way. THAT works, when you can incentivize using BTC over other options.

GREAT job getting the attention!
"It seem like tech giants in Silicon Valley have taken notice of the crypto currency too. According to this Reddit post, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) is planning on adding Bitcoin to its payment system. A Reddit user who claims to have spoken to Sridhar Ramaswamy, the Google senior vice president in charge of Google Wallet, said the company is gauging interest in the crypto-currency.
According to the Reddit post, Google vice president of product management Ariel Bardin asked them to pose a question on Google Moderator asking, "What would I want Google to do with bitcoin?" The question currently has 223 votes and counting. This goes to show that, while traditional financial institutions may be reluctant to adapt to Bitcoin, tech behemoths like Google have no problem incorporating the growing digital technology."

FALSE: read more closely. USD specifically states it's legal tender FOR ALL **DEBTS**, public and private. 
This means you can pay your taxes (public debt) in USD or pay back a private loan to a bank/mortgage lender (private debt), but there is ZERO legal compulsion for a store to take your USD in exchange for goods. I could open a gun store, for example, that only makes sales in gold and it would be perfectly legal, but I couldn't run a licensed pawn/loan shop in that way.

"With "bitcoin days destroyed", the idea is to give more volume weight to coins which haven't been spent in a while. To do this, you multiply the amount of each transaction by the number of days since those coins were last spent. So, 1 bitcoin that hasn't been spent in 100 days (1 bitcoin * 100 days) counts as much as 100 bitcoins that were just spent yesterday (100 bitcoins * 1 day). Because you can think of these "bitcoin days" as building up over time until a transaction actually occurs, the actual measure is called "bitcoin days destroyed". This is believed to give a better indication of how much real economic activity is occurring on the bitcoin network."

Now it's starting to look like the haters were right. It IS the one-world currency. It's overly traceable, and rather than remove you from the financial system, it only drags you deeper and exposes you to more liability.

It's usable as a currency, but not quite or only a currency, and is usable as a medium of exchange or remittance, but not quite or only that way. It's also shown worth as an investment.

Whoosh. Did you hear that? It was satire ruining your hairdo as it passed over your cranium. 
I've bought/mined $70 of BTC since October '13, and it's worth about $40 now, and the sad thing seems to be the more I acquire the less it's worth, it's sad. 
Now, if you want to do REAL investing, I've spend thousands on ACTUAL value in the last few months, guns and ammunition. And the best thing about guns and ammo is that when they're actually needed, they become priceless, or, if you feel like placing a dollar value on your life and it's defense (or the price of your Liberty and Country), they become worth that. 
I humorously refer to my investment strategy as FAG+B, which really pisses off my liberal-minded academia IT coworkers (who are rabidly anti-bitcoin for some reason). Food, Ammo, Guns, +Bitcoin.

And the rest of it, social engineering. Read one of Kevin Mitnick's books. 
A good example in my area, my county has ALL personal property and real estate tax info that is public record online and freely accessible. I could pick any home in the entire county on a map and instantly, freely, know the name and address of the owner, the make/models/colors/years and number of cars/vehicles they own (which gives a good idea of how many people live there and when they are gone), and the real estate tax assessment database even has hd photos of every building on said property for assessment purposes. For $2 on a credit card I can even have instant access to their property deed, which would most likely show who they bank with...Information is power, and public records can make you very powerful.

In that series set 65 years in the future, the tech was amazing...and almost entirely controlled by the corporate police, who were portrayed as the heroes protecting society from the 'terrorists' (Liber8, great name) trying to do evil by...giving people their rights back. Nice job, TV Canadia

The comments on that article are about what you'd expect. 
'It's the currency of scammers and hackers, it was only for silk road to buy hitmen and drugz!!!!"

Actually, you can make a backup of your keys from a photo (or someone can make a 'backup' of YOUR keys from taking photos). 
It's some james bond-level shit, and I've used them with great results.

But in that 3 days, has what you owe changed up or down? Did you owe $500 and due to volatility that debt is now worth $3000? Oh wait, refresh, now it's worth $2819.
I've ran into this buying bitcoin in a specific amount for a purchase. Order placed...waiting.....waiting....waiting.....the price just fluctuated and the $50 worth of BTC I needed is now only worth $43, so I have to go through buying MORE because the sale price is pegged to USD. 
This is barely worth the massive discount I get for paying in it. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:17:27
It's still a great way to shop for modafinil. 30% discount for paying in BTC right now.

It's the entire basis of it's definition as a currency. 
Without immediacy it's more like a wire transfer than an exchange of value. Get that 10 minutes down to &lt;time it takes to process a debit/credit card, and bitcoin would be unstoppable. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:09:28
Just imagine going through that in a checkout line. You'd have people behind you writing out paper checks griping you're taking too long!
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:06:39
Better attributes being my grey-market online pharmacy actually takes them. 
No really, that's the sole reason I even have/use BTC: they offer a 30% btc discount over cash. Hard deal to pass up. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:48:04
Don't forget the surety bonds that could cost millions, the endless background checks required from specified firms that could cost into the 6 figures. 
If you can comply with all of this:
Then good on ya, because you're wealthy enough to NOT be one of the disadvantaged groups BTC was intended for. 
Just like stocks, the housing market, the bond market, derivatives, insurance, even student loans, the cronies like you are going to pass 100 thousand pages of regulation to the point YOU are the only people rich enough to even afford the people to read them, and screw anyone else not in your trillionaire club. 
I say we just chip NY off the coast and set it adrift like we should have with LA.

Maybe the fuck not to YOU. 
Personally, I like the idea of insane laws in other backwards states like NY having zero effect on us living outside the asylum.

Here is an example of just that, very first night of unrest in Ferguson, just hours after the Brown shooting. 
This video was taken by the local news, and seems to show an armed police robbery occur
I'm sure it happens more than we all think.

With a cover that thin, he's lucky some unsavory characters he came across undercover didn't google him and blast him.

It's like being the lead fed investigator on a bank robbery, and deciding to pocket a suitcase of the recovered money where every bill has been marked, serial number recorded, and digitally scanned. 
And if you think that's far fetched, when DB Cooper famously hijacked a plane in 1971, the $200,000 he got in ransom from the FBI was described as "10,000 unmarked 20-dollar bills, many with serial numbers beginning with the letter "L" indicating issuance by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, most carrying a "Series 1969-C" designation[21]—and made a microfilm photograph of each of them."
They know that so far, 44 years later, not a single one of those bills has been spent because every single one of them is flagged in every database imaginable. The numbers are even available to the public.

This article already had such a great attention grabbing title, dafuq did you change it? 
Also, delete post for altering article title. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 02:14:44
Misleading or not, changing it is EVEN MORE misleading, and violates all redditiquete

Perhaps they'd even go so far as to invite big names in the industry to an offshore secret meeting to lay down the law and/or rendition the ones who don't cooperate. 
It's not like we in the US would ever do anything like exporting people to foreign nations to perpetrate coercive techniques upon them that would violate our own laws to further our interests oh wait yeah we're totally and well known for doing that...

They're going to decree that the price of bitcoin will henceforth be 1:1 pegged to the Gold troy ounce price.

Non-editorialized article title for the purists:
"Who Owns the World’s Biggest Bitcoin Wallet? The FBI"
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:02:18
States are trying to outlaw the currency incrementally (probably because they have yet to deduce how to legally steal it all)...and no comments?
I thought this story would top the front page at least, probably with 10k comments. 
Oh well, guess bitcoin really is a scam and is dying. Time to get back to real currency, gold.
@_date: 2013-06-01 20:10:33
Bitcoin: because the hundreds of established currencies just weren't enough, apparently, or something...
@_date: 2013-06-01 20:49:41
I like the idea of bitcoin, I just still prefer to buy things using non-existent currency in person, such as trading electronics for drugs, or jewelry for guns (done both). No exchange parties or web traffic required. How would bitcoin improve on this model of exchange? 
^Honest question.

I'm sure they did, as soon as those coins hit their wallet....;)

Many would argue that not wanting to download a multi-gigabyte file that takes several hours even on a high-bandwidth connection is a problem that needs to be solved years ago. 
This is why I gave up mining BTC before I started, 10 hours in, still waiting for blockchain to finish, gave up. On to the next x-coin currency. There are about a dozen or so up and coming. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 06:42:38
This is actually a valid point, especially considering all the bitcoin in existence has a value just short of the NSA's snack budget...
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:48:34
I wonder if I'll get the same consideration. I bought $5US worth of BTC on Sunday at almost $800US/btc, which has basically become worthless on the last few days. 
Come on Winklevoss, you fuck. When is the spike to $40k supposed to happen?
@_date: 2013-06-27 06:37:55
Thanks to everyone for their insight. Your input has even further solidified, to me, how idiotic bitcoin really is...at least my investments, gold, guns, and food, work without electricity or infrastructure. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:15:49
It's too bad buying more currency doesn't make prices jump in the real world. The Us Dollar would be the strongest in the world. 
What would happen if the NSA turned their 512qbit quantum computer loose on the bitcoin mining scene, found all outstanding coins in existence in several days time...what would happen then? Bitcoin at $0.01? Less?

I can see the dialogue boxes now. 
"Waiting to process transaction. Blockchain Updating. 1.2gb of 14TB complete. Estimated time remaining: 68 hours 23 minutes 14 seconds..."
"Warning: Insufficient HDD space. Transaction Canceled. You have been billed a 10% canceled transaction fee."
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:07:39
I thing it's rather terrifying to be truthful. None of the cash I spend is logged in the blockchain. I guess that's the beauty of the trustless mixing offered by cash.

He has a point. Only in the mind of the owner is value truly placed. Whose to say a 0 and a 1 aren't worth $1 million, yet 001110001110010100 is?
That's all we're really doing with bitcoin.

Why stop there? Seeing as you have a million dollars, you are well positioned to help me, the stranded Nigerian prince, to recover my inheritance, recently trapped in my country due to political strife. 
If I can just transfer the sum of $296 trillion into your US based bitcoin wallet, you can keep 3% as a transaction fee, for your most gracious help. 
All I will need to officiate this most profitable transfer is your bitcoin wallet cryptographic key, and we can get started immediately!
