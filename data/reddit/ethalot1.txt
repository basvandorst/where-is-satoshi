You must be new round here

Didn’t mean to come across like that. What I’m implying is no one knows what’s going to happen. There might be nothing on the order book then bam someone makes a market purchase and we go in the green or red especially if we see some institutional flow . Never trust order books. They just manipulate the way you think and 99% of the time it will be wrong! DCA and only buy what you can afford to loose. Best advice I can give and one day we will all look back on this and laugh of how crazy this ride has been!!!! Long live bitcoin!!!

I would love to know where you find your info out mate? Any links?
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:15:17
Lock it up in cold storage. Go away don’t check the price and have a cold one and chill out!
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:39:26
Looks that way. I like how they are protecting their users. But they are being so stupid about this. 2 weeks is way to long. Unless Coinbase addresses this they will loose even more market share!

Very good point. I’m not jealous. Was just asking for people opinions and I clearly have pissed a lot of people off in the process.
@_date: 2019-05-09 10:00:52

@_date: 2019-05-13 13:10:36
Thanks for all the responses! Great help!

One of my friends had the same issue. I don’t use Coinbase personally but 14days seems a bit ridiculous. 
I think it’s there to stop people scamming your card and buying btc and sending it off straight away. But I would like to know why this has suddenly come about and if it will ever go back to normal as I won’t be using Coinbase if I have to wait 14days for my coins!
@_date: 2019-05-16 09:37:05
Great link thank you so much!

Dont worry about me 5 different back ups around the globe �� we need to get the new comers doing the same!
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:05:52
It is manipulation I’m not saying it’s not? I agree it should be anonymous but don’t you think it would be better if an exchange knew what one of their customers was up to put a limit on their account. Or plot twit it’s the exchanges themselves ��
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:13:18
First rule I learnt. Coins never in exchange. Don’t worry about that ��
