Never tell. Once you reach billionaire status toss her a couple millies and ride off into the sunset on a chariot made of cocaine pulled by a flock of only the finest escorts.

Coinbase owns gdax. Doesn't that defeat the purpose?

This is how I make all of my investments

With the caveat that you mean never invest more *in bitcoin* than you can afford to lose
Most people's entire retirement savings is in investments, if you lost that as you approach retirement age, you're screwed. 
The difference is that they're not super high risk investments. They're usually diversified, etc

Credit unions are everywhere. They are non-profit, so any money they make is given back to the customer. The service is overall superior... lower fees, better returns, lower interest rate on loans, etc. It's a completely different mentality than the industry that has and continues to fuck over Americans on a day to day basis. I urge you to check 'em out.

Dammit. Someone fucked it up. It's .87769583. Who sends money to the government for that? .1337 was leet so...  I mean, if you're sending money to the SR bust, at least mock the government while you're at it.

The banks are just as guilty. They have a huge hand in politics. America _is_ a plutocracy, after all.
@_date: 2013-09-20 17:24:52
Fuck banks. Seriously. Do yourself a favor and go to your neighborhood credit union.

I was a bit disappointed in Gattaca. It was decent, but I'd rank a lot of others above it. I think it was just talked up too much before I watched it.

I just started reading the notes, those are pretty good.

Plus the government seizure....
@_date: 2013-09-21 22:48:13
True, true. But at least they're not _intentionally_ trying to fuck you.
