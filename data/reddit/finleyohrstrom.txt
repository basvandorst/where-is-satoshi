And sensationalist complaints about high fees and nonsense like that is justification to people to reduce Bitcoin to that? I don't understand the psychology of the other side beyond the conclusion they are just less intelligent/able to weight values and identify risk. I don't know understand the technical nature behind bitcoin near as well as many, so i feel sure there is something i am missing, though comparing to anything else in the world this wouldn't be any different haha.

I feel for you man. People always say "Your coins aren't yours on an exchange, it's all your fault!", but as someone who relies on trading for income thats not always such an option. Obviously part of the risk/reward of the job, but for instance i have a mega $ETH short which has been and will continue to be profitable, i can't put it anywhere i control the private keys, i can only close it and stop taking profits. I see how with normal buy and HODL trading taking your coins off exchange is pretty viable, but if your raw dogging any angel of the market you can with all your capital because you need to to make the returns your looking for, its just complicated as to how your suppose to maintain control over the keys. I guess decentralize and get off what you can, its not that complicated. anyway, good luck boss! Hope you get your coins back and the GOV'T has less of them.
