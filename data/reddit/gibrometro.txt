My request is you should immediately appoint a leading bitcoin auditing company to prove you're not insolvent. This is absolutely important regardless of battle with Mr. Ver. If you're not doing smart things in the right time, bitcoin industry suffer another fall when gox got down. You may lose good customers and businesses because of speculations.

Done. I checked all of the checkboxes. And said "You're doing awesome"
Exposing supporting charity is a good thought.

Nice GCX Team. Good luck. Is it possible to transfer gold to any other online platform directly. For example, bitgold. I would also suggest you to add virtual currency withdrawal options (paypal, perfectmoney)

Thanks. Just read the Merchant page.

My first point of view about cubits.com looks very simple and elegant. It's been working faster at this moment. What are all the limits and features for merchant account?

Funny! I just searched for different bitcoin to real life applications. Got in here. Looks great. You've also doing Whole Foods Market, right?
Do you accept corporate buying? - like ordering in bulk.
