I have a rich Chinese friend who has a sister. I think that many things in China can be circumvented with a bribe. The question is, will the government continue to turn a blind eye to the bitcoin space?

Also, because he is presenting to his boss he should also focus on payment processors (e.g. Coinbase) and the ease of implementation. There are a lot of merchant tools for bitcoin that make the process of accepting bitcoin payments much easier.

You will need to install the latest visual studio to get all compiler tools you need to build a lot of the Node.js packages. 
You can pick up visual studio express (with the C++ tools) for free from Microsoft, you just need to log in with a Microsoft account.
