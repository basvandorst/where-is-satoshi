which mailing list are you referring to?

Sorry but i don t understand your answer, you said "a size increase should help to keep the miners interested". How could this happen?

But are we sure that they will at some point increase the blocksize? Is there any public discussion that we can read about it?
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:13:35
Any source of this discussion? I'm really surprised that this question is not answered clearly and discussed more often. I can't find anywhere that core is planning at some point to increase blocksize. If it would be the case why the fork with bitcoin cash happened then?

Very interesting, I haven't realized this. I would be interested to know what a Lightning Network developer has to answer.
