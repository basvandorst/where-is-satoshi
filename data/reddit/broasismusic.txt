It's never had this. It's jerked up and then fallen, then jerked up, etc. If you really think we'll be at 5-10k by 2020, who's to say we don't see 45k in 2018 and correct back down to 10k over the next two years, then jerk up to 100k, etc? Not trying to be a moon kid, just saying...if we expect growth I don't think it will be slow and steady. If anything, there's a *ridiculous* amount the market cap of BTC can grow. Only the die hard's currently have it. That's been changing, but not nearly as rapidly as it can. Long term - sure... steadier growth on an average historical line (which still means a fast growth rate) I'd understand... but I don't see us leaving 2016 without at least getting close to the previous ATH. It feels too much like a real bull market now to discount any type of large move upwards.
I have no crystal ball, but we're all still very early adopters in the grand scheme of things. When the masses *DO* get in it will make all the previous bubbles look like blips. This is just my personal opinion, and I'm bullish as hell... but I just can't be bearish on 2016 given how 2014-2015 played out (and are playing out).

Oh I agree. It's a huge PITA. My point was that it could be done if you were very serious about doing it. For most, GBTC will do, but it can't be converted into actual bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:27:25


Technically not true. You can use a self directed IRA or 401k and have whatever you want in it - private company stock, physical assets (property), bitcoin, etc. I get that GBTC is currently the easiest way for most people, but if you were absolutely gung-ho about having *actual bitcoin* inside a retirement vehicle, you could achieve it.

Thanks for sharing that screenshot. Wow, looks very legitimate. Really sucks that this happened to you guys. And definitely put your registrar on 2fa. Also make sure your domains are locked (they had access to your registrar, if they weren't locked they could have grabbed your transfer auth codes for a future attack. See if you can refresh these codes with your registrar as well - make sure they know you were hacked.)
Good luck with everything - it was a sophisticated attack but fortunately, while it may sound strange, only 100btc was lost. With that level of access things could have been worse, so learn some lessons and march on :) Good luck!

@_date: 2014-07-02 02:07:44
That's some sophisticated shit right there. And let's not fool ourselves - as more funds amass bitcoin, this type of thing is going to happen more often. It's also a reason I no longer use google apps (or any email provider) with my domain names MX records because it's all too well known that if you can change that you get access to EVERY email. Still, my domains are 2FA protected with namecheap... Wonder if these guys had their registrar on 2FA or who their registrar was? MX hijacking is well known, and sounds like they also dropped the ball on internal security measures. Sucks the Marshall released the emails, but really, if the hacker wanted it they could have gotten it anyways. I have a feeling all the Marshall's did was make the first step just a little bit easier.

The old adage "be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy" comes to mind. I haven't seen this many full-fledged bears and people in general despair in quite a while. Posts left and right with people saying "I was going to buy at 350, but now I might buy if it hits 250..." are going to be kicking themselves. Obviously, don't invest anything you can't afford to lose, but if anything the stat-sheet for bitcoin has gotten massively more impressive in the last year. I bought a good amount last year and I just bought a lot more today despite being quite in the hole from my purchases last year. I might "lose" a bit more in the short term, but I'm banking on the fact that we won't go below the previous ATH. All bets are off if it does, but no matter what, I can't see it being below $300 for a very long time. And worst come to worst, I can afford to lose what I've invested in it. Not that it wouldn't sting, but really... anyone whose ever been bullish about BTC selling a losing long-term position JUST above the previous ATH is a bit screwy me thinks...

I'm computer literate as fuck and it took me DAYS to complete all the steps to get a secure paper wallet printed. People act like there's not 20 things that can go wrong along the way. Two of the first USB drives I used I couldn't boot from, but the third I could... plus all the time spent trouble shooting and stressing out. I would have stopped LONG before I made it if I wasn't so stubborn.
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:44:06
This is an interesting thought, and it makes sense. If part of the requirement of being insured is giving over control and all assets in the event of insolvency, then I think you're right that there would need to be some way for the insuring entity to take control of assets like multisig. But the original company needs to maintain it's business operations, which would make this a bit trickier. How do we ultimately have control over an entire companies BTC balance while also allowing that company the freedom to pursue it's business objective? 
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:49:19
Yep, I certainly understand the drawbacks. You nailed the big ones on the head... auditing tons of third party systems and insuring inherently risky exchanges. Any ideas for solutions to these issues? The only thing I can think of would be a standardized Bitcoin security protocol that all insured providers would be required to use, but then you're talking about developing an entire infrastructure. I'm not sure how it could be applicable or easily feasible in most situations.

Heh, that's a fantastic way to put it. I was worried about this as well, but when you realize that there are fees PLUS the reversibility, even accepting a 0 confirmation payment that's hit a site like blockchain.info probably has a much lower overall failure rate than the cc companies chargeback rate + fees.
To the moon!

I'm familiar with elliptic, but rather than a single company offering insurance on it's own accord for it's own depositors, I'm talking about a blanket entity that can offer insurance products similar to elliptic, but to qualifying third party wallets / exchanges. If every individual bank had to set up their own deposit insurance similar to the FDIC, it would be a lot of wasted effort. Maybe elliptic is in a position to expand it's insurance offerings to other entities?
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:26:03


Oh absolutely. That's probably one of the largest hurdles to making something like this happen. FDIC in the US is easier to accomplish due to being under a regulatory framework to begin with, and with the FDIC being a government corporation, and the government having the ability to print money, it really doesn't get any easier. On the contrary, bringing something like this to the world of Bitcoin would be much more difficult. Imagine a company that serves as a regulatory watch dog and enforcer in an naturally decentralized and unregulated space. Probably very difficult to accomplish, if not impossible, but if someone ingrained themselves in this space early it could be very lucrative.
The best solution to the fraud issue would be to concentrate the oversight and enforcement in the same country as all of the member corporations. Unfortunately this would centralize the development of the Bitcoin infrastructure in a specific locale, and some Bitcoiners would be against this. But for something like this to have such an impact as to force a conglomeration of the infrastructure around it? I don't know... this seems important but I don't know if it would have that large of an impact on the services and infrastructure itself. 
I would cautiously compare something like this to the model of Car Fax actually, in that we wouldn't be selling much to the end user. Rather, institutions would be the primary customers, but the primary marketing would be to the end user. Car dealerships have to get Car Fax because their customers come in and ask for it. You wouldn't deposit money in a bank that's not FDIC insured, right? Eventually, if consumers demand this protection from their wallet or exchange providers, both with their wallets and with their words, it could have a cascading effect. Whether it's good for the Bitcoin community as a whole is up for debate, but doesn't Bitcoin need some sort of regulatory framework before moving forward in big ways?
EDIT: Apparently credit unions aren't FDIC insured, but NCUA insured. I would imagine that all of them have state required insurance or private insurance.

It's six characters with a mandatory 2FA though...
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:34:07
Yep. Something like this may need to be ONLY for web wallets, or two separate insurance pools... one for wallets, and a separate one for exchanges so the risks can be distributed and weighed appropriately. It may be that offering this product to exchanges is just too risky. But even bringing this product to the consumer space could have a big impact. I forget the name, but there was a company underwritten by Lloyd's of London that offered de-leveraging and insurance on BTC deposits, but the consumer had to pay for the privilege themselves. Similar to Elliptic really, but I don't think that was it.
On that topic though, it is kind of difficult to imagine wallet companies dumping a huge amount of cash on this kind of thing. Banks pay for FDIC insurance by interest on lending money and investing deposits. But investing BTC in any real market (at least for now) means converting to fiat and taking on conversion rate risk in a highly volatile market. How would the companies pay for the insurance if they can't make money on loans? Exchanges make money on the fees, but wallets?

This. I get that $25,000 sounds like a lot to some 17 year old who's trading with his life savings of 1.2 BTC. But for most moderately successful adults who have retirement and discretionary investments, $25k is a drop in the bucket. Yes, there is risk using any bitcoin exchange. But how else is anyone supposed to buy in volume? I get that very large buyers can use OTC, but not everyone knows about it and not everyone wants to go through the hassle. And what about "large" traders? Day traders on actual stocks and equities *must* have a minimum of $25k in their account to even qualify for margin and status as a day trader - legally. You're amazed someone had basically the bare *minimum* most day traders legally need on an exchange?
I'm on this one. If even *this* amount of money can't safely flow in to bitcoin, how is the millions or billions of institutional money supposed to flow in?
Edit: not a prod at coinbase. I use coinbase and have had great experiences with them. just a comment on how people freak out that anyone stores any *real* money on exchanges. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:52:13
It's funny. In real life, there are a lot of finance and investment professionals that have exposure to bitcoin. But over in it's like the 1800's. Bonds and VTI and S&amp;P only. They're really gonna be left behind, especially if the sub keeps filtering out anything that goes against their mantra.

Ugh. I bought a few on coinbase a few days ago at &gt; $1,100 and I'd LOVE to buy more but nope... my first transaction has to clear (Dec 11) before I can buy *anything* on their site again.  * sigh *

This is false. I tried it the other day. Even after instantly verifying my (second) bank account, it said I had to wait for my first transaction to clear before purchasing again.

Two accounts with the same address / identity seems like they would close both for suspicious activity. They have that rule in place for a security purpose, and as unfortunate as it is because I'd like to buy right now, I have a feeling they wouldn't take any more kindly to this.

Section 3.3 of their user agreement:


If they are, then they're in breach of their own contract and are likely to be sued. For a company with 25 million in VC and a lot of potential, I don't see this happening. Besides, reserve banking only really works when banks have the ability to "create" money (or, borrow "created" money from the Fed). Since BTC can't be "created" by coinbase, the multiplier effect is non-existent and therefore fractional reserve lending for BTC makes no sense, and IMO, would be next to impossible (baring some kind of a ponzi scheme mind you).

You won't make money mining BTC, especially with a laptop. Best bet, if you feel you need to try it out, is to join a multipool (I use multipool.us) and mine alt coins. The pool automatically mines the most profitable SHA or Scrypt coins, and you can use cryptsy to convert to BTC. I have 2x R9 280x's mining on multipool.us and (with exchange rate) I've made ~.017 BTC in the last 24 hours.

Coinbase actually pays tx fees for transfers, so if anything they'd SAVE money implementing this on that end. They only get fee's on the buy / sell, and I'd assume fraudulent ACH buys that are the result of account hacks are frequently cancelled on the end user side sticking coinbase with the bill, so while they may miss a few "buy" fee's from the hacked accounts, I doubt it's more than what they lose to canceled ACH transfers.
