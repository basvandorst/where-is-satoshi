You can't, bitcoin isn't "on a cd rom", just the private key that allows you to make a transaction. That is a thing you could do with all sorts of traditional financial elements.

Bitcoin doesn't have any underlying company or anything to hold the price up so the community has a strong incentive to paint people selling as bad or weak or dumb or evil and people who buy as strong and brave.

I really don't understand why so many people seem to think bitcoin invented QR codes. Paypal had pay by QR years and years ago but discontinued it because it wasn't used much.

satoshi originally made bitcoin a windows only exe because he was such a bad programmer.

I am sure banks have the money to buy far more dumb antminers than the bitcoin network if they wanted. But more importantly hashpower is a meaningless number and bitcoin didn't seem any more or less secure 24 months ago when it had half as much power. 
Nor can you claim that high levels of hash power are a good thing, because then you kill bitcoin's ability to scale hashpower up and down, since you then paint a scaling down of hashrate as a failure of security.

Ah yes, the refugees can just load the blockchain on their computers then use their cell phone plan to connect their cell phones to their carrier at stores. No wait, this is just a centralized solution that uses bitcoin for no real reason.

All the QR code encodes is an address to send to, you can do that with paypal, you can do that with any service that sends money to a username.

Because you don't. Dogecoin and litecoin and namecoin have worked just fine without bitcoin.

Does bitcoin have any more security than when it was half that? When bitcoin had 10% that level it was held by people mining in bedrooms all over the world, now 3 people own half the equipment in big warehouses they personally control. Bitcoin seems far less secure if anything.

A large change in price is generally seen as a poor quality currency not a good quality one. A price that rises hugely is only good for get rich quick stuff, not for actual use as an actual new currency.

Yup, you are just promised bubbles forever, that is the promise of satoshi and totally how investments work. Price has only been 1100 one time but because it was 8 dollars some other time that promises you are going to get rich!

It doesn't scale either, since it requires locking up bitcoin and unless you do tiny microtransactions only the amount locked ends up being higher than the total number of bitcoin that exist for even moderate traffic.

Miners collect fees, however the fees are less than 2000 dollars a day and have decreased over time so you are basically supposed to handwave some magic will happen in the future that will fix that somehow and ignore it's a serious issue.

It's weird how other technologies move forward year by year but it seems like 5 years ago bitcoin was the internet of 1995 and now 5 years later it's still the internet of 1995 (or the car of 1900), the internet was only the internet of 1995 for one year then became the internet of 1996.

It'll still be the blocksize issue, even if you multiply it by 10 or 100 bitcoin's capacity is nowhere near anything that would be useful in any retail setting. You would need to increase bitcoin's capacity by 250x just to hit 80% of visa's capacity in 1993.

A very high percent, the chinese miners are using government subsidy and a lot of home miners are using either their parent's electricity or stretching their landlord's mistake of including electricity. I don't think very many miners at all are actually paying the actual cost of electricity. Bitcoin seems almost entirely funded by externality.

The glorious future where bitcoin is worth trillions isn't ensured, anyone pushing the price down too many times runs the risk of just making bitcoin look stupid and making it fail. 
Like if bitcoin only went up maybe people might start wanting to buy in thinking they'd get rich, but if there is a long history of it crashing every time it rises people are going to sit out more and more thinking "eh, it'll just go back down soon" 
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:22:46

 says 5300 nodes. 
 says 5 individuals control 75% of the hashrate and about 16 control all of it. 
Bitcoin isn't really so spread out that no one could rival it right now. Maybe in the future it COULD be, but right now it's pretty concentrated. It doesn't even have the old thing where the mining pools were pools of individuals, that had some autonomy, now all the big ones are individual owners in control of their hardware. And the nodes are 5300 but a lot of those are duplicates. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:10:02
Bitcoin only has like 5200 node operators (some of which are single people running 10 or 100 nodes in VMs) and like 8 major miners. 
You are mistaken if you think bitcoin has numbers that no other organization could possibly hope to match. Just the bank branches in my city could provide more separate mining operations than bitcoin. There is over 100,000 bank locations in the US for nodes, so even 1% running nodes would beat bitcoin.
Banks could dwarf bitcoin with very very little effort. "thousands of people" is a small number for the banking system of even a single state.

They probably can afford to ignore it though. There is only a microscopic amount of money going through it today and if more goes through it in the future setting up bitpay or something is rapid. 
(plus if any real volume happened now the very very limited blockchain would just fail to process orders, so adding it now isn't even worth anything since they have a guarantee it won't suddenly grow large)

Transactions are never forgotten unless the community agrees to forget them. Plenty of blockchains have had the community decide to "roll back" the blockchain and erase transactions. Bitcoin once rolled back and discarded 50 blocks worth of transactions. 
It's not really eternal or unchangeable, it just takes community agreement.
