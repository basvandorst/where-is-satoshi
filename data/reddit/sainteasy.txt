Money/profit might not be the motivator for war, but it is definitely a requisite for war. Paying for and supporting troops and equipment and other logistics is an extremely expensive undertaking. One that is best undertaken with money forcibly appropriated from millions of citizens. I can't see warfare existing in its current modern version and conflicts reaching modern world war proportion when they must be financed from the personal pockets of those wishing for war and when there is no government to forcibly conscript soldiers to fight for them.

Can't tell if your being sarcastic. Money is a unit of value measurement. Like inches is a unit of length measurement...right? Right???

I'm just gonna put this right here:
Seems someone has already made a video that illustrates this very scenario. Basically everything you just said put to pictures and music.
Wait, what?

To my eye the biggest problem bitcoin faces is deflation. And bitcoin's biggest asset -- its cryptography -- will be it's Achilles heel. Hard drive crashes, forgotten wallet passwords, lost or destro yed paper wallets etc will, over time, decimate the supply of bitcoins. And unlike fiat currency you can't make more of it. So after the bitcoin mining peters out and all 21 million bitcoin's have been produced then what? Slowly the money supply will shrink until deflation runs rampid.
Edit : relevant to op, this is why bitcoin's real value is its distributed ledger. It's concensus engine. As a currency it is limited, but the distributed consensus engine is a game changer.
