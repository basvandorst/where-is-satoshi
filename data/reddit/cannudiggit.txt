Buying and selling bitcoins to manipulate futures prices? Why not just skip the extra step and buy and sell bitcoins to manipulate the price and save the options fees from the commodities exchange? I don't see any advantage there. Would people actually do this?

Cash-settled derivatives such as the current futures or the proposed cash-settled ETF's can be regulated to hell and back but cannot in any realistic way be considered regulation of bitcoin itself. The government can regulate fiat currencies used to trade all they like, but in the end bitcoin itself still remains unregulated.

It should. I have posted as Rival since 2013 on Bitcointalk. Rival as a username was unfortunately already taken on reddit. I have had to listen to "experts" explain why Bitcoin was in a bubble for nearly a half of a decade. It does start to get a bit stale. My only goal here is to provide the benefit of my experience, even if it falls mostly on deaf ears.

How does an exchange cancel over a billion dollars of sell orders and think that no one will end up in jail?
Did they forget that they were regulated? This is not some MtGox thing where they can fly by the seat of their pants and then cry foul because they are offshore  and no one has jurisdiction.

With even a passing understanding of the fungibility of money, you can draw a simple conclusion that makes all arguments about taking debt to purchase crypto moot. If you owe even a single dollar on a credit card, car loan, or a mortgage, and own any crypto, you have in essence borrowed that money to fund the crypto. Anyone who chooses to buy crypto rather than pay down debt is financing the crypto with existing debt, which is no different than borrowing that money a second time.

When you say "affect underlying assets", I would say no, not really. As far as I can tell, the BTC dev team and the global army of contributors and testers (and layer 2 and 3 protocols such as Lightning network) are free from any government supervision, regulation, or oversight. The conversion rate to fiat does not appear to have any identifiable effect on the "underlying asset" either, aside from fluctuations in transaction times. That issue is being addressed.

You make a good point.  Clearly BTC is not a company. However, it is important to consider that even though BTC is a decentralized system, the real savings to participants due to the removal of inefficiencies is significant. There is a serious incentive for actors to become participants. In the final analysis, participants don't care if the system is owned by a megacorp in Seattle or if it is decentralized. They are looking for the option with the least friction.

Keep in mind: The twins own over 1% of BTC in circulation... which means they have 1% of the Bcash as well. They could drive the price of Bcash to a few dollars with the press of a button. I would hate to have that gun pointed at the head of my investments.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:55:50
This would make sense if currency were immutable value counters, which they clearly are not. Every bitcoin purchased removes a portion of value from the currency used to purchase it. If everyone traded in their gold for BTC, the value of gold would quickly plummet (supply and demand) and the value of BTC would explode. Now imagine bitcoin eating all existing assets in a similar manner. Dollars are variable value counters which theoretically can become worthless by such a process.

Friedcat used idled Shenzen chip foundries to produce 110nm ASIC chips to mine bitcoins. He sold hundreds of thousands of 333Mhz USB miners across the world, the first to be released to the public. He created ASICMiner, and at one point had nearly 45% of the total hashrate. He sold shares in his farm and sent BTC dividends to his investors.
He created prototype liquid-cooled ASIC farms in shipping containers that could be sold to governments as a drop-shipped mining solution, and some of the first home-based ASIC miners branded as ASICMiner Cubes. 
And then one day he disappeared, just like Satoshi. One day he was there, and the next day he was gone, without so much as a verifiable picture to prove he ever existed.
So now FriedCat lives on in the legendermain of bitcoin just like Satoshi, a shadowy figure with no proven identity, who came, created, and then disappeared.
** EDIT ** The considerable ASICMiner wallet account (thousands of coins) was emptied years ago, and as far as I am aware no one has yet traced where the coins have gone.

This strategy might slide once or twice if you dump on Bitfinex, but Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken all use KYC. What you are suggesting is clearly illegal under current SEC regulations, and may well land you with fines that exceed your net worth even if successful. The futures are so nailed down with KYC that the risk of such manipulation likely comes at a cost too great to gamble.
It is only a matter of time before globally unregulated exchanges such as Bitfinex are crushed by government intervention, and any chance of market manipulation going undetected are eliminated. But it might fly for a few rounds before that happens. Make hay while while the sun is shining!
**EDIT** Bitfinex prices are already being discounted for variety of reasons. If not for their wide range of trading pairs they would have already been destroyed. Serious investors should avoid them like the plague.

Dividends are not a form of wealth generation, they are just a means of distributing existing wealth. I would recommend "Das Kapital" for an introduction to understanding wealth generation, as well as the categories of value associated with an asset. It should be quite instructive as to the value classes associated with the bitcoin project. I am rather surprised economists do not recognize this yet, it has been available for 150 years and for a century was required reading.

They may not set fees, but large mining operations can exert influence in the community through other more political means.
When someone with 10% of the global hash gives an opinion, it carries significant weight, and when they make "suggestions" to other entities (such as exchanges) those "suggestions" get considered. It is difficult for a large mining operation or pool to advocate against it's own profit margin.

I wonder what the insane obscene interest rate for borrowing BTC would be, and who would be crazy enough to pay it? I would lend some to the banks if they paid me an annual return in BTC, but probably not if the interest accrued in dollars.

By the same logic, the FANG stocks have been "Pumped" for the last decade. I find that unlikely. Is it not possible they actually provide some value and investors recognize that value? I would posit that bitcoin is still massively undervalued even today, and these so-called bubbles are simply steps on the path to realization of the actual value.

I am not busting on miners. They perform a critical and crucial role. However, they are currently financially incentivized to stall the evolution of the technology as much as they can. This is a temporary misalignment of incentives which will eventually be resolved once the technology proliferates. However, it will likely not be resolved without the deck of major players being reshuffled. Any organization not investing 100% in layer 2 protocols may want to rethink their position.

That would make sense if they settled in BTC. But they settle Dollars. There are no BTC being borrowed, so the price would remain unaffected.

Aside from deciding and tracking who gets or does not get to borrow and for what, I don't see any other functions the financial system provides besides simply tracking balances. The contracts required for such decisions are mostly solved by etherium, and likely will be eventually solved with BTC as well with additional layers of protocols or sidechains.

There is no need for a physical bitcoin.
There will always be a market for people to perform some functions, crypto will not replace them all. But in the end, 99% of the secretarial pool was replaced by software. But there are still "personal assistants" for running errands. 99% of records research manpower was replaced by Google. But there are still researchers for hire for things not yet on the internet. 99% of financial infrastructure will be replaced by crypto, but there will still be some people that give advice or invest for those who wish to offload that task.

100% segwit adoption would empty the mempool in 24 hours or less. But there is no monetary incentive for any major miner or pool to advocate for it. We are currently at 11% for that very reason.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:31:31
I am not bashing miners, they perform a critical and crucial role. I am simply pointing out that their natural and correct tendency towards decision-making based upon their own self interest is damaging to the short-term evolution of cryptocurrency. Eventually the technology will advance, forcing their interests to align with that advancement. We are currently experiencing a temporary disjointed incentive paradigm, allowing those incentives to have retarding effects on that advancement. Once corrected, the deck of players will likely be reshuffled. Anyone not 100% focused upon layer 2 development may want to rethink their strategy.

Consider Amazon: One might wrongly assume that everything sold on Amazon could be 10% cheaper for consumers since they charge high fees to sellers on their platform. But in actuality, Amazon creates massive wealth by reducing inefficiencies in the marketplace. They then place some of that wealth into their pockets, and let the rest help reduce the costs to consumers. The framework that allows these inefficiencies to be removed has made Amazon one of the most successful companies in the world. The inefficiencies that Bitcoin removes from the financial system are likely several orders of magnitude higher. One could make the same case for Google.
The actual value of bitcoin to society once fully realized will make Amazon and Alphabet look minuscule in comparison. There is much more here than children arguing over the price of a piece of candy at lunch time.

Sorry if I sound dense here, but you can already bet on bitcoin going down by staying in cash, and if it goes down you have the option of buying cheap coins. If you consider cash and coins as a trading pair, whichever one your bankroll is in in makes you automatically long one and short the other.

Since it's inception, bitcoin has spent the vast majority of it's time valued at less than $1000, and a simple majority below $100 per coin. To suggest that purchasing at $6500 is a once in a generation opportunity suggests generations with the duration of a fruit fly.

When I was young, my father told me that the hardest thing for someone to do is to consciously choose to do nothing. I did not understand until I started with bitcoin 4 years ago. I mined coins, invested in ASICminer, mined altcoins, traded altcoins, tried various trading strategies, all because I felt I would do better if I did SOMETHING. After all of that, I should have just taken the coins I mined and did NOTHING. It cost me a small fortune and 2 years just to get back to the number of bitcoins I had mined by early 2014.
Bitcoin goes up, down, up, down, and the only lesson I have learned is that you obtain them, and then choose to do NOTHING. My father knew something that cost me a great deal to learn.

Coinbase is over $100 higher than other exchanges, and the others are not correcting via arbitrage. One logical conclusion is that there are literally no more available funds in the other exchanges to purchase coins. Everyone has gone all-in. Coinbase accepts instant ACH transfers, enabling additional cashflow. The others may take some time to catch up since such ACH transfers have delays.

Assuming increasing populations of investors over time, the absolute value of average holdings will naturally decrease. This phenomena is known in physics as diffusion. There used to be multiple active users with 100K+ coins. There may not be any left today. In 15 years there will probably not be any individual holding 10K, and in 20 there may not be anyone holding 1K. Eventually you will need to be a nation-state just to control 10+ coins.
