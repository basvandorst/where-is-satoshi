Threads like this always crack me up, because obviously if something is getting upvoted to the top then there are a fair amount of users who find that information useful, regardless of whether you think it's a stupid question or not. 
Personally, I'd rather see people having legitimate discussions about their good/bad experiences with coinbase (as opposed to reposting GIFs from the bitcoinity tracker or posting stupid memes), but that's why there are up/down arrows next to each thread. Devoting an entire thread to complaining about what you consider to be stupid questions just creates more clutter in the sub.
But that's just my 0.000002 BTC...

Yeah, how *dare* they be self-interested investors, as opposed to libertarian ideologues!

I saw that (and agreed to it), but it was my first time purchasing, so I didn't know the process, and it left me feeling a bit underwhelmed.
If they exceeded their daily limits on Monday, then why give customers the market price on Friday (as opposed to Tuesday)? Pretty substantial difference there.

The same thing happened to me, FWIW. I bought 0.3 BTC for approx $191 on Monday of this week, and because the value had gone up by the time my transfer went through, I only ended up receiving ~0.25 BTC (for the same USD amount.)
It seems to me that they should honor the exchange rate at the moment you confirm your purchase.
