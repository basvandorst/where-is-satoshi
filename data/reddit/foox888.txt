sorry correction: the clearing of Bitfinex BTC accounts on the 15th for NY folks is not a Geo-Political event. 
What I meant is that this will be coinciding with Geo-Political events in addition to the clearing at market prices NY residents accounts... The other Geo-Political events are anything from a comet striking the planet to riots or u know the standard stuff we see daily now.

yes but not as extreme as you describe, the spread has shrunk considerably. although i note most people stick to ONE exchange, making this arbitrage very profitable indeed.

actually that would explain why the flash crashes kinda stabilize around $160, not much lower lately. 
additionally, if it costs $109 - that is taking into account hardware cost over time + electricity / rent so that is the "mining" cost.  everything above that is gravy, is that a better way of saying it for you?

TREZOR is a critical component in the safety and storage of bitcoin and is INEXPENSIVE at $100. This is a MUST HAVE device if someone is to safely store their bitcoin beyond paper wallets. Truth is it is good to have both paper wallets AND TREZOR hardware wallet!

upon analysis, this is panic selling across the board without good reason. and because of that I think as fast as Bitcoin has dropped these last few days, it will rise as quick or faster on the way up.

@_date: 2015-08-11 15:08:24
TREZOR is a great product - it is basically a paper wallet with digital access and password protection. solves the $5 wrench problem and is otherwise totally nondescript piece of kit. MUST HAVE

very interesting, although... nothing to see here move along... impossible to know how many bitcoins you have on your trezor.

if mining cost is around $109 per 1 BTC then we see what the industry actually values 1 BTC at... so anything above that is actually bubble bubble bubblebutt.

that is the funniest thing i have ever read about bitcoin. and yet we all still remain obsessed with the community and bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:28:06
traders like to leave BTC on exchange wallets so that they have flexibility to convert it into USD or other and pivot quickly. (I THINK I HAVE NO REAL IDEA).

does it matter if it is my mother, any relative, or any human on the planet. why does it matter whom it is - the offer is - if you refer someone and they buy $100 in bitcoin, the reward is $75. Yet Coinbase makes it an impossibility to pay out the reward unless they purchase coins on multiple days. 
Coinbase could pay a proportional reward of $37.50 since it is their impossibility that $100 in bitcoin could not be purchased today... but they dont. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:09:21
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:22:02
nope, i am saying that by making the new user purchase coins over two days you add another hurdle to the experience and less likely the new user will come back on day 2  - and therefore they now have that user in their system and all that new users personal information yet do not provide the reward. It is not cool.

@_date: 2015-09-09 18:29:27
COINBASE could offer proportion of reward rather than no reward at all for the referral... I thought bitcoin was divisible down to the 10th decimal place... and yet no reward for referral. This is not good business - no wonder there is so much friction to adoption. It is not the KYC or AML rules that are the friction it is services like this that are the friction to adoption. Why offer a reward that is not possible without MULTIPLE days of purchasing in order to obtain... ???

the list goes on - i feel like these are good examples of wallets for your phone that are easy to use, easy to download, and easy to grasp for the newcomer.

very goood presentation. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 16:30:31
yes, its amazing what a generation younger or older can grasp... older folks are still using check books and would never even consider using online banking. next gen down uses online banking and next generation below that is using bitcoin (or at least exceptionally open to the idea of it). Bitcoin is a generational play - but it is important to include all generations and integrate them into the whole together bitcoin will succeed. 
the hater herd is slowly being thinned.

good read
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:53:00
actually no, i learned from coinbase help support that i have not referred anyone to coinbase even though i am sitting next the person that purchased $50 right now, and even though another person purchased $150 in bitcoin right now through the link i shared with them. 
I am not a crybaby, i am pointing out that their system is misleading and dishonest

this is very relevant - based on the project that 21 Inc is involved in. They are also working closely with Intel 
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:25:05
No, that may be correct but a new user is unlikely to continue purchasing coins day after day if they are only doing it based on a referral from someone who walks them through the experience. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:18:51
you already have the customer information, you already have them signed into your system and you do not offer reward for the referral - this is exact example of an IMPOSSIBLE offer - this is definition of dishonesty and false advertising. It is absolutely clear. 
POOR USER EXPERIENCE 
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:36:22
ahhh, the infamous trolls of bitcoin. what is your problem with my posting?
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:31:23
no, i disagree. the new user only purchased coins cause I am walking her through the process. She would have bought $1000 or more today but was limited to $50 per day. And all I asked her to do was puchase $100 today. Tomorrow we wont be hanging out and she will have forgotten she even purchased the coins. Her interest in the subject was not even real to start with and I talked her into it saying I would be rewarded for the referral - both of us were disappointed that there was actually no referral bonus offered at all.
