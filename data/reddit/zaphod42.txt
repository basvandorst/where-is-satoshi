Here's my sci-fi take on the future if bitcoin blocks stay 1 mb forever.
Everyone will get a payment channel opened at birth and it will remain open until they die.
If the only on chain transactions are when people are born/die, then according to [this site]( we only would need 6 tx/sec.
edit:  I guess we would need more to top off payment channels when they run low...  1mb blocks wont work forever...

This is only my opinion.  I've been using bitcoin since 2011, and have been watching all the drama play out over the years.
I used to think Roger was just really passionate about bitcoin, but over time it's become clear to me that he let greed take over.  IMHO, He is just trying to accumulate wealth and power.
His argument is that bitcoin core is not the vision he signed up for.  He wants bitcoin to be low fee digital cash.  I have to say, I agree with him on that point.  I hate high fees, and have started using litecoin for purchases instead of bitcoin because it just isn't practical at the moment.  I do believe that will change though.  Bitcoin is still an experiment, even though it's gaining mainstream recognition.  If we make a bad choice in the development process, it could set cryptocurrency back several years.  If we approach changes carefully and slowly, then we can fulfill the potential of bitcoin sooner rather later.  People lack patience, and Roger is taking advantage of that.

EDIT: If anyone wants the truth about this, listen to the Skeptics Guide to the Universe podcast, Episode   segment starts at 56 minutes.
TL/DL: A jury awarded some guy a couple hundred million in damages, because they believed glyphosate caused his cancer.  This decision was based on arguments from a lawyer, not arguments from scientists.
The arguments were based around a decision from the IARC.  They declared glyphosate a 'probable' carcinogen.  Dr. Blair, who is in charge of the IARC, did not include evidence from the largest study ever done on glyphosate.  He knew this study existed, and knew that it did not show a link between glyphosate and cancer.  He said, under oath, that the data would have altered the IARC's analysis.
~~According to articles I just read about that lawsuit, the science says there is no evidence that glyphosate causes cancer.~~

@_date: 2014-12-15 18:06:48
true, but the use case you are referring to is 'using' it as a payment method as a consumer.  I do that all the time with circle, just purchase the needed amount of bitcoin, and use it to pay for something I want to buy.
another use case is long term speculation.  if the price gets low enough there will be a group of people that are already planning to buy in at that price to hold long term.  Those people don't care about short term fluctuations in the price, and it may very well drop lower than their buy in, but they are betting that it will go back up eventually.  That said, speculation is still like gambling, and people using it as an investment could lose everything.

The ledger we use to determine how many bitcoins each bitcoin account has is shared via a network kind of like bit torrent.
A Bitcoin wallet is basically the keys needed to access the bitcoin in the shared ledger.
Only people that are mining can write transactions to the shared ledger.  Transactions are written in blocks, hence 'block-chain'.  The reward for creating a block right now is 25 bitcoin.
Blocks are found via a cryptographic hashing of data.  This is where things start to get technical and can no longer explain things to you in simple terms :)

I totally understand the frustration!  The thing to remember is that Bitcoin is still a very new technology, and it's still in beta.  It's not finished yet.
Our society has become so used to instant gratification, that we forgot what slow organic growth looks like!
When I started with computers, there was no internet.   I would use a 2400bps modem to call another computer that was running a public BBS (bulletin board system).  It was difficult to find other local computers to call!  And if the sysop only had one phone line, I would often get a busy signal when trying to connect.
I would end up calling long distance numbers just so I could geek out on the new technology.  I got huge phone bills back then.  It was clear that this was never going to be a thing that average people did, but in the end, the basic concept of connecting computers in real time finally reached a point of user friendliness and mass adoption.  The same thing will happen with Bitcoin/blockchain tech, even if it takes 5-10 years.

The nice thing about defining a currency mathematically in software is the developers can account for and store the dollar value at purchase and sale, and even generate a tax report for you.

Ideally I would like to do it in an online meeting type scenario.  I'm sure there is software out there that allows people to share a whiteboard and audio chat at the same time.  That way I could put the chart up and annotate it while talking, and the person getting a reading could also draw on the chart while asking questions.
I just had the idea, so I'm testing to see if there is any interest.  If there is I'll start looking into doing it more full time.
For now, I could create a schedule and set up skype appointments until I find the software I like.  
Searching google, I see people charge up to $200 for a 2 hour reading.  While I'm getting started and working out the details, I would charge around .2 bitcoin for 2 hours, or if you just want a shorter reading I could do .05 btc per half hour.

@_date: 2014-10-01 15:14:08
I'm a firm believer in the concept of "Put it where it goes".
I think each autonomous company should have it's own block chain.  (like what bitshares is doing with DACs.)
I agree with OP about the fungibility issue.  A long time ago, someone sent me some mastercoin, but I gave them an address connected to my bitcoin-qt wallet, so I think there is some master coin in my bitcoin wallet, but I'm not really sure.  It's possible that I spent it on tea in a regular bitcoin transaction....

It's easy to limit your node to use less connections, which uses less bandwidth.  I have a 1TB monthly bandwidth limit, so I cap my node at 30 connections in my bitcoin.conf file.

Yes, I am admittedly not someone that has a complete understanding of finance.  Although, I do learn more everyday, and bitcoin is the primary reason I have learned as much as I have about the way financial markets work.
What I do believe is that bitcoin has opened up a huge window of opportunity for us to rethink the way that we are doing things financially. 
It enables us to do things that we previously thought were impossible, and there is no way to know what kinds of innovations will be built on top of bitcoin, or blockchains in general.  This is what excites me the most.  New innovation is possible and I want to build innovative things that will benefit society.
Bitcoin has been created and won't go away.  It's just a matter of time before the infrastructure is ready for mainstream application and adoption.

It's really not difficult to accept bitcoin.  I suggest setting it up even if there isn't immediate interest.  Bitcoin is still in early adopter phase, so there are very few people actively buying things, but this will change quickly.  It's easier to position yourself early and know where the wave will break than to chase it once it starts.

Understood that it's not a security issue, but it is an accessibility issue, which is almost as bad...   I have been using blockchain as my hot wallet for spending.  I spent coins from it minutes before it went down.  If I had been just a few minutes later, I wouldn't have been able to spend my bitcoins.  
Not being able to access my funds when I need to use them is really not cool.  What if I had just ordered a bunch of food, and went to pay with bitcoin, only to find out that blockchain was offline?  I'm not sure that businesses would be understanding of that sort of technical failure to pay....

BlackCoin has been operating on a pure POS system for a while now....  No real world attacks that I know of.  Just a bunch of theories of vulnerabilities.  I would really like to see a group of people try to attack the current POS system to see if these 'theories' have any real world application.  
@_date: 2014-09-01 04:30:07
Everyone that runs the bitcoin client shares a ledger that says how many bitcoins everyone has, using basically the same technology that powers bittorrent.  The ledger is called a blockchain.
No one can change the ledger because everyone has a copy, and the only way to add to it is through the process called "mining".  Basically just creating a sha256 hash that has a certain number of leading zeros.
When you find a valid hash as a miner, you add a block to the blockchain, which includes all of the transactions since the last block, and the ledger gets updated.  The miner also gets a "block reward", 25BTC right now.  But that number is also programmed to split in half, so that eventually all bitcoins will be mined, and miners will be paid by the transaction fees from including transactions in a block.
The bitcoin mining algorithm adjusts, so that when more hashing power is added, it gets harder to find a block.

You failed to give the rest of the quote....  he answers it in the next paragraph.  It's possible to switch to a different style of cryptography if SHA breaks.
"If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function.
If the hash breakdown came gradually, we could transition to a new hash in an orderly way.  The software would be programmed to start using a new hash after a certain block number.  Everyone would have to upgrade by that time.  The software could save the new hash of all the old blocks to make sure a different block with the same old hash can't be used."

Yes.  BitShares is 'the real deal'.

BitShares isn't just an 'alt coin'.
It is a 300% reserve derivative bank that issues bit assets.
eg. BitUSD, BitBTC, BitGold, etc...
The value of the bit asset is pegged to the value of the real world asset.  BitUSD is cool because it has the stability of the dollar but the properties of cryptocurrency.
It uses DPOS(delegated proof of stake) to secure the blockchain.  101 delegates are voted in by the community to create blocks.

Coinbase is probably one of the safest places.
edit: I didn't mean for long term storage, just that I don't rush to get my coins out of coinbase after I buy them as I would if I bought from btce or bitstamp.  I would feel comfortable leaving them on coinbase until I had a convenient moment to log in and do the transactions.  Years ago, when I used Mt. Gox to buy btc, I always dropped everything I was doing the second I got notified that I had coins, and moved them to my qt wallet.  I never trusted Gox.

I got ripped off once back in 1994 when I was a teenager.  I learned my lesson back then.  I don't claim to be smarter than anyone...  It's more of a gut feeling that I trust than a thought.

I don't think it's just the user base that drives the exponential growth in price...  This is a new technology.  A brand new protocol that makes transferring digital ownership of a thing as simple as email.
Buying bitcoin is like the on-ramp to a whole new world of being able to be a part of distributed autonomous organizations.  I have a feeling that things like BitShares X and Ethereum will be hugely successful eventually, and will exponentially increase the value of bitcoin even more.

I think one of the killer applications of bitcoin is being able to pay people for work done instantly.
When an employee is done working for the day, they clock out on the computer, the computer calculates the length of time since clock in, then sends bitcoin to their account for the hours worked.
No more waiting for a paycheck at the end of the week.
Just imagine what it would be like if money moved in real time instead of in weekly batch processes...  That is the killer feature of bitcoin.

4) We are now in conversations with a national sales team leader that worked for a very large visa/mastercard point of sale company. He will lead our national introduction to merchants on accepting Blackcoin through Coinkite and through a yet to be announced blackcoin wallet system.
5) It’s about one week until Coinkite will add BLK to their PoS systems. For those that do not understand the importance of this, this will make BlackCoin available in the real world. People will be able to buy BlackCoin directly from the terminals and also buy products directly from shops. In my opinion Coinkite is one of the most important companies in the crypto space right now.

Maybe there is someone that would be willing to help based on a contingency fee arrangement?  ie.

I was doing this up until today.  Once bitstamp was back up, I sent my bitcoins to my local wallet and encrypted it.  If you think about it, bitcoin is still technically in beta, which means all technology built on top of it is in beta as well.  Bitcoin is the "wild west" of the internet...  Leaving Bitcoin at an exchange is kind of like buying gold from someone that found a bunch during the California gold rush (1848–1855) and telling the person you bought it from "You hold on to it for me.  I'll come find you again some time and grab it."  Chances are the guy would probably get robbed or be dead by the time you wanted to pick up your gold.

She was so sure of herself, she basically bet her career as a journalist on that one story...  Now I doubt she will ever be taken seriously again.  Maybe if she came out with a humble attitude and admitted how wrong she was, people would have been nicer to her!  Her stubbornness is digging her deeper into her own hole and really just making her look like a pretty dumb person in general...
edit:  I just want to add, the fact that the new owners of newsweak are allowing her to go on like this says a lot about them as well...

Here's my take on supernet....
This is an attempt at consolidating a bunch of worthless coins together.
The basic premise is that each coin has to have a unique feature to add to the supernet group, and all features will be available to all coins in the supernet.  In exchange, 10% of each coin that joins will be bought up by the supernet.  Supernet tokens will be issued on the NXT asset exchange.
I say, if the coin/protocol can't stand on it's own, then let it die.  Survival of the fittest.  Consolidation will happen naturally.

I'm not speculating.  This is a game changing technology, bitcoin the currency is like email, email doesn't make you any profit, but when you realize that bitcoin the network and the blockchain have created a new protocol that business can be done on, much like the creation of http, then you'll see the bigger picture.  I'm saying bitcoin is just the beginning.  It's a proof of concept.  It's definitely not the end, but it's also not going away any time soon.  Projects like BitSharesX and Ethereum are next generation concepts built on top of the technology that powers bitcoin, and these these do have the ability to generate profit.  I believe bitcoin will continue to raise in price, as more and more people adopt it.  I use it for transactions whenever possible, and try to buy small amounts once a week.  The truth is, Bitcoin works.  It doesn't matter how much it's 'worth' in fiat currency.

That is a really convoluted logic, and completely absurd.
How are you supposed to keep track of how much each of your inputs were originally purchased at!  I'm not going to use coin control to manually choose which input to spend so I can control my capital gains during a purchase.  They obviously have no understanding of how bitcoin works, or they want to make it too difficult to manage the taxes around it as an attempt at sabotage.

Running an ASIC is pretty easy.  Individuals don't run asics anymore because there is almost no chance for an ROI.  You need to be able to put a lot of money in to get enough hashing power.
The whole point of crypto currency is not needing to trust a central authority.  There will be a definite divide between people that use it as intended and those that try to use it like we did fiat in the dark ages.

The only one I like is BitShares-PTS.  But it isn't really a 'coin'.
@_date: 2014-05-27 20:15:35
Normal people need skeuomorphic design in technology.  Calling it a coin is something you can relate to, and say easily.
It's similar to your 'address book' on your computer.  They call it an address book, even though it's not a book.  They should call it a contact database, but that doesn't roll off the tongue as nicely or make sense to a non geek.
If you really want to call it what it is, then instead of saying "I have 5 coins" you could say "The sum total of my unspent inputs equals 5", but I can't see that happening.
Looks like we are stuck with "coin", unless galactic credits takes off.

I wouldn't call it an upgrade.  UASF is a tighter restriction on consensus rules to exclude certain blocks.  If miners just keep mining the same kind of blocks, and you refuse to relay them, you're just forking yourself.  If a really large number of nodes does it and some miners go along then that would result in a hard fork.

The 1MB limit was a quick work around put in place to prevent a DOS attack on the network.
If a miner makes a block in a certain kind of way, it can take other miners and nodes a long time to verify the block.
Capping it 1MB means it can only ever take a certain amount of time to verify and send the block to all nodes around the world.
I have a feeling Satoshi is softly banging his head against his desk for choosing this method.  I'm sure a more elegant solution could have been created if more time was spent on the problem.....  The 1MB limit has created a serious divide in the community.
Here's a thread from last year on this topic...

@_date: 2017-03-06 22:53:28
If a large group of nodes suddenly comes online that restricts the consensus rules so they are not transmitting certain blocks, then they are just forking themselves if the all miners don't follow along.  There will be nodes and miners that did not constrain the consensus rules, which will end up forking the chain.  It seems to have all the risks of a hard fork and none of the benefits.

Is there a list of which devs are on the payroll?  Is the dev that holds the key to accepting pull requests paid by blockstream?  If so, wouldn't that be a conflict of interest?

The blocks are only "bad" in the eyes of the new nodes that have modified the consensus rules...  Evil is in the eye of the beholder.
Maintaining status quo is the power of bitcoin's consensus mechanism.  It's really difficult to upgrade the protocol without overwhelming consensus, which means new upgrades have to be pretty great to be accepted by everyone.  We are in uncharted territory with bitcoin.  It sure is fun!  Even if there is a hard fork, bitcoin will survive.  Ethereum is stronger than ever after their messy hard fork.

I would assume, that in a consensus system, the consensus algorithm itself would be a product of consensus...
I remember a lot of talks in the early days by Andreas Antonopoulos where he said bitcoin would be what ever the users decided it would be by choosing to download and run the version of the software they wanted.
It's up to miners and node operators to define the protocol by choosing which implementations to run.  When there is overwhelming consensus on the consensus rules, whatever that might consensus might be, that is bitcoin.

I thought unlimited was an attempt to increase block size to reduce transaction fees and allow for more users of the blockchain.
You make it sound like it's purely a political motivation...
I just want bitcoin to be more useful.  I've stopped spending bitcoin and am just holding because transaction fees are too high.  I feel like core is limiting my magic internet money by keeping the block size at 1 MB, and that's not cool.  I've seen plenty of information that says a 4mb block would be fine, and a 2mb block would be a non issue.  Why is there such resistance to changing a single variable in the code?

I don't really care what most people say...  It's just words...  bitcoin is an experiment.  We are in uncharted territory.  Maybe only one bitcoin chain will survive, maybe there will be three.  No one knows for sure what will happen.  I prefer to keep an open mind.

A lot of people think doing segwit as a softfork is a bad idea.  Since we really need to increase the block size eventually, it would be best to do it all at once as a hard fork that includes both segwit an the block size increase.

If you really want to know though, bitcoin is made up of thousands of computers running the bitcoin software.  it works kind of like bittorrent.  bitcoin nodes all share the same ledger of how many bitcoins each person owns via a peer to peer network.  
The ledger is called the blockchain.  The blockchain is just a [merkle tree]( data structure.  A new block is created by [hashing]( all the transactions you want to add to the new block with information from the previous block.

Enable coin control in bitcoin preferences to select which UTXO you want to include in a transaction.  The only way I know of to break up a single UTXO is to create one transaction that sends parts of it to several different addresses you control, or send several transactions one at a time to one or more accounts.  each transaction will cost you though since you have to pay the miner fee.

Sorry, but I have to disagree.  Anyone can acquire Bitcoin through services like circle.com.  That makes it easier to acquire than gold since all you need is a debit card.  It is both a store of wealth and transactional.  Bitcoin blends aspects of several things in a way we've never seen before.  It's utility and scarcity are what make it valuable, not the difficulty in acquiring it.

That way I can use it as money and hoard it as a store of value at the same time.

You only need to increase block size if the blocks are full and people want to fit more transactions per block.
alt coin blockchains don't have the volume of transactions that bitcoin does, so increasing the size wouldn't matter.  The blocks will still be small due to the small number of transactions.

Miners add new blocks to the blockchain.
They do a lot of math to generate blocks.  If your transaction was part of the math they did, your transaction is included in the block.
They keep the transaction fees for all the transactions they included, as well as get a 'block reward', which is the distribution method of the 21 million bitcoin.  Block reward will continue decreasing at a predictable rate until all the coins have been distributed.

ethereum hard forked the chain and replaced a single contract's byte code with a new contract that just let people withdraw the ether they sent to the contract.
There was an EIP that proposed blacklisting the dao address, but it would have been an easy denial of service attack vector, so the community decided to just replace the hacked contract.  Because of the nature of the design, that kind of thing was possible on ethereum without altering any other contracts or transactions.

Poloniex front end code uses a lot of jquery and is poorly optimized.  Their back end code must be just as inefficient.  Wouldn't be surprised if it's all PHP like gox was.
Modern node.js web servers can handle 250,000 concurrent connections, and front end technologies like react.js make DOM operations take a lot less cpu cycles.  There's no reason polo has to perform so poorly.  They should have invested in more modern architecture.  I have no idea what they use for order matching algorithm, but I have a feeling Poloniex was built by amateurs...

Sorry, but I'm not wrong.  There is a group of people that are very against segwit.  If people try a UASF, then the people that oppose it will spend as much money as they need to keep the minority chain alive.  That means the chain split will be indefinite, and therefore, a UASF has all the risks of a hard fork and none of the benefits.

Instead of trying to think of it as a way to buy mundane things, think of it as the best way to store and transfer wealth we've ever had.  Real estate, and rare metals/gems are cool, but you can't put the value of it on a flash drive and walk across international borders.  If stored properly, bitcoin is the first asset that is practically impossible for anyone to confiscate from you.
Bitcoin is deflationary, USD is inflationary.  This means that over time, 1 dollar will buy you less things, and 1 bitcoin will buy you more things.  Which one would you rather use as a savings account?
USD will continue to inflate as more money is printed.  The government likes this because it has a lot of debt that it needs to pay back in dollars.  If they devalue the dollar, then they end up paying back less value for the same number of dollars.

The 1mb limit was a quick fix to prevent a denial of service attack.
People could build big 'attack blocks' that could take miners several minutes to validate, which would slow down mining and stop transaction processing.

IMO, the best immediate solution is bigger blocks, even though that isn't the popular opinion on this subreddit.
Of course it's not the end all solution...  Unless there is a major breakthrough in computer science, every single transaction can't be stored on chain, but 1MB is smaller than a floppy disk!

You're making the assumption all bitcoin clients stay exactly as they are right now.  If someone were to go write a few lines of code so it wouldn't reorg the chain, and it only built the chain with non-segwit blocks, then it's no longer technically impossible.

A reorg happens when there is a chain split, and a bunch of transactions happen on the current longest chain, but then due to an increase in hash rate, the other chain becomes the longest chain.
This invalidates all transactions that happened on the other chain, since the longest chain wins in bitcoin.

Last year Craig Wright came out and declared he was Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin.
He did some kind of signature trick behind closed doors in a controlled environment to convince Gavin Andresen that he was Satoshi.  Gavin made a post saying he thought craig was satoshi, but quickly changed his stance to feeling like he may have been bamboozled because he realized craig didn't provide verifiable proof to the public.
Suddenly, craig is back, but now he's giving talks at bitcoin events saying things like: "Fuck Raspberry Pis, if you can't afford a $20,000 node to "help" the network, piss off".  It's obvious that his agenda is to centralize the bitcoin network.
There have been several posts about his lies and cons already... just searching this subreddit for his name should bring up plenty of evidence against him being satoshi.

Each transaction you receive can be used as an input into a transaction you send.  A single receiving address may have many unspent transaction outputs(utxo) that can be used as inputs.    It's kind of like having a bunch of different sized fiat currency bank notes.  if something costs $23, you can give them a $20 and a $5, and you get the change back.  It's the same in bitcoin, but an input can be any arbitrary amount that you've received before, and the fee is determined by how many bytes the transaction is, not by how much value the transaction is.  More inputs means more bytes taken up in the blockchain, so a larger fee.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:31:41
Part of the reason is that craig is taking advantage of the split in the community.  
He is saying things that r btc likes to hear...  When people hear things that they want to hear, they are subconsciously more willing to overlook the parts they don't want to see.  This causes perfectly rational people to start saying things like: "listen to his message, and ignore his lies".  This in turn causes newcomers to start listening to him, and because they haven't been around for all the drama in real time, they start to believe his lies that he is satoshi.

The dao hard fork wasn't a rollback.
The fork replaced the byte code of the dao contract with a contract that allowed the people that sent ether to it to withdraw their ether.  
It was basically just a refund.  No other transactions were effected on the ethereum chain.
Regardless of what immutability fundamentalists say, the fork was supported by most of the community because it was clear that the contract was exploited in a way that was not intended by the developers and it was the first major smart contract.  It held a stupid amount of ether.  It was a huge learning experience and ethereum is stronger now because of it.
I think ETC will die off eventually.  99% of developers support Ethereum, not ETC.

This is a misconception about ethereum.  
History can't be rewritten because of popular opinion.  
The only reason it was possible was because ethereum was so new, and it was obvious to anyone with any common sense at all that the dao contract was exploited in a way not intended by the developer.
Ethereum is a community of programmers, and programmers understand that writing perfect code is hard.  The DAO was a learning experience, and a really valuable one, but a fork due to a failed smart contract is highly unlikely to happen again.

Maybe I'm missing something, but why call it 'bitmain coin'?  All they are really doing is increasing the blocksize.  I read their blog post, and it sounds like they have a well put together plan.
Isn't there a whole other subreddit full of bitcoin users and miners that want a chain with bigger blocks?  I don't think it's just bitmain that wants it.

I guess I don't see it the same way...  Cryptocurrency is an experiment.  There are no rules.  We are creating the rules as we go.  That's what makes it fun.


If you have the ability to fix something that is obviously broken, and the only one you harm is the one that broke it, then that seems like a no-brainer choice to make.  
Ethereum isn't like bitcoin, they didn't roll back the chain.  They just replaced the bytecode of a single contract with a new contract that let the people withdraw the Eth they sent to it.  No changes were made to any other transactions or contracts on the chain.

This part of the blog post kind of blows my mind...


That basically means USAF is more damaging to bitcoin than a simple block size increase hard fork with decent length of time to activate.
I've been around bitcoin since 2010, and the biggest argument on this subreddit was always that if we hard forked to larger blocks, it would leave behind all the nodes that hadn't updated, which would cause a chain split.
A wipe out is even worse than a chain split!  I have several /Satoshi:0.9.99/ nodes connected to my node right now...  what happens to those guys if a reorg happens?  This makes UASF seem like a serious attack on bitcoin :(
