Forget legal action, just beat the shit out of him.  Much cheaper and more satisfying in the end.
Cheaper meaning it will probably cost you more to try to sue him than it will be accepting the loss.
There is no police investigation that will sort through blockchain transactions.  There will be no justice but street justice.

This is why "collection" agencies exist.  And by agency, I mean vinnie and bobby with a baseball bat and a gun.
Seriously you have the dudes address, why not do some research and get some dox collected?
Of course the dude could have ordered to an address he doesn't control and stole it from the front porch but highly doubt that.
Step up and own this noob.

People call bitcoin a scam also.  You are literally just as bad as those nay-sayers.

Someone explain to me how this relates to butterfly labs and how they are a scam.  I know someone here wants to say it.  Lets hear it!
Oops! 
Already beat me to it, yep I knew it, somehow butterfly labs would be brought up as being an even BIGGER scam.  Thanks !

[Great explanation of why client side encryption is 'dangerous' and considered harmful.](
If something seems too good to be true it probably is.
tl;dr - no client side encryption is secure, including this.

Would this not be an excellent honeypot?
Why the hell would anyone who actually values privacy use this service?  You can go to your local target/walmart/whatever and pick up a 20 dollar "burner phone", then buy a 20 dollar phone card, all paid for in cash, much more anonymous than this service can ever be, and cheaper!
I have no idea what kind of sucker thinks this is a better idea than actually buying something in cash and having it in your hand, as opposed to having something that needs to be delivered to an address?
I don't mean to be insulting to your business model guys, but this just screams honeypot.


Ummm yeah other than the glaring hole that is the fact the damn thing needs to be delivered to an address.  Oh, I forgot, you guys crossed your fingers and pinkie swore/scouts honor that you guys destroy all records of your shipping address.  The only criminals that will use this service are the incredibly stupid.

Then it's not being stored on your phone.  What a pointless argument.

Hear that folks?  Governments are the only entity physically capable of building and maintaining roads, and doctors are magically free.  Pay no mind that the government itself is funded by tax payers, if I yell the word free at you enough times, maybe it might make it true.
FREE! YOU DONT LIKE FREE?!?!?!

Lots of things could be happening.  Someone could be arp spoofing you and trying to get you to login to their evil version of bitcointalk.org and then get your access credentials.
It could be a corporate/school misconfiguration somewhere involving ssl, it could be a number of things.
A screenshot like that does nothing to help figure out what's going on.

No because he, or the person he heard it from pulled it out of their ass.
