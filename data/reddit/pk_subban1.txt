I'm fine if I lose everything I have in it and am expecting some downs. Its more of an investment of knowledge as I'm only 19.

There is no advantage to buying a coin in which it appears to be cheap per coin. You should be looking at marketcap. XRP has the third highest market cap. A single coin will never be worth hundreds of dollars because of its large supply.
XRP already has a large marketcap so it potentially has less room for growth than a REAL penny coin (low Marketcap coin)  and saying that it can’t fall from this height is ridiculous as it’s already valued HIGHLY despite people thinking it’s cheap by the fact that you can own one for pennies. LTC is valued less by the market than XRP despite one LTC being worth 200x+ more than one XRP, there is a better chance of you doubling your money in LTC over XRP.
That said I expect huge moves from XRP soon as it’s been way to quiet.

You can download wallet apps on your mobile device so you can be in control of your coins. I used the Breadwallet before I got my hardware one
Or if you're on a computer you could get an Electrum wallet

Kinda weird how I stumbled upon this post because I'm subbed to your hcf channel lmao
To answer your question, it HAS made me mad. I've known about Bitcoin since 2013 but never thought too much of it. Oh well I picked some up so I guess we'll see what happends.

You're already winning by just getting out of the lotto
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:53:47
That's a great strategy, lots of people do it.

Can't really go wrong. I chose the nano s because it supports all of my coins. Ordered from the official website and it came in a week!
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:32:47
Thanks for sharing, this was heartwarming.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:42:59
No, at that amount it's definitely not worth it

If you use GDAX (the exchange coinbase uses) over coinbase you get extremely low fees. I wish I could use it but I'm Canadian :(
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:25:40
I've heard only bad things about that exchange recently
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:17:07
Never used it, just what I've read from posts  over time. 
Read one today where a guys money's been frozen for over a month and customer support has been no help

Did you select the bitcoin/Ether icon on your Ledger?
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:20:36
Literally signed up for Bittrex today. Good thing I didn't do anything
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:24:55
Bitcoin is not around solely for you to make returns on your investment 
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:10:05
Let's just work on getting it to the moon first.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:25:52
Ordered directly from the website, despite being told it wouldn't ship until Nov 2nd I got it today. Ordered on the 18th
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:26:39
Ordered mine directly from Ledger and it didn't have the tamper-proof security seal. There's a slip explaining why they don't in the box
