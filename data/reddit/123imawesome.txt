That sounds like a good idea. I'm not a US citizen so I would only effect me indirectly, since you guys sort of set the standard.  
Here we have a party who wants to implement this in the way that you get to choose what party you agree with on different topics and then the direct democracy's party members splits up by % and votes accordingly to their electorates will.
I would also like the peoples initiative they've got going in Switzerland where if you get a certain number of signatures the entire country has to vote for it. 
Just simple yes or no questions.

You missunderstand me. 
People need money, we should use money. But as a representative leader you should represent the people who elected you, and not the money that sponsored you. That is what I mean by pro money.

And that should tell you something about the system you are in.

direct democracy also strikes me as a somewhat good idea. instead of the charade we get spoon feed today.

The native Americans used sea shells. But let's keep to the recent shall we? 
Here is a correction for you to deduce.
Governments need money, money does not need governments.

Not true, voters are extremely rarely bought, simply because it is the most ineffective and transparent forms of corruption.
