Does anyone know how the IRS defines "ownership" in regard to crypto wallets? Does it have to do with whether you have access to the private key or more about whether you were the person that created the wallet?
Bank accounts are one thing.. They have to be opened in the name of a legal entity, but wallets can be opened by anyone or anything, and ownership is defined as whether the right privately key is produced...

Sure, we did not create gold, but it wasn't currency until we said it was. Gold is natural; gold as currency is artificial.

Maybe use an Android wallet?

Yes. Mine went through almost instantly.

Works pretty decently when the processor is ramped up to full speed, but the miner I used on my GT 10.1 doesn't keep the professor at full speed, so it slows waaay down when you leave it alone for a few minutes.
Edit: I meant "processor," but I'll leave "professor" in there so ttk2 comment still makes sense :P

Isn't all currency artificial?

Not if your currency is infinitely divisible.

I got a response today. Troubles with Mt. Gox. See my comment above.

Because you're complaining about Bitcoins as if they were created and controlled by some entity that is selling you a service. You're not entitled to ease of use. If you can't figure it out, don't bitch about your own lack of resourcefulness. I understand that you are highlighting some real issues confronting Bitcoin adoption, but you really don't need to have an attitude of entitlement about it.

Excellent first choices, BTW.

I just assumed it was six, because I didn't get my email until shortly after six.

So is the EP out yet?

The purchase process involved providing an email address and sending some coin to an address. After six confirmations, they send you a download link via email.

Lamesauce. Right when I was interested in checking it out.

I'm thinking about it... I've got an old Samsung Vibrant that I want to get rid of, but I don't see the phone available on their site :(
Edit: Turns out they do have a record of the Vibrant, but it didn't show up until I searched on its model number: T959. I have initiated the trade-in, and I have received an acknowledgement email stating that an envelope is being sent to me. I'll update this post when I find out whether or not I get my bitcoins :)
Update: I sent in my phone with the supplied packaging, and I got a confirmation email stating that the phone had been recieved, and that due to high demand, my bitcoins would show up within three to four days. It's now day five, and I don't have my BTC yet :/ I'm fairly certain that they will show up at some point, but it's a little annoying that it's taking longer than stated.

I don't think that passive aggressive remarks about OP's valid concern is restoring faith in your customer service.

Same here, but it only happened the first time.

I'm a little disappointed so far. See my original comment for the first part of the story: 
I received my phone mailer in the mail, put my phone in it, and sent it off. Got an email from traade.co a couple days later saying that they would review the condition of my phone, and I would have my BTC in 3-4 business days. Yesterday was the fourth business day since I received that email, and I am still coin-less. I understand that they may be overwhelmed with business from redditors, but the least they could do in this situation is send me an email stating that they are backed up and that it will take longer than the quoted time-frame to get me my money. I'm about to attempt to contact traade.co to see what's going on.
Update 5/8/13 - I received an email back from trade.co informing me that they are having difficulty acquiring Bitcoin from Mt. Gox, and I should have my money no later than Saturday. We'll see what happens...
Update 05/09/2013 - I got my bitcoins today! I wish the communication had been a little better to begin with, but I consider myself satisfied with the service at this point. Thanks, traade.co!

I'm quite surprised at the amount of misleading and false information in this article :(
