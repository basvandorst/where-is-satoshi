I'm not saying that blockchain technology doesn't have a future, it certainly does. We just don't have a good way to pick the winners yet. Maybe the google and apple equivalent of crypto is out there today, maybe not. But I don't think BTC is the answer. 
And cmon, how is bitcoin investors not giving free work for hopes of future gains? Bitcoin's price is almost entirely leveraged on future potential, unless you're willing to claim that one bitcoin has the purchasing power of 12000 US dollars. I have lurked the crypto forums for some time: almost nobody understands or gives a fuck about the underlying tech. So basically people are buying into bitcoin for the future potential of a technology they don't understand. This is exactly how the dotcom bubble happened.

Never buying and holding btc. I'm just calling bs on the current pricing and encouraging people to research what they're actually investing in. 
Edit: I should say, never buying btc unless it's at a fair market price, with a feasible solution to its current problems, and with low upcoming risk of legislative restrictions. Right now, none of these factors are present.

I do get bitcoin and most of the other popular cryptocurrencies because I have actually read the whitepapers.

If Bitcoin is a currency valued at 14k or whatever it is right now, you're basically claiming that one bitcoin has the purchasing power of 14 thousand US dollars. I just don't see this happening, not even in the distant future. 
I've asked this to all my friends that are into BTC investing right now: *what is bitcoin being used for*? What's its utility? It has basically zero adoption in the real world, is slow as fuck, and the transaction costs are insane because of how the consensus mechanism is structured in the ledger.
The blockchain market is in a crazy bubble right now, probably similar to the dotcom bubble, and [Bitcoin is the Boo of our time]( If there was any way to short the fuck out of bitcoin I'd do it straight away.

You know, except the fact that most of the worlds governments' balance sheets include massive loans issued in USD.
