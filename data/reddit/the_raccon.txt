In what way? Bitcoin is still around and it's exchange rate to USD is around $4000 now, just like it was before the bullrun at the end of 2017 and the bear market around 2018. Where are people still using German reich marks or the Venezuelian bolivar?
Actually to be fully correct, the recent bull and bear markets are only a result of volatile supply and demand on exchanges, not inflation or deflation. Remember that inflation is always predictable and predefined in Bitcoin. So as a bonus question: considering that no central authority can control Bitcoins inflation rate, how is inflation/deflation a threat to Bitcoin again?
@_date: 2019-03-26 06:34:36
Look at the total supply of Bitcoin, not the Bitcoin price in USD. One is predictable, the other is volatile. Then look at the total supply of USD, just like you would do when discussing the USD inflation. You don't measure the USD inflation by looking at the exchange rate between USD and hamburgers, you look at the total supply of USD because that's how you're supposed to measure inflation/deflation. So why are you using that terrible method of measurement for Bitcoin?

While they "check" for money laundering... In reality they let money laundering pass unnoticed all the time, you just gotta launder a large enough amount of money and don't forget to bribe the bank. Preventing money laundering might actually be easier with Bitcoin as anyone can do research and discover suspicious transactions. With banks, you'll need a snitch inside the bank and a group of journalists willing to risk their life's to expose the corruption.
@_date: 2019-03-08 09:32:08
And why wouldn't they? if you have access to a reliable way of exchange you can pay in BTC and then exchange the equal amount in USD to BTC. People wouldn't do that if the item get more expensive but if there's discounts involved some would probably consider it.
Peoples interest in $$$ is because that's that easiest (or only) way they know to pay for stuff. Once BTC has all the advantages over USD the average Joe is interested in, the interest will soon shift to BTC. Even if it includes a moment of exchange with all the trouble that means for the average Joe.

You do miss the point. You're arguing about inflation vs deflation in a discussion about two methods used to adjust between them. I.e market value where you switch between inflation and felation all the time without crashing the currency or a central bank controlling the supply by creating artificial inflation to ensure a stable inflation and thereby avoid dangerous deflation while the asset itself ironically is still market valued.
I'm not arguing about inflation vs deflation, I'm arguing against having a central authority being able to manipulate the price of the asset with articvially created inflation which as you say is to avoid deflation.
@_date: 2019-03-25 06:04:23
Considering the properties of most FIAT currencies, inflation could be a critical feature for the currency to work, as the opposite (deflation) would be catastrophic for FIAT. However, with market valued assets like Bitcoin, Gold coins etc it doesn't really matter if you have inflation or deflation as it'll only affect the speed of development without being a threat to the whole society or the currency itself. 
Having a variation between inflation and deflation (assuming the currency could handle it) would be more healthy than constant inflation until hyperinflation and then a total collapse of the society. Change my mind.

Correct, but it's inflation is and will always be predictable and decreasing over time. In FIAT you'll always have an unpredictable and volatile inflation with some attempts to regulate it at a stable level, not to benefit you or anyone else but to control the purchase power of the society.
@_date: 2019-03-25 06:52:29


Ignorance by acknowledgement, how does that even work?


If you expect a "stable" price in USD with a behavior similar to most FIAT currencies I can see the problem. However, that's not what Bitcoin is. Why reinvent FIAT? How would you change Bitcoin to solve this problem, without loosing it's fundamental properties and advantages over FIAT?


So 3.8% predictable inflation with a predictable halving around each 4th year makes it hard to use? how? The real issue here is rather the exchange rate to FIAT. Because Crypto and FIAT has different properties, and since FIAT has long been the established method for payments you'll be exposed to volatility once you see both of these payment methods right next to each others. 
You could apply the same logic to cars and horses. If you know how to ride a horse but not how to drive you'll probably find it hard to use a car too right? But would you still argue against cars because of that considerably small difference and completely ignore the major technical advantages the car has over the horse?

I suppose it's because people prefer to pay 3.89654 mBTC for an item instead of 4.9 mBTC where the first one is live exchanged to USD and the second one literally a price in BTC adjusted with some delay to cover for eventual volatility. Certainly tho, if the business makes a lot of profit and have paid their bills the second option will more often offer great discounts like 1 mBTC for a short period op time, all for the same item.
On the other hand, people do like discounts and I'm sure there are ways to update your price tags in BTC without considering the exchange rate to USD and still make some good profit while the customers feel that they get a good deal.
I mean, we've done this with fiat at some point in time. Prices for new items has never been certain from the beginning, it's all about guesses on supply and demand then adjustments based on the same conditions.

Do you wait 120 days for your credit card payments to verify? nope, the grocery market trust that most people wont go to their bank and claim the money back with a fake story about how they didn't get their groceries. And for those few who does that the grocery market simply adjust their prices to cover the loss just like they do to cover the transaction fees.
They wouldn't need to wait 20 minutes for blockchain confirmations because most people wouldn't bother to go through all the trouble just to steal some groceries. And if it became a real issue the grocery store could simply build their own payment system with prepaid credit, or their own blockchain. Just like most public transportation companies has done already because traditional cards are just to slow and expensive.
@_date: 2018-10-27 14:24:21
People do get scammed all the time even in the traditional banking system, probably more than in the crypto world. The only difference is that banks and payment processors sometimes can help you get your money back, or you might have an insurance with your bank so that others can pay for your loss while the scammer can keep your money.

The upper limit is set partially by the availability of the energy. If the electricity to run your miners cost more than the profit from your miners you wouldn't mine and thus the energy consumption would not increase. The more people who participate in mining, the higher difficulty. And higher difficulty means less profit for each individual miner.
Also most of the recent increase in energy usage comes from previously unused renewable sources which means cheap energy without additional environmental impact. You don't need to be worried.

It's another way to do it, probably the preferred way as "someone else" (people with debt) will pay for the destruction of money supply. The only problem is when people cannot afford to pay the higher interest, they get homeless and the bank takes the house, which they can't afford to maintain. The economy would be screwed anyway.


That only delayed the fatal crash, with a high cost for these nations tax payers. although it looked bad for the nations who let the economy crash back in 2008, those countries are probably gonna survive better than those who bailed out the bank, just to make the bubble grow bigger.

Maybe if every bill had some kind of number/key/hash/QR code printed on them so that anyone with physical access to the bill could verify the value of the bill and check if it's real.

Shouldn't be impossible to implement offline verifiable paper bills that could be used without having to trust a third party.

Fiat is actually a market valued asset just like everything else. You can only have a stable value by adjusting inflation to a fixed rate and put the new printed money into your own pocket. The problem is when actual inflation occurs, i.e when the demand goes down lower than your planned inflation. That event means that you as a bank must destroy your own money to lower the inflation to the fixed rate to keep the fiat currency stable. No bank could afford that which is why, when fiat crash, it crashes really hard beyond recovery. and it could happen to any country.

Inflation and deflation are just symptoms. The real problem is when you try to regulate an asset with a market based value (like everything) while the supply is unlimited and controlled by a central authority.
The central authority can adjust the value to keep it stable only by creating new money out of thin air (inflation) or by destroying their own money (deflation but very limited). Obviously none would sacrifice their own money just to create deflation when the fiat price falls and that's why, when fiat falls, it falls hard beyond recovery.
@_date: 2019-02-10 10:15:02
You're missing the point. Inflation/Deflation is not the problem. Same goes for your example, you can't be out jogging all the time and you can't sit on the sofa all the time, you need both to stay healthy. Inflation/Deflation are just tools you can use to manipulate the price of an asset. This means, if you want to keep the price stable, you have two options:
* **Inflation**: You print new money and put them in your own pocket, this works as long as the market price is actually stable, goes up or very slowly goes down.
* **Deflation**: You destroy some of your own money to force the market value to go up. 
This is why most fiat currencies eventually crash completely as soon as their market value starts to go down a little. There's no point arguing about inflation/deflation. The relevant discussion is about regulated market value ("stable", like fiat) vs unregulated market value ("unstable", like any asset). Forced inflation may be shitty but forced deflation is indeed a catastrophe as it would never work.

Because FIAT only works in combination with a growing population and constant over consumption. That's why nobody truly cares about the environment, and a bunch of kids running around protesting and demanding everyone to abandon their wealth "*for the climate*".

Those "security features" are only needed because it's too damn easy to steal one or more cards and instantly use them to buy all kinds of stuff without the owner notice anything until the bank account is empty. 
If only there was some kind of currency, where you didn't have to walk around with a plastic card with the private key printed on it in plain text and hand it out to everyone you'd buy stuff from we wouldn't need central authorities who control all of our money and stop us from paying because they think someone stole our card just because we do an unusual or large payment once.
It's not that security has become the enemy, it's rather the lack of security which has introduced new routines, and those routines are causing trouble when we cannot use our own money without the banks and the government ruining the financial freedom.

Define valuable, how can we say that something is valuable or not by valuing it in FIAT currency which is literally backed by nothing but thin air? Sure the market is volatile and merchants may want to change their prices quickly to avoid selling to cheap or too expensive but that shouldn't be any problem in these times when we all have computers to do the maths for us.
A few century's ago gold coins where used as payment without problem in terms of valuation, the only difference between then and now is that people had to use their brains so the market where much slower and thus the gold price less volatile than Bitcoin today.

Not really, the term itself is just a made up word used to dismiss one's own hypocrisy. Stop dismissing arguments with "whataboutism" and don't be a hypocrite. We need to discuss the energy usage in all areas and make real and fair comparisons. 
The main issue here is not that Bitcoin uses a lot of energy, but how the energy usage, fiat vs Bitcoin is interpreted. The comparison is all about individual transactions which means for fiat, you'd count the energy used by servers owned by VISA or MasterCard and divide that on all unique transactions/users using those payment processors while for Bitcoin you'd count all energy used by miners and divide that on all transactions, including bulk transactions while you completely ignore the true amount of real users.
That approach will of course render fiat more energy efficient, but it isn't, because you don't count in all the additional waste of energy like middle hands, payment processors, banks, physical offices, staff, client computers, printing of physical money, armored cars, guards, vaults, development of software, manufacturing of servers etc (yes manufacturing of ASIC miners, development, etc should count too).
And let's not forget how the energy usage relates to the amount of users. In fiat, if you double the amount of users you'll double the energy usage too because the scaling will be linear in order to provide equally good service for all customers. With Bitcoin on the other hand you don't need 2x more miners just because the amount of users get's 2x higher, sure the network needs an increased hash-rate eventually for better security, but it doesn't have to be linear to the amount of users in order to provide equally fast and cheap transactions for everyone. Once cryptocurrency can scale properly without loosing privacy, security or become centralized it will be more energy efficient "by user" than any fiat currency could ever be.

Google (and all their competitors) scale both horizontally and vertically tho so it's not really comparable.

The vast majority won't suffer about things they don't know about. With a few large companies controlling more than 90% of the market on social media and payment processing, innovation will eventually slow down and people will accept whatever garbage these companies comes up with.

Imagine if they've managed to convince everyone that Firefox was a "*Nazi browser*", what do you think would have happened? We would all still use IE6, the web would have been terrible to use, but nobody would suffer, because nobody would know about the better reality we're currently living in.

Well, I got this theory that all a scammer dream about is to get rich quick. And once they get rich they gonna take a nice cold money bath like Scrooge Mcduck. Let's face it, Bitcoin is great and all, [but you can't do this](

Which means that if you choose to stay anonymous, i.e by not linking your wallet and public information to your ID you get privacy. By the same principle, you'll loose your privacy if you decide to give up anonymity.
How are you gonna get privacy from Bitcoin if you give away anonymity by following the KYC regulations? You'd basically get the same amount of privacy as you'd have in a bank account. That fact invalidates the privacy argument when you try to convince people why Bitcoin is better than FIAT, how's that "not harmful" for Bitcoin adoption?

Isn't it a bit strange tho that a company like Coinbase, promoting cryptocurrency which is supposed to be decentralized and censorship resistant suddenly bans a platform who's only "crime" is to promote free speech. I don't understand why? it's their right to choose who can use their platform, but what's the point?

You're suggesting limitations in peoples economic freedom and freedom of speech based on their opinions. I'm just curious if that makes you happy with today's centralized systems (i.e banks, payment gateways and social media)?

Hmm, this paradox of tolerance getting more and more complex...
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:44:05
Well technically most bans occurs when someone with (according to Twitter) extreme opinions, gets too many followers. All large social media platform are full of extremists and crazies with a couple of hundred followers but nobody really suffers from them because they don't even know they exist. 
The bans literally don't make any sense, unless it's part of a plan to stop the competition from alternative social media platforms, with new cool features that would amaze most users. Because if you ban a few crazies from your own platform these will obviously go to the new platform, becoming a majority there. 
Because Gab's only known technical advantage over Twitter is the fact that they promote free speech, they would look like hypocrites if they banned anyone. And if they don't, they'll be labeled as a platform for whoever is at majority there at the moment.

I'm pretty sure this also applies to some car brands, hateful cunts buy cars, then drive around being hateful cunts. So according to you, some car manufactures are hateful cunts too? I'm just trying to figure out how you think because you're expressing some weird opinions. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 17:15:19
So if you promote free speech and a bunch of hateful cunts use your platform, because they're banned everywhere else, and you're not banning them, then you're a hateful cunt too? would Coinbase be a hateful cunt if they didn't ban Gab? Would the bank be a hateful cunt if they didn't ban Coinbase because Coinbase didn't ban Gab and so on...?
Is that what you're trying to say?

An attempt to make a Twitter alternative without censorship on a centralized platform. They've succeed pretty well in terms of maintaining free speech. However, as they see themselves as a "*Twitter alternative*", it's been hard for them to attract new "*legit*" users. "*Why use Gab when there's Twitter?*" - the majority asks. As a result of that, Gab's user base is mainly people who have been banned on Twitter and some other social media platforms for various reasons. 
Since some people strictly practice the principle of "*guilt by association*", Gab has been labeled by some as "*nazi twitter*" or "*white power twitter*", which is technically incorrect. Understand the difference between Gab and Gab's user base.
If this is how platforms promoting free speech is treated by the masses, then why do we even have cryptocurrencies? what's the point if people want censorship, centralization and no transparency?

How are you gonna ensure they don't get anything then?

Problem is that nobody actually is audited and legit. It's all about making people think banks are audited and legit. Let's have a look over the USD [inflation during the last 100 years]( Where's the revolution?

Why not both, without Bitcoin we'd all be salary slaves anyway.

It's to keep up the illusion of "*stability*" in fiat monetary systems, it can't be "*stable*" unless there's a centralized authority (like a bank) telling you what investment's you can and cannot make with your own money.

True, but the banks won't reimburse you for free. In one way or another you'll pay for this enforced "insurance".
