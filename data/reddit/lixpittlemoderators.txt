If you're not Satoshi Nakamoto or his clone, you're not really using Bitcoin.

I've noticed a trend:
When innovations are made in network *bandwidth*, it is usually an academic entity doing research so they can improve the internet.
When innovations are made in network *latency*, it is usually [financial types trying not to be the last middleman holding the bag.](
Decentralization literally means that there is *no central position* to fight over, and it's among my *favorite* things about Bitcoin. I don't mind the delay in confirming a transaction one bit if it serves to remove the privilege of these pig-in-a-poke selling assholes who make fortunes by squatting in the right place while jerking themselves off over the "liquidity" they provide.

Look at that nasty little weasel word she slipped in there. No such thing as "almost unlimited", unless we're talking Olive Garden breadsticks.
Others have mentioned the divisibility of BC, so I won't belabor that.

Far be it from me to argue that I'm average, but the Presidency was just won by an "outsider"- perhaps the man on the street has a greater distrust for respected institutions than either of you suspect.

Pretty sure it's a few opportunistic hacks with a bunch of miners that are attempting to do a &gt;50% attack and force a hard fork, not "enthusiasts worldwide".
Source: I'm an actual bitcoin enthusiast, and I care less about getting to the moon in twelve minutes than I do about a decentralized, anonymous currency. If a tiny number of people can dictate the direction of Bitcoin (as BU is attempting), Bitcoin might as well be fiat to me, no matter what the price tag on the exchange says.

I keep seeing this sentiment equating bitcoin to gold but don't understand it.
Did I miss the headline when gold became cleanly divisible to eight decimal places and, regardless of the amount, can be sent swiftly and cheaply anywhere there is internet access?
Also, gold has been a medium of exchange for quite a while. In fact, when it comes to mediums of exchange, you might say it's the gold standard. Bitcoin's starting from nothing and achieving gold parity in such a short time is something to be lauded, not denigrated.

Thanks for speaking up on behalf of the silent majority.
The rest of us peons can only express our own opinions.
But seriously...


Everyone is entitled to their opinion.
The degree to which someone is entitled to an *audience* for their opinion correlates directly with the degree of their understanding of the subject.
Why the hell would anyone listen to someone's advice about bitcoin's direction if the person giving advice doesn't understand bitcoin?
"I don't understand bitcoin, but if everyone would put a nickel in an envelope and mail it to me, I think it would improve things. Or a pickle. I forget which."

He's trusting the miners' rational self-interest. It’s a bold move Cotton, let’s see if it pays off.
If the miners displayed rational self-interest we wouldn't be having this conversation right now.

I've noticed that subreddit has taken to purchasing advertisements in the sidebar.
Their need to advertise says a lot about the word-of-mouth they generate.
Despite paying for subscribers, that subreddit still has less than 15% of the subscribers this one does.

You seem like a person who admits when they are wrong rather than immediately resorting to insulting anyone who dares disagree with you.

This is the best argument I've seen for changing the proof of work to something that doesn't have dedicated hardware. I'd even consider changing the proof of work regularly as dedicated hardware becomes profitable.
But then, I'm more interested in liberated money than free money.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:12:12
I never said you didn't understand bitcoin. I vaguely mentioned people who don't understand bitcoin and you assumed I was talking about you. I'm entirely comfortable with the idea that you know things I don't. Bitcoin is proof that the internet is for more than pissing contests. :)
However, it is an argument from authority when your only contribution to the conversation is listing your credentials.

Surely, if transaction speed and cost vary, then "fast and cheap" are not intrinsic qualities of Bitcoin.
Speaking only for myself, I value decentralization and anonymity much more than speed and economy. Fortunately for me, the characteristics I value actually *do* seem to be intrinsic to Bitcoin.

I sense an implication here that you're okay with people being robbed, so long as it's not for money. Their computational power was used without their permission, it seems. If you're arguing that CPU power has no value, I think you're arguing in the wrong place.

Who cares about the absolute growth? The important thing is the rate of growth relative to cpu speeds, right?
Who cares if the cpu intensity of bitcoin doubles if processor density quadruples in the same time?
Feels like you're moving goalposts, because everyone else is talking about changing in the short term and you're talking about doing it someday.

You know that "dollars" don't pay interest, either, right?
*People who get loans pay interest* in exchange for receiving the loan. There's nothing stopping someone from doing the same thing with bitcoin.

That's wandering away from the initial point, which is that trusting miners' "natural incentive" to consider the holistic well-being of the blockchain / bitcoin ecosystem is naive, since *individuals* also have a natural incentive to fuck everyone else for their own benefit.
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:29:46


Assuming that SegWit takes away "the massive hashing power of the bitcoin network", how does doing so remove decentralization, which is "what makes bitcoin really great"?
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:14:09
Yeah, it would've been more realistic if Rick had fucked with the interest rate to make 1 of itself equal 0.000000000000000000000001 of itself.
Or, possibly, a highly-advanced society with a centralized currency (self-contradictory, I know) would develop a user interface that just lets you enter the desired value and gives you the closest result possible without requiring you to dick around with interest rates.
I know I would have enjoyed the episode more if it had went on a lengthy tangent about market forces, though.

@_date: 2017-04-03 17:09:59
None of the technologies you listed involve paying content creators, because:
1. decentralization makes it difficult to monitor unique views.
2. people already "pay" for the content by hosting it.
Also, the real line of descent is:
Kazaa was centralized garbage.
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:14:16


Yes, actually- but with code, not legislation. One function of SegWit is to close the loophole Jihan is exploiting.
As much as you might wish otherwise, my summary is quite apt- in fact, it's Greenspan's own phrasing.
