I'm 17 now and few years ago (4 ı think) ı tried so hard to get my hands on BTC because ı even knew it was amazing back then ı first tried faucets then realized these won't work, ı had a debit card named "İninal" that's very popular in Turkey and everyday ı'd save up my allowance and buy bitcoin through various websites that doesn't require verification such as virwox but there was a lot of problems from virwox high fees to my debit card taking the us dollar to try rate higher than what it currently is still ı managed to get quite a good number of Bitcoins to my possesion because before that year my best friend had died of cancer in front of my eyes ı've been with her throughout her cancer stage for 3 years but she couldn't survive it so ı was very depressed so ı kind of needed to dedicate myself to something and that was collecting Bitcoins, ı never traded it or thought to trade them but after some time ı started spending them without refilling my balance and when ı run out of my balance ı kind of let it go it was like a simple fad on my life that lasted about 3-6 months, ı got back into Bitcoin in April 2017 again started with 0.07 BTC got way up to 2.21 BTC trading it then with lots of stupid trades and being in alts most of the time and not BTC ı got back to 0.125 BTC and even this kind of makes me antsy and kind of in a attrition state so ı'd even know what to do if i were in your brother's position.
Sorry for my English.

People cant deposit their own BCC's that's in their own wallets because a lot of people was holding their BTC in their wallet before the fork so they have their BCC in their own wallets and they can't sell because no deposits allowed for now.

R.I.P Btc probably back to 3k or sth before it ever reaches the ATH again.

As a fellow Turkish ı don't find your comment "Turkey is a country with little chance of bright future" correct Turkey is still a developing country and has great economic growth potential and overhead once Erdogan goes away Turkey should continue it's pre 2011 booming and ı wish you luck on your journey through Bitcoin and your future wish you the best ^^
