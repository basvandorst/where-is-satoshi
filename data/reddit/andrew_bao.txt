Compared to the fee for transferring the larger amounts of money it’s still negligible I reckon, bitcoin it’s just a flat fee for any amount. So the amount of fees you’d be saving as the amount of money that is being moved increased, the proportional decrease in fees should cover that percentage loss if it is downward trend.

Technically it’s still a great payment method for international transfers for large quantities over normal fiat transfers

Also true

True, but i guess it’s immediate within the hour so the % change in day doesn’t really matter and the % change within hour is negligible usually.

Everyone is not adopting SegWit, even though segwit would solve legit all the fee problems and increase speed for the network, coinbase will never adopt segwit- nor will the majority of exchanges. They all want you to move to bitcoin cash, where the fees will come back after bitcoin's hodlers make the switch to bcash

Omg dude did you google before you wrote that? You’re talking about fractional reserve banking, not quantitative easing. Quantitative easing is simply the central bank printing more money to get more money supply into the market.

Well debt is expressed in % of gdp for private and public debt in data. But usually the public debt % is not as bad as the private % as a country is not likely to default on loans whilst individuals and businesses can easily default. But obviously if both were lower that would look better
