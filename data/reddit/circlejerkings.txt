Of course, because the 2 coins you own will soon be worth 100k right?
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:13:49
Looks like the hype is over. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 17:49:51
What's the weather like in fantasy land?
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:43:29
It's directly related. The less Bitcoins one has the more retarded ideas he comes up with. 
You will never see someone with tons of coins say stupid stuff like this. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 12:45:44
He thinks by next the whole city will be using bitcoin obviously. 
Yeah, i know, it's funny. And sad at the same time. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 16:28:16
What? A bullshit article with made up circle jerk facts? Nooo, who would've guessed. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 05:20:42
I predict a nice big circle jerk for months and then eventually silence. 
We all know this won't happen. Just like the Bitcoin atm. 
Someone who sets up a new bank doesn't post about in on frigging Reddit!
@_date: 2013-07-19 06:19:07
Nobody knows what Bitcoin will do so nobody can tell you if it's a smart to invest or not. 
If anybody tells you otherwise he is lying. Bitcoin could be worth 0 three months from now or 500. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 14:56:09
Congrats, everytime i think i read the most ridiculous thing here someone else manages to post something even more ridiculous. 
Kids with 1.3 Bitcoin hoping it's gonna be worth 100k. 
It's sad really.

Another circle jerk article that turns out to be complete bullshit. 
It just goes on and on. 
1 person makes up some story how Bitcoin is exploding in some shithole country and the next 2 weeks it will reposted over and over again. 
And of course if you post that it's nonsense you get downvoted straight away. Because thats what the jerkers don't want to hear. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 05:27:51
A necessity haha. 
Poor guy. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:01:27
Sounds legit. Hitting you up now. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 21:36:59
1000 people online in 5 minutes. Yup, that has fail written all over it. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:41:48
Of course he did. But just like every other person his greed was more important. He just kept telling to himself "it won't happen to me". 
Then they get screwed over and come crying on Reddit.
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:39:31
340 dollars a day. What a joke. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 06:13:47
He will do it anyway, get into problems and come crying here about it. 
It's the same story over and over again. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 14:36:05
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:38:46
By next year right?
@_date: 2013-07-18 20:48:58
Nice advise. After that Paypal will take all the funds back from innocent people. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 05:23:46
So that is your evidence? They met once?
99.9% because of that?
I sure hope you don't gamble too much. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 05:15:39
Pull some facts out of your ass and write an article about it. 
Seems to be a pretty normal thing to do when it comes to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 14:40:19
Boohoo, need a tissue?
About that guy, it's confusing how someone with many coins can be so delusional. 
I assume he got them by luck? Early miner?
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:35:43
Can i pay with Paypal?
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:03:52
Awesome! Another article about the 7 Bitcoin users in some 3rd world shithole countries. 
Join the circle guys! Fap fap fap
@_date: 2013-07-19 10:42:38
No. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:24:01
You needed to test them to figure out it's a scam? Damn son, you're gonna have a rough life. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:26:58
Sounds like a good plan. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 13:15:17
Well i guess 180 dollars is a lot when you're 16.
