Ah ok. The wall has been relatively close to it for a while. Its been almost 40 hours
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:18:30
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:58:12
Gotcha. I will wait. Still says 0/3 confirmed unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:31:41
riparoni. Guess I am waiting a couple of years bois.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:56:44
Its been 4 and a half days. Anytime soon?
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:00:32
hmm. Ok. Would have loved to use it tbh 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:55:43
47.209. I customized the fee below the recommendation which was probably stupid. Will I get the BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:37:45
hmm sunday hopefully.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:31:18
I am working on it now. I am looking at guides but how can I import it into electrum and still be able to buy and sell?
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:33:10
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:32:16
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:50:35
Yeah. Just waiting til ATH
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:03:06
Ah ok. I'll send it this Sunday. Thanks man!
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:44:02
In Kuwait, the profit margin is around 6.8 million per day.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:53:11
Yes I believe the 2013 model gave around 10.3, if conditions were right. A solid investment.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:40:15
Yeah thats been my problem. No one seems to want to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:48:02
But then I will lose the $22, right?
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:41:21
Ah ok thank you. I was trying to find an alternative for Exodus $25 fees, and I don't have a lot of money in the wallet so that's a huge chunk. I'm 100% safe to delete it, right? Additionally, how can I import my exodus wallet somewhere to get rid of such high fees? Thanks again man.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:14:39
Ah. I said US because the link is German, but I still think I can use it fine. I will export to electrum to avoid the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:58:36
I feel stupid for using Exodus. Sorry I am in US. How can you set your own fees though? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:42:31
It says (watch only) on electrum at the top. Am I safe to delete?
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:56:37
Ah ok
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:01:15
I have the same problem. Can I do $300 paypal man
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:56:45
ah ok thx
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:47:53
But then I will lose the $22, right?
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:31:41
Ah ok. It was my very first transaction and I got a little nervous haha
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:44:42
Oh ok. I understand now.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:00:55
I can't. Under 18 man
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:11:23
Isn't it pretty marked up? The lowest was higher than the current buy
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:01:50

@_date: 2017-11-16 03:55:15
