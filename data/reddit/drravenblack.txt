Those things all happened before. If we were friends and you were dating someone that has a reputation for being a ho. I told you to watch out, and you went skipping down the rainbow, ignoring the warning. Who's the delusional one? It's not like you can't find information on the 2008 crash.

I wanted to know that same thing, I've been attacked by alot of pro bank, pro IRS assholes in this reddit. It's turned me the fuck off.

I thought the whole point of Bitcoin was to get away from the stranglehold of the POS central Bankers. Jesus Christ, what was the point then?

Hold on, did that just happen? Some one from the devils institute told the truth?  Where's the gold mikey, where's the gold?

It's how these elites work. "Do what i say, not as I do!"

I like the speech, seems like he's in front of a lot of people. He's sticking his middle to the establishment. I like it, I hope his dream comes to fruit. However, I feel like it's a little naive. They are going to come down hard. It's going to be a hell of a fight. It's the nature of Capitalism, and they have the government in their back pocket. Bit coiners don't. I'm just being real, I've been trying to fight marijuana laws for over ten years. You got to take their power with money and public trust. . That guy has a big following. He needs to set up a lobby and fund to fight with passing laws. Do what the elite do, pay off congress. Some time's all it takes is 100,000 a Politician. Bitcoin can beat Goldman Sacs, if money was raised. We need to see the big picture here. We need regulation that is only used to protect the consumer from fraud. we can't do it without going through exchanges and the middle man which the banks will take over, and out buy. They can't even protect their websites now. we need regulation and technical advancement to provide security, that protects from fraud, without the governments spying, and regulation that protect themselves, and screws the consumer. How do we that? This is a real concern. I happen to believe that god forbid, if a terrorist attack, or school shooting got connected with Bitcoin. The ride would be over. Never let a tragedy go to waste. Didn't Hillary say that?  If you're in business, and do a risk assessment on bitcoin this is number one. It's just thinking ahead of possible risks and outcomes and trying to figure out if you can stop them. You can't get emotional about it or you'll lose. it will blind you.

Yeah a safety deposit box in an unknown location, A hidden safe for a back up. and all his communications and bitcoin info on all his devices should of been encrypted and backed up. devices should of all had kill switches. but reading the story. They might of got it out of him by threatening him with insane jail time, or threatening to bring his family into it. Seems like they were trying to steal his Bitcoin, with no due process. which I thought was a lawsuit and illegal under the constitution. I didn't know i lived in North Korea. I missed that memo.  How do you think he could of done things differently?

Just like the movie "Inside Job" 2 hours of total proof of criminal activity. It wins awards, entertains, and no one goes to prison. The Panama Papers, total proof of money laundering, and no one goes to prison. Trump is deregulating the hell out of Wall street. Making it legal again to mislead investors and not get sued or held liable. I don't know what it's going to take man. I really don't.

Our politicians in the US are all owned by those same bankers.

You're in good company and you're right.

I'm not sure what you mean. neither are backed by anything. Central Banks rigged Wallstreet, you guy's know once they get a hold of this thing. You wont have a chance. They will have lightning exchanges only they have access 2, bot's that manipulate the markets, inside trading, unregulation for them only, immunity from criminal prosecution, SEC payoffs, DOJ payoffs. Tax bail outs after they destroy a market, where everyone else loses but them. I can go on. Not trying to be negative. It's just the truth. you guy's shouldn't be so nonchalant They will eat you up, spit you out and leave you for dead. metaphorically. If you trust them, you're all nuts.

I like you style, i'm intrigued.

To the original poster, what did your bank say? Did you call them? I heard this was just a protection that just needed verification.

Translation " SEC Agreed to back off if the 1% and the criminal central bankers don't have their nest egg disturbed."
