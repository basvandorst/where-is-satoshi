I suppose if you wanted to take out a sponsored headline targeted to linking to your dating profile page, that would be OK (and a novel way to look for a significant other).

That is always great to hear! Keep an eye on the other subreddit promotions too :) For example, we currently have one for which (in my opinion) is a fantastically adorable subreddit.

We're currently working on revamping It used to be the go to place to submit ads for potential promotion, but fell out of use over time. We really want to bring this back, so we're working on a new CSS, sidebar rules, and more to bring this back better than ever. For now, if you have something you want to promote feel free to message the mods of with a link to your ad, the subreddit you want to promote and why. If you want to hold out a bit longer and submit to when it's relaunched, feel free to do that as well!

Compared to other sites we are actually not priced that highly. The display ads do require a higher spend commitment, but we also have a self serve platform that anyone can buy ads on starting as low as $5. 
That being said, since we don't allow rich media, flash, data mining, etc. we need to be priced lower than some competitors. We really want our ads to be non-intrusive and be as interesting as possible. We look for quality advertisers and encourage them to make custom ads/content specifically for redditors. We are definitely averse to putting up ads with "hot singles in your area" or "how i lost 10,000 lbs" since it's not going to be appealing to anyone and is probably a scammy advertiser.

Yup! We do have some awesome artists on staff and can provide design if a client requested. Most agencies have their own creative team though, and are pretty strict about keeping all their creatives in-house.

I answered this here:

is correct -- this is a "house" ad, which means no single person or advertiser is paying for it. You may see this ad rotating across the site if no advertiser has purchased that space. We have tons of traffic and thus ad space to fill, and not enough advertisers to fill it all (yet!). Subreddit advertisements are a great way to fill this space and help encourage redditors to check out subreddits they may not have known existed.

Yup! If we had a legitimate advertiser like OKCupid, or another similar site that wanted to target the meetup and/or dating subreddits, that would definitely be all good in our book. We just don't want the flashy, trashy ads that don't have good intentions.

I mentioned this to someone else but here it is again just in case: we're always working on ways to improve our self service system including the payment process. We're still a pretty lean team so things like that take time.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:12:15
Aww, that means a lot! We work really hard to make it the best experience possible. And trust me, we love reddit as much as you do, so we want to keep it that way.

Personally, I do not feel pressured by anyone investors or otherwise to just re-do our whole ad system just to monetize. Our investors love reddit as much as we do, and we're doing everything we can to try to sell some great and interesting ads that are also not intrusive. If anything, it's the opposite, our investors want us to grow and prosper to maintain or improve reddit's amazing communities.

I work for reddit.com, typically called an admin. We only use our red distinguish when we are speaking officially (and occasionally when making a fantastic joke). As someone on the sales team that deals with ads on a daily basis, I wanted to share the correct response to the question posed by OP.

There's a few answers for this, but the short answer is - ads are only targeted by subreddit and IP address. Here's more information if you are curious:  The longer answer is: House ads are not targeted toward individuals or subreddits. They are typically targeted sitewide, but we'll exclude certain subreddits that may deem it offensive. For example, we have a retrogaming house ad running but we excluded it from Advertisers can buy ads targeted to the homepage and/or subreddits. If you are subscribed to a subreddit in which an advertiser bought the ad, you will then see it. For example, eGifter is sponsoring this subreddit, so when you visit you see their display ads on the sidebar.

That really means a lot, especially that you took the time to explain how you feel about ads in general vs. reddit's ads :).

You should add [Watsi]( to the list! They accept bitcoin that helps go toward their operational costs:  
Also, they're an amazing organization that is completely transparent and helps fund life changing (but low risk!) medical procedures for those in need.
