The block chain will always be accessible, no matter the limit.  The difference is in the fees and when you want to use it.  Pay for coffee?  Sure, works today.  Already I just use my e-coin mastercard however.  In 20 years?  Very unlikely no matter how much garbage you allow in your blocks.  Monthly salary?  Life savings?  Never going to be a problem, even with 500k blocks.

Why trees work the way they do, and why bitcoin isn't going to replace photosynthesis any time soon.  
Yeah, so bitcoin is fundamentally a unit of account, while payment cards are fundamentally payment cards.  Draw your own conclusions.

Which part didn't you understand?  
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:06:42
Writes means sending TX.  Currently there is a minimum fee for that.  The fee is going to go up.  Making larger blocks will delay that somewhat, but the fee is there already and will one day be higher than it is now.  That's how I understand it.  Am I missing something?    
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:09:20
Oh yeah?  What, the supply will no longer be public or capped?  Suddenly counterfeiting is possible?  I don't see it.  Fees will eventually go up, with adoption comes third party services like bitpay, coinbase, btc-e, lightning, sr, etc. etc.  That's a far cry from full fiat fakery.

That Cato talk was a joke.  
1st there was no reference or indication that he had bothered to look through the academic literture on the topic.  Centralization of mining power is not a new idea and if you shoud respect your audience by acknowleding that.    
2nd the material was woefully out of date, especially in regard to ghash.io which appears to have gotten smaller since the data was taken (but before the presentation).  This basically allowed the audience to see and disprove the thesis in real time.  
3rd even if the thesis that mining will be monopoly controlled were correct (apears not to be so far), the recommended action (trade your BTC for counterfeitables controlled by a monopoly) is absurd.

As much as I like the sentiment, I am going to have to give this glossy poster a badmouthing.  It just doesn't respect the viewer  as it should.  
1) No explanation of wavelengths or postprocessing on the display of the sun.     
2) No clear reason for the sun being there.
3) Immediate reference to mostly irrelevant and more nuanced than admitted issue of thermodynamics and limits of information theory.  Bringing up cosmology is also really a bad idea here folks, at least you didn't go that far.      
4) No mention of public nature of coin.  Fiat ledgers passwords can be cryptographically secured as well.  All transactions are *public* with coin.  That means no fudging or secret mining a.k.a. counterfeiting and it means verifiable transactions and funds.   
5) No mention of why we would want to count to 2^256

I care less about what you tell me Satoshi's vision was than what you say about the trust required in various architectures.  As I understand it an SPV node doesn't have to trust the first node that tells it what a valid coin is, but can query many nodes to verify.  I do see your point though, this is very different than having the whole record to check onesself and it a real issue. Sure different than fiat issuance/counterfeiting though don't you think?  
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:07:33
2^11^12 = 2^132    
Sure that's a big number but we are still not up to the keyspace of 256 bit ECDSA or even bitcoin address space at 160 bits.  If the pool size is 2048 words and only 12 words are used, we are 2^28 times weaker key security than standard bitcoin keys.

It's a hard asset.  Imagine 100BTC worth of gold, ganja, pesos, or tobacco.  Sure if it's on a balance and you aren't actually touching it isn't nerve wracking but if you actually hold it (which is one of the big advantages of public coins) you *should* be nervous.  Triple check the position of the decimal is my advice.  That's the only part you can really fuck up.

You're right it isn't the lending itself that enables bad projects - and certainly there will be lending of any good as well as concentration of wealth and plenty of "bad guys".  It is more the creation of the currency in private that enables these things - as when you can create the currency from nothing you no longer have incentive to be all that careful.  An infinitely inflatable system (no caps on money supply) doesn't lend itself well to care of finite resources, or something like that.    
@_date: 2019-03-30 11:19:37
Thanks for your reply, that's a reasonable point.  Perhaps some currency in the hands of an issuer "enters the economy" and perhaps it doesn't, there's no way to verify it.  We can however imagine whether we would allow money to "enter the economy" if we were issuers.

"If I were going to meet up with someone and physically purchase bitcoin from them, how would I guarantee that what they're handing me is a legit, unused bitcoin, rather than a bunch of meaningless numbers and letters?"  &lt;--  most important question, ty!   The only way is to have a legitimate connection to others in the P2P network so that your software can ask the others if the coin is legit,  or to have a copy of all legitimate coins on your own device so you can check yourself.

Then don't use other networks, this is certainly your right.  Thankfully others do see function to having more than one network, and now as a result we have a vastly more robust ecosystem of public coins.

Thanks for your reply!  How does one check that a vendor sold music reported?  How does one verify that the conglomerator, with obvious incentive to do so, doesn't skew the results?  I respect your trust of these people involved, and apologize for being a child of the disinformation age, but without verification - it comes down to trusting a person, who has incentive to, let's say, unintentionally misplace results or make typographical errors that favor bosses investment.  The idea of tracking downloads is ludicrous as a metric that might mean popularity, as is trusting a company paid by the ones who its polling results will effect.

Correct me if you think I am wrong but I don't think this is a serious flaw.  For example look at the mess that is HTML and javacript.  Almost no website meets exact specs published by any individual, yet most of us use it every day.  For that matter look at the mess which is the English language.  Do we need these things to be exactly specified in cartoon drawings?  Sure it might be nice but we don't need it.  I'd like to see nice clear java full node too.  Maybe I should go write one.

In other news, yes, we need pay as you go mesh networking, and we need it yesterday.  Get it working please.

Yes and no.  My experience in ivy league and other good schools, and the best classes there, are that they emphasize foundations not new tech.  You are more likely to learn a professors toy language or an old language, to understand the basics and where they come from.  This can sometimes be helpful.

That is the roadmap for one project called "bitcoin-core".  There are thousands of other independent software projects all working with bitcoin.

I totally agree OP!  I am always happier these days when my net worth goes down.. because it means more people can get in and the transition is smoother = better for everybody including me.

Easy.  You are comparing to united states dollars, which have no limit.  Take a look at what 2.6 trillion zimbabwe dollars will buy you.  Such a prediction for the market cap for bitcoin says very little about the value of the bitcoin, but says a lot about what the predictor thinks is going on at the federal reserve.

Thanks for sharing.  The more you add third parties into your payment chain, the more complicated it gets.  
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:43:36
Translation:  In five years, any bitcoin you gave to us will no longer exist for you.  Ah the joys of being a trusted counterparty for fools!
@_date: 2013-10-13 21:52:47
This chart misses the point completely.  You are comparing one of several large RMB exchanges with a group of USD exchanges that really represent international interests.  In truth RMB/BTC exchange passed USD/BTC exchange long ago.

You've all seen it:  big investment ruins a product.  Too many cooks spoil the broth.  Etc. etc.  In other news 24change.com looks to have borrowed bitinstant's one-page-does-all innovation that they abandoned when looking for something to spend money on.  
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:13:00
Thanks, looks good, keep up the great work!  Mycelium rules!  Personally I call anything which I can compile and view the source "open source" regardless of the license; I guess it's good to be specific in describing these things to avoid confusion.

I give this guy props :)  I meant I used to pick up hitchhiker going to work all the time, and did myself on numerous occasions.

When you can withdraw and hold the stock yourself, I will consider buying it.  
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:44:52
so you're saying it's soft like fiat and can be created at zero cost in any quanitity?
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:18:44
Hmm, they take and hold my money but they aren't a bank?  Exchanging currency is not something you associate with banks?  
Of course, you are right not to put all your coins in one bank.  
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:26:13
I want to spend them for THAT EXACT REASON!!!  I can buy something now and be like wow, actually I only paid 1/2 the asking price cause i bought the coins three weeks ago.  Or even better, actually ;)  
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:50:22
Wait, people buy porn?  Hmm..  well I guess paying for free stuff is popular these days.

Same question works for the dollar, which also has sizable links to pharmaceutical companies, both open and public ones and mafia / government controlled ones.

Very true.  If it were on NBC, we would at least know for sure it was bullshit :)
@_date: 2013-10-07 12:31:31
that's a bit ridiculous.  ok, somebody puts a gun to your head, you are "letting" it be taken.  coins are seizable like any other commodity.. to suggest otherwise is a disservice to new users.  
@_date: 2013-10-15 08:26:14
Yeah you're probably right.  Banks aren't going to be interested in accepting money.  Especially not banks like coinbase and MtGox.  
Wait what?  
@_date: 2013-09-15 10:16:28
Yeah sure, Washington is an entity with individual will.  Keep telling yourself that and see how it sits over time.

Nice work!!!  This is big, keep up the good work Thank you :)
With your experience, you might also be able to write software to share internet for bitcoin.  There are existing tools to open an AP with your wifi computer / device if you have wired ethernet or 3G.  I bet you could merge this either with open source or using an API with your control software.  
There is also room for client-side development for automated hotspot price negotiation.  Do you see the need for a new lower level protocol?
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:48:56
Check exchange volume.  Most popular thing to buy with coins is USD or CNY.

what about "26000 seized" suggests "unseizable" to you?  
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:35:54
Tell that to the silk road customers.  Tell that to Ulrich for that matter.  Sure, the coins are not frozen on the network, but that doesn't matter much when somebody else controls them.

Bitcoin IS a botnet.  Of course botnets can mine.  Litecoin is even more of a zombie coin because the gpu advantage is apparently somewhat lower over CPU mining.

Majority of Swiss have no income from those things.  Actually the Franc has been historically one of the best managed (least inflated) fiat currencies in the world.  For this reason they need the coin less than many, but I am confident they will adopt an intelligent policy toward adoption.  
@_date: 2013-10-20 06:45:42
Because there's only one kind of person, only one kind of business, and only one God and only monogamous relationships, we should have only one currency.  Right?

Who cares?  Most people stopped paying attention to the Nobe prize decades ago.  It's always been politically motivated in ALL subjects.

Thank you Darkwing and your ilk.  The longer the transition period, the slower the rise in price, the easier it will be for our family (humanity as a whole).  Keep up the good work surge protection team!

Narmotur wins the prize here.  Coinbase transactions are also included in the proof-of-work hash.  Therefore, the work the pool is giving you to do is work that could prove the pool gets the block reward, not you.

TRWTF is that the "penny stock" is being pushed.. "copper".  OK, so pennies are made of zinc today but still, kinda funny thanks ;)

When I think "launder" I imagine somebody tries to clean something.  With bitcoin you are not helped in getting clean money in any way.  Therefore, it does not help to launder money.
To Launder money you need to add the dirty money to a legitimate reported taxable fiat income stream.  Think Construction business, restaurant, Citibank, etc.  Bitcoin does not in any way help with that.

this is a nice excuse to make a transition to trying your own computer, your clients will thank you later and be glad for this problem happening when it did.  
@_date: 2013-01-13 11:51:51
Bitcoin is very flexible.  You can come up with a use case that fits the business you are trying to help, making their particular niche transactions both easier and more secure.  However most people will have some respect for the fact that it can't be counterfeit or stolen via hidden inflation of the money supply.
