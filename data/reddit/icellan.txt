Do you need to be registered to buy gold or silver? I wouldn't think so. Why bitcoin?
I get when you want to trade on a trading platform, but isn't Bitinstant just selling bitcoins?

This is exactly what you would need, but maybe a little cheaper. The coins themselves are a little expensive next to the btc on them.
You could pay a merchant with a coin, with a nomination of 1 btc, 0.1 btc or whatever (the merchant can check this) and have the rest deposited back into a paper wallet you were carrying.
The private key is hidden on the coin under a sticker that is ruined if you peel it back. You can easily see whether it has been tampered with or not.

I've tried to be as transparent as possible, that info is actually in the info page in the app.
I'm using blockchain.info to get the balance.

Thanks for the tip, I'll update with some extra info.

LOL. No clue!

I actually do know how this works, but was trying to be nice in explaining to someone who didn't. I do agree it would have been better to be factual, but I didn't want to go into details as many people confuse public key with public address (as is often used in paper wallets for instance).

I hear you! I've been in exactly the same situation. I just gave up on fighting the stupid.
In my case, I was told that people used to believe the world was flat. Because that turned out to be false, Bitcoin is obviously not a good thing and a ponzi scheme.

Thank you! I was getting sad that nobody wanted my little gift to the bitcoin community. ;-)

I'm in the Netherlands, but have actually never bought gold myself.
I just checked some gold shops over here and they state that you need an id if you buy more than € 11,000 worth.

That's funny, my experience is that women are not interested in anything I say. They just want me to shut up and look pretty :-S

I'm aware of this, but apparently not everyone is.

The public key is often referred to as the bitcoin address, so in this case it is definitely the public key. You should never give anyone your private key!
The idea to store the addresses in local storage and not on the server, is for anonymity. There is then no way I, or someone that gets hold of my logs, to know which addresses are owned by you.
