I mean, the US is a pretty free country all things considered

I've never followed Bitcoin too closely, just casually, but if I'm getting the gist of things then Lightning is supposed to get transactions done faster and cheaper.  
I don't deny that Bitcoin has the *potential* to become very useful as an everyday currency, but in my eyes it has yet to prove that it *will*

But who's going to want to spend BTC in general?  Maybe in less developed countries it could be useful, but in the US it's far more inconvenient to make purchases with BTC

Just to clarify, I'm talking about Bitcoin working as an actual, functional currency, not just something people invest in with the intent of eventually selling it for real money.  I own some Bitcoin myself, but purely as an investment I plan on exchanging for USD once I'll make a reasonable profit.
Let's say this Lightning Network does take off, I still don't see why I would exchange the USD I'm paid with into Bitcoin, especially when I've literally never seen a physical store accept Bitcoin.  Even if I did have Bitcoin to spend, the value fluctuates so much that the $100 in BTC I just spent last week is now worth $150.
I see value in Bitcoin as an investment, not as a currency.  I'd really like someone to make an argument that changes my view on that, but with my above average knowledge of Bitcoin, there isn't currently any compelling reason to exchange my USD currency to Bitcoin with the intent of using it as I would USD, unless I wanted to make an illegal purchase of some sort.

It's still a long, long way from being a remotely viable currency for the average person

But why would I adopt now?  What real, tangible benefit does it have to the average person?  I don't give a shit if its decentralized and untraceable, I do give a shit about my money's value being drastically different day to day, about transaction fees doubting my cost and being slow as shit

I could use toenail clippings as a currency, doesn't make it a real currency though.  Dictionary definition and real world definition are two very different things
