Lol what?!

The government goes hard after guys who run filesharing sites?  Could have fooled me and like every other person on earth.
Government goes after corruption a lot.  This is just typical ignorant anti government rambling.  That being said, Snowden is a hero.  But he should stop talking about things he's clearly wrong about.

When did that cause a depression?  Give examples please.  Because we know of examples where inflexible monetary policy caused depressions.

So you'd like the bubble to burst all at once instead of deflating it slowly?  Depressions are brutal.  Recessions are inconveniences.  Ignoring the human cost of economic devastation is an interesting skillset you've developed.

I suppose your "expertise" in crypto makes you a better source?  It's pretty clear one of the major causes of the Depression was the inability to expand the money supply when needed.

You actually don't need a limited supply of money.  Flexibility with the money supply prevents all sorts of bad things from happening - like depressions.

I understand the concept.  When you are a customer of a financial company you have certain expectations.  Mine are that my bitcoins are mine.

Mt. Gox is irrelevant...it's still your own bitcoin.

Won't happen.

Anyone expecting an 80% annual compounded return for 12 years....suckers.

This is very weird.  So if you had, say, 500 BTC in your Circle wallet you are now suddenly limited to sending basically 1.3  BTC per week?  That's totally absurd.
Did they get hacked?  I can understand sell limits as that may be a function of their relationship with banks but not being able to send your own BTC somewhere?!

The sentence isn't harsh enough, IMO.

Your post reminds me of what I used to see on the Yahoo finance boards for every shit tech stock and microcap.  Your small attempt to run up your holdings.
I'm bullish on BTC - but it could just as easily fall to $10 as run up to $2,000.  Even if all the crazy dreams on here come true and cryto replaces fiat that doesn't mean bitcoin will become the de facto standard.  If anything, whatever government or large trusted corporate entities are left will create one from scratch and organize it in a better way.
Or you can keep on believing that Satoshi is going to be worth $20 billion dollars when BTC runs up to $20,000.  Truly destructive innovation often doesn't benefit the original creator - it benefits the people who utilize the innovation the best.  What about the bitcoin community tells you it's fit to manage a currency the world economic engine can depend on? It's full of conspiracy theorists and idiots who think gold is a good investment.
Those of us who hold bitcoin better HOPE the current world economy and fiat currencies remain strong.  If not, we're fucked.

All your assets in bitcoin and gold.  You're on the path to financial ruin without even realizing it.
@_date: 2015-11-08 05:13:48
Lmfao anyone who wants a return to the gold standard is flat out retarded. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 01:51:24
Or it's used mainly to verify transactions which only takes one satoshi. 
There is an artificial supply constriction due to significant amounts of hoarding. That's artificially driving the price up. Shorten the time duration from ten to one minute and the price craters while also making bitcoin more useful.

Look at the scale and scope of the US government and its financial system and tell me it's "virtual."
