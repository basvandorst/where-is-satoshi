After making some transactions with btc, I honestly can't figure out the fuss about waiting. I've done 4-5 small transactions and I only paid like 29 sats fee. Cleared pretty quick too. Wasn't almost instant like my bch transactions, but it wasn't like I waited 10 minutes. I honestly don't know, imo both sides should just work together for the benefit of what bitcoin is meant to be.

It's very cool but literally the exact opposite of what is going to attract new money to the space. My uncle is 50ish and just coincidently mentioned bitcoin to me because of a bitcoin atm. His comment wasn't favorable though, something along the lines of "does anybody even use that funny money?" I only had a moment to defend crypto and bitcoin and told him we can chat at Christmas.
It's just not mainstream enough for people to realize it's actually legit, I could tell by his reaction that he has no doubt that bitcoin is like a pyramid scheme. Even though it's market cap is 136 billion, that means jack shit to these guys. Unfortunately he is the people you are trying to convert and onboard into this. Wealthyish middle class, went to college, has a job, has a house etc. I'd love for btc to get a stronger reputation or a boost from starting in some impoverished third world dictatorship and help elevate some people that have just had the shit kicked in their faces their whole lives but it's just not gonna work that way.
@_date: 2019-12-07 16:23:44
Its not just my uncle though and unfortunately that is one of the greatest challenges bitcoin or any crypto faces. My line of work puts me in front of multiple wealthy middleclass everyday and the confusion and misunderstanding about bitcoin and crypto is unbelievable. They are absolutely convinced that crypto is evil and the only people that use it are cartels and the mafia.
The sticker on my phonecase is usually what gets people to speak up and say something, ask a question or just state their opinion about bitcoin. Most of the time its an awkward joke or something about funny money. Many people are so confused about what bitcoin actually is that there idea is so skewed its not even funny. One lady told me she thought bitcoin was just another paypal that didn't report to the government and displayed it for everyone on the internet to see what what you bought. She thought it was fucking crazy that anyone would use it. I explained very briefly that is not what it is and while I worked she kept asking me more and more questions. I dont know how she views crypto now but I hope that i was able to show her the path to the correct info and a better understanding of crypto in general. I really wish I could just get paid to teach people about bitcoin. Im a blue collar tradesman who works at a family owned and operated company and when I talk about bitcoin and crypto it really throws people off at first. People usually comment on that alone haha. They dont know what I do outside of work.
 If everyone just someone how told one more person about bitcoin and cleared up a little bit of confusion the results would be exponential. It would be like a snowball rolling downhill. You just need to tell the right "one person"
By the way thank you for pointing out that my uncle is a terrible representative of Generation X and not just a misinformed individual who only knows the us dollar as the king kong mother fucking currency that it is hyped to be. 
The problem with bitcoin isnt its technology its the marketing behind it. If a steve jobs was behind bitcoin it would explode. Apple didn't become what it is today because of its tech. People dont buy a new iphone every 11 months because its better. They buy it due to the marketing and mentality put behind the product and that is what bitcoin is a product.

@_date: 2019-12-09 13:24:52


I didn't make my cell phone stickers though, and they're also just Bitcoin logos. I'm not really sure where you are going with this. At this point you are just wasting your time to be completely honest. Did you make the artwork ? Cause you're defending it harder than the op who took my opinion constructively and moved on already. Why can I not comment on this artwork but you can openly question monero about why they lack a proper GUI and you can bask kraken for having a shitty ux/ui ? Did you commission monero to develop a gui and they delivered a cli ? Did you expect kraken to look more like bittrex or coinbase ? We can go around and around like this or you can go blow a whale. Its your decision
@_date: 2019-12-08 12:25:35

I'm sorry but I have to be honest with you, I could care less about your opinion. You're some random person on the internet that for some reason decided that my comment triggered some deep dark buried shit in your fucked up brain. If there was not a written thread I could go back and read I literally would not remember why we are commenting back and fourth.
