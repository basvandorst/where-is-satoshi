The last extra milking before closing up.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:49:35
lack of use leads to this, I would worry.

r/bitcoin and r/buttcoin are two faces of the same coin.

Remindme! two weeks. Is OP "tethered" to the ceiling?
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:27:42
Good luck for when you want to cash out!
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:25:03
Not enough fools left to put money into it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:17:33
Only way it's hard to check is if there isn't any money there.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:19:00
Great business for the buyer. The vendor will probably shut shop in a few months, tho.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:42:56
If someone had watched this instead of selling when you OP made the post, that person would be down 10% already and would have still 3hr ahead to lose some more real money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:04:31
Welp, I'm not sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:53:42
There is no such thing as waste in energy systems. Energy produced is always equal to energy consumed, nothing go to waste (except losses in power lines and such).

It has value for thos ethat sold them to you

Save a bit of fiat for the rope.

Bitcoin is not going over 7000 ever again, tho.
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:03:06
it won't, tho.
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:25:39
you should buy more actually, that way other can get rid of the bags at a good price.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:53:45
It's the market not being manipulated what makes these cliffs in the charts. Actual price of bitcoin is still way lower than the current one.
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:17:10
Any day now...
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:33:59
It seems the probe for market manipulation has cut the washtrades, cryptos should plummet in the forseable future.
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:31:32
Bitcoin is never going over $10.000 again. Those days are long past.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:58:12
For the laughs, of course.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:56:05
People will wish they had liquidated bitcoin at these prices in a couple of months, tho.

That's a pyramid scheme, sooner or later people will run out of transactions to proof unless transactions increase exponentially forever.

I bet that will end well.

did they get rich quick in the end?
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:37:02
I just transfer a thousand euros from one account to another one in another bank and payed 0 in fees. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:27:48
I bet my ass that you will end up losing money despite buying at 3k
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:45:25
Hi OP, how do you get along with a 60% salary reduction?
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:14:03
They already are, but their price is not updated yet to reflect it.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:07:05
gotta put as much people as possible into the base of the pyramid these days, amirite?
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:47:16
How dumb must one be to think something like this?
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:02:05
You know actual money is controlled based on our best mathematical understanding of economy, right?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:04:19
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:24:13
sure, scams too.
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:30:15
If you want to traffic with humans, drugs or weapons, cryptocurrency is the way to go. Only use case so far.
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:33:46
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:56:53
Not enough people wanting to buy in to pump the price. And not enough tether either.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:03:16
Bitcoin can't be counterfeited (well, once it was) but can be forked ad infinitum.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:21:26
Blockchain technology is shit, tho.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:53:44
Bitcoin is more efficent than that. It will drop to $0 in a matter of months.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:37:43
I think you are being too optimistic here. Bitcoin will not be in use by 2025.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:53:15
Oh, so then you only lose if butcoin drops from the time you get payed. Around 10-15% then supposing you don't spend all the money on pay day?
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:14:41
Oh, I see now. Did nazi that before 0_0
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:49:49
Don't think too much about it. Bitcoin users and transactions peaked a few months ago. This problem is nonexistant.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:03:53
Funny you say cryptocurrency can be used to avoid bubbles.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:44:55
In bitcoins, tho.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:18:24
Great lessons learned, don't buy foolish shit with no value for a lot of money. Even if every idiot in the world is buying it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:03:49
will there be a market then, tho?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:29:13

So, the hodlers?

@_date: 2018-02-05 10:15:45
I think you need help.

"reditor for one week"
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:55:54
They can, But you will have to share. I think all the holdings of the sub may buy a wheel by the EOY.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:42:38
"It seems crypto need more shills, I'll make a new account"
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:12:32
 they don't, though.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:09:06
It varies from bank to bank. In my bank it's free, for example. But it varies.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:57:59
No. This is not a correction. People buying in has peaked. Only non-stop tether printing keeps a demand high enough to avoid a collapse of the cryptocoins. You can see this by the accelerated rate at which scams are being closed, there is no more left of the bubble but the final pop, that should be in the next 6 months tops depending on how fast people stops buying in.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:48:36
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:10:41
Yep, EURT is fuelling this shoot up. Not real money, but tethers "100% backed" by euros...
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:35:34
"reditor for three weeks"
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:45:37
Bitcoin has been so transformative at every level. Like... that thing they did....or that one time a person used it as money.. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:48:33

@_date: 2018-04-12 06:14:21
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:06:49
check bitcoin transaction history and think again about that "users have not peaked".
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:08:31
survivor bias, those that are in deep debt due to this bubble have left the forums.
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:56:37
There won't be another one, tho.
