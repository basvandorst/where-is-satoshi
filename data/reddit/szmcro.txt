Also i dobt even know what ure taking about, i understand banking system in general, but this is beyond my knowlede. Care to explain?

Why should I care? Regulations should be written on their page. Im not even able to see this transaction on my profile. This is typicall banking mode. Holding my money, but in this case, without my approval

Man I wtote this to warn ppl. I dont care about their regulations, why would I care about their problems dude? They are holding my money, thats all i care about. You got this whole wrong. Experience trading there vs coinbase or anywhere else for that matter is rock bottom. I do nit care about the reasons for that. Thats bitstamps problem

one (maybe) stupid question. btc gold fork. my btc is in my wallet and the snapshot is like now. how long do i have to keep my btc in that wallet? till 1.11.? will btc gold magically appear in that wallet and when can i move my btc from the wallet to be safe to receive gold?

yep, placed an order on mon, got my btc 4 days later, on a different price. that's just disgrace

Well, if anyone has this kind of issue as I have now, anyone can have any other time so. This policy is absurd
