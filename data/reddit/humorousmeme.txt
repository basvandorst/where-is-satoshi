Thank you! It's exciting to own a tiny piece of the bitcoin pot. Now I have to set up a wallet.

I think the cryptocurrency technology is revolutionary, but that doesnt mean bitcoin itself is here to stay. It could encounter some problem, or get replaced by a improved competitor currency.

Gotta start somewhere.

I'm not sure about that. I think people do need to learn about a cryptocurrency for it to catch on. You do need marketing. But I think bitcoin would be stronger if it was designed to resist rapid swings in price.
Deflation is good for individual investors in the short term, but bad for the economy as a whole, and bad for the chances of bitcoin getting more widely adopted.

Oh, I fully understand the uses. Cryptocurrencies have quite a lot of potential. I'm more concerned that bitcoin is designed to profit early adapters, which gives later adapters less of an incentive to climb on board.

I think cryptocurrencies have a lot of potential, but I'm not sure bitcoin itself will be the universal currency everyone expects. I actually think this rapid deflation is bitcoins biggest weakness.
The higher bitcoin rises in price, the less likely people are to adopt it. Why would anyone want to buy into a system *after* the profit has already been made by other people? Bitcoin is great for early adopters, but unless you assume it will just continue rocketing upwards forever, why buy into it now after the investment boat has been missed?

Why downvote the truth? Amazon is more likely to make their own rival currency than accept bitcoins. They will only accept bitcoins if they become truly universal.

If you want more people to exchange their currencies/products for bitcoins, and keep your own bitcoins valuable, you should do your best to convince them bitcoins are worth getting.
