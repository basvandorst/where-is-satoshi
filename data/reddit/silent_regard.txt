I don't disagree. I disagreed with your choice of words previously. The statement "Bitcoin is fiat, because it's value is whatever the markets say it is" is logically unsound due to a false premise which you just demonstrated for me.
I believe your argument that bitcoin is fiat due to the decree of the reference client and/or the white paper is logically sound, however, in this community people use the word to refer to currencies that are subject to manipulation of supply by state (or central bank) decree, so it's not helpful to those that don't know what people are talking about when they refer to fiat currencies.
And you're right, bitcoin isn't backed by it's limited supply. Hence the quotes. Scarcity increases value. If gold were as plentiful as air it would still be useful to engineers and artisans, but people wouldn't pay much for it, and people sure wouldn't use it to store their wealth. Bitcoin's limited supply is part of what attracted a lot of libertarians to it.

Bitcoin is "backed" by its inherently limited supply. The supply of a fiat currency on the other hand can be arbitrarily increased or decreased by decree (by fiat) of government organizations or central banks.

The value of gold is "whatever the market say it is" as well... which by your logic would mean gold as currency is fiat as well.

Fiat means "a decree; a formal authorization" so a fiat currency is one which is simply declared to be legal tender. People use it to describe US dollars, Euros, and other government backed currencies because governments can simply create more at will and decree that it is legal money.
