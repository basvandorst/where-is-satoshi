nope, I wasn't. astute observation. 14 hours later im still waiting for first confirmation also. So I haven't become more impressed I assure you.

I feel like this answer is the most relevant to me. Online service. Pocketing some of the few. Cointree(Australia). Used to be ok for small transactions but seems to be pretty dicey now. Thanks for the replies. Looks like I’m in for a long wait.

I promise you I can afford to lose $200. Its better to test the water first before jumping in. Now I know not to jump in.

So I made a transfer of worth $136 for a $14 fee and I haven't got a confirmation after 90mins?
How long is this transfer likely to take currently?

Mmm well it does seem like a flaw. Unreliable fees... I mean if any business said “hey, our fees are always changing and wait times are highly unpredictable” would you use the business? I’m not trying to be a dick but as someone trialling bitcoin I’m not impressed. Probably not going to rush back to by more. I mean out of $200 by the once I get it to the wallet I want to store them in I’m down to 136... Ild call that a flaw.

Ok cool, good to know I’m in the ballpark. Thanks.

is 7 hours without a single confirmation after paying a ~10% fee on $150 transaction unusually long to wait?
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:08:01
"10 minutes average for first confirmation" they said... ahh nah.

Thanks for the reply. Gives me a better understanding. I think my problem might be the online service pocketed half the fee and really I’ve paid less so I’m in for a long wait.

ok, I obviously don't get it, but is 7 hours without a confirmation strange?
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:50:25
7 hours and no confirmation??
Seems like bitcoin is flawed.
