You mean only 1% of small blockistans run nodes? Isn't that hyprocritic?  
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:03:45
Better use full nodes, it's an advice for every bitcoin user.
@_date: 2016-02-09 01:21:17
Exactly, there're only 5000 TRUE users. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:00:33
But i don't wanna run a full node even if blocksize  is &lt;=1MB, and SPV nodes are vulnerable too, why not use a professional wallet provided by big company? 
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:06:26
Make no difference to me, i don't run full nodes today already. There are very small number of decentralized users who run full nodes today : 5000, the other millions users are stupid centralized users, they don't deserve bitcoin.

Soft fork is cheating, exactly.

But if you can't make onchain txs (because you are poor, as poor as you can't buy a  'datacenter' level of computer), you cannot TRUST NO ONE, you have to trust a LN node  --same as you have to trust a bitcoin full node if you're using a SPV wallet ( because you are poor).

It scales because it's faster.

If "censorship resistant" is a valueable service, will you buy it?  If enough people want to buy it, then it's a business.  
You should run that business a server farm if it's profitable. 
But there are many other values in bitcoin, we should not let "censorship resistant" hijack the whole train.

A chain is kept by many parties, so it's super inefficient.

Sidechain coins are not Bitcoin. They are only redeemed for Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2016-02-08 04:03:59
Who don't know how to run a full node, is not good enough for bitcoin.
Who don't have average computer/bandwidth/tech to run a full node, is not good enough for bitcoin.
Who have average computer/bandwidth/tech to run a full node, but DIDN'T, is evil. They make bitcoin centralized.
@_date: 2016-02-01 12:40:54
Nope, technical consensus is the most important consensus, users/merchants/miners should listen carefully, or it will cost you a great fortune.   
Classic can't handle 2MB blocks, it will fall apart, then everybody will just switch back to Bitcoin Core.  
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:04:50
I don't run full nodes today, so bitcoin is centralized to me today. Heck, there are only 5000 decentralized users, the other millions are centralized users. They don't deserve bitcoin, should be evicted.  Let them go to the altcoin with 2MB blocksize.  
@_date: 2016-02-09 01:32:58


Do you have concerns about setting a precedent of just seeing a doctor every time you get sick, since you don't believe you can live that way forever? 
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:26:21
How could be miners the only nodes?  Where will miners spend their newly mined coins ? 
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:19:03
Make no difference to me, i don't run full nodes today already. There are very small number of decentralized users who run full nodes today : 5000, the other millions users are stupid centralized users, they don't deserve bitcoin.  According to you logic, bitcoin has already failed. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 09:35:44
Do you understand that Blocksize control is as bad as Price control ?

Basically it's a protocol of how to move a multisig wallet  without frequently moving it.   
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:59:34
There are only 5000 users who really appreciate bitcoin's decentralization nature, the other millions of users who don't run full nodes are stupid!  They don't deserve bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:55:59
@_date: 2016-02-09 01:23:15
They actually are. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:02:08
Because it's fucking easy. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 01:22:52
Hmm, i think there're already too many computers can't handle 1MB blocks already, so maybe we should shrink the blocksize down to 56KB.
@_date: 2016-02-09 23:37:47


Only 5000 people value that ( by running full nodes) 
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:20:19
Exactly.  Make no difference to me, i don't run full nodes today already. There are very small number of decentralized users who run full nodes today : 5000, the other millions users are stupid centralized users, they don't deserve bitcoin.

While the bitcoin main-chain are getting full and slow, Liquid does offer a good alternative to users and exchanges. Bravo.
