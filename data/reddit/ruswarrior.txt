Thank you for the update! Looks cool. I'm glad to see a product.
When can we expect final product? Seems like development process is very slow and inefficient. Its been 3-4 years already. How can the open source community help?
It looks like forums like  (less than 1 year of development and without a fund of 6000 bitcoin) have far more mature and superior products which has me concerned on your team's work and your allocation of 6K bitcoin.  
As far as $50K donated.. No, 6K BTC was donated. Yes price increased you're right. But let's not get into that. Let's stick to how we can improve development.

What do you mean by total addresses? 
Do you know what addresses even are or what they are used for? Addresses are supposed to be one time use, not to be reused. It makes sense for 90% of the wealth to be in a very small amount of addresses compared to all of the addresses that have been used over the years. 
It means that wallet software developers and services and exchanges are doing their job correctly.

Blockchain grows at the following rate;
1MB every 10 minutes 
6MB every hour
144MB every day
52GB every year
Bitcoin Cash wants to balloon this up to 8MB blocks or 400GB every year. This will cause a consolidation and centralization of nodes due to normal and average people not being able to run nodes. Eventually only a handful large enterprises or companies or banks will have the capabilities to operate full nodes and that is the end of bitcoin, or a decentralized monetary system.
We are trying to scale this via other means such as the lightning network and side chains. As far as "technology," the bitcoin core devs are completely unmatched by the other groups.

Technically they want to increase it to GB+ in the long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:51:36
Yes. But here's the problem. 
8MB blocks gives us 56tx a second compared to the current 7tx a second. 
100MB blocks gives us 700tx a second. 
1GB blocks gives us 7000tx a second. 
In comparison, Visa does 5K txps daily with bursts to 20K txps during peak season. And that's just Visa on its own. 
This type (onchain/linear) of scaling is simply unfeasible and unrealistic. But it's not even just hard drive storage, it's also a matter of network bandwidth. All nodes must be able to synchronize and validate everything within 10 minutes. If nodes fall behind, then the network slowly falls apart.

There is great potential. The current political ecosystem in the US and EU is reflective of my country in the 1980s. 
I've said it before again and again and stand by my notion that the US is currently going through what the SU went through in the 1980s. 
The mistrust of government, mistrust of news, the split society, the instability. I think bad times are upon us. It is paramount that everyone diversifies and hedges against this accordingly. Gold and now we have an even more exciting asset class and store of value, bitcoin. 
Edit: And who would have fathomed the thought that a global super power would collapse?! I bet if you asked anyone in the SU in 60s and 70s, they would have laughed at the thought. But hey look what happened. The Roman Empire, US, EU, Venezuela, Canada, Saudi Arabia are no different.

Market cap is a useless measure. If I create a new premined coin with 100 million units and perform a few trades at 1000 sats per unit.

Most of the garbage thats on coinmarketcap is just garbage and junk in reality. If you're using market cap as some real measurement for success, *lol*.

1. Yes. Of course, all fiat currencies and financial systems are equally threatened if not more. 
2. Yes. Just like how Russia gave up the Warsaw Pact satellite states and former SU member states. Along with all spheres of control in the Middle East, south east Asia, South America, and Yugoslavia. 
These questions you ask were probably asked in the 60s on the "hypothetical" situation if the SU collapsed which was responded with outright shock and disbelief. The sheer thought that Russia would give up Ukraine would be met with outright lunacy in the 60s. 
What do you think about the fall of the Roman Empires and how it gave up its states and spheres of control? Or the British Empire? French? German? Mongolian? Ottoman? Persian? 
What makes the US empire any different than these greats of the past?

Everything is a ponzi. When dollar collapses, anyone holding the dollar bags will lose big.
Happened in my country in 1991, soviet rubles became worthless. 
The key is diversification and risk assessment. At the end of the day, financial instruments are human/social oriented. When society collectively agrees, the instrument has value. When society loses trust, it collapses.
Look at Venezuela or real estate in Detroit/Flint.

College is a bubble. 
By college, I'm referring to student debt and also the degrees themselves. When *everyone* has a college degree, the value of the college degree goes down. Simple supply and demand. Supply of college degrees goes up, demand stays the same, the value of the degrees goes down. 
College used to mean something, today not so much. It's a scam.

You base your entire argument on the notion that I shouldn't worry which is a complete flaw. But I'll bite. 
What about smaller businesses? Or countries? Or organizations? Or groups? Or municipalities? Should they not run nodes because they don't have the required resources to run and operate nodes? 
Why should nodes, who perform a *very* important function also, be limited to the elite. Nodes a) verify blocks. b) verify transactions. c) carry copies of the ledger. 
It is paramount that we allow or provide the capacity for smaller organizations to be able to run the ledger. It is another set of checks and balances against the elite.

You start off your comment very surprised, and then agree with my assessment. 
You said it yourself, an *acknowledgement* of a skill set. Not a skill set. Like I said, I've seen the average person straight out of college, and I'm not impressed and sadly it gets worse and worse each year. 
When college degrees are pumped into the hands of every man, woman and child; they begin to lose meaning because they are also subject to simple market rules of supply and demand.  
Edit: For the record, I was lucky enough to understand and realize this sham early on. Dropped out, studied on my own with the use of the internet and other resources. I'm currently full time employed as the head of my department with 2 contracted positions on the side. College debt: 0.00

When a bitcoin is bought, a bitcoin is sold. When a bitcoin is sold, a bitcoin is bought. 
Think about it, when you are buying a bitcoin, who are you buying from? A person who's selling. And when you are selling, who  are you selling to? A person who's buying. 
Another way to think about this is. When you are buying bitcoin, you are selling dollars. When you are selling bitcoin, you are buying dollars. 
We are buying bitcoin not because it's going to be worth more, we are buying bitcoin because we fear our dollars will be worth less.

It's actually a great thing for Bitcoin. Russia is cryptofying their national currency. This enables greater access to Bitcoin for their citizens which I think is their overall goal.

This is great. Even though it's not a true public, free ledger; it still acts as a tether (USDT) like cryptocurrency that is backed by a state. This would allow the ruble to begin enjoying all the perks of crypto currency networks and features. And also enable all Russians with better access to Bitcoin which I feel is their main motive. They are working to position their people for the future.

I agree, I believe in decentralization of global power. An array of nation states all working towards a common goal, with nation states acting as checks and balances towards one another. 
I want a world of many beautiful ethnicities and cultures. I want to visit Beijing and Sao Paolo and Paris and Johannesburg and New Delhi. I want to learn about eastern arts and western arts. I want to learn about everyone's beautiful cultures and share my own. 
I will not let Marxist ideologies destroy our humanity and send us into a sad and depressing monolithic society where Moscow is no different than Paris and Hong Kong and New York and Kabul and Cairo. 
I want to see different people come forth and solve problems through both what they have in common and also their disagreements and not be forced into submission through tyranny. 
Nation states and decentralization and division of power is the natural way as shown in nature. Struggle and competition and mutual collaboration. 
It's quite ironic how you're on a bitcoin forum arguing against its very principles and core foundation. 
The last 100 years was a failed Marxist experiment and it is quickly failing. It failed in the east in the 20th century and is becoming short lived in the West in the 21st. 
The people's of this world are voicing what they believe in. It is only a matter of time until Marxist tyranny is vanquished from this earth. Long live humanity. 
And lastly... I find it humorous that you are advocating for more a concentrated elite body of power to remedy our current concentration of power in our nation states. You people are ludicrous and amusing, which is also why your ideologies are miserably failing. Keep doing what you're doing leftist loonies. ;)

This is the great thing about free markets. Price goes too high, and it comes down. Price goes too low, and it comes up. It always finds its fair price and balances itself out.

As far as the first good or service, yes. Two pizzas were bought with 10,000 BTC. Google bitcoin pizza. 10,000 BTC is worth roughly 25,000,000 today assuming that it is not all sold at once.

Dude. No company will conduct business using their "employee's" personal bank accounts. 
Fuck that shit. They're basically sending you  most likely money so you buy bitcoin for them and send to their addresses. You're basically laundering money for them or they are sending money from stolen bank account numbers. 
How dumb can you be mate? Like I said, bail now. And close your bank account and get a new checking account.

Hundreds of thousands *of* bitcoin == 100,000-999,999 bitcoin. 
Hundreds and thousands *of dollars worth* of bitcoin == x bitcoin.
It's silly to denominate your holdings or savings in other currencies. Ie. Only morons will say "I have 150000 Russian Rubles worth of US dollars."
@_date: 2017-06-25 11:20:21

Nation states are absolutely important in our fight against globalism; nation states currently provide us with decentralization in global geopolitical power. Countries act as checks and balances in geopolitics. 
I really dislike it when people dismiss nation states without quote understanding the importance. If nation states were to indeed fall, we will only have a more centralized single international body dictating laws. No thanks. 
By globalism, I am not referring to an interconnected unified world. But globalism in the sense of a single governmental body of earth.

Most people are hedging their wealth and investing in the future. It is in everyone's interest to hedge against the future; simple game theory really. ie. 
Risking a few hundred dollars (a few nights Going out money) to position yourself for the future (purchasing power). The future gains greatly outweigh the present potential losses.

Bitcoin has a very small ecosystem and is in its infancy. The larger the economic ecosystem in terms of participants (consumers, producers, sellers, buyers), the value of something becomes more stable. 
I've been around since 2012, and the price swings are indeed becoming more and more stable; and this will continue to follow. 
The matter of fact is cryptos *will* replace fiat. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:51:08

Oh just go over Mexico; they're are a few cities that are entirely controlled by gangs. 
Or go to the no-go-areas in Europe.
Or just about any city in the past. Bolsheviks in my country started off by taking over small neighborhoods and that grew to cities then vast regions and eventually the entire country was engulfed. 
ISIS was a small little gang once. 
Security or government always gravitates to more and more centralization. 
Matter of fact is, I can tell you're a very idealistic person who has yet to see much of the world. I was in your shoes once upon a time, long ago- had a very romantic view of the world and of humanity. But it's all fucking crap, I can tell you. I don't mean to come off as insulting, in fact I envy you. 
Nation states are our only practical form of decentralizing global power. There is no other alternative. And the reason is due to their longevity and history, it's here to stay. Somewhat like gold.

Lealana produces physical coins that can be funded by sending bitcoin to the coins respective public address. Each coin has a private and public key, the private key is hidden behind a holographic sticker while the public key is exposed. It's a form of cold storage. 
Look into Casascius coins and Kialara bars. Really beautiful art, and make great collectibles.

Yes but the context is what matters. We're not talking about BTCUSD pairs. Maybe on a trading forum or trading discussion thread, your statement would suffice. 
But thank you. I don't mean to make a big deal :-). I think we need to slowly begin conditioning our minds to not immediately or naturally treat bitcoin as simply an investment vehicle. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 00:31:36
Sounds like money laundering and other illegal activities. I'd highly _advise_ against it and recommend walking away. And blocking them. I'd also close whatever bank account info you provided to them and open a new account. 
If you're not careful, you can be liable for financial fraud and laundering.
