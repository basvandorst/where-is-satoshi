It IS an Australian exchange, the biggest and most trusted here in Australia.  It just doesn’t run on a .com.au domain.

Send to BTCmarkets.net, sell at a 6-8% premium over USA prices and deposit into BTC markets with ETH is free, and withdrawing to your bank account is also free no fees.  Btcmarkets are the biggest most trusted Aussie exchange.

Yes you Bpay into your BTCmarkets account and can withdrawal straight to your Aussie bank account in AUD.  It’s very good.  And a great fast exchange to use.  BTCmarkets has better premiums so your selling 6-8% higher than what you’ll get on a USD exchange.  It’s basically exactly what your after.  Anyways I use them I’m happy good luck on your journey mate.  Check volume on Coinmarketcap.com they are biggest in Aussie.

If they had announced it ahead of time, their servers would have crashed 3 times harder than they did by doing it this way.

In Future just setup a binance.com account and send your coins there, and do the exchange yourself it’s quite easy.  Seem too many people having issues with ShapeShift and changelly to ever trust them if anything went wrong.
Hope you get help from changelly with your money.

Might be great time to buy low tomorrow I may stay up late and watch and see.

Your right I think a big pull back first is certainly possible first before another slow run up.

Yep this article was from page of Australians biggest news site yesterday.  News.com.au.
Of course it’s a Bcash pump article.

I think the unknown factor is too high for me to buy bitcoin cash right now.  Could drop hard tomorrow, but it would be my most bullish pick and I may buy some tomorrow.  What bitcoin are you gonna buy?  The one for $3500 or the one for $17500.  One is fast and cheap to move and the other is slow.  I see double digit gains coming soon just not sure about what happens tomorrow.

Fixed it ��

In future use Binance a hugely trusted exchange with instant signup and don’t risk a 3rd party with constant issues like changelly.
Hope you get some support for your issue and have it all fixed soon.

Just a standard speculative bubble that is bursting as all bubbles do.  There will be another one in a year or so when some of these crypto companies deliver non vaporware.

Our Aussie betting companies are known to ban people who win a lot and just keep the losers who keep losing.
