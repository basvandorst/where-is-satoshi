This critique is dead on...
About someone who claims to be a Wall Street Wise guy... Um, call me unimpressed.
Oh... His dad won't buy Bitcoin so all hope is lost? Um, my Mommy, who is 80, bought some Bitcoin. 
Volume is down? He's a Wall Street guy and he's never heard fo a Bullish Descending Triangle? Volume declines before the breakout of the most powerful of these. Even CoinDesk.com understands this...
What? You lectures us about the benefit of Wall Street buying in and the price of BTC going dramatically higher like we'll be upset about that?
Right, we weren't aware this might happen. This has been a hobby for us so far. Now that we have his wisdom, we'll sell now, at a low price, because we never had the idea that Wall Street involvement would drive up the value of our investment.
One can always tell a real nube to the BTC scene when they say, "Who knows if Bitcoin is going to be the CryptoCurrency that wins the day?"
And then they can't fashion a coherent argument for any alternative.
Glad to have you on board, NUBE...

Check out the posts of "Peter R" here and elsewhere at BitcoinTalk.org...

Now that I think about it, I suggest you find the most appropriate thread at BitcoinTalk.org that Peter R has participated in and engage him in conversation about this topic. He's thought a lot about it and, I'll bet, will engage you in discussion of the issues.

Peter__R... I'm confused by the chart. You write that the dark black line represents bitcoin market cap. But if that were true, we should see sharp drops in that market cap dark line corresponding to bitcoin market crashes... But we don't see them. How can that be?
It makes sense to me that the green line would be the bitcoin market cap.
Thanks for your effort on this.
What am I missing?
