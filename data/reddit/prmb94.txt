BTC has literally broken $8k twice in the last couple of months

You're the one that'll feel rekt in 24 hours when we're at $7k
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:59:30
In fairness, the reverse is also true

Easily said ex post facto

Dump time

My God, you're one of the paranoid 'EVERYTHING IS FUD!!! IGNORE IGNORE IGNORE!!' guys. How fun. I was merely pointing out to you that it had dropped below $8k recently (and, in Feb at least, it did not simply bounce back after dropping below that level). 
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:38:17
We dipping below $9,000 again today?

 needs a google translate 
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:29:44
Thank you good sir
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:38:43
Well, this looks to have been one hell of bull trap. Jheeze 
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:42:11
Ah...where's the floor??
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:01:54
Exchange wallet, or?

Dump might be related to Binance FUD in Japan?

This will invariably get downvoted, but (good news notwithstanding) I don’t know why more of you guys aren’t skeptical about a near-$2k rise in 48 hours, especially given the bearish trends/sentiment that was so pervasive over the weekend. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:00:08
erm, guys...

Can anyone explain how whales (presumably) coordinate their dumps to maximise suppression? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:55:36
Steady? What was steady about that last spike? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:57:44
No offence, but you are so deludedly bullish, and have been for a while. Just yesterday you were posting that we definitely wouldn't hit $7k again (it looks as though you've deleted the post/s). Wise up, man. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:01:43
If that is true then I apologise - and I hope you're right, I just doubt that you are.

Although not from the US, I was cheering on Bernie from the sidelines

'Krakens trading platforms crashed.' Shocker

So this analysis makes sense to me:
