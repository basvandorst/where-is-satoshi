You sir..  Have a loose interpretation of the English language.  But i give you up vote for happy making my mind is.

I just don't want to see this become like fiat right off the bat. It's just a concern.  Was wondering if anybody else shared the same feelings. I'm a believer for the record.

For real. Imagine being the waitress!

Were on the same page. I'm just pointing out it is not detrimental to the btc community if my hardware goes down it is detrimental if CB's does though.

Another example of the downfalls of centralizing.

Exactly, but because everyone was going through coinbase everyone was effected. If it happened to my personal server it would have effected only me.

Not necessarily a problem, just throwing my thoughts out there. But why would miners spend on anything other then resources to expand and gain more BTC. The only thing that would make sense to me would be if miners also turned into a sort of credit union where they would loan BTC with interest to companies that don't provide goods or services to miners. Do you catch my drift?

Interesting thought. So we offer power in exchange for BTC and they use power to earn more BTC to buy more power to earn more BTC...etc. I am beginning to see how important keeping mining as accessible and decentralized as possible is important. It seems that method would just end with one mining company out competing every other company and he who controls currency controls the world.

Well there would be no incentive to invest in that case. But in a cashless society what goods do we, or even an exchange, have to offer to invest in a mining company to begin with?
@_date: 2016-12-14 21:19:05
A person spends for many reasons. A company spends to expand usually. So, a mining company will spend BTC to expand an operation that's sole purpose is to earn BTC. What goods do we offer that interest a mining company? I have heard electricity, which is an interesting thought.

In what sense?

What if we included a QR code that took them to download mycelium or something. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 19:56:04
True that

I definetly get this. I check BTC prices at least 10 times a day, then i wish i had more funds to buy more. I get pissed when I realize I cant afford any more. It feels like ill be at .3558 BTC for life and I HATE it.
