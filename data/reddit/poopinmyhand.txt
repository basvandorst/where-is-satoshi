I'm glad I found this thread, I had a similiar idea, wondered if you could modify the [tables and program that they have to build them at freerainbowtables.com](

Can someone explain or maybe discuss if we haven't figured it out, how would bitcoin be taxed? I would think it's possible that bitcoin would fall under the capital gains tax. If you go to a store and pay cash, that has its own tax, but if I go to a store and say, "I'll give you two walk in freezers you need for a pallet of Rice Crispy Treats," that (I think) would fall under the capital gains tax. Would BC be the same thing? Might legitimize/bring unwanted regulation.

Yea I'm no fan of Krugman, and just by the first part of his article 


It doesn't sound like a lot of his readers know much about economics, but you just can't argue with this super basic stuff. Like first week Econ101 basic. Rate of deflation is probably more important but that doesn't change what he's saying theoretical or observed.

You're an idiot and I hope your sister sues the crap out of you someday.

The essential problem is that turning your labor capital into a secure asset that will retain or appreciate in its value is near impossible. I like Bitcoin and the reasons behind it but this problem will never be solved and most people will stay in govt back fiat currencies and hope it keeps its value. Land isn't even a secure investment anymore.

Im pretty experienced in Forex trading, it's not super hard but a lot of people learn a few things then apply it to btc. The problem is that most FX strategies, despite the occasional fluke, don't really apply to btc. FX/fiat currencies have rules, govts, etc. that allow people to study over long term trials to understand how they work. Btc is very different and I don't try to apply any of the same rules. Just because a support line shows up here and there doesn't mean it's the same as a 'normal' currency pair. Be careful and don't risk your life savings in this stuff. I love the idea, love how it works, but if you think btc wasn't overvalued a couple days ago, you probably should take step back.
