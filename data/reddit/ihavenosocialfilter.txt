Ugh. I can't believe even otherwise reasonable people can't see how dangerous the Net Neutrality regulation is or at least how ineffective it will be, and that they can't see the root problem they're ignoring, that is crony capitalism.

I get that this sub is all about sticking it to the government, trust me, I am too, but this is piracy and it actually does hurt content creators.
Furthermore it has very little to do with Bitcoin.

Not wrong, just different. This is my alt for accumulating downvotes, because I don't have faith in this community to respond well to honesty.

You have to be a millionaire in LA just to get by on scraps. What's YOUR point?
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:04:16
Consider this scenario. You're a fat guy, and the federal government bans large sodas. You consider that to be discrimination for whatever reason, but nobody else in the country thinks it is, and you'll never convince them. You have the choice to leave it to the states and have it still be banned in every state but yours, or to leave it to the federal government.
Are you going to fight and rage at the federal government to force everybody in the country to conform to your ideals and make them unhappy just so you can feel like you forced the right thing upon other human beings? Or would you rather take the small victory and take the fight one state at a time, giving you a much MUCH better chance at victory overall, especially when the country can see the success your state has by allowing it?

Well yeah. If I lived in the state with the worst cost of living, I'd look for a currency not subject to the tyrannical state government's inflationary behavior.

This is not an argument. This is an emotional outburst.


You can't just call them your taxes when it's convenient for you. He paid his share of taxes, and the services he used to make money came from the share of taxes HE PAID. He's not spending any of YOUR money. He's redeeming the value of HIS OWN money that he was forced to spend. This is one of the big flaws of socialism. Because the money goes into a pool, it suddenly becomes "the people's money", and anyone who uses that money is expected to be conscious of the impact they're doing to society at all times. That's not freedom. If someone earns their money they should spend it on whatever they want, that way, if they waste their money, they can't possibly be wasting "your" money.


You don't want to live in a socialist state, yet you want money to be shared and managed by a central source. If that's how you feel, you're in for some bad news.


Another emotional outburst lacking any logical value.

How can you be split between two candidates who are polar opposites at their cores?
@_date: 2015-05-24 20:53:04
He aligns himself with people who are very much Socialist in the classic sense of the word, so I don't think wordplay is going to redeem him honestly.
Moreover, he clearly has the "big corporation hate" that classic Socialists have. That's not a capitalist viewpoint.
Oh, and the partisan politics. He's very much anti-the-other-side.
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:15:31
That's a horrible reason to deny states' rights. The government was intended to be slow and inefficient. Every time people try to jam laws through, we end up damaging ourselves. The founding fathers anticipated this and intentionally made the process deliberate.
Moreover that excuse does not mitigate the benefits I outlined of allowing granularity as opposed to forcing everybody in the country to conform to one ideal.
@_date: 2015-05-24 22:18:06
And those taxes constituted an equal trade as well. He owes society nothing further, and the money is his, and he deserves to keep it.
Furthermore, I'd warn you not to fall into the Extension Fallacy, that what worked in some cases will work in every case. Just because government built roads haven't been a failure doesn't mean Socialist bureaucrats expanding control of our finances will continue to be a success.
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:07:34
It was shared due to equal trade, so he doesn't owe society anything for the money he earned, because he provided equal value for that money. It's his money.

I don't care about my side, and I don't care about ego. Ego does not tell me how I'm going to be living for the next 4 to 8 years. I look at the policies, the things that are going to actually affect me. That is how an informed person votes.
@_date: 2015-05-24 22:06:31
What about my post history implies that I have only partisan interests in mind, and not that I'm arguing against a certain ideal, or a person who speaks in favor of a certain ideal?
@_date: 2015-05-24 20:59:09
Why does law have to be an "everyone must conform or nobody may" proposition? The more granularity we have, the more people can be satisfied with their state's own set of laws, that way we can actually HAVE gay marriage in some states instead of fighting over a single point of yes or no for the whole country.
@_date: 2015-05-25 04:49:52


As far as gay marriage, it should end at the level of the two partners who want to get married and any other parties they invite to get involved.


Unless you move? Pursue happiness? There is literally no logical connection between living somewhere shitty and forcing the entire country to do your bidding.


I agree, and I believe it is inethical/immoral/whatever to endorse it as well. Still, under DOMA, the federal government does just that and leaves it up to the states. The states should then leave it up to the counties etc. But the hierarchy needs to remain in place because it has a good purpose.
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:11:37
That is true. If it came down to Paul vs Sanders, it would be a fight for the actual ideals instead of personal or party gain. Knowing which candidate I would choose, I wouldn't naturally want to invite such strong competition, but it would certainly be one of the more interesting election cycles in a long time. It could ~~literally~~ figuratively be the tipping point of America, whether it would continue down a road of Socialism or of Capitalism.
@_date: 2015-01-01 13:43:56
Or because the cost of living is higher, less rich people refuse to put up with it and get themselves somewhere less insane.
@_date: 2015-05-24 22:04:07


Liberty is an inalienable human right, so that doesn't really fall into the purview of enacting laws. It's unconstitutional to do so.


Yes! Delegate as granularly as possible!


You may decide to take that stance. But realistically, you wouldn't know that ahead of time. Even if it were possible to convince people, it's easier to convince one state than the entire population of the country. And each state you can convince will join your cause and spread the good word with you, so it's less of an uphill battle. Honestly it just makes everything easier to take all this in small bite-size pieces.
@_date: 2015-01-01 13:46:23
I'm no ancap. Hell no.
Richness is a factor of monetary numbers and cost of living. If you make a zillion Zimbabwe dollars, you're not rich because cost of living is so bad.

Pursuing happiness is not hard to do when your definition of progress is held up. You're pursuing happiness right now by fighting against those traditional citizens. What the founding fathers EXPLICITLY did NOT guarantee was the achievement of happiness. People don't have to bend over so that you can be happy.
The conforming I'm referring to is having a federal government that proclaims from on high "There shall be/not be any gay marriages." and everyone in the country has to conform. Just as you'd be upset if the federal government maintained that nobody in the country may ever have a gay marriage, other people would be upset if the government forced them to allow gay marriage.
Let's look at a less polarizing perspective on this.
Let's say we're choosing what color is better. The left half of the country likes red and the right half likes blue. The federal government might take it to a vote and find that there is 50.000001% of the population that prefers red, so 49.999999% of the population is going to have to suffer with the color red. That's a lot of suffering.
Instead, then, they take it to a state level. The western states all vote red, and the eastern states all vote for blue, and now the country is legally split with red on one side and blue on the other, and maybe not 100% of the population is happy, but it must be well over 75%, and what's great is that people who can't stand to live somewhere against their color have a home on the other side. They actually have the choice to pursue the ideal they want and be happy instead of being forced into obedience by the federal government.
So surely you see that on any issue, no matter how right you are, it's better to let people who are wrong be happy with their decision. And if it turns out to be a bad decision, they can have the experience of being wrong, and improve themselves because of it, or just suffer without having any impact on your life.
@_date: 2015-05-27 04:40:30


Sorry, it's still true. Gay marriage doesn't have to be legal for people to pursue happiness. Sure, it prevents some people from achieving happiness, for now, but it doesn't prevent them from pursuing it, and it doesn't mean it will always be that way.


That's the end result when you let your government become more granular. You're demanding the ultimate universal single entity government make a proclamation that people have to recognize gay marriages. Well that's not choosing for themselves. They have more choice if you delegate that decision to state governments. Or more if you delegate to city governments. Or more if you delegate the decision to the individuals and their institution of choice, if any.

I would have pinned the status quo as "Socialist policies dragging the economy down", in which case he would only upset it by making it worse.
