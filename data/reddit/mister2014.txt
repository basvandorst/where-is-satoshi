He obviously pays staff to output all this crap. Hes spewing these kind of little pearls of wisdom constantly.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:19:09
-ITISH more like. The CEO is some Indian dude. Not this guy :)
I am invested in BTC, but this is pure crap and an old post. I thought our community was better than this.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:17:24
its because hes 90000 years old.
Its interesting he said its a bubble. Surely one of his pearls of wisdom gifs is "Do not mock what you do not understand"
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:30:07
Its not about hate for bch. Its about frustration due to the lies Roger V has sold. Claims bch can scale to millions of tps is total BS. Big blocks dont solve the issue. So just buy btc and wait for lightning network and profit. Dont waste time or money on bch. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:47:19
You must be a self made millonaire right? Well then, you can do whatever the hell you want as youre much better than anyone else.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:18
Never too late. Just dont buy the altcoins they are all tanking.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:26:40
Why so much hate. Were a happy community lets come together and help one another to all do well and ultimately make btc great again :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:31:07
I really think youre going to have issues cashing them out. You will need to prove how your brother came to own them. Thats on top of proving the laptop was his etc also. If you cannot explain how he came to have these coins its going to be tough. :(

@_date: 2017-12-26 13:10:07
Its actually a quality post to try and steer people away from the lies and bs Roger spews. Scalable to millions of tps haha yea right. Barely does 24tps. Such a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:03:05
Totally agree. BCH crowd just dont seem to get it. 24TPS is terrible and does not meet Satoshis white paper either. Visa and paypal have huge TPS numbers which no onchain coin can ever hope to hit. We need offchain (LN) and batching of the transactions back to the blockchain. But they never listen blinded by their fixation of bch vs btc and whatever smoke and BS Roger Ver sells them...
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:29:23
Yes sorry man. They key question they will ask is how did these btcs come to be. Otherwise they will always think the worst. Aka stolen etc even if thats not the case :( 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:10:54
Me too brother.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:05:32
I love you guys on this community. I was worried but coming here calmed my nerves.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:33:02
Down vote me all you want but what I say is fact. For some more free advice sell your bch buy btc and wait for LN and watch bitcoin goto the moon.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:25:28
Selling off also affects it. So having ppl hold their btcs is key here.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:19:10
Thats actually irrelevant. Btc community understands the inherent issues with onchain transactions and the low tps of realtime processing. L2 and offchain is the only way to get the tps needed to replace visa etc and realise Satoshis white paper. 
You see we understand things a little better. We dont lie and say btc or any other blockchain coin can do this...
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:59:34
China and India are really backwards. It will hurt them severly in the long run. But their governments are all about controlling their people and suppression. So no surprises really.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:30:40
Use bitstamp they have segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:46:37
ok a question for you then. Did you buy bch and if so why. What was your reasoning and research behind it?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:46:39
It will for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:35:14
Wow the bitcoin Jesus :)

I did read what you wrote. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:44:15
Yea best to move all btcs off their exchange
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:31:54
Use bitstamp they have segwit 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:52:19
Great post for sure. Something worth following.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:03:40
You referring to bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:30:23
Great information. Thanks for that. The future of bitcoin certainly looks bright.

Use 2FA login anyway and never reuse a password. Irrespective.

Its password1
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:55:01
Love this answer. Whilst all the while bch crowd and roger ver say this coin is scalable to millions of tps when it isnt. Now you say you too can use a L2 solution. Which admits failure for the fork and blocksize increase. Why was there even a fork if it does not solve the scalability issue you claim your coin fixes....
BCH is a failed experiment at best by a group who does not understand the blockchain and its limitations. On top of that they have made a centralized solution. Way to go.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:59:38
Congrats and welcome to the party.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:17:10
Roger Vs statement on his twitter 'BCH Can scale to millions of tps' hmmm :) and yes bch crowd believe this rubbish scoffing at L2 when it was announced not understanding that the tps is not possible otherwise. Its why so many bought in believing onchain is possible because Roger V says so. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:27:52
Great pls everyone try and break it so they can fix everything asap and get this out into the wild.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:32:32
Also roger ver knows bcash will never have the tps to give fast payments if it becomes popular. Its a failed experiment. He said when asked how will bcash handle scalability that he will use the LN haha.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:56:43
Bcrash will use LN roger ver said in the CNBC interview a full admittal that his fork is a failure when many people start using brcash
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:27:22
Its also a failure it hasnt fixed anything. The increase in blocksize will never solve the scalability issue inherent with blockchain. Only offchain solutions can solve this. What it has done has split the community in two thanks to Rogers greed and narcassim. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:17:18
Sorry to hear you lost your retirement :(
I have put some cash into BTC but nothing I cannot afford to lose. Sure Im not going to lie it will sting, but Im ok if it goes. I havent gambled retirement money or my home etc.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:43:38
Yes then you two can become a arrogant childish self made millionaire. Plus you can look like a crazy psycho and flip the middle finger whenever someone slightly offends you. :) bcash baby yeaaaa
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:54:22
Well not much for me to say other than what I have already. Onchain millions of tps is not possible no matter what they do. Increasing blocksize cannot achieve this and only makes it more centralized not decentralized. But if you have both btc and bch in equal measure you will be ok either way.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:49:44
Yea time to take your business elsewhere. The most money is in BTC. So if we move it all off they are screwed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:04:19
Great idea. But Im guessing pimps will be using this option a lot instead of air bnb. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:42:47
They finally realise their solution is flawed and will never scale to the lvl that is needed. Its a HUGE deal he acknowledges it and also acknowledges his amazing dev team cannot solve it on chain...
Roger Ver essentially is saying his coin is a failure. Sure its slightly better than BTC but its a total fail as it will still need an off chain solution to solve the scaling issue inherit with blockchains no matter the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:54:01
Not bad for someone who clearly stole the idea. Proof crime does pay.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:46:02
Its a good job Robert Ver is not pro bitcoin. Imagine the meltdown and the abuse he would aim at your poor mum :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:41:49
Dont worry really. This has happened many times before for btc. It will recover just hold and wait.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:59:50
I finally sold off my bch. Feels good
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:08:45
Everyone is and Im with you all on this. But we need this rolled out ASAP and for it to be seemingly transparent during btc transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:13:05
Haha im with you!

Bitstamp I like and they support segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:38:40
Bitstamp. They also support segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:10:08
I dont believe the average buyer that you describe here will sell it to turn a profit. Not in the short term. I  believe those joining the party are looking at it as a long term thing. Gold 2.0. So I dont expect any crash. Also individually they cannot afford many btcs to make a dent on the market if/when they do sell. The only way they could really affect the market negatively is if by some miracle they ALL sell at the sametime. But this is unlikely as most have their own sell out level in their mind. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:23:01
Thx man I bought some in the dip you created. I financed it from some bch :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:10:31
Yes you can use irrespective in the way I did. But its ok not many people really understand English so well. Im assuming your first language isnt English its no big deal dude. Often on reddit people come to try and do the old grammar police youre not the first and you wont be the last. Its good you are open to learning though, thats the main thing. 
Regarding the other points ah whatever really, put your coins money where you feel safest.

@_date: 2017-11-28 17:15:20
Yes why?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:29:29
No what he asked for was not part of the degree. I learnt all that working for years with databases etc
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:47:51
Agreed why are some people just wanting others to fail. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:51:03
Im asking how is it not? Youre essentially making more available to trade which increase the amount in circulation. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:48:47
The degrees would be better if they taught what is actually needed when you work. The lecturers are the issue here and its due to the fact they are so far removed from real work as they typically have never worked in a 9-5 in the subject matter they are teaching. Which is the point I was originally making.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:13:16
My degree was not in english. Neither was it in writing comments perfectly without needing to edit after. Furthermore had they been degrees in these two areas I still wouldnt have been taught how to do either :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:31:34
Im a noob what does this mean. How does this help bitcoin etc.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:42:32
Thats exactly why that person is a lecturer. They do really know nothing, and generally teach pointless information that you never use when you get a job. Its understandable when you realise they have never worked a real job in their lives.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:18:51
Thanks for confirming. Its interesting I got down voted for my comment too weird.
I like to use the analogy of gold. Gold can only go so small physically until its not measurable. You cant have gold molecules to trade for example :) which is why it can not be inflated like fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:02:20
Nope and nope. The fact is youre taught a lot of useless crap that you never ever use when you work in IT. Lot of theoretical rubbish that has no real world application. Z notation anyone?!
But actually get a job interview you need a degree in software engineering.

@_date: 2017-11-28 16:53:41
You'll learn when you start working. 99% of my degree was a waste of time.  The 1% that was worth it was the friends I made and the parties. :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:06:13
Yea which is the majority. My degree was software eng.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:05:08
Me too. First time I didnt though. But this time yessss :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:07:54
This is essentially inflation if this is done. Which breaks the whole point no?
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:03:51
Smart answer... the point is the new trezor supports more and is more expensive. They should add support to existing customers who have the original trezor.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:37:53
Youre basing this on what exactly. They havent said they will do this.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:09:29
Ill set this up on my linux box. Bought my first % of a bitcoin this week :) so why not.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:49:53

@_date: 2017-11-16 18:59:33
Thanks for the info
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:01:34
Well a degree gets you a blue collar job so yea it has that use. But if you want to be your own boss and build your own company the degree will not help. Why because the people teaching you are not people who innovate, take risks or build companies. 
But hell its fun being at uni :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:20:33
Jesus man youre really anal right. Its clear what I meant. Degrees are a waste of time and their content is useless. If the ONLY use is a interview for a job you have no preparation for is that a USE to you?!?! A degree should prepare the student for their subject matter and they dont. How bad is that especially when Uni fees are so high. Most students graduate in debt. So yes to me degrees are a waste of time money and are actually a fraud.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:44:00
Yes hes embarrassing. Like a spoilt child.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:07:38
Nope further up in response to someone else i clarify that the only use is getting you a job. Actually the interview for a job. So again there you go. 
So as you want a perfectly specified outline.
1. Degrees teach you very little that you actually use in a real job.
2. Degrees if you get one help you get an interview. No gaurantee of job mind.
Clear now? :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:24:43
Omg man Im done enjoy trolling people. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:27:57
It would be better if they supported more coins on the original trezor. Like they do for the new trezor model.
