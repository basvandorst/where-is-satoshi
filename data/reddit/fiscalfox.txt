It's even less useful for purchasing games though. The reason Steam, Apple, and Google take 30% is not because they're doing payment processing, it's because they're sourcing the audience for you. You can stick your games on the web for basically free and sign up for a Stripe account, and pay just standard credit card processing fees, keeping 97% of your revenue, but you have to find a way to reach consumers then. Stripe even lets you accept bitcoin, but we, for instance, get about 0.2% of our revenue from bitcoin. If you're a user, credit cards are simply better because you have protection in the form of chargebacks (not to mention rewards programs).

Yeah, it's like you didn't read the article beyond the chart, with all due respect.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:02:48
Yeah, that's quite true. I mostly wrote it so I could link FB friends to it when they post less-than-educated things about crypto.

The trouble is that you're limiting your audience to the intersection of people who care about crypto and people who want to play your specific game. 
With bitcoin, in particular, the molasses-like speed of value transfer is also out of keeping with most games. I mean, in our games players can transfer IGC/premium currency to each other like in many games, and like in most games, it's effectively instant and without cost to anyone barring the almost immeasurably small incremental power consumed by our servers to run that operation.
I could see some value in using blockchain for IGC in a truly decentralized game, but in almost all games where you'd use something like that, the game is totally centralized in the hands of the developer, so it's hard to see what advantage you're really getting by putting decentralized lipstick on the proverbial centralized pig.

Yep, you can. Short-term (assets you've held under a year and a day) losses are first used to offset short-term gains, and long-term losses are first used to offset long-term gains. If you still have a loss after that, you can use up to $3000 of the remaining loss to offset normal income (like from a job). Anything beyond that, you can carry forward to future years to offset capital gains and/or $3000/year offset to normal income.

No, but you can offset them against other gains you have, though the treatment is different based on short-term vs long-term gains.

It's not nonsense at all. I've been developing online games since the 90s, and pioneered the use of virtual currencies/goods in games. There is no advantage to us in replacing our in-game currencies with a cryptocurrency. I've had this discussion probably a dozen times with people wanting me to consult with them on how to do this.

Not all. It was well over $21k on Bithumb, which is doing nearly the same volume Bitfinex is. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:31:28
That's kind of my point: It's not impossible not to go to $100,000, as you recognize with at least two scenarios.

Fails to replicate the grin on my face.

He means Segwit2x, which is distinctly different from the other forks.

I think you and I have a different sense of what the world 'impossible' means. ;)

Yes, you'll have your new coins in your hardware wallet. Whether you can do anything with them is another question. Trezor announced today that they won't be ready to let you transfer the new coins out, because doing so could endanger your real bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:17:21
Personally, I think anything over 10k is well-worth having a hardware wallet for. That's paying about ~1% to store your value safely.

If you believe that bitcoin is going to be huge, then yes, as ultimately it will either go much higher, or go much lower. I don't think there's much of a long-term middle-ground there. 
One thing that's important to avoid doing when investing generally is getting fixated on past price behavior. For instance, I guarantee you that many people were asking exactly this question when bitcoin hit $1000, $1500, $2000, and so on. What was the answer to the question at those points?
Now of course, at some point every asset tops out in value, and so at some point the answer is going to be no, it doesn't make sense to buy (barring wanting to actually use it for something). Nobody's going to know when we've hit that point except with the benefit of hindsight though.

Hope you get there, friend!

Fred Wilson is a very legitimate VC who writes and thinks well and clearly. I pitched him once, though he declined to fund my company. Everyone 'investing' (gambling) on ICOs ought to pay attention.

Their ability to predict crypto prices is about the same as anyone else's: non-existent.
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:07:18
It's not heresy as this isn't a religion, but it's certainly dishonest and the sort of thing marketing weasels might spit out.

To expand on another person's comment, gdax.com, which is coinbase's exchange. Upsides are you'll pay much lower fees. Downsides are that since it's an exchange it'll let you do things you shouldn't like accidentally selling your coins way below market because you entered the wrong price by accident. There are also daily withdrawal limits but those might not affect you depending on how much you're trading.
