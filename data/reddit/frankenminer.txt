How do you know this? The only reason it's not easy to withdraw is through dodgy companies demanding authorisation payments or witholding funds. A big company can be easily held to account for things like this for just the reason you said, because they keep track of it all and freedom of information. It would damage their reputation if not bank balance if there was enough of an uproar so I'm sure to ensure thus doesn't happen their dev team will make it as easy as PayPal to deposit and withdraw funds.

Carry it to the store in your wallet on your phone then use an app to scan a qr code and you have paid. All items could have a tag that is disabled once you have scanned and paid. Then you can just walk out the shop without setting off the theft alarm. It's simples. It's the future.

So if there's two parties that are interested in trading Bitcoin for various other goods and services that is a transaction. This could be more alikened to the old bartering system, although Bitcoin can mimic any fiat currency going it is so much more than any fiat currency. It is different in nature and has a separate set of rules that govern it which are much more transparent and fairer than the systems currently in place which are controlled by a tiny percentage of the population. 
Ownership is simply the act, state, or right of possession. The question you are asking is more a question of morals.

No you're misunderstanding me. What I meant is that finding that correlation is a way to check if governments are printing money in secret for cryptos. Even if it's done on darknet.

Why don't you take a minute to not be a patronising know-it-all. Why do I need to think about it? Because you cannot think of an answer to my previous statement that it could be a goodt thing if done properly. It's not like it going to be fiat fiat fiat then one day cryptos take over and they rule from then on. There won't be a great fiat amnesty where everyone has to hand over fiat in exchange for crypto like a new world hard fork. If they do become the main commerce of choice over fiat it will be over a long period of time and both will have to interact with one another so a reliable way to do so could be a good thing. Not saying Sachs will do this but they have a chance to here.

Has anyone considered this situation could have been a complete sham to discredit Bitcoin... If the kidnappers knew enough about cryoto's to be confident they could make their Bitcoin trail anonymous why didn't they ask for a privacy coin that can't be traced. Surely 5/6 Monero per Bitcoin would of been a better demand.  Surely the authorities would be on the btc address like wild fire sparing Bo expense to analyse the chain. It doesn't make sense to me... 
Either the kidnappers don't know alot about cryptos or the group who are responsible for the sham aren't very clued up on how it all works (hence the motivation to try and bring it down). 
I'm glad they didn't ask for monero as I'm a supporter and wouldn't want it to be used for/associated with kidnappings but if you think about it if it was you, would you demand Bitcoin in a situation where you can basically have any coin you want and know you need it to be untraceable? 
I think not.

Just curious what grounding you have to make all these claims. To know so much about these things you must have some level of experience that qualifies you to do so. I also have plenty of real world experience but qualifications and education to back it up. Comparing a multi national corporation to a green grocer is ridiculous. The difference between the USD and the USDC is obviously the transparent blockchain technologies used to account for it. You're just grasping for straws now, your personal opinion and feelings towards Sachs and the establishment sway your opinion very strongly. Being narrow minded is only accepting your own way of thinking about things. I can accept that Sachs are not to be trusted and acknowledge that but what I am putting forward is the point that they could use this as an oppirtunuty to create a very useful platform for crypto&gt;fiat and fiat&gt;crypto. If you don't agree that's fine but you can't tell me I'm wrong because really neither of us know. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:15:07

But you previous comment,'not Goldman Sachs'...
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:49:21
Well I can say the same about any fiat currency backed by alleged gold reserves. You never actually own the gold the federal reserve uses to back their currency yet you happily put value in the dollar and will work for it. The dollar is controlled and manipulated by a small percentage of the population in a deceitful and secretive way. Bitcoin offers a decentralised transparent solution and it's worth is backed by both users believing in it and the work that goes into keeping the blockchain operational and the power it takes to do that. But really it's just the 'cant go into a shop and spend it' thing that got me. You're so off the mark. It would be just like contactless pay with your phone or debit/credit card a technology that we firmly have in out grasp now and although not fully utilised for Bitcoin yet it is being rolled out and more and more places are starting to accept.

It's okay, it must only be a streak and nothing more or you would have more conviction in your beliefs. Most people don't actually view Bitcoin as the currency and more the reserve behind currencies. It is still very much in its developmental stages which involves high levels of fluctuation but as it developes fluctuation will calm down and it will become more of a standard. Let's not forget all prices fluctuate just not as irratically. That being said it can still be used as a currency but just not for buying your penny sweets down the corner shop. Things like real estate and trans Atlantic transactions can be facilitated using Bitcoin. These transactions are often completed much quicker than traditional large trans Atlantic transactions using fiat currencies. As a result the fluctuation is not such a problem. The real problem is you not wanting spend because of greed. People are happy to accept Bitcoin, atleast people that believe it will rise, and if they don't they could either just short themselves or build the fiat conversion into their pricing. It's really quite simple. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:40:40
Data manipulation. 
What you're suggesting involves a high degree of trust people just don't have for large corporations or accounting bodies. I left accountancy because it became clear to me it is governed in an unfair and secretive manner using accounting techniques to hide money and avoid paying taxes that regular joes would be made to pay under force of law.

Yeah or use existing btc funds and Tether with usdt then return the btc once its confirmed or have it sent straight to your exchange wallet to avoid fees. Then regardless of when you cash out as long as you convert from usdt&gt;cryoto with a marketplace then cryoto&gt;fiat with a broker like coinbase quickly you're good.

I think the mass adoption you are thinking of isn't the mass adoption that will happen. What I mean is I think you are thinking of mass adoption as everyone having Bitcoin in their wallet and using it to buy general goods on a day to day basis. The way I think mass adoption wil manifest itself in Bitcoin is through financial institutions and banks (maybe considered crypto banks by this point) making the switch onto blockchain tech and using Bitcoin as their standard. Mastercard has recently put in a patent put their system on a blockchain so this may already be happening. What do you think?
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:11:59
Haha well yes, but that's got nowt to do with this. The fed is irrelevant to cryptos and blockchain, unless you're counting the fact cryptos where made to combat the corruption in established institutions. Usdt, however, is very relevant. Also the entire idea behind cryptos is to eliminate this kind of behaviours in financial markets so the fact Tether are conducting themselves in this way just puts people off.

They will be acquiring warrants and will raid you very soon arresting you and seizing all your hardware, software and accounts to look for more info. Yo better lawyer up cause you're in for a wild ride. I don't think this is the right sub for this either. The charge they will be hoping to bring on you is international drug trafficking.

It's a really really great idea in principle, but even verifying through social media wouldn't be enough. You would need a person in the field to be completely sure.

Bitcoincash should be on r/bch and r/bitcoincash and Bitcoin should be on r/btc and r/bitcoin but we all know that ain't gonna happen!

It's not right for a company like Bcash to shamelessly try to invade the Bitcoin space. Trying to pass itself off as the "real Bitcoin" by buying misleading domains and dominating the r/btc sub reddit. This is a very very shady and scammy practice to be involved in let alone actively pursuing. Especially for a coin ranked 4th on CMC. 
We all know Btc=Bitcoin and Bch=Bitcoin cash. 
It is misleading investors into buying into Bcash when they really wanted Bitcoin this in turn hurts the entire crypto community because it diminishes the trust that has been build up. 
This is the main technique Bcash has adopted to try and dethrone Bitcoin from the top spot and that's all there is to it. It's not a two way street, the agrovation is being cause by Bcash on r/btc and other outlets. This is why people from this sub have shit to say about Bitchcash. 
I emplore you to find a valid point from the other side with any reasonable arguments as to why Bitcoin is in the wrong in this situation and why Bcash should be on the Btc sub and not the Bch sub. I gaurentee you all you will be met with is bias rhetoric and an immature stances on why Bcash is the best. (it's really not).
From a leveled non bias point of view Bcash are very obviously the agrovators in the situation and any shots being fired back at them are reactionary and largely justified.

If you go to my profile you can see the site I built, it's nothing special just some guides and things but might be good to look at for inspiration. I think forum style is a must for group discussion it's just difficult to get people to participate.

Even in the bear market you still make a profit. It's about what you mine now and how power efficient you can make your hardware.

Yeah but then you'd be discounting any/all new accounts. Someone might have never heard of reddit but hears about your site and asks for help. How woukd this be dealt with? I'm not poking holes in your idea here, as I said I think it's great. Just a few ideas to troubleshoot but I say go for it dude you're never going to know unless you get the ball rolling

Well it does because your actions led to your situation. The collective concensus is that if you don't do your research it is your fault. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:08:13
That's where the idea of Bitcoin being the marker of value for all other coins comes in. It will be too valuable to use for small transactions but strong and stable for basing all other coin prices off. You then have a bunch of coins you use for various things that can all be transfered into Bitcoin to see the total actual value.

Yeah. It kinda already is watch and compare prices and you will see alot of correlation.

It's just my thoughts, but seems to be the way it's going. It's other main function would be moving large amounts of money in international contracts quickly for very low fees, it's already used for that. I'm not getting into the btc bch argument on this thread lol. I think they both have their place but in my mind it's 1 - Bitcoin 2-Ethereum 3-Monero(xmr) and 4 Litecoin. You got contact details?  Always good to have like minded people for future projects.

If complaints are everywhere then why did you put your coins there in the first place? If you needed the money for medical treatment why did you put it into coins? 
Now I'm not saying they are not in the wrong, they should pay everyone their coins. But that's a couple pretty bad decisions on your part. And the main question people are asking is why?

Surely hashrate (no of active miners) has a direct effect on supply?
