LDP has one seat in the senate currently and first preference votes are on the rise for them in all their historic states and they are now even getting started in QLD (which is difficult as 'homebread' partys like Katter's and Palmer United)
The way in which the LDP is growing is very much like the early days of UKIP, and they just won the UK EU elections

If everyone increased their fee average fees would just increase with it. It would do literally nothing to the rate at which transactions go through. Fees don't magically increase the blocksize. 
It used to be the mempool would clear in the next few block, then it was the next few hours, the we were told to just wait for it to clear overnight, now it's over the next few days. The mempool getting filled up on a regular basis. What happens when the mempool doesn't clear before the next cycle of high transaction volume?

Cool, I also think Bitcoin banks will become a thing and competitive currencies happening. But I disagree with what he sees as the ultimate future of the Bitcoin network will be, as do most in that thread and the general debate up until the last couple of years. 
Regardless, Bitcoin is fundamentally a free market experiment and what happens to it is up to the market to decide. The block size limit was always assumed to be a temporary feature set at a limit that would not effect the market. Now the market has grown and full blocks and overflowing mempools are more of a systematic bug which now others are trying to claim is a feature. Blocksize limits are an artificial barrier to prop up fees, limit transactions, and support off-chain solutions. 
If I'm wrong and the alternative is the better idea then it should flourish in a free market without restrictive block size limits
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:26:54
I understand your point and I agree, but you wouldn't be getting rid of the fee market, it would just be a true free market where miners compete to accept the lowest profitable fee possible. Once block rewards go away fees will fund mining so zero fee transactions won't be accepted. Similarly, accepting fees so low that they don't pay for the electricity used to mine that portion of the block also wont be accepted. Some payments will be time sensitive so their fees will always be above average to be certain to get into the next block. Eventually a price will settle at a reasonable level for both miners and users. Dynamic block sizes would help this be signalled but this would still work with unlimited sized blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:45:49
When we get close to competing with Visa then we can talk, but until the blockchain gets over 2-3 TB thus unable to be run with a ~$100 HDD, blocksize increases should be uncontroversial. You can't LARP about a certain idea of future btc at the expense of Bitcoin today. 
Currently the average node is run by neckbeards like me in their parents basement, which is why the critical point is the cost of an average hard drive. By the time that happens however, their will be so much real economic activity on the network that medium and large sized stores will run full nodes and take over from the neckbeards. By the time visa traction levels are in sight the amount of resources, both technical and physical, going into Bitcoin would be so immense that our current debate would look laughable. Further, improvements like segwit/xthin, pruned nodes, better HDD's all work to prolong the life of each 'stage' of node hosting.
Now let's be reasonable and serious and develope Bitcoin for the next 6 years, not 60 years. Adoption and use is suffering because of the current blocksize. Even if you are pushing for LN and other side chains you shouldn't be arguing for overflowing mempools and artificially high fees.

The views of that single individual are not far from the other devs, they certainly don't openly object to it. 
What he is discribing is not advocacy for bigger blocks sometime in the near future (like you said you wanted) but for a top down interpretation of what 'legitimate' transactions are so that Bitcoin becomes a settlement layer with massive fees to artificially large offchain payment networks. He also somehow thinks almost all users should be running full nodes. 
Both these things go against Satoshi's vision. He predicted most users would not run full nodes and worked on lite wallets. To satoshi, full nodes were miners. The reason why people aren't running nodes today is because there is no incentive, not because of the blockchain size. To think otherwise is to not understand the tragedy of the commons. Further the white paper makes no mention of blocksize limits and satoshi only wanted one so long as it was cheap to attack the network while mining hash power was low. 
There are many more problems with what he believes but they all boil down to him not being an economist or logician. The fact he is a good coder doesn't give his opinions outside of this any weight (by his own admission he isn't even a security expert). If one of the devs say their is a bug in some code then you better be listening, but if they make a comment about incentives then treat their comments with the same level of skepticism as a post from a 1 month of account.

That's not really how money works, you can't retrospectively say the pizza cost $30. When you start doing stuff like that you end up with the famous $20 million pizza story (one of the first btc purchases ever). 
Sure Bitcoin is less stable in the short term than what you might be used to with fiat or stocks but time and time again Bitcoin has been shown to be less risky than other investments because the volatility is less than long term growth trends. 
Spending Bitcoin should be no different than spending fiat in the way you calculate opportunity cost. Even with fiat you could keep it invested you're whole life and it would certainly be worth more than it is today but you wouldn't have any consumption in the mean time. You spend money/Bitcoin when the utility of consumption today (eg time preference) is greater than the expected opportunity cost of keeping it invested. Millions of people doing this every day is what drives the ultimate price of Bitcoin.

I don't know how much you understand Bitcoin or competitive markets but transaction fees are a natural product of scarcity. When miners process your transaction they put it into a 'block'. On average there is one block every 10 mins. Currently there is a limit of 1mb for each block (for historical reasons I won't get into, it used to be much higher). This puts a hard cap on how many transactions can be processed every 10 mins. 
When the number of requested transactions is larger than the spots available, there needs to be a way to decide which transactions are the most important. This is the job of fees. Whoever is willing to pay the most gets in, everyone else has to wait for the backlog to clear or try again with a larger fee. As many people have legitimate transactions they want to make fees have shot up. This isn't the fault of miners being extortionate. 
There is currently a big debate going on as the whether this is a good thing or not, with many wanting to increase the transactions per min by either raising the block limit (Bitcoin unlimited/BU) or making transactions take up less space (segregated witness/segwit)

I cover this is another topic, yes successful collusion destroys the competitive regulation of the market. However lowish barriers to entry and the fact the Nash equilibrium is more stable in a competitive economy than a colluding one mean this is less of a concern.

Heaps of people actually, it has been consensus in multiple threads other there that they want BU before SegWit because they dont trust core devs to increase the blocksize after SegWit consensus. 
Though there are many who hate core enough to also reject segwit but even then they endorse other technologies that have the same practical end as segwit. 
Im undecided between 'old school' blocksize increase and dynamic blocksize but im generally supportive of segwit. If core codes a decent blocksize limit increase into 13.x ill swap over my BU node without hesitation, until then ill be unconvinced core wants on chain scaling. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 16:20:21
How are you defining a miner controlled dynamic blocksize limit then? 
BU allows any miner to mine at any blocksize limit they want and allows nodes to accept or reject any blocksize they want. How is this not a dynamic system? I only mention BU as it is the real world alternative to fixed blocksizes
@_date: 2016-12-15 14:40:28
If anything it would do the opposite. If one group mined empty blocks to fill up the meme pool it would be in the interests of the rest of the hash power to mine a much larger block and take what basically amounts to the fee's from 2 blocks.

When i joined on the bitcoin hype train the community was full of crypto-anarchists/libertarians who had a vision of changing the entire worlds economy with a simple digital exchange system. Wallets were becoming user friendly and stores both online and in the real world were not just taking a risk by accepting bitcoin, but were accepting it because it was better and cheaper for them. I was sceptical at first but as this dream slowly turned into the first signs of reality i bought it. I mostly held but paid for numerous things with my bitcoin and loved it. The problem is i havent touched it for a year and am now starting to think about selling. This is simply because the dream is dead. Those visionaries who kickstarted bitcoin have been silenced and now btc is talked about as a traded commodity rather than the revolutionary currency it was meant to be. Well guess what, the world doesnt need a crypto commodity. 
The current price is just the disembodied aftershocks of the hype of yesteryear fuelled by speculators who have no idea why anyone cares about this technology anyway. If bitcoin and its community doesnt revert back to its original mission it will die a slow death.

Because a businessman who appoints other businessmen to run the country is much much better than political establishment who works for businessmen.  
Trump is (largly) appointing people who are provably successful at management and large scale decision making and who have little desire or need for extended political careers. While there might be the occasional conflict of interest its unlikely they will do political favours for other individual companies in exchange for political donations. Instead they are likely to use their own wealth of knowledge and experience to make broad decisions that promote general business practices.  This is in stark contrast to corrupt establishment politics where whoever pays the most gets to puppet the politician.  
Trump is doing *exactly* what he said he was going to do by draining the swamp. Meanwhile hillary took hundreds of millions from special interest (and most concerning, from Arab governments) yet we're meant to believe in the left's talking point that Trump is the corrupt one? kek.

If we assume the miners can collude successfully then there is nothing stopping them from mining blocks that are not full and only accepting very high fees. Or even publicly stating they aren't going to accept fees below a certain level. End result is miners having monopolistic control of fee prices. If there was a very large amount of transactions though then a 1MB limit might restrict their potential profits, but if they are colluding anyway then they'd just manually increase the limit themselves. The fact is that if you control the hash power you control Bitcoin. 
Thankfully this level of collusion is practically impossible unless the group has some secret uber mining machine that stops anyone else mining a block. Also Bitcoin would die very quickly which would also disincentive miners from doing that.

You seem to misunderstand, if empty blocks are being mined, other miners will mine blocks at sizes that will clear the mempool asap in order to reap the fees asap. They can choose to mine a larger block whenever they like so long as its accepted by everyone else. 
Also miners could just reject to include transactions below a certain fee regardless of if the block is full or not, but if they do they run the risk of other miners accepting lower fees and thus getting more btc through larger volume.  
There is no situation where mining empty blocks is beneficial to a minority of the hash power in a dynamic blocksize world.  
There are legitimate arguments against BU but this (empty blocks) isnt close to being one of them.  
In regards to your separate point about feedback loops, basic competition theory shows us that without a strong and trusting cartel of a massive majority of hashing power, it would be impossible for the blocksize limit to be in benefit of the miner. Every time someone attempted to manipulate it to reap higher fees another will come along and take the short term benefit. 
So long as the barrier to entry for mining remains acceptably low there is nothing to worry about. 
Imagine if there was no blocksize limit, there would still be a fee market. Miners would only accept fees that covered operating costs, undercutting this would lead them out of business -&gt; lower mining difficulty -&gt; lower operating costs for mining -&gt; sustainable acceptance of lower fees. Even if miners were forced to fill every block, if only transactions with no fees were sent then no one would mine forcing fees to be introduced. 
What a lot of people have seemed to forget is that markets are natural and spontaneous, arising from the circumstances of demand and supply. Markets do not need to be set up or designed like many people have been acting. 
This isnt an argument against no blocksize limit, there are valid reasons for them. Its simply an argument against the idea that the limit needs to be set below the market equilibrium point in order to artificially prop up a higher fee market.

Firstly, thanks for the detailed reply, you have some legitimate points but its tied up in too much hyperbole and some invalid points. No too surprised i was immediately downvoted here for replying to someones "serious question"  
Segwit effectively increased the blocksize slightly, but its a one time effect and not enough for proper scaling. When i say i support 2mb + segwit i mean blocksize = 2mb + the x~1.7 scaling that segwit offers. The reason i dont support segwit first, HF later, is because core has failed time and time again to make any kind of compromise - everyone vaguely interested in the debate should know the history of it so i wont repeat the specifics here. I am unconvinced that post SW core will have any intention of a HF. Capitulating to their stubbornness only decreases the chance of on chain scaling and that is more important than segwit. Rather, if you are all so against BU/classic, and are so desperate for SW, why dont you want 2mb + SW now if you believe a HF will be necessary after? I would predict that 50-80% of BU supporters would switch clients in such a case, same with miners. 
As such BU/Classic ***is*** the only realistic option currently available to supporters of blocksize increase. You cannot HF without 51% hashing power, to suggest that we should HF ourselves and ignore mainchain is dumb, we believe in bitcoin, not alt-coins, so we will follow the networks rules as will most segwit supports if a BU fork is successful. 
There isnt $20 billion on the line, if BU successfully forks with buggy code that drops nodes for a few hours to a day we are talking about a few hundred thousand to a couple million in opportunity cost - no different to when Wall St suspended trading. There is no situation where buggy BU code would lead to the violation of bitcoins core security. Further, if im wrong and BU is such a threat then why arent core devs desperately pouring over the code and submitting pull req and BUIPs  left right and centre to fix it up. BU vs Core isnt a debating about coding, everyone knows core has better resources, coders, and QA, its a debate about economics and philosophy. Core's attempt to make it into the former is depressing. 
Lastly, BU code isnt the worst thing ever, it generally works and the vulnerabilities found so far have been very intricate requiring malicious attacks. The same is true with software companies worth billions of dollars like microsoft or tesla etc. Exploits and updates are to be expected, i just with BU had the same resources as core. My point about exploits wasnt about asking them to stop, but asking some non BU resources put into BU QA. Like it or not BU nodes are a significant part of the network so it should be in everyones interest that make sure that code is clean. 


i already addressed this point, it either isnt true or UASF doesnt exist. BU clients have just as much power as UASF clients. If UASF can go against the wishes of hash power then so too can BU clients.  This is the hypocrisy/poor arguments that i was talking about. 


not entirely sure i agree that most people see UASF as 'bad' but i understand your point. but; "Most people agree BU is bad, but are just frustrated that we are being held hostage by one dev team."
@_date: 2017-04-24 19:34:48
Not OP but   
a) bitcoin as money - while i have no problem with sidechains existing and being used organically, bitcoin at its core should be available for anyone and everyone as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. That requires bigger blocks
b) BU/classic is the only current option available - I'm not opposed to segwit as a technology, but remained unconvinced that core devs agree with a) and thus i will look for alternative dev teams until core delivers a convincing roadmap for blocksize increases. If tomorrow core released a client with 2mb + segwit i would switch over asap. 
c) regarding poor code - i am not going to abandon BU because it has worse QA than core, and nor should anyone. Any developer can code for any economic implementation, and if BU looked like it was in a position to successfully complete a hardfork then i would hope the entire community would work together to QA the code or write new EC clients, including core. Saying that, i would much prefer better code but some agents seem more interested in searching BU code for exploits they can attack rather than fix (which is bad for everyone).  
d) i see arguments that dont make sense - people here seem to be jumping on the UASF bandwagon under the idea that 'nodes (or at the economic majority) control the network, not miners' while at the same time arguing that BU is centralisation of power to miners. BU nodes have just as much power in controlling blocksizes as things like UASF - how much that power is i dont know, but a BU node can reject EB's at whatever size they choose. If this community is correct that nodes to have the power and a vast majority of users are in favour of small blocks then it would be no trouble for the network running EC software to reject any and all &gt;1mb blocks.

You mean scaling? 
Both subs are full of rants and discussion on an hourly basis, you definitely arent the only one posting about it. 
But segwit supporters see BU 'blocking progress' in the exact same way as BU supporters see core 'blocking progress'. 
Outside of luke-jr, you wont find many people on either side regularly suggesting that scaling isnt an immediate problem. The argument is what amount of scaling is needed, what the best technology is, and who should be doing it. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:40:29
I understand the logic of how a monopolist could increase fees, thats not my point. Mining might be slightly more centralised than you like but thats not the same as monopolisation, mining has actually been more centralised in the past. Monopoly is a economic term, not just descriptive of large market share.
To achieve this plan to increase the average fee would require massive collusion between a vast majority of miners - and that collusion would be very unstable. Reread my previous post more carefully and see how you can apply game theory to the situation. 
Regardless, empirically, if this was the case you'd see many more empty blocks and they would be coming equally from every mining pool.  It would be easier to just donate money directly to other mining pools than attempting this without a monopoly, because it would have the same effect.  
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:36:10
Right, yeah slightly different to what i was talking about. In this case it only works if there is a perpetually filling mempool that never clears. If the mempool does clear, those transactions can be confirmed with no opportunity cost by another miner. 
I still dont think this works though. The thing that keeps the mempool full is demand &gt; supply. However, miners will always take the largest fees regardless of how much the backlog is. The 'fake' transactions would have to have fees lower than that which will be included in a block, so at most it might effect the lowest fee transactions that arent time critical. For time critical transactions that need to be confirmed, say, within a day, demand is still naturally &gt; supply so the final equilibrium fee where demand = supply should not be much different between the natural market and the subverted market. 
its like going to a car auction and trying to raise the price above $40,000 but only bidding up to $30,000. The highest bidder isnt going to care about those bids 2-3 bids behind his. He just cares about his bit vs the next highest. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:29:06
nothing to do with asicboost, its just a special case where the miner found the next block before they could validate the previous block (ie they found the block almost immediately). You want to be pumping out blocks asap so instead of waiting for validation of the previous one (needed to inc transactions) their software will push out an empty block instead. 
Normally a block is found once every 10 mins so this isnt an issue for ~99.7% of blocks.
Further, as the miner reward continues to halve, and fees per block become bigger (though on-chain scaling), this becomes less likely as the fees will be worth more than the block reward. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:39:46

Not really, trust comes from decentralisation, not running a full node. 
Any private wallet can create a valid transaction, doesnt need to a node at all, let alone a full node. If you need a 3rd party block explorer to see your transaction you can trust it by looking at its competitors since the barrier to entry in exploring the blockchain is very low. 
If you reject that logic then running your own node its 100% trustless, since you have no idea if all the nodes you are connecting to arent colluding and sending you a fabricated blockchain. Only a 51% hash power miner can use bitcoin fully trustless since they will always know they are the longest valid chain. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:06:33
The game theory of this is just wrong, this might work if mining were monopolized, but currently the increased fees from lowering supply is less for an individual miner than taking the fees for that block. Essentially you have a free rider problem where the Nash equilibrium is to take the immediate fees. 
Elsewhere someone has posted the actual, technical reason for the empty block  
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:44:00


I dont think this is true. IIRC you get one chance to see the 12(?) word seed. What they are storing is the wallet.dat file with the private key strongly encrypted with your password. When you access the wallet, they just temp send you the file with all decryption being done on the user side. They have no ability to see your password or open your wallet, hence a hack of their servers wouldnt be a problem unless the hacker rewrote the website and collected user inputs
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:42:28
Yea, obviously. **Edit**, just realised the point was *trying* to make. On chain scaling lowers the fees of individual transactions but allows more of them. Hence the total fees per block will be higher. The market free of artificially low blocksize limits will determine the elasticity of demand.

Like 70% of the community yeah definately. Not getting 2mb + segwit was what pushed this whole debate over the edge and caused the surge in support for non core clients

Selfish mining only works if you think you can outpace the rest of the network, people talk about it like its free money but we dont see it because its inherently risky and basically gambling 
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:43:53
Flex transactions for starters. But i dont understand your point. Not many people think segwit is inherently a bad tech - there was a time on when that idea was being pushed but now its died down. 
The big problem is not malleability or 2nd layer atm, but on chain scaling. We (most BU supporters) are unconvinced that core is committed to, or even believes in, significant on chain scaling. Yes segwit is effectively a x1.7 blocksize increase - we all know that, but dont think its anywhere near enough outside the short term, and core isnt offering anything more. 2mb + segwit and we can start to talk again but until then BU ends this debate now, it is the nuclear option.

Segwit trolls are blocking EC because bitcoin poses a threat to the banking establishment. The growth of bitcoin in Tx/s will directly compete with current tech like visa and mastercard but with lower fees and more user control bitcoin will take over making banks irrelevant and eventually bankrupting them. This is just filler to make my linked comment longer and thus make the bullshit look more informed. This is why blockstream (which has a bank account) is a puppet of visa and seeks to destroy bitcoin from within by conning its users into stunting its growth. 
If you think i am bullshiting i can link you where blockstream has a bank account, i can show you them talking about bitcoin being a settlement layer between banks so only they can use the technology. I can post these quotes if you want me to. BU is the solution but the segwit trolls are blocking it so they can continue to play on the problems that BU fixes...

Did you just make a post with an anti-BU title, and the source for that title is your own comment in another sub, then get upvotes for it?
I gotta try this shit. 1 sec

Huh TIL. Can't see immediately why, but I'll read the paper when I have time

Explain how with UASF, non miner nodes can easily control the protocol if they have decent consensus, but those same nodes suddenly lose all their power when running EC? 
If a substantial number of user nodes are rejecting &gt;1mb blocks then its not in the miners best interest to continue pushing hash power to it, and if they do continue then their blocks are going to just be ignored by the rest of the network as no one will build on top of it. 
Either user nodes have power or they dont, its not magically different for UASF and EC

Doesnt that defeat the purpose of a brain wallet though? If your going to keep a random set of numbers written down just generate a random address.
A brain wallet shouldnt need to be written down and should be only stored in the brain - hence the name. Im trying to think of ways to make it even more secure 
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:40:14
You dont need the paper wallet's privet key to move bitcoins TO it, just FROM it. Also there is no such thing as using a prvt key offline, so you will have to make a new paper wallet every time you send funds with your current account to keep your current level of security.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:17:07
Bitcoins get added to a pool - bitcoins taken out of a pool
Because the bitcoins are different coins now, you cant trace them 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:59:27
I dont understand why people go to levels of encryption ect that they do not use on a day to day basis.
If the account was for safe keeping, whats wrong with an offline paper wallet? No passwords to remember, guaranteed security. Chuck it in a safe and you bitcoins will survive a fire. Plus is takes less than 10 mins to create.

Actually we kinda are... But rapture failed because it was a society - not just a economy - and thus it's fundamentals could change, something bitcoin doesn't need to worry about. Also they were all fucked up on a hallucinogenic magic sea slug.

Thats why i said you should pair this is a strong phase in order to get 'encryption'. Although i still understand your point and i by no means are arguing to use this in place of proper phases

Firstly, welcome to the Reddit family! (there is no escape)
Secondly, Thank you very much for your info. I just put an order through with them and the bitcoins just arrived! So 10/10 to them. I dont mind paying the extra 7.9% for the added security of knowing exactly what price your getting them at. 
Thanks once again for the info, and may the price of your coins rise ever more!

Namecoins are generated through the mining of BTC - i dont fully understand it but pools give you namecoins you mine from mining BTC - that i do know
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:37:15
If your that paranoid about security and loosing the wallet, you should consider an offline paper wallet they you can chuck into a safe - cant be hacked, cant be lost (unless you somehow loose a safe).
As for mining pool, any pool with over 5% total share of hashes will give you the same bitcoin return.
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:03:29
a paper wallet is nothing more than a private key printed on paper - so i dont quite understand what you are asking.
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:41:37
I suggest browsing There seems to be a few good posts regarding many of the questions you bring up.
@_date: 2013-10-21 07:55:09
Further, if this did become commonplace and bots did adjust to it then in one simple move we've doubled the pool these bots need to check, or in other words halved the number of phases they can check - and thats only with one level of this.

Make an offline paper wallet and print it as small as you can but still readable. Fold the paper and dip in in some latex to make a case. Add 2 more layers of latex.
Now make a SMALL incision just under the skin of your calf - it wont bleed that much and will be less noticeable and less likely to be damaged (calf muscle doesnt fold) insert your latex case and apply a band aid.
Send bitcoins to your new account through a mixer. If you do this right you wont even have a scar

The only threat caused by quantum computers is mining. Set a good well programmed quantum computer mining and you will have tera, may be even peta, hashes per second. 
The algorithm would have to be changed to one that it not just simple maths - which should not be too hard.
The problem is that first quantum computer that is made to mine bitcoin before the algorithm can be changed could have the hash power of more than the entire network

The Yogscast are one of the biggest Youtube channels (with almost 6.5 million subs on the main channel alone) and mostly feature minecraft series. This is from their yearly charity steam (this year raising money to buy cows for the poor in africa [hence the hat]).

Or you could just move it to a paper wallet generated offline. No password to remember and it will be more secure. Also the only way to loose your bitcoins would be if your hose burnt down, but a safe should fix that.
