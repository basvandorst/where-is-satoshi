Blaming Ulbricht for the deaths and addictions of those people is like blaming car manufacturers for car accidents. However, there was some talk that he hired hitmen to protect the site. The 'death' thing was brought up so the prosecutor could create a strawman out of Ulbricht and make him up to be a cold-blooded murderer. 
I'm not sure why he's in jail. I feel no safer having him off the streets unlike I would for many other people.

So? Drug users can do what they like. They do it to themselves. Ulbricht did not kill them. He made it possible for them to kill themselves. Just like tobacco, alcohol, guns, rope and bleach manufactures aren't blamed for the people that kill themself with them.

"Cash" is destroyed all the time. Most money in banks doesnt exist in the first place. The government has interest in stable currency. Monetary policy is about adding and removing money. That doesn't exist in bitcoin.

Spending money is good for the economy because goods and services being performed in large amounts is good for the economy. And goods and services are bought and paid for with currency.

There's a middle ground of course but everyone with any knowledge of economics knows savings are bad for the economy so of course the govt wants people to spend.
