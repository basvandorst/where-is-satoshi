GUSD isn't Bitcoin. You should edit your comment to reflect the truth.

He plainly stated that fluctuations don't matter - the boss will convert his USD earnings into BTC and distribute the BTC to OP.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:02:52
It's the equivalent of .1 btc
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:48:54
Perfect reply. The counter will be that what you wrote still isn't any "backing" at which point the argument ends.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:59:09
I'm done 
@_date: 2019-07-31 20:36:23
Was someone advising OP to deposit BTC or GUSD to BlockFi? BTC. You cited a passage regarding GUSD deposits, which has nothing to do with OP's situation. Perhaps it is you who should be re-reading. Cheers &amp; Checkmate!

Sadly if it goes to 1 million you won't be able to say you were there for the greatest transfer of wealth in history™

Every time an innovator does something like this involving bitcoin it gets stronger and stronger. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:57:01
You ever been to @_date: 2017-12-05 12:22:53
Because you were never inside the banks
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:18:45
That's insane...
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:39:07
Now I'm confused I forget what I was thinking but check this out
Bitcoin has 8 decimal places
.00000001 is the smallest unit of Bitcoin, affectionately called a Satoshi or a sat
.00100000 would be 100k bits or sats. Not sure why OP said that costs 1k USD it's more like 10 usd.
Also dont understand why he introduced the millibit distinction, and don't think it's necessary. The current model is to just use sats as I described or bitcoin.
But im pretty sure he means that 100k sats will get you a lambo in the future
@_date: 2017-08-27 02:52:50
And pay taxes on whatever else he cashed out. Stupid man.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:02:58
Absolutely. Just start researching. There are healthy profits to be made with many coins.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:14:42
Well it depends it could still seem worth it if you think the value of a coin has room to move.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:06:32
Really succinct example. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:16:39
I wasn't being dismissive - there's just so many angles that it's hard to give a specific answer
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:37:09
The clapback is so real
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:23:10
Usually if Bitcoin is on a downturn the other coins follow.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:06:35
Convince yourself 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:49:49
If you made your own more expensive currency with no other features beyond that, then no one would buy it and it would be illiquid. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:05:55
Exactly. That's the awe inspiring essence of a deflationary currency.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:43:17
Personally I think 1 BTC will be absolutely life changing in a decade.
If you distributed the existing bitcoins using the current distribution of wealth, then the people in the top .001% would each have .67 bitcoins. Let that sink in.

The force controllers must also slide forward and backward to symbolize the price range. Right now you can only visualize the pressure on the price.
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:29:48
so do the inverse of those gifs? it does sound stupid but markets are just aggregated opinion so it makes sense
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:36:47
It's called BITCOIN CASH man
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:06:53
The force itself is, yeah
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:16:11
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:57:52
Lel, thanks for this man
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:59:42
I honestly don't know. I can form intuitions about the macro scale, but predictions on the micro scale are largely a fools errand.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:09:20
Not to mention it would be a huge catalyst for other retailers. You think they aren't watching Amazon like hawks for any signs of "doing something right"? Amazon is leading online retail and even crushing b and m retail - other companies know this and will break necks trying to keep up.
If amazon accepts Bitcoin, watch how many companies follow.

Miners will receive tx costs as rewards.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:53:01
A few reasons. The self fulfilling prophecy of a dip being necessary, coupled with the real psychological barriers associated with passing 5k per. And now, the icing on this crumbling cake is the Chinese government banning ICOs - remember, the threat of a government squashing this infantile cryptocurrency space is a very real one. It might be the case that China sets a precedent. What then? Well if the US followed suit then this rocket ride would certainly fail to launch with any haste.
Not spreading FUD, just trying to look at why the price is dropping and how else it might continue to drop.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:36:00
Love it. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:46:59
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:35:58
Yes. Imagine that the coins are linked to the private seed. The wallet acts as a display for a seed - displaying what is attached to the seed, if you will. 
Edit - I know it seems weird. So try this to prove it to yourself. Send a small amount to a new wallet. Write down the new wallet's private seed. Delete the wallet. Make a new wallet and recover the seed. Your original amount will appear in the new new wallet, proving that the coins are linked to the private seed, not the wallet itself.
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:24:33
Right. Good points.
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:26:46
I am not so sure about your absolutes - buying property seems like an example of buying space more than it is an example of buying time.
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:25:36
I know who you were responding to.
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:09:19
Definitely not an example of that fallacy. OP made some kind of false equivalency/hindsight error 
*OP that you responded to
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:13:22
Really nice point.
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:19:11
Yeah, I know who you were responding to. The gambler's fallacy is that one thing hasn't happened in a while, therefore it must happen soon, or vice versa. That's not what his comment implied at all. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:38:37
*spongebob mock meme*
Fair enough. It may be worth some optimism though.
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:09:41
Dude hold up. If that wallet can be recovered with a seed, it's possible. Just read an article about a guy who found the dictionary of choices for the sia wallet seed. He used that and some clever programming to crack a wallet that had one word missing. Obviously your order would be much taller, but if you could find the dictionary of possible seed words and then use some brute forcing you could probably get the wallet back and pay the people who helped you do it. Just a thought.
