This isnt really what its for though...
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:51:45
You can only hope someone gives some to you and then you can find out ;)
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:02:18
Ah yes. I had closed it for about a week. Thats why its needing to synch. again. Thanks again!
EDIT: Will I still be able to use it while synching or must I wait?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:53:49
Because there is a limited amount of bitcoins, if you introduce a great deal of new individuals to it, it will insanely raise in price. Sounds great right? However because of this, noone will want to buy products with it, and is just going to hoard it (invest) until they want to sell. 
It would be great for it to be more accessible, but you have to think of consequences too though
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:15:15
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:06:54
Can someone imgur it so we can look on our phones?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:06:45
I believe you need a wallet to store it, and that gives you your "address". So i dont know how it would work
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:02:25
this is all over again.
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:15:42
Why not use to tip reddit users with good comments instead?

Weve yet to go through the Bull trap yet, which is bound to happen.

Im sure hes lurking and will upvote you
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:13:57
Hopefully it rebounds quickly with all this publicity
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:20:45
Im confused why this is being downvoted.. Just trying to help out. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:19:07
Basically its going to look like its rebounding or recovering, but its really not and will keep crashing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:45:49
Okay thanks a lot. Do you know how often it has to "synchronize"?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:42:03
Depends on the site usually
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:13:35
This really needs to be read by many more people. If it starts to become common place to use then to buy items, then it will stabilize very nicely
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:21:49
Okay, thank you, I wasnt too sure on everything and didnt know if I had to go to a certain place to get my address or if this was it. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 19:16:45

I will try to add more as I encounter them! If anyone knows of any other free sources just let me know and I will edit it
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:27:06
Okay I will definitely encrypt it. Is there a best or special way required to back it up?
