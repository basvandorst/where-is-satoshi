Looks very good, only real remark is that fact that things are unlikable atm. As a vendor I cant link to my page on duo so people can see my store trough the web. 
Typing  does work, but no representation of this in the url field. Url parameters is a must like. 
    
    ?listing={listing_id}
    ?search=[search terms]
    ?vendor={vendor_gui or onename id}
This way I could link like this
    
Otherwise great job !!

That's the thing, I'm not sure the demand for the actual mempool would lower by much. I see LN adding other use cases for bitcoin, therefore taking some transactions of the chain, but at the same time adding transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:26:44
True but their whole push for an increase was a better user experience (aka cheaper) for their users. Therefore it would make sense they also invest in LN once it is deployed and tested.

My problem rn with lighting is I don't see it fixing the current volume we need to support. All the transactions I'm currently making are the kind that won't work on  the LN network (to an exchange and back).
Sure LN will make it possible to do many transactions of low value to start buying coffee. But we will still have a lot of volume that will have to go on the base layer 1 of bitcoin I think.

Is it wrong to assume IF 90% of miners vote for bigger blocks, we can assume other 'non miners' can handle bigger blocks also. (This assumes a 90% consensus needed for a doubling) Meaning the throughput of the lowers 10% of miners decides if blocks get bigger. 
The increase is limited to doubling and average blocks should be filled if I remember correctly. Meaning at each state the network capacity can be doubled, only if the current capacity is almost filled and miners agree they can handle the extra traffic. This seems like a very neat system to me.  
Also when block rewards drop and fees become more important, miners can decide to build up fee pressure by not letting the cap be raised. If they decide bigger blocks are needed they can do so. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:38:52
Why would you change the blockversion to match the one of XT? If you are a miner and are sending out the XT bock version, your voting for the XT change. Or am I wrong here?
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:36:04
This, and there was no screaming contest or something which happens too often. 
Edit: Spelling
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:33:33
If you just don't vote for the increase, nothing will happen so no need to start a divorce. 70% consensus won't be reached and all stays the same. Why start a fighting divorce if you can settle the debate a 2/3 majority system and continue from that. No point of jumping of a bridge...
I do see some problems with letting only miners decide on this consensus and not all nodes. But so far no real solution is proposed that can fix this.

Thanks for the post learned something new about how multisig works when using multiple BIP32 keys.

Yes both will have to scale. The basic blockchain needs to grow to support layer 2. Layer 2 will be used by most for the daily transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:29:27
I just imagine if you withdraw from the exchange itself, it would open up a LN channel to your wallet. Now you have an open channel from the beginning you control the bitcoins yourself. 
Exchanges LN nodes will be connected to other exchanges, payment processors like Bitpay etc... This way your funds will easily be spendable from day 1.

I find it a useful service for people wanting to store their bitcoin valued at the current market rate, without being force to go trough an exchange and let their money sit there to be able to spend it in bitcoin later. (Which come with some high fees)
They should integrate with changetip to let people who don't really want to own bitcoin, peg it to a currency. Basically an 'Store Bitcoin as USD' option. Then when someone tips you a dollar in bitcoin, the value will still 'a dollar in bitcoin' the next month. You can get a taste of the functionality behind bitcoin without the volatility risks. Seems like a good deal.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:27:55
But why would you force 2 chains by doing this? You create instability in the system and hurt the value of the chain you are mining. If you just don't vote for bigger blocks, it wont happen because the threshold wont be reached. 
30% could block the increase without any damage to the system so why should you do it?
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:47:44






The extension blocks seems like a very complicated solution to me. Manly because of the work needed at a wallet level. Their is a lot of these wallets around and testing/updating UI's is a lot of work needed to be done by a lot of people. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:42:16
Also if you read the sidechain paper, it seems this will also help big miners with good connections. Because sidechains use a merged mining model. Only the big miners who can support all the chains, get the best return for their mining power. If you got a bad connection you might be at a disadvantage because your rewards are less.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:24:51
What is the advantage of a sidechain with 1MB blocks and a 2MB block bitcoin chain. Seems to me if I want to run both (and use both) I will spend the same amount of resources .

@_date: 2015-06-11 14:44:45
I don't think so. What they do is let you sell bitcoin for USD. Then they aggregate all sell/buy action from all users and make sure their books are balanced. To if much more BTC was sold, they need to sell some on the market to avoid the risk. 
Sending value between your card is indeed an off chain transaction. But if you send bitcoin to somewhere else, it will over the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:19:28
Well at least their is a paper with a well defined idea. We can have some discussion around it, improve some of the ideas and then implement is.
Also the implementation of this seems reasonable to implement and not something like the lightning network which will take much longer or the extended blocks idea. (Which I can't find any real proposal for atm)
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:35:52
Also missing the full technical explanation here so we can form an opinion of our own. Not just based on reddit comments...  
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:01:03
Interesting but this assumes 51+% of miners colluding on faking to support the XT chain while in reality not accepting bigger blocks. This only works if they colluding knowingly, otherwise everyone things the miners are agreeing to the XT fork and will be forced to start accepting the bigger blocks. 
Now if we have 51% of the miners colluding on something, the higher orphanrate doesn't seem like the worst problem at that time.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:18:29
Will you be running a full node if you don't use it anymore because the fees are to expensive on the main blockchian, and everyone is using layer 2 solution's like lightning network? What are the incentives for regular users when running a node doesn't offer you anything at all? This seems a big problem to me in this whole debate. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:25:58
So I was thinking if you could hide the fees in the spot price calculations when you don't consider the possibility to withdraw in fiat. Scenario is as follows.
Real spot price is 250 with a 10% spread, BR uses a 'fake spread' of 1% below the real spot. Then there is a 10% value increase of bitcoin to 275 keeping the spread and 1% fake spread.
-5% | Face Spot -1% | Real Spot | +5%
237,5 | 247,5 | 250 | 262,5
261,25 | 272,25 | 275 | 288,75
    At Real Spot Price 
    Sell 1 BTC  = 250$
    Buy back  = 0,90909090
    At Fake Spot Price
    Sell 1 BTC  = 247,5$
    Buy back  = 0,90909090
    Difference real vs fake spot = 0
Because you’re always doing the conversion back to BTC, it wouldn't even matter if they have a face spot price. So if the spot price doesn’t fluctuate from the real price of BTC then no money is to be made this way. If they did have a fluctuation 'fake' spot price this will hurt them at one of both ends of the conversion.
Is my reasoning correct here or am I missing something obvious?
@_date: 2015-06-21 22:39:27

@_date: 2015-06-12 15:39:25
Capping the raise seems like a neat solution. Only let it double each 6 month after the last doubling. Only problem I see a single big miner could keep the limit down by not upping his soft limit. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 16:49:10
When they talk about the blockchain they always talk about the possibilities and the security of it all. The biggest problem of all is you need bitcoin to make it secure and the immutability of the ledger (which is the whole point) to work.
 To secure this ledger you need hashing power to protect it. Big banks could run their own 'blockchain' based on a other token for sure. But then you need trust again to step into this system. The point of bitcoin is you don't need trust, it secures itself due to the build in intensives for mining and everyone sharing this ledger for many applications.
 
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:57:01
Ok thank, makes sense. So lightning would be a perfect solution for every person to open a challenge each day, and only need to 'commit' to the blockchain once a day when the channel closes.
But a fee still needs to be paid at the end. Meaning if blocks are so full each the transaction costs 1$, even the lightning network becomes expensive and bitcoin become a service you use for a daily fee. Meaning we still need an increase of the bitcoin blocksize to manage the average transaction cost. 
Lightning network also breaks the promise of receiving your money instantly. Now you need to wait till the channel closes before you can spend your coins again.
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:38:20
Any source for the real proposal, because I can't seem to find any actual layout of the system with or without any explanation. 
But I do think this would work in a seamless way for a user. If your wallet is on a 8MB chain and I am on the original 1MB chain. Can I send you funds to your address? Can I receive from your 8 chain wallet?
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:18:10
To me it seems simple. If 90% of the miners vote for higher blocks then it seems 90% of them can handle the bigger blocks. It seems reasonable to me if the miners can do it. The other non mining node runners will be able to follow.
Also it is not because the limit is 10MB we will have 10MB blocks. You need the transactions to fill them. 
Someone here also suggested to make a increase (doubling) only possible if the average of a certain amount of blocks if over 70% full. Using this system you have a lot of factors managing the increase
- The limit can only be raised if we see consistent almost full blocks over a certain period in time. This way the bitcoin users also have a small vote because the market would need to make demand for bigger blocks.
- 90% of miners need to vote for higher blocks, which means they can handle the traffic, then we could assume the other nodes could also handle it. 
- Limit the increase to doubling means we will fall from 70+% blocks to 35%+ blocks. Which seems high enough to have a reason to pay fees, definitely in peek hours where transactions may rise. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:21:13
Might be a good idea to put a limiter on it so we don't increase the block size if their is no demand for it. Lets say an average of 70% full blocks need to be reached before the limit can increase.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:38:13
I like the idea I must say. The fees are reasonable and if it helps cover costs and development this is perfect. 
You can see it as these free apps on your phone. In stead of running adds and f*ing up the UI. You get charged micro amounts like a dev would have from the add revenue. Don't like it just overspend (like buying the pro version) and continue.
This is also the model we want to praise for bitcoin in the future where you don't see adds on news sites but get charged micropayments. It is the definition of a value for value model and I see no reason it wouldn't work for software.
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:24:20
Regarding the your latest point about the fees. They are still charging commission if your account isn't verified. Once verified the fee for btc to fiat will be 0%. BTC to other things like gold/silver will still have the fee.
No insurance is of course a big problem, seems to me for fiat money some insurance shouldn't be a problem to obtain. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:55:11
So your idea is BIP 100 buys us time, while the extension blocks are the real solution?
I think this BIP might be the correct way to go for now, while we build things like the lightning network to solve the scaling issue as it might be more efficient to the extended block solution in regards to scalebility and speed. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 09:33:13
So your view on bitcoin is it can be used by anyone, also people with very bad internet connections, while the lightning network will be run by the VISA capable internet connections?
@_date: 2015-06-20 10:00:52


Interesting, I hope we do see some more BIP/discussion on how to do this. Only real development on a solution seem to be the 8MB proposal and BIP100. Hope some brainstorming is being done on other proposals.
It seems enough people want an increase, so it is now just finding a solution that protect the weakest entities of the system and getting consensus. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:36:56
Hope they also update their app a little bit so it can be used for a POS system. Biggest problem now is I don't see a way to hide the balance on the wallet. You don't want to show the costumer all the money that is hidden on the address, even if its only a watch only Xpub.
@_date: 2015-06-21 12:02:09
Would like to see this also. An increase seem to be needed but this proposal has no real limiters put on the increase. BIP100 seems to fix these concerns and want to see some feedback from Mike and Gavin on this one.

blockchain.org with 2FA enabled and second password for sending seems the safest option to me. Even safer compared to electrum on a online pc. If you get a keylogger on your system you'll out of luck with electrum. You can go safer with electrum on a offline pc but this can be to much overhead for normal peaple.
2FA is a must tho. Otherwise their is no point. Also enable it on you email because your backup is send to your mail so this needs to be protected to.
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:56:18
A real bank safe sound secure to me. And maybe pick a random book on your shelve for the backups. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:58:09
Online banking here in belgium is also protected using 2FA using a piece of hardware and your bankcard. Basically forcing 2FA for everyone. Every transaction also needs to be signed.
Most bitcoins that get stolen is because people don't protect them enough. Online/no 2 factor...
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:09:03
It's like agreeing on the use of the length of 1 meter. We still use km as the measure for long distances.
We just switch to a new base unit. From BTC to 1/1,000,00 of a bitcoin being a bit. If we like talk about large number we use kBit (easy for daily use). And MBit for our current BTC.
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:34:32
3 is mainly fixed by wallet providers offering default good security like 2FA and thing like the hardware wallet. A ledger HW1 cost 15$ if I recall and you will be safe from mallware and hackers. It isn't that hard but the setup needs to become as easy as using a paypal account if it is something that needs to break trough in the mainstream. The online banking system here in Belgium also uses a hardware device to generate codes with your bank card. So for many people here, they understand some hardware may be needed for full security. 


I don't think this is problem for a lot of people using changetip to send tips. But I could imagine if you are an artist on soundcloud and you receive tips to your account. It would be nice to see their is an option to 'opt out' of the volatility without using any functionality of the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:26:50
Only problem for me with coinkite but I understand why they do this. If you would have access to the keys then you can just use the wallet like a normal one even as a free user. And coinkite is not a free service. 
Also they don't want to give you they keys and then when your funds got stolen you come complain to them. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 19:56:32
Thanks the seed is indeed the base for all other possible derivatives to basically all signing services could use this.


Greenaddress does state a "Write to hardware wallet" feature in the settings. I'll see if I can find out trough support what exactly this does. If this just writes the seed from greenaddress to the trezor, the security of trezor is destroyed because the seed has been 'seen' by an outside computer.

I would also like the full switch to use **bits** as the base unit of 1/1.000.000 of a bitcoin. 
BUT at the same time stop using BTC as a unit and **fully switch to bits**. Meaning:
    1 MBit (1BTC) = 1,000 kBits = 1,000,000 Bits
This would make it easy to to represent prices of normal day priced items. A 5$ item would be 9.74 kBits. Making it extremely easy to value object. If price surges we can start putting prices in bits. The main difference is we keep the base unit of bits. It seems easier to think of something that is x1000 (kBits) then something 1/1000 (mBTC).
This also had the advantage that switching will be very easy. Just switch from BTC to MBit for a lazy implementation. This will help with the initial switch of all software on a bit-day.
**Everyone can pick the type of representation they want, but the base unit 'bit' is used by all.** 
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:00:07

Most of the concerns about the blocksize increase seem to be around bandwidth. But data is data so how is lightning helping with this?
If everyone is using the lightning network and I want to run my onn nodes for a non trust less system, I should run a bitcoin node and a lightning one. 
If bitcoin itself is expensive to use on the original 1mb blockchain, what are the intensives to run a full node? To me it seems none. Won't this hurt the decentralization more then with bigger blocks?

It depends your view of bitcoin. I do see a market for sites like this that can give you extra benefits.

[X-post from Just wanted to share an idea I had for allowing sellers to use OpenBazaar without being exposed to the bitcoin price swings, which may be a problem for small margins sales. Big seller have inventory's in USD so they can't risk a price swing of fund locked in escrow for 1 week. Problem gets bigger with high price swings.
Solution might be a 'USD' locking escrow / smart contract which will charge 120% for the item at current price (using Bitpay API). Then when funds are release the transaction will be published so that seller gets the agreed upon value in USD, and seller gets returned the rest of the payment. If the seller uses a bitpay donation address as his payment address, he can then be sure x% of the payment will converted to USD.
A feature like this will help with sellers with offering their everyday items without much risk of losing a penny due to price swings.
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:31:55
So quite close if you want to store 10BTC (163.6$  / year) at current rate. But this will only cover you upto 5000 pound value. Everything above that is not secure. 
And I'm not willing to put more money in an online vault if they have control over the private keys and they won't be liable if it gets stolen.

Yeah I do. But if you can figure out how to buy Bitcoin I think you also have the skills required to secure these steps. 
I do believe we will see web wallets with great security to become the norm for the normal user. Something like the workings of how online banking works. 
They send you a yubikey or something similar you will need for loggin in and sending money. Then also have a mobile wallet witch can spend with just a pin code for amount upto something you can set. (50$ sound like a good thing) If the amount is bigger you will need the yubikey + pin code to sing the transaction.
Maybe even a third level of security for your 'vault'. This is a manual process from cold storaga at the bank and takes 48h so in case of a breach you can still reverse it by phoning the company.
Just some idea's
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:21:53
I like this the best. Switch to bit as base unit but use kBit as the daily use. Also change BTC to MBit in all software for making the full switch. For daily use we can indeed just use the kBit like you proposed. If we reach 10000$/MBit then we drop the kBit for Bit.
    1 MBit (1BTC) = 1.000 kBits = 1.000.000 Bits 
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:22:36

Credit  on bitcointalk for back of the envelope calculation 
    Left half of the room: 6x6x16x18 = 10368 mining boards
    Right half of the room: 6x6x19x18 = 12312 mining boards
    
    = 22680 boards (assuming 100% occupancy on all racks/rows as shown in close pics)
    
    So if each board is like the batch 3 product boards then they should be apparently 750 GH/s each
    
    So 22680 * 750 GH/s = 17010000 GH/s = 17010 TH/s = 17.0 PH/s
    
    The current total network hashrate estimate is: 55.5 PH/s (
    
    So following the assumptions I've made for these calculations, this room would accommodate 30.6% of the total network's hashrate.

If it is used to create both signatures, is it then possible to recover my account with the mnemonic seed if I lose my 2FA or will you still nog sign of on the second transaction.
Also it it possible to get a bitcoin receiving address starting with a 1? Because some apps don't allow sending to p2sh adresses.

I don't see this happening. It breaks one of the most important things about bitcoin. The fact that all bitcoins are created equal. If this isn't the fact anymore it loses all his value imo. Because of that I don't think it will be implemented because just imagine the drop of value it will cause.

The seed (and possible password) or all you need to ever restore the wallet. So even if your tresor breaks you can use an other wallet like electrum to recover your funds.
You could indeed create a seed and send funds to it for long time storage. Then wipe the trezor and create a new seed for your normal use.
Only problem is that switching between them takes a some time. You need to grab the seed from your secure location. And restore the trezor with your desired seed. This proces takes 10 min if you do it safely. So not the ideal solution but it is possible.
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:52:55
For using it as a hot wallet it is the safest option imo. If you enable 2FA and second sending password.
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:11:34
A hash is a way to get data A to a string of characters B. Going from A to B is very easy and fast. But going from B to A is hard/impossible. 
This means you can prove very fast this document is the hash you can find in the blockchain but it will be hard to get your file by reading the hash in the publicly available blockchain.

I would buy a trezor. You just need to write down a seed to keep everything safe. Put this seed into a safety deposit box and your set.
For extra security you can also use a password with the Trezor. Each password creates a new account on the Trezor so you can have different passwords for your savings/spending wallet.
For convenience I would use a android wallet like greenaddress.it with 2FA enabled for daily use and on the go.

Some copany's in the Netherlands just ask a premium for paying with certain payment options. Recently ordered something and the payment using paypal was 0.50 cent + 3% extra. Bank transfer or iDeal was the regular price. 
I personally think this is the way to go. This offers more transparency to the customer of the cost of the payment provider they chose. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:54:31
If you use the advanced option of using a passphrase this isn't necessary. Both will be needed to have access to each account. So for each account you'll need the corresponding password. 
Maybe put the password of the 'honeypot' in the safe so possible robbers will steal these bitcoins and you'll be aware of the theft.

Colored coins are always still normal bitcoin. The only difference is that compatible wallets will be able to verify that these are colored coins and they shouldn't be used in normal transaction. 
If you want to use them just uncolor them inside your wallet and the wallet wont protected the coins from being included in normal transactions

It's much easier to go to bits and also use kBit and MBit.

Depnding on the amount of bitcoin you want to store you have different options. Everything under 5BTC is safe to store online in a wallet like  ,  ... **if 2 Factor Autentication is enabled** with a good password. Mycelium for android ( is also a good option for your daily/spending hot wallet.
For everything more you'll have 2 options left.
1. Use a hardware device like Trezor (buytrezor.com). This is the easiest and most secure option. It has many features and can be backed up using a list of random words. Keep these words safe and you'll bitcoins will always be backed up. A big disadvantage is the initial cost. But it will be a good investment imo.
2. The next option only requires an USB stick. Create a liveUSB to create a mallwarefree / offline OS. ( 
    Boot into the OS and install the electrum wallet ( At this point turn of the network functionality of Ubuntu. From this point on this will be an **offline OS**. 
    Launch electrum and create a wallet and write down the seed. Take a second usb and export the master public key from inside electrum. Shut down ubuntu and go to your regular OS
    Also install electrum and click on create seedless wallet by importing the master public key. At this point you can create new addresses and view your balance at your online pc. If you want to send fund you'll have to create a transaction on your online pc and store it on a usb. Then boot to the offline liveUSB. Sign the transaction. Go back to the online pc and broadcast it.
    It is a slow process if you don't have a second laptop. But it is the only safest way to do it. The Trezor hardware wallet does basically the same thing but will safe you minutes in doing a transaction.
Some notes on other options. 
* Use of Armory Wallet might also be good. But this requires running a full bitcoin node and is overkill for most people. Only look into it if your going to store A LOT of bitcoins. Armory Wallet also needs to be used with an offline PC/liveUSB
* Paperwallets is also an option if you want to store bitcoins in a physical medium. These wallets also need to be created on a offline PC/liveUSB. You can create multiple small wallets and load them when needed to your online hot wallet. Mycelium has support for this feature. 
Endnote: Remember that if you make a backup of you keys/seed to never put it on a online pc unencrypted. If you want to create a encrypted file with the seeds stored in them, remember to do this on a liveUSB that nevers connect to to internet. Otherwise you can't guarantee its safety.

@_date: 2014-01-31 13:43:12
Sorry to hear that. This is indeed a problem people don't realize the backup is even more vulnerable if it is just used by and email or dropbox. At this point a keylogger is enough to gain access to your account. 
Imo this should be made more clear when you make the backup with blockchain. If you want to reach the best security for your bitcoin I still suggest blockchain for small amount and paper wallets for all the rest :)

The added value of the extra step is going trough a global payment system. This allows the splitting of service used by the buyer and the seller. 
- You send me a payment through Coinbase-US
- I receive this payment through BitPay-Kenya
This has the benefit that the service used doesn't need to exist in the place of the recipient or sender. Company's can then just earn money on the exchange spread. Resulting in low fees. 
This basically builds an westren union type system consisting of different company's. Because it is now viable to start such a service in a single country, completions should increase. Today their is no point in creating a PayPal like system that only works in a single country.
**BUT** I do see your point. This are still more steps. But the lower fees could push businesses to use this kind of system. Once they receive bitcoins through something like bitpay. And start paying suppliers in China using Coinbase. They can cut out both middlemen and getting a smooth transaction form the old monetary system to the new. (One can only hope)

Is your iPhone rooted and installed any apps recently? I think some apps can read your text messages so it is possible their exist a malicious app that can read you 2FA codes. 
Their was someone else lately who had 2FA enbabled through sms and it turned out it was most likely a backup that was compromised. Is 2FA also enabled on the service you used to make the bockchain bakcup? 
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:38:37
Hi have a little question
I see your service as a good alternative in the long run. A wallet that acts more like an online banking solution with some good security.
You got 2FA witch is good but I'm looking for something that will protect me if someone steals my phone and gets my password from transferring all my savings. I don't think this is an offer at the moment but I might have a feature request/idea
Balance in your 'Bitcoin Checking' works like a normal online wallet. Idea is you only put in maximum of 2BTC in that wallet. The other wallet 'Bitcoin Savings' is time locked. This is what I understand under time locking


I understand that this is problem if you need to pay a huge amount you might need to wait 24h but Time is the strongest security you can have against hackers. 
This is a service that would be worth the 10$/month for the ultimate balance between security/ease of use
Hope you consider it :)

You're not ensured if someone steals your credentials and transfers the bitcoin out. So if they don't have a systems that limits someone form transvering all the bitcoin at once from your account. This still isn't a safe option for huge amounts of bitcoin.

It seems normal to me they don't allow the buying and selling of bitcoin in their app store applications. It would be possible to subvert their 30% cut on in app purchase if people could buy bitcoins and then use them to send to devs to unlock app features.

@_date: 2014-01-04 13:08:06
**My words of wisdom**
**All good security should at least have 2 breakpoints to be breached**. To get to your coins you'll have to have a **physical breach**. (Access to your paper wallet, access to your phone for 2FA...) or a **data breach** (your password/wallet file). Physical security is the best imo but you'll need to watch out that you have thought of all scenarios. A cold paper wallet is nice but if you don't encrypt the private key you only have one point of failure. Also remember you can lose a paper wallet so might be a good idea to have a copy of it stored in different location (aka one at home and one in a bank vault/friends house)
I like this explanation from OP but it kind of paranoid for like normal expenses. One of the most easiest way to protect yourselves is to use different levels of security demanding of the amount of coins you will hold in it.
Splitting up your holdings is also a good idea. Even if something fails you'll still have some of your coins safe in other places.
**Hot Wallet Level upto 1 BTC**
This is just the hot wallet online using blockchain.org to store upto. I use this to track all wallets as watch-only and do all my standard payments without any problem. This is already great for security if you just do the following steps
* Enable 2 Factor Authentication
* Enable second password to spend
* Remember blockchain sends a email with your wallet file to your email so also enable 2FA on your email account. (Even make a new gmail address or something just for blockchain.org wallet)
This is already quite safe and even if you get a keylogger on your system you have some protection by the 2FA.
**Bank Level upto 10 BTC**
To make my live easy I use electrum for this level. This is kind of my own Bank account/ATM. Only need to access it for big payments or to fill up my hot wallet. 
Creating the wallet
* Boot into Linux Live Cd on USB stick
* Install electrum
* Turn of internet in linux. At this point this OS installation wont connect to the internet anymore for full security. 
* Create wallet and write down seed (this is your backup of your wallet in just 12 words.)
* Create seedless wallet (seedless wallet can generate new addresses but cant spend form them)
* Install electrum on you hot/daily pc and use seedless wallet.
Now you can just use your daily pc to generate addresses for you electrum wallet and can view the balance. If you want to spend form you'll need to boot into the Linux Live CD to sign the transaction created using the hot wallet on your daily pc. The steps are explained here 
This is already almost impossible to be hacked as the hacker had to have access to your usb live cd (fysical breach) and know the password of the wallet (data breach).
**Cold storage**
The rest of your holdings should go into cold storage using paper wallets created offline. You can create this using the steps explained in this post.

Ok let's say I want to invent a coin that will be used for entrance tickets to an event I'm holding.
- Make a bitcoin address that will be the maker of colored coins and send bitcoin to this address (1). This address will be the only one that can color coins that are associated with a particular color.
- Use the bitcoins and color them. (2) In this example I created 100 TTC coins which are in fact fractions of bitcoin that are colored so the wallet will show them as TTC coin in stead of 0.0000001 BTC. 
- I can now sell these TTC coins to the people who buy a ticket for my event. If they can prove they own the TTC coin they can enter. If you want to sell you ticket of give it to a friend. Just send the TTC coin to him and he can use it to enter.
- Creating/sending coins just cost a single bitcoin transaction. 
Important to remember is that you trust the issuer. I can just use it

IMO it is just better to make some paper wallets witch you encrypt with a password (Put it somewhere safe so you wont forget after a year not needing the password). Then just go to your bank an rent a vault their. I think I pay around 50€ each year for mine with all the paper wallets. Maybe also make a backup you can hide somewhere at home for extra security.
If you don't trust paper you can always laminate it to protect it against water damage. This is fairly easy to do and you will save a huge amount of money.

Well if you buy something for 100 + 20% VAT is cost yourself 120.
If you sell this item for 200 you will receive 240 (including VAT).
The 40 extra VAT you need to give back at the government. But you can get the 20 back you paid for the same item. Meaning you only owe the government 20. Which is 20% of the Value you created (buy @ 100 sell @ 200 = 100 value added).
This way you only pay a tax on the value you created = Value Added Tax (VAT)

    1 MBit (1BTC) = 1.000 kBits = 1.000.000 Bits

I mostly go for the following explenation.
Think of the bitcoin network as a whole lot of safety deposit boxes labeled by numbers (public keys). Users have wallets on their computer containing the keys to these boxes. If a user A want to transfer money to user B. He creates an message for the bank(the bitcoin network) to transfer the money from box A to box B. User A needs to sign this message by proving he has the correct key in his wallet for box A. The bitcoin network is the entity that controls that users only transfer bitcoins between boxes if they own the correct key for that box.
I think this is mostly correct and also help to understand that bitcoins don't exist on your devices. They only exist on the public ledger and you have the control to move them using your private key

kBit is indeed the thing we would like to use best. But to make the switch smooth (and easy for current developers) is the easy option to also allow MBit. In time all can switch to kBit for easier visualisation.
Most important is making the switch across the board with a small base unit of 'bit'
    BTC  --&gt; MBit (Easy fast fix current software)
    mBTC --&gt; kBit (Daily Use)
    uBTC --&gt;  Bit (Base unit and Future proof)
Smalles unit can still be kept as a satochi and whould work once we start using the Bit as the daily used unit.

Oh so the memeric key can work the same as electrum seed. But the associated private keys are used in 2 ways.
* Use private key of the 1/2 part of the 2of2 multisig
* Use private key with single public address to as be spend after certain nTime
I like the 2/2 concept. The ability to set a limit of spending without 2FA is nice and the time limited feature that is planned seems interesting to. It give the wallet provider the possibility to offer extra security if they see weird transactions from your account.  Possibly needing a 3FA to be even more secure for transactions over certain limits.

Yep exactly
And if you have a fully unique and strong password, and also don't store it online you will be safe. I personally like paper wallets because I can make lot of small once of about 0,5BTC. If I need some BTC I can just unload the balance of just 1 and keep the other once safe.

They should implement a system to link your openBazaar to eBay profiles. Like a certain code you should put on your eBay profile to verify the link. This would help to create the initial trust for sellers already using eBay at the moment.

Assume that every country has their own type of circle, to buy bitcoin using their local bank account with 0 % fees. And the merchant to do the some using a service that sells bitcoin for 0% fees (BitPay). 
The combination of both now makes it possible to have an 0% fee global payment network with 0% fees using the bitcoin network as the backbone. This also decentralizes the payment gateways between seller and buyer. At the moment both need to use the same. (Like paypal). 
These payment gateways can match payments internally and otherwise  buy/sell on the market. This would allow very low fees if the market spread is low. If you look at EUR/USD today you see spread &lt; 1%.
At this point the option of not converting is just a click away for all users and receiving payments is the same as paypal.

@_date: 2014-01-24 15:36:21
I suggest the use of paper wallets. You can generate these at   or 
1. A paper wallet will pair a public key with a private key. Each public key has only one private key associated with it. If you want to spend it use a wallet like blockchain.org to sweep the balance from a paper wallet.
2. No the password from a paper wallet encrypts the private keys. Without the password you can't do anything.
3. Yes
Some extra tips 
* I would generate multiple paper wallets so you can divide the bitcoins evenly. If you then want to sweep the balance of a wallet you can just pick up the total amount of paper wallets you will need
* Generate your paper wallets offline. Even better if you can do it on a clean OS like a linux liveUSB.
* Make every wallet twice (copy) and store them on different location. If you get robbed at home they wont be able to take the bitcoin (because it is still encrypted) and you can just use the backups to recover the bitcoin. I personally use a safety deposit box for my backups.
* First test your setup with a very small amount of bitcoins. Do everything from sending coins to the wallet to then getting the balance of the wallet and spending it.
Hope this helps :)

Possibly they got a hold of your backup but these should also be encrypted. The normal reason would be a key logger. 
Also a 10 characters long password is not very safe against brute forcing even with symbols. Length is very important in a good password.

Protecting it from physical theft isn't hard with just 12 words. Write 3x4 words in a book or something. It isn't to hard to find a way to safely store the words on different locations.
You can still memorise the seed for easier access. But don't let the memorisation be the only backup. It is just asking for trouble.

They had to because how otherwise they will get the money back to mexico witch they let into the US. ITM
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:08:27
In principle, yes.
The purpose of the seed is the fact it nevers touches an computer. A possible keylogger could get your 1password password and have access to your seed. 
Also when you enter the seed into 1password you have entered the seed into a computer in an unencrypted way. Giving exposure to keyloggers.
Keeping your seed offline but store the passwords of you different trezor wallets using a password manager, does seem like the best solution. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:35:45
well the transactions themselves need to be propagated through the full network.
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:01:25
True but they could make a system of cold and hot storage. And once the hot wallet is getting dry the cold/paper wallets can just be scanned into the system. This isn't much overhead at all. Could be done by 1 person. And with the money they are earning with the 0.50% fee on trades should be easy.
@_date: 2014-01-29 13:59:17
Same here. I watched both panels and was surprised by the knowledge of them. They took it seriously and the witnesses were interesting. There is a lot of money to be made in investing in bitcoins and I think the panel leader understands this. If you want these company's to be in NY you'll have to make some clear and unobtrusive rules. And at the end of the day this is whats it's all about, making money...
Regulation at the level of the exchanges also doesn't bother me that much. It is a good way to not hamper the system to much. Also once you're in the bitcoin system everything will be much easier and if you still want the anonymity you'll have the option to mix your coins to be extra secure. 
What they never talked about is what happens if you can stay inside the bitcoin system at all times. Get payed for your work, buy something at your supermarket... If this becomes reality it will shift the whole ecosystem of regulation imo. But I don't think this is something we need to bring up in this kind of hearings. It will only bring confusion so I suggest they take baby steps with regulations.

Yeah the changing dominations is a problem. And I'm still getting used to it. I think bits will work the best because it will stay a large number for a long time. 
When traveling abroad I went to some countries where the currency is 2000x higher dominated compared to euro's. You really get used to it quite fast because you can just subtract a couple of the last numbers and multiply by a certain number. 
Like with bits is is just divide by 100 multiply by 4,5 to get the amount in cents. divide by 10000 multiply by 4,5 to get the amount in dollars.

    1000 € = 2595 kBit (*2.5 for quick estimate)

Just an update.
Greenaddress indeed is capable of writhing its seed to the Trezor. This will wipe a possible seed already setup on the Trezor. To me this breaks the security of the trezor and its seed creation process. So I wouldn't use it. 
Using the Trezor as a 2FA option should be a nice feature to me, as it is possible to use trezor to sign messages using its seed. (Feature request ;) )
@_date: 2014-10-22 12:02:12
I would implement it using coinbase. The first 1M $ in transactions is free at no charge. After that it is 1% to convert to your local currency. You can also give the customer a discount for paying with bitcoin. ( Which will be displayed nicely on the payment button.
Depending on your business, don't except a huge surge in orders. It will ramp up over time as more and more people will start using bitcoin and see the benefits of the cheaper transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:57:13
This wont work. The network sets a difficulty and then all the miners go looking for a solution. Once the solution is found the miner/pool can create a new block.
This block then needs to be submitted to the network and this can happen by everyone witch should make it unable to see who found the block/
The only reason we can see that Ghash.io found the block is they publish using the same ip address every time.
Also good to note that the % you see of a pool is an estimate based on the amount of blocks found in a certain period. It is an estimate so might be higher if they hit a lucky streak. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:36:45
From my research on the trezor the system seems secure. Attackers need to get the seed from the device which seems impossible as communication by the trezor with the pc is strictly defined and will never do this. But bugs are always possible but to my knowledge they seems not likely

You'll have to trust the one that wrote on the napkin to give back the value of what is written down. Now in stead of using a napkin we use fractions of bitcoins to do this. 
It cost just a bitcoin transaction to color a coin. This is because you need to put the data (write it down) in the blockchain

If you like my designs and want to use them to print some wallets you can use this wallet creator. ( It’s based on the paper wallet generator of Andreas at safepaperwallet.com. Has some nice features like BIP38, backup slip, csv export… I used it for all my paper wallets.
I also made some backs for the paper wallets. You can find these in the *back* folder. These are in the same dimensions as the pages generated by the wallet software, so you shouldn’t have any trouble with alignment if you print with the same setting/scaling. All the original designs are also included in *ai* folder. So you can make some modifications yourself. 
Any suggestions are also always welcome.
Note: all the wallets in the pictures are empty so don’t worry I will lose the bitcoins.

Trezor compatible would be nice. But I think it might be the same public master key as electrum. Also maybe an alarm feature for certain keys transactions from your cold storage. 
The kind that wakes you up so you can start panicing ;p
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:33:22
This is indeed the problem with using armory. I suggest using electrum for your offline and online wallet. First install the offline wallet on the bootable USB and write down the 12 seed. 
You can then generate a seedless wallet on your online pc. You will have access to all your public keys and your balance without downloading the full blockchain. It is also possible to generate new addresses on you online pc and these will be spendable using the offline wallet.
If you want to spend some coins just create a transaction from electrum online wallet to your mycelium wallet. Then boot into the offline pc to sign the transaction. Boot back to the online pc to broadcast the transaction.
This way your coins ara always safe in cold storage. You don't need to sync the blockchain to create a new transaction. And you have access to all the electrum features of a online wallet. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:08:05
Ok lets go over them with some commenting about what my opinion is about the issues. Sorry for the long read :P
* Issuance – the issuing of the currency is iniquitous and mining is not possible without specialist resources so it privileges those with wealth, while it is not connected to work of value beyond database processing
Not exactly. ASIC chips can be very cheap so it would be easy to see a world were you can buy cheap product that mine bitcoin. The only problem is you will have big competition of the ones who do it on a big scale and with great efficiency. This is the same noways with mining real gold. You will need capital to make money and a return won't be certain. Their is no such thing as free money.
* Fees – miners now set transaction fees so in time this could increase and serve to extract rent from everyone using it as their means of exchange
Miners don't set the fees the senders do. Miners could only process certain transaction including a minimum fee. But the network is open for competition so this will reach a natural equilibrium imo.
* Speed – the blockchain is growing to a size where it is slower to confirm transactions, so not suitable for all transactions
No its not. We are not at the limit of transactions/s we can process. The block size can still be raised but once the limit is reached we will need to find an other way to be able to process more transactions. 
* Asset-like &amp; deflationary – the currency is treated as more important than real wealth, yet we need currencies that are in sufficient supply to enable us to transact as we choose
Don't really get the point here. Bitcoins are in sufficient supply because we can keep dividing them up.
* Illicit trade and tax evasion – Unless wallets are registered to an ID
Same thing can be done by using cash all the time. Everything you earn needs to be told to the government and taxes need to be paid. Doesn't matter what you do and in what currency you get paid.  
* Enabling surveillance due to public blockchain – Becomes an issue if more wallets registered to ID (a converse issue to the one previously, it depends on your views on anonymity)
This is indeed a problem if wallets will be linked to a public address. But nothing is topping you from making a new wallet and be anonymous again.
* Volatile – Not suitable for the risk averse or as a unit of account
Also a good point. Many think we will reach a point when prices will start to stabilize but no one knows when this will be. It is still a risky investment atm but the pros for some are much bigger compared to the cons.
* Manipulation and Gaming – Market manipulators can sell to themselves to affect volumes, &amp; algorithms could calculate highs/lows from movements between wallets on latest blocks
And you think things like this aren't used today on all other markets? 
* Misinformed buyers – Some may buy in as a “gold rush” beyond their ability to take a loss
Is this the fault of bitcoin? It is clear to anyone that the risks are great and the price can be very volatile
* Many unregulated Exchanges – People could lose money by hacking or uninsured collapses
Correct this will be solved in the future tho. Regulation will be coming for exchanges.
* Unbacked – If confidence falls, there is no backing of bitcoin units by demands for it as tax, or contracts with institutions, or legal tender laws, or deposit insurance
This is a whole other discussion but I always argue bitcoin is backed by the believe in the currency like one could argue other currencys are. If all people from a country in the EU decided to cash out their euro's for dollars this will have a big impact on the market also. All the millions of investment in bitcoin mining equipment could also be seen as something that backs the network. Especially when we talk about ASIC because they would only work on the bitcoin network.
* Carbon footprint – Massive computer processing power required
Might be better compared to printing money and driving around with armored trucks to transport money. Systems like VISA / MasterCard / Your bank also have huge servers witch need power to run their own network infrastructure.
* Computing power rules – The majority of miners choose upgrades to the software, whether or not all agree: perhaps best but not always? Also 51% control would allow double spend.
The perfect democracy? 
* Internet dependency – A problem when phone lines are down.
Some weeks ago the payment system of Belgium went down for 12h on a holiday shopping day. It can happen to any system. If the internet for the whole world goes down I think we have bigger problems than bitcoin. You couldn't use your online banking also.
The chances that you have no internet in your home and the cell network is down is also very slim imo. 
* Disruptions Ahead – The monetary system needs reform and replacement but the way this is done will have wider effects on Government finances and personal savings, so a lack of good response by Government to prepare society and economy for the changes would be a problem.
So maybe that is the reason 'the people' started building their own system to use. Maybe bitcoin will provide a way to opt out.
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:05:46

Good point, I only saw 1 instance I can remember of someone getting a blockchain wallet hacked with 2FA enabled. And the conclusion was they got a backup form the email wich wasn't protected with 2FA. Weak and reused passwords might be the biggest problem.
Btw I use LastPass for all my passwords. Minimum 24 characters fully random and of course 2FA anabled ;)
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:14:48
Very interesting project!!
So if every user gets their own colored coins address it would be fairly easy to organize the 'payouts' in bitcoins to the same addresses. Or let them sign a bitcoin payout address. Saves reddit to trouble to payout dollars to thousands of people around the world + legal.
Might be one of the prime examples of the future of banking/ future possibility of the blockchain technology and bitcoin.
Sidenote: Any idea how you will handle the wallet safety? All hosted on reddit (with the poor password security by some users) or give people their own keys? 2FA would also need to exist for a online wallet to keep it save imo.
Anyway Good Luck ;) 
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:42:23
Yes it is a good guide but if you have your bitcoin wallet on a pc connected to the internet you will have some risks if your pc gets infected. To avoid this you will need to use **Cold Storage**.
To find out more about cold storage you can read up on armoryguide.com (theire is a section explaining the process) Other option it the use of paper wallets.  is a good site with all the explanation you need. My personal preference is using paper wallets.

Is it really that hard?
* Visit  and download zip file
* Extract zip and run the software
* Print Wallets
* Send Money to Wallets
* Store Wallets in a safe place 
Of course you need to do this one a clean/offline system to be super secure but even if you do this on your daily pc after running you anti-virus/mallware it would be one of the safest options.
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:27:28
Maybe it's a limitation of memory. It would also complicate the process of restoring, wiping a seed, selecting... much more complicated. Not something you want for a v1 product that needs to be secure and bug free. The trezor needs to be very simple imo to keep it secure.
Should also mention that under every wallet (with password) you can create multiple account that don't mix funds. So you can have your business, personal, savings all under the same account.
You can do something like this:
    Wallet 1 --&gt; Password: BobsPassword
    Account  Personal
    Account  Savings
    Wallet 2 --&gt; Password: AlicePassword
    Account  Personal
    Account  Savings
So with one seed you have all the features you can wish for. And you only need to keep track of 1 seed. If bob and alice don't share the password they have fully separated account. Pretty cool and worth the money imo. + you support the company to bring us further feature development and next versions ;)

The best thing about bitcoin is you can easily move to other cryptocurrencies without mush problem. Only problem is you don't have the same infrastructure build around something like litecoin compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:22:35
Yeah but if we are realistic this isn't something that will happen. Even if we use only bitcoin. Your base price will still be calculated in your local currency. 
A lot of online businesses are done by resellers who have small margins. They can't afford the risk of 5% price swings in a weak (estimated time for releasing escrow). Even if their reseller accepts bitcoin. They still will base their price in the local currency. 
In time when bitcoin price is stable (stable being like the eur/usd price, an escrow like this won't be necessary anymore)
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:23:20

Indeed. This makes much sense for computer used. Bitcoin is also the first native currency for the internet so the use of 'Bit' as standard unit seems right.
Also for the users of the metric system the use of kBit and Bit is seamless. It is like kg and g for us. Much easier compared to using mBTC and uBTC. 
The use of MBit in stead of BTC is also important imo. It keeps all confusion away and helps with the smooth transition by offering an easy and quick solution for current site owners. Just change BTC --&gt; MBit and your set for now. 
If a friend asks how much how much bitcoins he can get for 10$, you can now just say 20 kBit. Compared to 0.02 BTC. Sound much better and helps with user adoption on the low level side.

Seed is a random set of word. You have the option of 12/18/24. 
The recovery feature is just a way to transfer the seed word back into the trezor hardware. The device will tell you to put in word number 3 then 6, 18,9... till all words are entered. Sometimes the device will say to type a specific word for extra protection from keylogers. Works quite well.

Yep true that because it will send a backup of your encrypted file to your email. It is a good idea non the less to put the 2FA on there. 
Maybe even make a separate email address just for blockchain.org makes it bubble secure.
My golden rule is always you need at **minimum 2 layers of protection** witch cant be breached by just having a key logger installer or your phone that got stolen.
@_date: 2014-01-06 10:01:14
Why not? A hot wallet on your pc just needs a keylogger to be hacked. If you have a blockchain.org wallet with 2FA and second password enabled you have 3 layers of protection. Even with a keylogger you will be safe.
Ofcourse an offline signing wallet is safer but this isn't as easy and a lot of overhead to just store 200$

In the document you mention 2FA is secure as long as:


different device or 2FA can’t be intercepted by software
Shouldn't it be possible by using the following system.
I assume the problem is when someone is 'watching' your 2FA being typed in and before you hit the send button, a malicious transaction is created and signed with the 2FA key. This could be solved by the following system.
 
* Wallet does all the work and sends the signed transaction to the server.
* Server send back the transaction overview that needs signing with 2FA.
* The 2FA is now linked/locked for 1 minute to the transaction that needs to be signed. A attacker will not be able to sign an other transaction or the user will see that the transaction that needs to be signed wont be the one he created. 
* User enters the 2FA and at the server side both transactions are compared. If they are the same the transaction is published. 
Not sure this is the way to implement it but the idea might be a good one. :)

Here is a generator for the people interested.  Just download the zip and run in the browser.
This uses the software of  and should be safe to use. I just changed the images and the offset of the qr codes. You can check this by looking at the latest commit to be sure I didn't make any other changes. 
This also includes a backup slip witch is why I use this software for all my paper backups.

A safety deposit box is not insured but I'm counting encryption witch will make it impossible even if they get the notes from box. 
Eliptic is liable upto the amount you pick and pay for. To if you take the minimum of 5000 pound and you put 10000 pounds btc in there. And then it gets stolen you only get back the 5000. 
So the price to insure 5000 pound is around the same as the cost of a safety deposit box. Anything more and you'll be better of using a deposit box if you want to keep costs down or stay in control over your coins.
If they get their price to something of 0.5-1% it might beginning to sound interesting to me.

There is no point in supporting it for a full desktop client. If it needs to hold the private keys on your local machine, you will only need to use the password to decrypt the wallet. 2FA is mostly used to get access to a certain files/browser token on a remote server. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:23:26
For a spending wallet the only safe thing for me is a online wallet with 2FA. blockchain.org is great because it also has a second password option for sending. This to me is the ultimate security and safety for a wallet for upto 5BTC. Much safer is not possible imo for a spending wallet. If you use a local wallet like multibit/electrum you have no protection against a keylogger on your system. With blockchain.org you do have this protection.
For you savings wallet you have 2 options. 
* Cold storage using paper wallets safely stored in a vault. Encryption with BIP32 recommended because you never know. 
* Offline/Online wallet solution. You can use electrum if you don't want to sync the blockchain otherwise armory is the best option. If don't have an extra pc laying around use a linuxUSB instalation or a VM with linux on it. A VM won't protect your password against keyloggers but if you configure it good you will have a safely stored wallet.
If you use an linuxUSB stick it might be a good idea to store all the data of electrum/armory in a truecrypt folder for an extra layer of security when someone steels your usb stick. This is a good guide to follow 
My **golden rule** is always you'll need **multiple layers of protection** witch can't be broken with just one flaw. Like someone steals your phone, you have a keylogger on your system or someone has access to your pc. If you follow this rule you'll be alright. 
Sidenote: remember to enable 2FA on your email if you use blockchain.org because it will send an encrypted backup to your email. If you don't have 2FA on your mail just a keylogger is enough to break your security and that violates my golden rule ;)

+1 The internet made it possible for all people to communicate without any problems. Bitcoin enables on a global level the possibility to prove that you own something. This can be used to do a lot more than just use it to buy stuff. It's a full public ledger system. Everything in the world you can think of that needs to know of you owner of something can use this ledger to prove it. It can be used to prove you have the bitcoin, own the property rights to the satoshi associated with this car, you are the person who tries to login with this username....

You cut it of like in one of the pictures. You then store it as a extra backup of your paper wallet. You then store them in different locations. (like home and in your bank). This way one you lose your wallet because of a break in/fire/water damage... you still have some safe backups somewhere else. 
Having only one version of your wallet seems risky to me so it is extra easy with this stub in stead of printing all wallets two times.

I've been around this subreddit and have seem 10's maybe 100 instances of people wallets getting stolen. Most of them should be considered someone capable of good security. And then even still a lot of the times it has something to do with keyloggers or weak password. Also laziness in setting up a good system is sometimes a problem. 
If you think you can be safe you shouldn't expect any problems BUT never leave more than you can afford to lose on you system/wallet only protected with one password. Best option to me is still blockchain.org with second password and 2FA enabled still. Everything else I put on my keychain with linux installed and electrum. Also got the watch only wallet of electrum on all my pc's to make it easy to monitor and generate new addresses when needed.
Sidenote: It's not because you won't click on a bad link someone in your family wont. Also the second password of blockchain makes it safe to use one your mobile phone.

@_date: 2014-08-27 23:03:47
You only have 1 seed on a trezor. But if you enable the password protection, each password represents a separate wallet. Depending on the password you use, you will be logged in to that account. 
You can for example let other family members use your tresor with their own password. You do need to share the same PIN number. Or if someone beats you till you give up your password. You can give the password to your spending wallet with only 100$ btc in it. And at the same time keep you 1000$+ account safe.
Sidenote: If you lose the password you'll also lost the bitcoin behind that password. Both the seed and the password are needed for recovery.
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:13:51
The idea seems good by I think this isn't possible to implement. LastPass doesn't know the Master Password. So the only thing they can do i supply you the encrypted vault. 
If you want to use 2FA as an unlock code, the Master Password needs to be stored somewhere (to access the encrypted passwords) or the vaults need to be encrypted. 
It might be possible if they encrypt the file twice. Once with the master password and once with a password kept by lastpass for each password. When you need a password, your local master password can be stored but for the second encryption layer you need the password form lastpass using 2FA.

*Content of the pdf/statement formatted for reddit.*
**Bitcoin mining pool GHash.IO is preventing 
accumulation of 51% of all hashing power 
GHash.IO, the worlds largest and most powerful mining pool, has entered 
2014 with overall hashing power of over 40%, making it the  pool 
currently in the Bitcoin network. 
The pool has gained significant hashing power due to the 0% pool fee, 
merged mining of alt coins, excellent real-time data presentation as well as 
quality 24/7/365 support service. 
The hashing power of GHash.IO consists of: 
* ~45% BitFury ASIC based miners 
* ~55% independent miners 
Although the increase of hash-power in the pool is considered to be a good 
thing, reaching 51% of all hashing power is serious threat to the bitcoin 
community. GHash.IO will take all necessary precautions to prevent 
reaching 51% of all hashing power, in order to maintain stability of the 
bitcoin network. 
We have put a plan in place to see that 51% of all hashing power, will not be 
maintained by Ghash.IO by executing the following actions: 
 
* We will temporarily stop accepting new independent mining facilities to 
the Ghash.IO pool. 
* We will implement a feature, allowing CEX.IO users to mine bitcoins from 
other pools. So when they purchase GH/s they can put it towards any pool 
they choose. 
We will not be implementing a pool fee, as we believe the pool has to 
remain free. 
GHash.IO does not have any intentions to execute a 51% attack, as it will do 
serious damage to the Bitcoin community, of which we are part of. On the 
contrary, our plans are to expand the bitcoin community as well as utilise 
the hashing power to develop a greater bitcoin economic structure. If 
something happened to Bitcoin as a whole it could risk our investments in 
physical hardware, damage those who love Bitcoin and we see no benefit 
from having 51% stake in mining.
Our plans are to develop additional services, to help expand the use of 
bitcoins. The services include, but not limited to: 
* A bitcoin payment system, which utilises the extended features of the 
bitcoin protocol. (
Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals) 
* An escrow service, which will help secure transactions between members 
of the bitcoin community 
* Micro-payments aggregation, which will enable users to receive small 
amounts of Bitcoins from third parties. 
* Instant bitcoin payments for merchants, which will increase the share of 
Bitcoin e-commerce transactions in the global economy. 
Non-standard transactions, such as mentioned above, can not be relayed to 
the blockchain network, however they are still valid, and can be mined 
using the hashing power accumulated on GHash.IO. 
Feedback is more than welcome.

Doesn't the foundation members have huge amounts of bitcoin. They won't implements these kind of stuff if it will have a negative effect on the value of bitcoin. Even if the network is compromised what is stopping people of using a alt coins as an intermediary for doing private transactions. If people go to an new altcoin the possible huge financial winnings will create a flood of people switching. You could also see a scenario where the 2 coins can exist perfectly in balance.
Buy alt coin with bitcoin and send the altcoin. Receiver transfers it back as soon as possible back to bitcoin and you have done a transfer almost of the bitcoin network. If this is automated you can repeat this step using different altcoins for full security.

What is the point of limiting BTC withdraws. All of this can be done in software so why in the hell do they need to asks for fees. It cost them almost nothing. 
It's fun to say bitcoin is almost free but when it comes down to it and you want to buy and sell it you have fees for buying (0,5%) and again to withdraw. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 10:14:42
I would also point out the fact that company's like coinbase make it possible to accept bitcoin but receive USD. I always have the feeling many people don't know this. These payment processors have very low fees and their is no reason not to accept bitcoin at that point.
It is also possible for individuals to do the same by creating bitcoin invoices. They will save a minimum of 2% over paypal. 
You can then link this to the reason why paypal said they will need to integrate bitcoin into their wallet. Otherwise they may be forced by their own high fees.

This is just asking for trouble if you are using applications. You'll always need to check if you are using the old or new bitcoin domination. At the same time all software developers need to keep using the old domination inside their application while displaying the new to the users. 
Fully switching to bits seems better to me. Keeps everything safe wile not using the same name for different dominations.
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:00:11
Both would be ok for me. For users of the metric system Bit or kBit is as easy to convert as g to kg. The use to display things in kBit would be the best option for merchants imo because it mostly represents same amount of numbers for object. Like 5 $ being around 10 kBit. This helps with the familiarity of the unit and the conversion.
Important is we switch to Bit as the standard unit. Including BTC to MBit.

MBit is only used as an initial use for wallets to make a quick and easy change to a system based in bits. mBit would be millibit but doesn't exist as it is to small.  
The change form BTC to MBit is needed because otherwise most people will keep thinking in x Bitcoins. Making the use of bit difficult. If we use MBit (megaBit or milion bits) we'll use a fully based metric system of MegaBit (MBit), KiloBit (kBit), Bit and cBit (bitcent or satochi)

This looks like some cool hardware. It is a fully secure hardware environment on your phone. I could see this to be used to as a storage mechanism for your android wallet seed. It is a computer and can handle all the signing.

Indeed once you test your wallet this on is **HOT** meaning that you'll need to make a new one. You can't reuse a wallet.




I think you missed the point of a **Paper Wallet** for cold storage. I'll start from the beginning. The point is that you create a pair of Public and Private key that won't ever be connected to the internet. 
Once you print it and send coins to the public key you won't be able to spend the coins without the Private key displayed in the qr code (example: 
The key to spend your bitcoins are now on a physical piece of paper. If someone gets access to this piece of paper they can get to your bitcoins. Or if in some way you lose the piece of paper, the coins will be lost.
To mitigate the risk of losing it, I suggest you make an other physical copy of the paper wallet. (now both can be used to spend the cions) Of course it would be best to store the backups on different location. Both not online. I use a bank safety box and my home safe. 
Now your coins are well protected but if someone gets physical access to your paper wallets they can still spend them. An option is to encrypt the wallets when you create them (bitaddress.org and safepaperwallet both have these options. Expect bitcoinpaperwallet will have it soon). Now if you lose your password you wont be able to spend the coin. You could also write the password down and put it in the bank safe together with the paper wallets. This way you have an safe backup in the bank and still have the wallets at home protected by an extra layer of security by the password. (So if they break into your home and steal the physical wallets you still be safe)
It's really important you don't backup your wallets online. This will still make your vulnerable to an online attack witch is the whole reason you are making a paper wallet in the first place.
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:05:40
Just remember that if you got a keylogger on your system this will be enough to record your password and have access to all the funds. So at this point all the extra security of blockchain.org doesn't matter anymore. 
If you make the backup in a good way you will have better security and make the blockchain.org wallet much safer.
It is always the weakest link in your security that in the REAL security you have and not the one you encounter every day when using your wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:46:08
The problem to me is the difference between 1mBTC and 1uBTC. People are not used to doing this conversion. Most of them wont know the difference between milli and micro. Don't underestimate the stupidity of the average person (
But if we take are base unit to bits. It will be the difference between kBit and Bit (Like kg/g km/m). This makes it a much better choice for switching with the future in mind. Certainly for users of the metric system.
Also new adopters can now buy 20 kBits (20,00 bits) for 10$. Sound much better compared to 20 mBTC (0.02 BTC). Which may help user adoptions a lot imo. + users who like the old domination can still used MBit as a fairly simple unit.

If the trezor breaks down you can still use the seed in a wallet like electrum.
You can compare a trezor to an separate offline electrum wallet with a password. The difference is you don't have to transfer a unsigned transaction to an usb stick. Sign it using the offline electrum wallet. And broadcast using a online electrum wallet.
With trezor you just plug in the little device and sign the transaction by pushing a button and entering your PIN (and/or) password. It is as secure as a using a dedicated offline pc for signing transaction. 
Just a note. A normal electrum wallet on a internet connected pc is not really. Some malware can still steal you bitcoins quite easily. Trezor can be used on an affected machine (without) risk. Malware can still see detect your password but the seed is never exposed to the pc. It stays on the trezor. 
Your PIN is also always secure on infected system as it uses a clever system to enter it. (Trezor shows 3x3 grid of number and you need to enter the PIN on the PC using a blank 3x3 grid). The PIN is used to encrypt your seed. So in case you lost your tresor, attackers couldn't read the seed from the tresor's memory.
If you enable the extra password security option, you also have the option to create different 'accounts' on the trezor for each password combination. Just type in a random password and a account is created. This option can be used to create a 'honeypot' account to protect yourself from tactics like this. (
**TLDR;** Trezor replaces an cold storage dedicated offline wallet.

Could the same not be done for the limit. Create a new hard limit of 20MB or less, and have a soft limit of 1MB. Software get's updated gradually and when we start to see problems and need an increase. The increase can be faster deployed in need of urgency and consensus should be easier. 
**Or** maybe an algorithm which let's blocks grow bases on the previous block, with a maximum limit. Base limit is 1MB but we can push blocks with 120% the size of the previous. So when 1MB block gets published. The next one can be 1.2MB.
Something like this keeps the same resources needs for running a node for a longer time. Once blocks start filling up almost fully and a backlog start forming. This algorithm helps cleaning up the backlog faster. Once cleaned, we scale back to the 1MB limit. With something like this we also keep the limit as low as possible based on the **constant** demand on the chain. In peak ours, a backlog will still be created and people will need to pay more fees or wait longer. The need for other solutions like the lightning network will still be needed to have fast/cheap transaction.

This seems like a non argument to me. You have 2 different types of mines imo:
1. Small Miners: These will join a pool without any doubt. Mining solo for them isn't really an option if you don't like the huge swings.
2. Big Miners (Controlling a notable % of the network): The miners are running very expensive operations. They have the capability of setting up their own nodes with good connections.
For both groups I don't really see a problem with bigger blocks. Sure if you have a 1MB/s connection and you're solo mining. You lose revenue and would join a pool. But how many solo miners have only a 1MB/s connection? They can easily get an faster connection or set up a private pool somewhere else. Therefore I don't really see a problem with this particular point.

So if a node drops offline the data will be resynced to other nodes. ?
If so, what happens when the other node joins the network again. Did he lose all the data? Otherwise you have more then 3 times the redundancy and with it, the cost rises.

In a way this is still good. If people start supporting their creators more and more by donations they won't be needing the add revenue anymore. Once this is normal, the barrier to entry for donations using bitcoin is much lower. 
I even imagine a system where content creators can don't show adds when they get paid. But by using bitcoin you can pay for each viewing, but only fractions. Cpm on youtube is around 7$/1000 views. So by paying only 1cent for each viewing, an audience of 1/100 would be enough to survive.

Well it could still fail as a major currency to be used day to day. But for the system to work bitcoin still needs to be valuable, otherwise the mining economics don't work anymore.
Instead bitcoin could just be a token to transfer value whereby value is just based on the amount of other currency passing trough the system but not used by the everyday user. Just by big institutions in the background, and for other uses like collored coins and side chains.

May I ask why it is O(n^2) scalable? It seems to me doubling the size would allow double the amount of transaction inside the same block.  
@_date: 2015-05-19 23:30:36
So if I get it correctly Factom is basically a separate p2p network where you need to use the Factom coin to push a hash of your data to the Factom chain. Every 10 minutes this chain is pegged to the Bitcoin Blockchain so you don't need to worry about securing Factom with some kind of hashing powers. 
Now my question: The whitepaper talks about Bloat and the 1MB bitcoin block limit. Won't Factom face the same problem when everyone start using the system for Title Records in the world. Data is data so you're just moving data from the blockchain to your own. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:45:02
It is but it seems to me you can detect this and just drop these spam transactions. The real problem is when we have full blocks with real transactions by real users. Then we get a bad user experience, which we can't really afford when you are trying to convince people to use your system.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:34:04
K fair point, but in the end if Classic only change the blocks size, it will be easy to for core to just use the adjustments from Classic and put in in the Core software.
Ofcourse it still sends a message but a real switch will only happen when afterwards the development of next features and improvements for bitcoin happens on Classic and not on Core. 
Thats also why Core might have a good incentive to 'patch' in the block size increase if Classic is building up steam in real mined blocks.

Oh I was under the impression an input could only be used to send to multiple outputs in the same transactions, not in different ones. Still learning everyday here.

Trezor code is till open, just not free for everyone to use and make a clone device.
Also it is not because Bwallet is open source, it is suddenly save to use. If they don't have the ability to fix security problems or the code isn't audited. If you really don't want a trezor, maybe the best choice is to go for the ledger wallet. Atleast this way you are supporting the actual development of new hardware wallets.

Something like this is possible and should be implementable by youtube. The biggest problem is that the bitcoin network isn't really designed for transactions of 0.004 USD, fees would be to high so an other solution is needed.
It could be fixed by using a 'payment channels'. If a user wants to have an ad free experience, he opens a payment channel with youtube for a certain amount (ex 5 USD). If you click a youtube link you won't see adds, instead youtube charges you for the view on this payment channel. Once the payment channel is closed, all bitcoins will be send to youtube, the remainder send back to the user. Youtube can then group the bitcoins and send it to the content makers, after taking their cut ofcourse :p
Don't know the CPI you can get on youtube, but almost anyone would pay 0.01 USD a video, which is a 10$ CPM. My guess 10$ isn't that bad to be honest.

mytrezor suggestion
Don't make xpub viewable when device is remembered on pc. It is useful the have the ability to remember a trezor wallet and generate new addresses without the trezor plugged in.

@_date: 2015-01-17 13:28:55


Just one thing to remember. If u use a hardware wallet with greenaddress you need to handle the second seed as the backup key. If you use the pin feature to remember the second seed, you don't need the hardware wallet to send funds. Just PIN+2FA
Basically you have these options
**2of2** nlocktime transactions needed (small fees associated)
Key 1 | Key 2 | Features
PIN/passphrase | GreenAddress with 2FA | All
Always able to access your funds
Key 1  | Key 2 | Key 3 (Backup - Offline) | Features
PIN/Passphrase | GreenAddress 2FA | Passphrase 2 | no instant confirmation
PIN/Passphrase | GreenAddress 2FA | Hardware wallet | no instant confirmation
Hardware wallet | GreenAddress 2FA | Passphrase | no instant confirmation
So if you use the passphrase with the PIN (example on your phone), only PIN+2FA is needed. This means if you want to use greenaddress as an alternative to the hardware own interface, you should create an separate greenaddress account where you store the second seed as an offline backup. Otherwise the security of your hardware wallet won't matter to much compared to the normal use of greenaddress. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:33:10
Not really because if you transfer it using HTTP or the API of the service. You are not transferring the value itselve, it is more like an IOU. If you use the VISA network for example, you have to trust VISA when they told you someone payed for the order. Only later you'll receive the actual value. 
With Bitcoin you'll don't have to trust anyone. If the bitcoins arrive, they are there and aren't going away. If I use my coinbase account to pay on a site where there is a 'pay by bitcoin' button where the service used is VISA. VISA doesn't need to trust Coinbase to accept the payment, it knows the payment is sound. 
Bitcoin removes the authentication method you need to send value over a specific network, like a credit card to send value trough VISA. **It's like a global unified entry pass to all value transferring networks.**

Might work for the release of an initial device, but for the long support of these devices, it might be troubling to compete with copy wallets who won't do any R&amp;D.  
People will only buy once for the device after that any additional R&amp;D funds should come from profits of the device.
Possibility might be to also do some crowdfunding for new features, this way splitting up the R&amp;D cost and the actual selling of the hardware.

@_date: 2015-01-17 11:28:36
Very interesting indeed. It basically makes bitcoin the global way of sending money over the internet, without anyone really needing to own bitcoin. Because bitcoin is a common standard, you can send money between bitreserve like companies. 
If you look even bigger, a system like this could be used to replace international wire transfers. The user will just make a "BitTransfer" from their USD account to my account in Europe. The bank itself will transfer it to bitcoin, send it to Europe bank, Europe bank transfers to Euro. Voila supper fast and safe international wire transfer.
The bitcoin value will be pegged by the transfer of value it needs to support for all these short periods of time.
One a smaller picture this is very handy to sell to people who want to test out bitcoin, but don't want to have the risk of holding it. Making it much easier to let people try it out. 
Edit: Systems like this will really help bitcoin becoming the TCP/IP of money.
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:43:48
Right, the payment request should be send directly to the hardware wallet if it passes the certificate checks from BIP70. You shouldn't be allowed to copy the bitcoin address.

You hava an option to make a coinbase vault as a 2of3 wallet. This way you always are in control of the funds in there. If you put a big delay on deposit + 2FA this might be one of the most secure things to do for the normal user. 
For anyone else just buy a Trezor or use electurm/armory with an oflline computer/linux distro. Not to complex imo.

Well all the normal features of bitcoin are still present if you use bitreserve, only no price swings. You can still send money easy around the world, micropayments, low fees compared to paypall. 
In the end I don't think a lot of us will see bitcoin as a kind of currency that you hold, but more like a payment network like VISA. The big difference it is open and make interoperability possible between different services. 
If you see a payment button 'pay with bitcoin' you will click it and you'll be forwarded to a service like bitreserve where you using 'the bitcoin network', but your value is dominated in the local currency.  
Now at the receiving side someone could use a whatever service they want that supports bitcoin payment. In the future this may also be a service like PayPall. You'll receive your bitcoins on your PayPall address and they are converted to your local currency again for a much smaller fee, due to no VISA fees for PayPall.
You could imagine a scenario where if you pay trough PayPall using VISA network/card it will cost the merchant 2%+30c. But if you have money in your PayPall account you can use the 'Bitcoin Network' and merchants only need to pay 0.50% for the BTC--&gt;USD conversion.
This to me seems like the most likely outcome for bitcoin. The linking of different financial services around the world. Once you have a local financial service that supports the 'Bitcoin Network' you'll be able to use it worldwide. 
tldr; bitcoin as the 'VISA network of the Internet' open to all and interoperability between financial services.

I just tested 2of3 on Greenaddress by copying the xpub from mytrezor and creating a 2of3 fresh account. Disconnected the Trezor and logged back in. I was able to send funds without the trezor connected and just using phone 2FA (local signature + greenaddress signature).**This means Trezor isn't required for the 2of3 account** which doesn't make it more secure then the standard accounts. Why use a Trezor at all then?
Enabling Trezor as a 2FA device on this account would solve this security issue.
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:50:26
To my slim knowledge of Ripple I think not. Ripple uses gateways to put in value in the network. So if I want to make a transaction from VISA to Coinbase. Their must exist a link (direct  or indirect) between this. This way it is still based on trust. 
In the case of bitcoin we agree to all trust the bitcoin protocol. And all use this protocol to transfer value. 
Also with Ripple it seems like very dangerous if some trusted gateway has a problem and shuts down. The might create a cascading effect resulting in other gateways having problem. (Not sure about this tho)

Hope they get this working for a decent price. I personally would like to see more low cost alternatives like the ledger nano or HW1. Sub 50$ price seems important to me as it allows for a bigger user base. 
A HW1 cost only 15 Euro so it is a easy sell for bitcoin beginners with a bitcoin balance of around 200+ $. Also an impulse buy for many other users to just try it out. 
Price point like the Trezor or and probably this device are to high imo, which really limits the market.
A mobile application with a cheap key management device like a HW1 with build in USB OTG to connect to your mobile phone seems like the best option to me. You can have NFC, big screen, PIN protection (or fingerprint on the galaxy for example) even multisig with multiple keys for larger transactions. And all this for a fairly low price point.

Once they go online they should prove the access to the cold storage imo. I understand everyone wants to see it now, but when your systems are compromised in some way even touching cold storage should be done with extreme care.

Also if someone took their base code an schematics and created an other wallet with more features, it would be a different story. Then you create competition on features/price ratio and not just on the price itself.

+1 Greenaddress
Best online wallet around. Enable 2FA using google authenticator and you're quite safe. 
If you wan't to be more secure for bigger amounts, an hardware wallet is the way to go. I personally use a Trezor and it's very nice, but a little bit expensive. Ledger Hardware Wallet is an other option. It doesn't have a screen but comparable safe to the Trezor. 
You can also use both hardware wallets with greenaddress if you want.
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:32:42
They could even use 3 of 4 with one key on AWS, one on their own hardware server just for signing, and BitGo as the final step. This way they can still use AWS for the great scaling and put their own protections on signing using their own inhouse signing server. Then finally hand it of to BitGo which has a second layer of protection.

Nice stared it for later reference, was going to build something like this to track all my bitcoins and to practice a little bit using the bitcore :)
    var publicKey = pubKey.derive(0).derive(i).toObject().publicKey;
I'm not sure but don't you also have to check the .derive(1).derive(i) ? If I remember correctly 0 is used for the user wallets and 1 for the change addresses. The way it is setup now you'll only find the normal addresses generated for receiving. Once you send a transaction the 'change' funds will not be tracked.
From 
- m/iH/0/k corresponds to the k'th keypair of the external chain of account number i of the HDW derived from master m.
- m/iH/1/k corresponds to the k'th keypair of the internal chain of account number i of the HDW derived from master m

It might be a problem for anonymity tho. If you have public torrents where you everyone can log your payment address, it might be easier to track you, if at some point for example these funds are send to your coinbase account to withdraw. 
Investigators might track this, and the fact that you make money of this makes it even worse. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:58:09


This seems like a nice feature but it should be made clear that this doesn't offer the same security level as using your Trazor normally. Someone who steals my phone with greenaddress app and my 2FA + beats me to steal my pin code, can still access the funds without the Trezor. That is why the Trezor also need to be used for 2FA (preferably the only activated 2FA option)


Reusing the same Trezor for signing and 2FA is probably not adding extra security. Using two different ones can improve security but I think it may be even better to use two devices from two different manufacturers to make it more secure.
If Trezor can be used in the 2of3 model, and as 2FA, the following will be possible. Imagine an account with 10 BTC. If the Trezor is plugged in, it can be used to sign the transaction and use the seed stored in the browser to sing, eleminating greenaddress signing (full control of my funds). But if I want to make 1BTC available for daily use. I use the Trezor as 2FA to set the velocity limit. Now this 1BTC is available to me simply trough my browser/phone using my PIN.
This also make a lot of sense because when I need to do a big transaction. I want to utilize the power of the Trezot (and it's screen) to verify it myself before signing. Eliminating any possible attack vector their is on greenaddress on a compromised machine. 
If you want to enable even more hardware wallets, you can just add them as 2FA options and require to authenticate using two different 2FA methods. This also really shows the power of multisig and greenaddress as a gateway for the final signature. This also might be the easiest way to implement new wallets fast.

+1, intresting points. Might look into ripple again.
Ripple indeed seems useful in some parts. Might keep a closer look at the development. In my scenario it might be done to extreme. Because if we reach such a big audience with the capabilities to use bitcoin. There might be no need anymore to do the transactions between VISA.EUR and Bitcoins.
I do think for Bitcoin to success. We need to offer options for the general public to allow them to 'hold bitcoins' in the form of their local currency, like done with bitreserve. Creating a small scale version of my scenario. 
Once the market value of bitcoin grows, stability will follow and the general public can start using it normally. 
At the moment I still think Bitcoin has the biggest potential, mostly due to the network affect and the eco system that is being build with all the VC money.


This seems like a huge problem for scalability indeed. Might weaken the Ripple network if running nodes will take this much resources.

3% fee seems high. Couldn't you use bitpay to receive funds and lower the fees...
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:30:17
You don't need to hold bitcoin to use bitcoin. Companies like bitreserve.org can hold your funds on their books in the form of every currency. Like today paypal has the option to hold your funds in usd/eur...
Once you want to pay someone using the bitcoin network, bitreserve transfers it into bitcoin and sends it trough the network. Reverse process happens in reverse, if I receive bitcoins they are transferred back into the local currency.
The big difference is bitcoin enables interoperability between services. If paypal offers the same service as bitreserve, I could send you 10$ trough my bitreserve account to your paypal account, without big fees. Linking all services together trough bitcoin. Other features like escrow are still possible if you want to, you could even implement reversible transactions if the escrow service doesn't sign the transaction immediately, allowing the same safety for retailers/sellers they have now with credit cards.   
Bitcoin creates a platform to transfer value, their is no real need to hold it.

To my understanding your implementation works as follows. Once a transaction is created. Instead of decrypting the Mnemonic from local browser storage using correct bin and retrieving the password. The transaction is first send to trezor to sign. Once this is done it is send to greenaddress for the second signature and to be broadcasted. 
It their a way to send coins when no Trezor is connected? I guess not because all transaction need to be signed by the Trezor to work.
The ideal solution to me would be to be able to setup a *Trezor account* under the *Accounts* option in settings. This would also enable Trezor as a 2FA option for the other account. Greenaddress could simply ask for a random message to be signed from the tresor. If this corresponds with the xpub on file, 2FA will pass.
In this scenario greenaddress is the one stop solution. I can login to my account using simple pin on authenticated devices. I have access to my full secure savings, generating addresses for the trezor account, protected by the hardware if I need to send from it. (even in the future maybe delayed transaction signing by greenaddress for extra security). 
The normal accounts can still be use for the 'daily' spending and convenience. Trezor and other 2FA methods can be used to set the *spending limits* on your daily wallet for super easy access and speed when dealing with small amounts.
**TLDR**; Trezor as a separate account and as 2FA would make greenaddress the one top go solution.

Not sure this is true. I thought they ware save to use on affected pc's.
I would ask you how you think Trezor can make money if all their IP is open source and can be used by other people? They can't just ask a premium for their devices because people will start buying the cheaper Chinese version who don't have any R&amp;D costs. Asking a monthly fee also wouldn't work.
I like the whole open source idea, but in practice they are still a business and need to earn money somewhere. And if a Chinese close will cost them revenue in this small user space, getting out of the red when developing a fully open source hardware wallet won't be feasible.

@_date: 2015-01-18 09:07:08


This is in practice true, to combat this you can use a password in combination with your Trezor. ( When you login to the Trezor, you'll be asked for a password. This password is added to the seed to create your wallet. What this means is that every possible password is a new fully separated wallet. 
This is a nice feature because if you want to create a new wallet, just type in a new password and you got it. So in the case you are forced to give up your passwords in a home invasion. You can easily give up some of your wallets with weak password, and keep the rest still secure. 
Also important is that the Trezor give you a save environment to sign and send funds. This is something you don't have with BIP038 wallets. You still have to load the private keys into a device, which may be infected. This problem doesn't exists with the Trezor.

If a HF happens with a threshold of 80% it's important that the difficulty ajustment is long enough to force a long period of block discovery on the weaker chain. Pushing everyone the majority chain again, even if a 'controversial' (20% miners disagree) HF would happen.

Biggest problem is once you start with 'paying' to replace add, all the sudden they start asking for much more money. 
Let's take youtube RED as an example. Let's say only 3$ a month goes to the creators. (7$ goes to google music, youtube features) If you watch 100 YouTube video's a month, that is a 30$CPM. For the average cpm on YouTube is 2$ ([source]( 
So all the sudden when you start paying the directly, you pay 10x+ times more. Not counting the possible savings of the content provider having a sales team to get advertisers.

Agreed having acces to the xpub is usefull and having it stored when in watch-only mode is no problem. Just the easy access bothers me when in this mode. Should only be this easy when in the normal mode.
Just different philosophies about the watch only mode I guess. Anyway keep up the great work on Trezor, still love it through all the hate your guys received lats days ;)

Let's take the scenario where Coinbase releases their own hardware wallet to use with their service. And the specifications of this are closed source. It might be used as the 2FA for their multi-sig vault.
I would think a lot of people will still use this wallet to store their bitcoins if they trust the company, and the company has some liabilities if they lose your coins due to mistakes they made. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:24:52
Hard to say if the difference will be made up by the increase in sales. I also bought a Trezor but the price tag kept me from buying it initially. I still want a second one as a backup. But at these prices I can't justify it. 
Also for new users, telling them to buy a 120$ device to keep things secure, seems like a hard sell. Something around 50-60$ seems more like the best price target. If you compare this to the ledger wallet, Trezor will be a no drainer due to the included screen.

Bit difference is with ledger you need to use a security card to make sure the transaction you are signing is the bitcoin address you wanted to, and it isn't replaced by some mallware. 
With the Trezor you can just look at the screen and be 100% sure. Imo both are still better compared to just online solutions.
@_date: 2015-01-11 01:31:26


Ok makes sense, so the flow is like this (Tresor Present). This looks very secure to me and how it seems implemented now.
- Login/Sign using Trezor
- 2FA using phone
- Greenaddress signs and broadcasts
Problem is when I don't have the Trezor present but still want access to the account for daily transaction. If the following is still possible, this isn't secure because the trezor isn't used and phone is the 'all access' device (weakest link counts). 
- Login/Sign using pin
- 2FA using phone
- Greenaddress signs and broadcasts
But the following would be safe if I disable 2FA using phone. First:
- Loginusing Tresor
- Use 2FA Trezor to set spending limit of 1000 bits
- Logout
Now I can use part of fund without trezor:
- Login/Sign 500 bits transaction with PIN
- Greenaddress check spending limit
- Greenaddress signs trancation
Hopes this make clear what might be a good combination of extra security using Trezor but also make some of the multisig functionality available. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:50:45


Interesting. If I enable the password, will I be protected by the attack where they steal my Trezor and extract the PIN? 
@_date: 2016-03-03 01:03:30
1. Due to being close to the lock size limit, filling up blocks for an DOS attack is much cheaper. To me this seems like an important aspect of protecting the network. It needs to be very expensive to perform a DOS attack. 
2. I do think we are seeing some kind of small crisis. Normal bitcoin users without great knowledge of the specifics of the network are getting a bad user experience using bitcoin (even if you can blame it on the wallet that doesn't adjust fees). This is something we cannot let happen. We are fighting an uphill battle for adoptions and every problematic users experience is one to many imo.

The only problem is when prices keep falling, it is hard to talk about bitcoins in everyday live. The first thing everyone asks is about the price, and if you tell the truth you'll have to say it is still going down. 
At this point most people already aren't interested anymore or made their mind up about bitcoin.

check out a service like bitreserve. You deposit bitcoins in your wallet and if you want you can link the value to USD/EUR and you won't see any value change when the price goes up or down. Sending bitcoin just works like normal. Best of both world imo.
Ofcourse when the price doubles, don't be sad your value didn't double to.

This is indeed needed for the instant confirmation. If you don't want this feature, but still want to use them for some of the other multisig features like 2FA, spending limit. 
They also offer 2of3 accounts (just create one in the settings) where you don't have to do the time locked transaction because you have 2 keys (normal key + backup). They can still do all the multisig things except the instant confirmations with services that support it.

Yes but not between platforms. So if a site supports VISA payments, but I don't have a VISA card, I can't use it. Same goes for PayPal. Now if PayPal and VISA enable pay by bitcoin, you create a global payment network.
A site only has to have 1 payment option, pay by bitcoin. Click the link and I am forwarded to my payment provider (PayPal / VISA / MasterCard / Coinbase / Bitreserve ...) 
At the receiving end the same can happen. No need to different services to support different networks. Just receive by bitcoin and if you use a service like PayPal, it will be converted to USD.
Sending money becomes like sending email. It doesn't' matter which email provider I have (Gmail, outlook, yahoo, my own domain) just send it to my (mail/bitcoin) address and I'll be sure to receive the value you send. 
**TLDR**; A global network allowing inter-platform payments. Sender/Receiver Finantial service doesn't need to be the same anymore. No company in the middle creating fees. 
Table of possible payments from sender to reciever
Sender Service | Through Network | Receiver Service
VISA | Bitcoin | PayPal
MasterCard | Bitcoin | VISA
M-Pesa | Bitcoin | PayPal
Bank | Bitcoin | M-Pesa
Coinbase | Bitcoin | PayPal

When you setup a trezor with multiple wallets, by using multiple passphrases you can protect some of your bitcoins when you are being forced to give up your password.
For example. If i have 100BTC I can create 10 wallets using the passphrases psw1, psw2, ... , psw10 each wallet having 10BTC in them. When they steal my seed key, they still need the passphrase to acces the bitcoins. In the event they force me to give them my passphrase, I can just give them psw1 and psw2 and they will find the 20BTC. All other bitcoins are still safe because they don't have the passphrase for them.
I can now just get my offsite backup of my seed key and use the other passphrase to extract the remaining 80BTC. This isn't possible with paper wallets because they will know if they can't access the funds on certain paper backups. With the Trezor there is no way of knowing their are other passphrases with funds on them.
You can also use this feature as a way to give all your family members their own wallet. They just have to plugin the Trezor, type in their own personal passphrase and they have an account backed up by your seed. They/You don't need to worry about backing up their seed and keeping it safe. And if you don't own the passphrase you can't access the funds.

Are you sure payment channels will work? You'll need to open a payment channel for each peer you are going to download from. Even at a cost of 100bits a transaction. You're still looking at an overhead of around 0.05 usd for each peer. 
A lot of content on p2p networks is much less then 1GB big. How are you going to pay for that when transaction fees will be bigger?
This implementation makes only sens to me if you have a centralized server where you download from, like youtube or netflix. Then you could open a payment channel for 1$ and use the channel to allow micropayments. In case of youtube, no ads and with netflix no need for a subscription.

@_date: 2016-03-04 00:25:30
Yep totally agree
0-conf is not the same as a VISA payment at all. The payment can't be reverse by the sender easily without going to a mediation process. If you combine this with RBF that is now in Core 0.12 you don't even need to succeed in a dubbel spend. It's build into the protocol. 
Only thing that could work in this 0-conf scenario is thing like Green address solution or the one of Bitgo. But these give them access to one of your keys to cosign the transaction.
Also if we have constant congestion, the mempool would never clear. It would be possible for transactions to be stuck in the mempool for a long time, maybe even get in 'limbo' if they have to low of fees.
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:25:15
Yep, This is also why I see bitcoin more working as the 'money transfer protocol' between different services. Basically every country could have it's own companies who operate like bitreserve. Transaction inside each system can be very cheap and many different services can be build on top of this.
The power of bitcoin comes into play if you want to transfer value between different systems. For example, it makes it possible to send value from my bitreserve account to PayPall account for zero to low fees. The only thing a service needs to do is to be able to accept bitcoins, and upon receiving, turn them into the account currency preference. If money needs to leave the system of the service provider, they just need to supply the option to send trough bitcoin. This service provider can be anyone you want, banks, paypall, MPessa. They only need to support PayBy and Receiving Bitcoin and they are linked to the global network.
- If you want to switch providers? Just send all value in the account to the other provider supporting bitcoin.
- Need stability? No problem because no money is kept in bitcoin, only transferred trough bitcoin if it leaves the service provider.
- Government Regulation? All providers need to comply with the countries regulation. They can still report and block certain transactions if they want to.
- Escrow and other features? This can be handled trough multisig. Even the buyer protection offered by PayPall can still work. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:14:44
Other scenario where nearly full blocks will be a big problem. How do you accept 0 confirmation payments trough bitcoins if you are not sure they will be processed. In a fee based market, a transaction which has sufficient fee, can still be trapped in the mempool and might be dropped if the network activity is high and higher fee transactions are put into the blockchain.
One could also just accept 1 confirmation payments. But fro example, bitpay invoices are only valid for 15 min. So if i see my transaction being dropped I need to open a new invoice every time. This is a horrible user experience.

Just some idea's how a open, crowdfunded wallet may work.
1. Use lighthouse to make the basic schamattics and software to use the device.
2. Manufacture these devices and sell for cheap cost + profit (below 50$)
3. Future development of the software can also be done using lighthouse funding. For example, if user want the development of multisig in the software, they can fund using lighthouse to do this. 
Advantages: 
- You can offer cheap hardware devices because all R&amp;D is already payed for with lighthouse. 
- Everything is open source meaning everyone can adopt it without it feeling like a big problem.
- Opportunity to build trust for future development of features and quicker crowdfunding.
- No risks or the need to keep selling devices to keep developing the software, this will happen trough the funding

1:02:30 might the best analogy for explaining the potential of bitcoin I have ever seen. "Bitcoin isn't gold its the copper of the internet"
Copper is mined, speculated and mined like gold. But the fundamental thing copper is used for is to carry something like electricity or messages around. And the bitcoin currency unit will be used the same way, to carry value around.  To the blockchain cant work without the token moving around, because the value is inside the token called bitcoin. It wont be used that much as a store of value, more as a means of transferring value. Like copper is used to move information around the world, not to speculate and store value.

Fair point this indeed seems like a attack vector to me. Some mallware substituting all bitcoins addresses from incoming html to their own. You would be thinking your signing the correct one, but it goes to the hacker.

So you think exchanges will let you deal in both versions of the fork? Pretty sure they will all go for the longest chain as this is how the network was intended to work.
If people keep using the &lt;25% fork, exchanges might allow trading on this coin 2, but the value will have to rise from 0 again imo. It would be like a new altcoin where the distribution of the initial coins is based on the distribution in the 'longest chain' of bitcoin at a specific time.
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:24:19
It also puts a mark on miners who control 5+% of hashing power. They could be DOSed and or something similar to force them not to mine the new protocol. It also puts A LOT of power in the hands of those people. 
Personally I like 75% with a longer grace period of around 3 months. Why is 75% enough imo?
If we want to say bitcoin has some of democratic properties with the voting by mining power and we look at law's in different countries around the world. A **75% majority is what is needed in most countries to make changes to the constitution**. To me a HF would be compatible to a constitution. It concerns the fundamental laws of the land, aka the protocol of Bitcoin. Therefore this means to me, 75 should be sufficient as a threshold for a Hard Fork. As long if we make the grace period long enough so all other miners can see they 'lost' the vote and have time to upgrade.

As far as I know Bitcoin Classic is only a patch to the Core software. So if Classic is getting a lot of support and miners are switching, Core could easily merge this patch in their library and continue to do they great work they do today on other stuff. 
This is how it suppose to work imo. I don't think they will keep running a chain which will only have &lt;25% of the hashing power behind it. If the people/miners decide on a change in the consensus, other implementation will start to follow the longest chain. 
If later SegWit gets added in Core and adoption starts rising, people might switch back to Core and so forth. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 21:11:29
Very good article imo, the google maps analogy really makes the whole story for me. If we get to a point where a backlog exists, users will feel like the system is failing. Once this happens all the things we praise bitcoins for, sending value over the internet instantly even on a bank holiday,  feel like lies and its game over for the regular users.
This might not be a problem when the network is big and other solutions for daily users exits, like the lightning network. But these wont exist before we hit the limit. Until then we need a network which proves itself every day without any major hick-ups.   
Here in Belgium we've seen an overload citation of the CC network provider the 2 previous year, just the day before Christmas. A lot of merchants complained and a lot of people felt the system let them down. This included big news stories of course. Here in my family this led to just shopping with cash last year to avoid these potential problems (which turned out to be a good idea last year). I think something like this isn't something we can afford to let happen to the young bitcoin network.

It seems to me to pull this kind of attack of, you need a much bigger capital. The real cost might be only 5K a day at the current rate. But to my knowledge. You cant create multiple transactions when a input is still being confirmed. Meaning you need to split your 5K in very small parts beforehand, to have very small inputs and send out very small transaction which can be detected as spam very easily. Or have a significant higher budget to pull of this attack.
With a 20MB limit this attack will cost you 100K a day. Which will only grow one the exchange rate goes up. 
Also is it feasible to, even with a system to deal with high transaction volume, to have a bitcoin system that only consists of 1MB blocks? 
It seems to me the block limit should rise in any situation, even if bitcoin is only used for big settlements and as the backbone for other networks like the lighting network or equivalent solution. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:53:12
Yeah I'm also afraid how smooth the transition will be. We can only hope the the Core team finds the targets of Classic low enough they wound't really mind merging it in. 
The best thing might be if they patch it in before Classic takes fully over (if that will happen)
At the end of the day this is a very big global open source project, and in project like this not everyone can get what he wants at the same time. So compromises  need to be made once in a while. The exit of Mike might actually help this situation I think. It removes some of the bad blood between devs out there.

@_date: 2016-01-16 17:18:45
Well if Classic goes into effect with 75% of the miners. That means the other chain will only have &lt;25% mining on it. Meaning block times will be huge before difficulty adjust. This means that in effect the &lt;25% chain will be shorter, just because less people are looking for blocks on that chain for a while with the same difficulty. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 22:16:13
So how do we get developers to work on the real solution? It seems hard to me. It might be a good idea to have a block size raise implementation ready for when we see the problems of full blocks to start hurting the network. We are ready to quite quickly implement this hard fork. Consensus wont be that hard of a problem at that point. 
Some kind of 'doomsday' plan if you may.

If the majority of the hashrate (90%) moves to 2X, non full nodes should just keep following the chain with the most POW. If you add RP from the 2X side this can't happen anymore.

This is why businesses want the small increase now, so that the network is still usable for normal everyday transaction. Just bump the limit abit while other solutions and improvements get made and deployed. 
Even in the future with LN etc, we probably will need to increase the actual limit anyway if we want bitcoin to be a global ledger. 
I myself already skipped on buying a few games on steam with bitcoin, just because of the 1-2$ fee I needed to pay on transactions below 10$. We can't effort to lose users and usability while we wait for other solutions to roll out.   
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:18:00

But fees need to be way down for this, I'm not using it at a store when i need to pay 1-2% extra due to fees.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:00:00
Will all the fees I paid in the last year, I could have bought enough equipment to run a full node with way bigger blocks. Kinda hate the usability of bitcoin is reduced to just holding it. 
Sure LN is 'around the corner' but it has been for a while. Till that point using bitcoin for any value under 1000$ seems like the wrong use case.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:29:08
So how do I use segwit? Any wallets supporting it already?
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:28:11
Well it gives the honest miners more room to include more transactions cleaning up the backlog. A single empty block now results in a lot of  trouble and extra congestion. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:50:42
Well all these sollutions aren't ready yet, It's highly important bitcoin keeps working easy and cheaply till they do imo. I already skipped on buying some stuff with bitcoin straight away because I wasn't feeling upto paying 1$ fees on a 5$ steam transaction.
Usability of Bitcoin should still be the number 1 priority and if we need to bump from 1mb to 2mb to do that, its a easy trade-off imo. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:16:34
No, but the 10% left over will have to HF also to keep the current consensus rules. Because with 10% of the hashpower left over, finding the 2016 blocks to readjust the difficulty will take 20 weeks. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:16:34
With these fees and all the infighting, the real USABILITY of bitcoin has gone to shit. Yes sure, it still works for bigger amount but who actually is willing to may 2%+ in fees themselves, instead of just using PayPal. VISA may be charging 3% transaction fees, but that is not something I as a user sees.
So what is the real value of bitcoin then? Just to be free from banks? Because not a lot of people actually have problems with their banks. So if we wanna reach massive adoption, we are gonna need some other thing to get people interested. 
Can we please just get the NYA through, get some USABILITY back quick, and then continue with all the other scaling solutions. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:55:00
So when 95% of the hashpower switches to SW2X, do you think core won't move back? Or atleast some of the developers. 
Even when none do, everything is open source and both codebases will be pretty similar. Making it possible to just transfer many of the improvements which will exist on the legacy bitcoin core implementation. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:18:46


How was UASF any different form the 2X move? Both seem to force the other one to join, otherwise risking a big split in the network. 
Also I still have a hard time figuring out how the legacy chain will survive IF 90+% of the mining power will go to the 2X chain. I don't see the remaining 10% mining at a loss for 20 weeks before the difficulty adjusts. HF on the legacy chain seems to be the only solution, but at that point you have 2 HF's active and many of the arguments against the 2X chain will be less applicable for both chains.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:57:57
And this is the problem of the whole debate imo. But hashrate is the only thing in the consensus rules which can be used for determining the majority fork.
If you make the argument all the economic majority is behind the core implementation, they can also HF with replay protection and everyone can follow by updating their nodes.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:27:20
Well if I can't use my VISA card for a month, I might go an pick up a MasterCard and use that one from now one. Uptime and resilience to spam attacks is pretty important, and even with SegWit I don't see how we are protected against those. A simple small bump with SW2X might be enough to give us the breading room to work on other solutions and go forward together, instead of splitting till we all have a separate chain.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:02:51
Didn't you hear? You shouldn't use bitcoin an make transactions at all rn. Just buy and hold and then wait for another year till LN comes out and all the problems will be solved. If you want to buy something from a company that accepts bitcoin, just use PayPal. It's way cheaper.
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:42:39
It does have users tho, everyone who has a coinbase wallet and pays with bitcoin at a merchant accepting with bitpay. You need these services for bitcoin to be useful to people. Without that there is no real value in the ecosystem. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:01:55
Getting a bit tired of future things that WILL fix it. Can't we just activate segwit, do the 2x HF, get LN off the ground all at the same time. All these parts will be needed for scaling in the end, so why not do them together??
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:24:05
One problem with Segwit is we need people using it before it becomes useful and actually starts making blocks smaller. Therefore it seems still possible for spam to fill up the blocks quite easily I'm afraid. 
Crypto Currencies is still a very competitive space, and usability isn't really getting any better I feel like. Is there any real reason for people to start using bitcoin today except for investment?? When I pitched bitcoin in the past to people, the nearly instant and free transfer was a big part of it. 
With the BCH HF it also seems like HF are way more doable as we thought. And that HF was like setup in like 2 weeks is seemed like. Therefore I would thing resistance to the upcoming SW2X HF might be less extreme as expected. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:26:27
The big difference to me is all the supporters of the NYA will support SW2X. So if you have a coinbase wallet you'll be able to pay a merchant using BitPay etc. Atleast this gives more power to the SW2X chain when the HF happens. 
I do hope SegWit will lead to the increase you state. As far as I know, we'll only get that when its being used by most transactions. The fear here then is we are still vulnerable against spam attacks.
But I do agree, HF might be best considered in case we get full blocks again after SegWit depoly and not do it when we don't need to take the risk. Ofcourse this will lead to the NYA agreement falling apart, and that might lead to other risks as well.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:52:00
Someone explain me this:
IF Hard fork happens with 90%+ Hashrate, how is the legacy chain gonna survive at all without any hashpower and a massive difficulty? It will take a long time for the difficulty to go down, halting the network for weeks. There doesn't seem to be any way around this except for the legacy chain to HF themselves.
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:07:36
Great post and I fully agree! UASF did play a role (hard to know how big) in getting to this point now. But it's SW2X which gave us segwit on the current chain with 100% of the hashing power still here.
Also I find it important that if 95% of miners will split of in the HF to SW2X, the 5% left behind will almost be forced to also perform a HF themselves. Adjustment of the difficulty will just take to long otherwise, rendering the chain useless for a very long time. This means you'll end up with 2 new HF chains.
At that point Segwit2X will have more security (95% vs 5%), lower fees (2MB vs 1MB blockspace) and significant support of some of the biggest economic actors in the space (providing usability) while both being hard forks. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:33:21
I just don't think with SW activated on both potential chains, the devs will keep working on a chain with only 5% support of miners. Mainly because if you are going to stay on the legacy chain with not much support, you might need a POW change to protect against potential 51% attacks. And at that point you also just made a HF to something people wouldn't consider bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2015-08-25 17:55:49
The way you think something is secure, only 20 people will be using bitcoin in the real world. In the end you need to trust someone. I didn't audit my Trezor and Ledger wallets but they seem to be trustworthy. Being Open Source doesn't make it secure be default. 
Also why would they build in backdoors to steal your coins. They got a company and had some VC funding. Much more they would be able to steal without it being noticed.
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:46:45
I think it would be a good idea to have some update to core that let nodes announce their stance an the issue. Some config file where you can just put in the BIP's you support. Something like
     {supportBIP: [101,102],
      rejectBIP: [100]}
This would allow the indexing on the support for certain bips without any of the mess of potential forking. Helping the core devs moving to zero in on a  final BIP to be implemented into core. Seems to me people who can run a node and configure it with the correct settings would help filtering out a lot of the noise. And might result in an increase in the number of nodes being run, resulting in more decentralization.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:13:00
Read the paper and sound really cool for sure. We can still roll out the LN network like it will work today it seems And then later use this new technology to make the funding and opening of channels even more efficient.

Currently building something like this. The idea is to allow tracking of normal addresses and xpubs to start. Later extending it to greenaddress account, and easy imports of hardware wallets. Will also support transaction labeling and different account to organize. 
The service will only store encrypted copies of the addresses on our servers so it will be 0 knowledge for us. Will also support version where only the browser cache is used so nothing is shared to our servers  (with backup options for your wallet) and a fully offline version where everything is bundled in an single javascript file. Might just bundle it into a chrome app or something for convenience. 
Will be made open source, targeting soft release somewhere end of this month.

So you don't handle any fiat. I can just buy tokes using BTC that are backed by fiat by your partners. If so, who are those issuers? 
@_date: 2015-08-29 08:36:39
Don't all this non 50/50 systems give power to an even smaller group of miners? Needing 80% means 20% can stop any increase or decrease.
Why not just let every miner pick a position: halve(-1)/stay(0)/increase(+1) and then only trigger a change if it is supported by 50+% of the blocks, it will happen. Otherwise the limit stays the same.
This gives control to the miners when 50%+ supports a change. Which seems fair because no miner has the VETO power when he controls 20%+ of the hashrate, which seems the opposite of decentralization. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 09:10:43
Also 2 tips for new users
1.  Backup all your bitcoin keys/wallets offline and store it somewhere safe. 
2. **Basic rule for bitcoin security** If I virtually take over your PC and can see everything you are doing, I shouldn't be able to steal your bitcoins. 
* Meaning you need to have some second factor/device protection like a hardware wallet. (Ledger HW1 only 15 Euro or Trezor).
* Multisig wallet like copay wallet with PC+Mobile 2of2 combination if you don't want to spend any money. 
* Offline electrum/armory wallet if you have an extra pc
For smaller amounts, just a app on your phone if fine. For bigger you'll need to invest some time in protecting yourself. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:29:43
Correct, currently using the blockr API to query for transactions. To avoid this I'm planning to enable the option to switch between different API's to query. Like the Bitpay's Insight API.
It would then be possible to run your your own version of this Insight API (which is also open source), and the offline application will ba able to pull information from that. This way keeping everything offline and secure.
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:16:53

Nice to hear. I think it might be a good idea for Core to release a simple 0.11.1 version which let people announce a preference about some of the BIP's out their.

For securing your long-term funds (aka Savings/Bank Account) I would definitively go for the Hardware wallet solution. [Ledger Nan]( or [Ledger HW.1]( are good cheap choices. (Trezor also very good option). Hardware wallets give you protection from infected machines and still easy access.
For your daily options I would just use your phone and use a wallet like [Copay]( or [MyCelium]( This offers enough security for any amount you would put in your regular wallet as cash. Your hardware wallets are easy enough to access to transfer money to your phone for spending out, or just use them to make payment online on your pc.

Is that a fee for every transaction? If not, card seems kinda usefull if you keep using it locally.

@_date: 2016-02-22 12:07:57
If we reach mass adoption we need to be ready tho. Core for sure wants a HF to happen on a long time scale, lets say 6 months. 
Meaning if we hit the beginning of mass adoption blocks will be getting full. Discussion on how to solve it and make the HF patch will take some time. Even if everyone updates very fast once that happens and thresholds are reached for the HF, the time to HF will be around 6months.
This process might take a minimum 6 months, at that time are we not in danger to stifle mass adoption??
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:46:28
Indeed, it also makes the on boarding process a lot easier. Just tell them they need some kind of 'Home Safe' to keep their bitcoins secure. And if you can then tell them this cost only 15 euro it is a great deal.

Currently just using a blockchain.info/wallet for my coins. Use 2-factor authentication for logging in and a second password when you want to send coins. I then backup that 'online' wallet to my pc and my backup service. 
blockchain itself only stores the encrypted file and the decryption happens in browser. This seems like one of the most secure options witch also is easy to use.

Sound like a safe think. You could possibly store the passphrase in a lastpass.com note or something. If you hide it in a pice of text it would bring even extra security. 
BTW if you need a password manager use lastpass. Works like a charm and also has 2-factor-authentication. This way you can use very strong password for every site. Best futures are it has a chrome plugin so it can auto-fill. Also can restrict login to you own country. Brings some extra security against hackers.

Still not sure they'll have to if 95% of the miners will switch to the 2X coin. Because then the original chain will be dead because blocks will just take to long to confirm, taking 2 months to readjust the difficulty. At witch point the original chain might need to perform a HF themselves, resulting in again an other chain.

Think you are wrong here. If both coins would have the same value after the fork, the trading pairs for BT1 and BT2 would be trading both at 0.5 compared to the current BTC. 
This means the most profitable chain to mine at the time of the split, will be the one with the most hashrate. With the  B2X token is worth 0.25, the chain will be the most profitable to mine if the hashrate stays above 75%. Atleast this will hold till the first adjustment period.

Why are people still signalling for NYA then? Because I don't see any gains in signalling to misguide the other vote. If signalling stopped today by some miners, the future of s2x would be in way more danger.
Also at 25% of the value, having 85% of the hash power will be enough to make the coin the most profitable to mine. Atleast till the first difficulty readjustment of the weaker chain (which may take upto a month at only 25% of the remaining hashpower)

@_date: 2015-09-13 21:33:18


Good point, maybe finding a way miners are forced to include transactions in their bloks. This way they can't game the system down. This seems viable now because transactions have not much value to the miners. They get their profit from the rewards. Once this changes gaming this system will become expensive (both ways, up or down)
We could force to include transactions by not excepting their blocks if a certain % of the transactions in the mempool aren't included based on the block creating time. Not sure this is safe, but something forcing the inclusion of transaction solves a part of the gamebility of this kind of system.
Feedback bases seems like the way to go for me, but indeed you have the problem you need to make it gaming resistant. This will result in a complicated solution.

Still can't see why we couldn't have a block size based on a moving average times a certain amount. With a window of 1 week. This way if the demand rices the blocksize will increase too. 
Putting the max size at avgSize x aValue, will also create a small amount of fee pressure if you want to be included in the next blocks. This because due to the nature of finding blocks, even if the average tx/s is happening on the network, blocks will sometimes fill if the time between blocks is longer then 10min (full blocks ==&gt;  fee pressure)
For non time consuming transactions, 0 fees are still possible and those will be swept up in the down times. **This is also something people understand, at peak hours you'll need to pay more.** Something here in Europe some are used to with our electricity and phone bills.
If someone want to DDOS the network, it will also get more expensive over time. The fees will build need to grow and the blocksize grows, meaning more transactions will be necessary to keep up the attack.
Ramping up to holiday periods, the limit will rise again, as do the transactions on the network. Naturally building up a buffer for the busiest days.
@_date: 2015-09-13 22:30:56
You do need some limit. Otherwise a bad miner can just make a 1GB block and weal nodes may crash trying to verify. Having a limit makes it possible to know/prepare to receive blocks from of that size.

I still don't get how with lightning you won't get centralization. Seems like everything will flow to some big hubs, at which point you have full centralization. 
And you'll still have to pay the transaction fee for each channel you open with a hub, meaning you'll be better off with choosing a well connected hub (again hub centralization). 
Also wallet providers will need to abstract this layer 2 solution to the user, therefore they might run their own hub and connect it to the big ones. Meaning in the end you'll end up with every big exchange and wallet provider running a hub, which is maybe a 100 in total. 
Idk I'm still not convinced layer 2 is the answer, especially if you consider the development time still need it to get it finished/tested and deployed.

Q4 my wallet is ready
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:13:42
How is this different from multisig? Is some of communication protocol also implemented which we don't really have for multisig to my knowledge.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:49:45
Well IF they all are actually in agreement to run this patch when it comes out, I see the possibility of a very fast rollout (or at least lock-in) So there is some time for the code to be developed and a small period to lock in the 80%. But it is indeed cutting it very short.
On the other hand, with the threat of BIP148 there is an incentive for the miners to go for the agreement, this way they still are in control of the upgrade and they'll probably get there 2MB increase in the end.

Just waiting for Tesla ... Bitcoin 1 over here
@_date: 2015-03-02 14:26:20
Interesting but no real advantage of a multisig structure. With your idea you have 5 transactions and 5 private keys. To keep everything save you should keep them at different locations. Meaning 10 different location. If you break 6 locations you'll have acces to the bitcoins, if you're unlucky you just could just need 2 locations to be found/hacked.
If you use multisig wallets you can make it 6of10 and have the same security. or 10of10 if you relay must. 
Also: How would you know if a address is compromised? Only when coins are send to it a hacker would steal the coins and you will know it was compromised.
TL;DR Just use multisig ;)

What I'm struggling with is how doing an HF is considered very dangerous to do, but at the same time, everyone seems all in on UASF and how it will be all a breeze. 
Personally, I'm not sure what to do with my bitcoins I've saved up and held all these years. The uncertainty is massive and a real problem for a lot of regular users which might not follow this day to day drama. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:08:07
Hmm very interesting, has some great privacy benefits to for company's wanting many levels of signing before allowing transactions to be send.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:38:46
If BTC1 gets through and activates segwit, nothing is stopping core from making it compatible and then developing further with other great features like they have been done for the years. 
Didn't we want multiple implementations of the core client for diversity sake?
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:31:29
Looks great, like the fact it forces 2FA which should be the norm. 
Found some problem on android
- Keypad doesn't always work when entering pin, click unpair and cancel fixes the problem (Nexus 5)
- It might be helpful that the back button works in the application. Now you always need to click the onscreen button which might be confusing to some people
Some features idea's that might be useful. 
- Allow the adding of bitcoin addresses to a custom contact list, now it seems I can't add people who aren't using Ninki wallet. 
- On the dashboard allow the creation of payment request in the standard format. *bitcoin:[address]?amount=1*
- Support for multipel accounts (advanced feature)
- Support for hardware accounts where all transactions should be signed by the 2FA and the hardware wallet. This way combining the security of hardware wallets with counter party signing. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 13:48:02
So they take 1.4% each year, doesn't matter if I made any profit or loss? So if I want to hold bitcoins for 10 years I would need to liquidate 1.4% of my holdings each your to pay for this. Damm...

My guess for these things is an automatic restart of the system that still point to the older config which isn't signalling bit 4. They are still signalling NYA so I wouldn't worry to much.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:53:57
Well following the agreement we need some new code to be written first. This activation needs to happen on another bit (4) and with a threshold of 80%. If that all is done and tested I'm imagining the miners will be able to start running that patch.
@_date: 2015-03-02 09:49:29
Any idea how these would be taxed and valued? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:19:02
We don't have enough hashpower for BIP91 lockin right? So I'm guessing it will be for the activation period after that.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:29:04
Bitcoin.com developer said on the other subreddit that the BIP91 code isn't deployed yet on all servers. Therefore the signalling difference all of the sudden. (don't think I'm allowed to link there)
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:29:25
Nice to see some of the VC money into hardware companies. Hope this helps with the development of the NFC version of their wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:56:29
If I'm correct the agreement will indeed just use the current segwit implementation. The big difference is that, if the activation happens through bit 4, this signals for the plan of doing both SegWit and a 2mb size increase later.

It is only but it offers the ability to protect yourself using 2FA. This makes it better for security compered to running a local client.

To be fair, the coinbase vault system can also be used if you still want the convenience of having your funds online, but at the same time secured. You also control the funds because of the 2/3 key setup + any online transaction can have a set delay. This way you'll have a chance of blocking a unauthorised transaction when needed.

Well you have to trust mtGox and theire is the problem. You have to get verified and so you identity if known by mtGox. They have a log of the receiving and sending of funds so you have a weak point. 
If a government tracks a withdraw form mtGox to a bitcoin account it can go to mtGox and ask witch account is associated with the transfer. Linking your bitcoins to your identity.

You can also use electrum to generate a master key to use on other computers. With this key you can make new bitcoin addresses but will not be able to spend them. For that you need the original master seed. 
I use this on all my online pc's. You can check your balance and if you want te receive a payment just create on new address on one of my online pc's. Once you want to spend some just make a transaction on the online pc and save it to a usb stik. Then you go to the offline pc with electrum and the master seed. Then you could sign the transaction on the usb stik. Then go back to the online pc to publish the transaction to the network. 
This gives your ultimate security but does create some extra work. Might be considered if you handeling big amounts of BTC ;)
@_date: 2013-12-22 12:06:55

I don't know exactly where it happens but it is part of the mining code your run. All the unconfirmed transactions in the network are waiting to be included in a block. When you find a block the mining software will get the maximum of transactions he can fit in a block and announce the block to the network. If the block is valid it will now be part of the blockchain. 
Check out this link it explains the workings of the bitcoin protocol. Goes very deep so might be little complicated but its a good watch if your intrested.

Yea I just think you used the wrong kind of form (in your bank to send the funds) I just used a normal EU transfer. Should be no problem if you use this information


Bitstamp LIMITED

Unicredit banka Slovenija d.d.

I also got this from my bank.
* The benefits of SEPA Funds Transfers:
* Send money to any bank account in Europe
* No fee is applicable for SEPA transfers
* No foreign exchange commission on transfers from Citibank Euro current and deposit accounts
* Most Euro payments within the EEA will reach the destination account by the end of the next Banking Day following receipt of instructions (subject to our cut off times)
So it looks like normally their is no normal fee. I suggest you contact your bang again to ask about it next time you want to make a deposit.

Might have an idea. Post your BTC to bitstamp and ask for a a coupon code for BTC. Make a new account on bitstamp and use the code to fund it. Then withdraw to a new address. 
Bitstamp doesn't need verification I think so it should bring 90% anonymity. Still should be possible to track it but will be much harder to track it down if it chances accounts.

@_date: 2013-06-07 15:34:36
What I would do is something like based on electrum system. The bank generates the seed and gives you the key to make a seedless electrum wallet. It this way you can do everything normal just not send coins.  You can use the electrum wallet to create an unsigned message.
User can then go to the bank site and send the unsigned message to the bank to sign this message and execute it. 
Depending on the security options the bank can then send a SMS &amp; Mail to the user that the transaction will be executed in the predefined time. (like 12h)
This gives the option to the user to stop the execution of the transfer in the event of a hack. (By clicking a link in the email or sending an SMS to the service) 
It should be possible to fluctuate the predefined time. Everything below 2BTC a day would go trough immediately allowing most online payments for the day. Between 2-10BTC would take 12h. 10+ BTC would take 24u to be executed.
In the event of a hack you would only lose the 2BTC and the rest of the fund you would be able to cancel the execution and lockdown your account.
Just my idea of how to do it.  
@_date: 2013-02-14 20:34:44

Doesn't really matter but I would put it somewhere when paying. Stating that you will refund the same amount in bitcoin when you asks for a refund. Then their will be no confusion and reason to complain. If the costumor doesn't agree he shouldn't buy the product.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:18:48
If sellers use a service as bitpay they would be able to include something like buyer protection. Seller would decide if he offers this for free (and takes the 1% fee for bitpay) or he gives the option to the buyer for 1% fee.
When a seller is new and has low reputation he can take the fee at his site. Once you have a good reputation score you can turn it of and give the option to the buyer if he really wants it. 
This seems like the best of both worlds to me.
@_date: 2013-06-08 17:57:06
The transition fees are indeed for the miners. But you can only collect the fees if you find a new block. This block is now worth 25BTC an consist of transactions. If you set a fee miners would be more likely to chose to put your transaction into their newly found block because they will collect the fees.

I hope you do. I understand why he is so angry at you if they are a real business trying to ship a product. They have run into a lot of delays and are under a lot of stress. Being at CES all day, trying to get the product shipping... They are at CES to precent their company at other technology enthusiast. You clearly know all about BFL so you are not really the person who they are targeting. 
Looks like you went their the day before and expressed your feelings. This isn't the problem. But if you go back the next day and again you show up and state your claims. Why would he be friendly to you. He reacted to agressive and its not good PR nor a way to treat people. But you just came the 2nd time to the boot to troll them some more.  
I still look at is this like a kickstarter product. They asked for pre-orders to make this device. You all knew the risk beforehand. It might run into a lot of delays so you never now. If you wanted to be sure that is was a real product just wait till they ship it. 
I just hope they ship soon or get good news form the factory so all this drama can stop. It's not good for the community and isn't helping the public image of bitcoin.

You could also use the blockchain application on a smartphone to just ask for a payment. (Downarrow at the homescreen --&gt; then hit this pencil) Here you can just enter the amount in euro's. And you get a QR code for the requested amount. This wont transfer directly into euros but is a fast and easy way. Then use a exchange like bitstamp to transfer and da a sepa transfer to his bankaccount. 
If you want direct transfer to euros a service like bitpay is the only way to go I think.

Time based protection might be the best protection of all. It kind of defeats the purpose of instant transactions but for most peoples needs it might be the best option. Also would make all the hot wallets mush safer.

@_date: 2013-01-24 13:21:50
Maybe one day you just tipped a 100 $ :)
@_date: 2013-06-05 13:08:57
So this is just a firmware upgrade? Why would I but the 100$ update from them if I could just upgrade it myself?
@_date: 2013-06-14 18:48:19
Should be safe if you only let the api trade but always a risk.
@_date: 2013-01-12 18:41:52
Very interesting post. But the only real problem I see with your thinking is point B. You say the Estimated Watt per GH  is 650W. This will go down a lot with future technology's. Also with the deflation build into bitcoin the price will keep on rising so that 0.0005 BTC fee will be worth even more. Bringing point K and L closer together.

Only problem is I don't have $ is my account but bitcoin. What is the value of that to the government?
@_date: 2013-03-13 13:41:31
Very good article. Give a good overview of the history of bitcoin and highlights some of its potentials without doing it to technical but still being correct. Well Done !
@_date: 2013-01-19 17:24:14
On the homescreen click your balance. You will get an overview of all the currency rates. Select EUR. Now you will see BTC price with below it the EUR price. 
If now go to the pencil it should give you the EUR rate to enter an amount. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:26:06
Should be no problem. I also have a 10BTC transaction stuck. Because their is no fee, it wont be a priority for miners but it will happen. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:46:43
It does seem so. It's like watching at dollar prices for europeans. If you look at the price you have an idea of the converted value is in euro. Price may swing so it's not perfect but close.
Ofcourse are the swings still bigger in bitcoin but it might help with adoption.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:05:22
Thanks for the nice spot on your site. Looks good ;)
@_date: 2013-02-17 18:34:12
No panic here yet. Just moved some BTC to the exchange to be able to react fast if necessary.
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:16:52
Interesting idea you. Never thought about doing it this way. I might test this in the weekend. I have the idea of splitting up my wallet in small peaces of 5BTC this way if one gets compromised I only lose the 5 BTC.
Is their way to get multiple seeds into the same electrum client or do I need to use a fresh install for every other wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:33:26
I just need a google glass app displaying the ticker price. Just 1500 mBTC for the glass maybe 5mBTC for the app.

There was a topic on bitcointalk about a redesign. This was funded by some people to get a designer doing some work but it never turned out something. I made my own design in this topic just for fun. It is something different. It should represent the bitcoin B but made of blocks (revering to the blockchain). I personnel really liked the result.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:22:40
This is true in a sense. The difficulty will adjust so any amount of computing power in the network will be enough for the payment validation to work. 
BUT your forgetting about possible attacks on the network. If the network has a low amount of computing power, it would be easy for a fraudulent entity to get hold over 51% of the network and be in control. That is the reason we need the investments from people to keep making ASIC. It is an investment in the network witch makes the network stronger and because ASIC are specific to the bitcoin network. Provides stability in the infrastructure.
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:29:41
Same here. Is hard not to talk about if if you make allot more money while sleeping compared to actually working.

I used SEPA on bitstamp couple of days ago and went trough same day. Was on a Friday so took until monday to show up on my bank account. So kraken only has the advantage of the lower fees.

Sold 15% of my holdings @ 175 and keeping the rest. Have some low buy orders in if it drops below 50 to catch some free coins. Otherwise I like having some dollars in these creasy times.

This is a show just started some days ago called the daily bitcoin. Good production for a new show. Quite like it.

I always put an expiring date on the note I make for people. If they don't take it of after that data I take the money back. Of course you always need to tell them.

Let's try this 
@_date: 2013-11-05 11:17:26
Hope so would love to use it in Belgium. Use them every month at least a couple of times.
@_date: 2013-03-03 19:46:33
I would also like to add to use a second password in blockchain.org for sending bitcoin. If you have the mobile application this password will be needed to send bitcoins.
This system of an online and offline/paper wallet is the best combination of security and convenience.
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:17:19
Got an extra key due a mixup with coinbase. You get the steam keys with this one so enjoy. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:59:27
Lets just say the bitcoin network is **protected** by a more powerfull network compared to the world top 500 supercomputers. **'Strength in Numbers'**
@_date: 2013-02-16 20:46:30
A Dollar a week would be great. But if their is a big correction down, the new people might see this as a problem with bitcoin. Newcomers dont want to buy into a market and after just a month lose 20% of their investment into bitcoin.
As long as it is a stabilised growth I don't really mind it. But the fact we see a good support @ 27 is a good sign. Means the recent rise is something supported by the market and not just a pure bubble :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:03:52
Maybe you use this feature when your 'saving' a wallet from a backup private key. Otherwise just transfer using the network would be the way to go.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:23:28
I see 79 as the lates price I got form the api
@_date: 2013-02-14 21:25:27
Thanks for making this happen. I hope the community can help all the people who want to learn about bitcoin in a grown up and good way.

Yeah that helped to. But still sticking with MV out of principles. Even if other operators might start to get competitive in price. And now whit bitcoin adoption even more reasons.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:58:34
3719 mBTC sound much better :D
@_date: 2013-01-24 22:03:22
How I imagine some people who bought at 19
@_date: 2013-06-08 17:41:50
So by this numbers each block cost 1680$ to the network. If you just take the 12,5BTC block award the price should be **134.4 $** to keep the same amount of reward. Sounds doable if you ask me.
@_date: 2013-01-30 11:32:29
I hope they do to stop all the drama. But had to post this gif because it is to perfect for the situation.

Maybe once bitcoin gets very big the price will get higher due to the lower amount of available coins. I'm keeping it for sure in a DIY sleeve to keep it in good condition. 
Might be the best thing to do when holding this coins. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:50:57
Would really help to don't miss any episode ;) Liked the show so far. Keep it up. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:08:46
This is the way I also did it. Just don't forget the truecrypt password. Wouldn't be the first person to forget it and lose the backup this way.
@_date: 2013-02-22 14:42:46
Current price would agree :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:42:02
Good luck to you to. It is also possible to create a double spend with the coins and send those with a fee. But only a last resort if you can't wait the extra day or two it might take ;)
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:44:59
I see a point where investments in new hardware wont make any sense anymore and the network stabilises. When we can do smaller chips with better efficiency the network will rise again but these jumps will be much smaller. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 07:46:42
Pïck up one of these so you don't lose the big monitor once the project is done :)

I use this guy on bitcointalk forum (
He is very fast. For the Special sales I just send a pm asking for a quote, send the btc, get a key back. Works well and as an European I even save money on the price on steam.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:19:57
New lessen learned. Keep some cash ready at bitinstant to buy when it goes down. Sold some bitcoins this morning and was able to buy some cheap coins.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:38:14
Also got 'the' call today. Most of the questions were pretty basic. He also asked about the amount I have and I just gave a ballpark number but stating I wanted to be kept anonymous. He sounded surprised by this but I just told him you don't go around shouting you won the lotto if you win 10K or so. 
Some other basic questions I just tried to bring over the point that bitcoin is more than just 'get rich quick scheme' but more about the protocol behind it. You can transfer money as easy as email and it gives the control of you money back to the user. 
He did ask me about my price predictions witch you could expect. It's just the nature of all the buzz around it. If we were still at a price of 10$/BTC I don't think you would see such high media attention for bitcoin. Cant have one without the other.
I also told him about bitpay.com an easy way to except bitcoins and get regular euros to your bank account including the regular pitch why businesses might accept is. Hope something like this might pop up in the documentary. 
Offered my services to help them out with other questions he might have so might expect a call back.
@_date: 2013-01-13 22:34:14
Indeed the most important thing for bitcoin is it is possible to pay everywhere with it. The more places the better. It is free publicity and if services see the benefit of it after they see the low/0 fees you need to pay to accept bitcoin, they might even promote the fact to buy with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-01-30 21:18:01
I like the fact you can just use for all the news you should now about, without needing to keep track of some of these treats on bitcointalk with more trolling then real intelligent discussions. :)
@_date: 2013-02-12 18:41:16
The bitcointalk topic: 
Looks pretty cool. Hope to see it working soon.
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:37:17
Looks cool once its working. Never really tried DDG but seems like a good product, did hear some good things from it. I'll use it for a week to try it out :)
@_date: 2013-07-19 14:40:50
Ok thanks. So if the change address is the same as on the paper wallet. The wallet is still usable as it was before.
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:18:06
If you've been here for a wile it is always the same thing. Most recent one was the drop after the run-up to 260. I just think it is the normal way of people to react. Some panic, some try to boost the mentality, some try to joke about it...
All of this has happened before. All of this will happen again.
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:25:54
Just picked up the games with bitcoin. They use coinbase and it was instant using blockchain.org wallet. Moments like this bitcoin in awesome.
@_date: 2013-03-11 14:09:32
Still like the show even if they are so wrong about bitcoin. Some good deconstruction of the news and the rest just goofing around for fun. Looks like bitcoin felt into the second part. Anyway ITM
@_date: 2013-07-12 07:44:03

I use gbox.me and it works fine for me. Might want to check it out.
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:43:41
Still had to ask how much bitcoin he has. Always roll my eyes when a journalist asks this.
So what is your current bank balance?
@_date: 2013-02-17 18:37:49
If I remember correctly just your USD fund are covered. Not the BTC part.
@_date: 2013-02-16 19:45:47
I hope so. A stabilisation at this price would be fantastic to see imo. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:54:40


Exactly! Some would argue their are far better systems to do certain kinds of protocols. But due to investments the older more adapted protocols keep being used. You could easily see this with altcoins.
Yes some altcoins will be better in the future than bitcoin but bitcoins has the first mover advantage and the commitment by all the money put into ASIC to secure the network.

Hi, this is the way I do it. I use 2 wallets for my bitcoin. One online wallet and one on my pc.
**Online Wallet (Sending/Receiving)**
This wallet is used to keep some bitcoins online so you can use them easily and still have good security. Create an online wallet on  Use a strong password as this will be the encryption of your wallet. If you have a smartphone use Google Authentication to add a extra layer of security. This site encrypts your wallet file in the browser and then sends it to their database. They also offer backup to other services like dropbox in case the site goes down you still have a encrypted backup of your files somewhere else. 
Remember if you get a virus on your pc and it logs your password it still can get at your money if they get your encrypted wallet.
I use this wallet for a small amount of bitcoin so I have something I can spend easily, but also store safely.
**Offline Wallet (Cold Storage/Receiving)**
For this I use the armory bitcoin client ( You can find everything to make one at this link. You have 2 options if you use this client. 
If you have an extra online computer. I suggest you make an offline wallet. It basically creates an bitcoin wallet for you. Encrypts the wallet and prints a paper backup for you. This computer will never connect to the internet so you wallet file is always safe. This wallet is used for **cold storage** meaning you don't have direct access to it to send bitcoins. But you can always send bitcoin to the wallet. If you ever need to send bitcoins form a offline wallet, look at the armory site were it is explained how to do it. You can also make an digital encrypted copy of your wallet to backup. Remember that the paper backup is unencrypted, so if someone gets it he can spend your coins.
Now if you don't have an extra PC just use armory client to make an online encrypted wallet (meaning stored on your pc). Make a paper backup and a digital one and now you can send bitcoins to it for storage. For the best security use this wallet as **cold storage**. Meaning once created never unencrypt the wallet again to send some coins. This way even if you have a virus on your pc it can only steal your wallet file. (witch isn't a huge disaster because it is encrypted and the encryption is very strong) If you ever need to send bitcoins from this wallet. First make sure your pc is virus free and only then type in your password to unencrypt your wallet.
Last step is to add the bitcoin address of you use for your offline to a "watch-only" address in your online wallet. This helps you keep track of how many bitcoins are stored in your offline wallet.
Little long explanation of my method but hope it helps.
Edit:  gives you a quick explanation of all the different kinds a wallets out their with the pros and cons

And they won't try to understand. The problem is Bitcoin is a totally new concept witch can't be defined in the financial system we have today. So they will try to apply the already in-place rules till someone gets to court and some decisions are made by a judge.
The biggest problem seems to be the people who write laws have not enough understanding about the technology witch will lead to bad laws. Hell, a lot of them have trouble understanding the internet.

This is awesome. Been a MV customer from the beginning and this is a very forward thinking company. They customer support is very fast trough facebook and twitters (some of the first who used it so good here in belgium/netherlands). 
They focus on the younger generation with just prepaid plans. Price here in belgium started with 15Euro witch gave you 2GB of data. At the time this was super cheap compared to all other operators. Really helped to bring down the rates here in belgium imo.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:40:28
Kind of a long story so make me thing they had this ready to go. Almost like a free commercial ...
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:08:04
Memorizing a 12 word sequence is just asking for trouble imo. The chance of just forgetting it is just to high compared to the chance of getting your seed stolen if you protect it well. 
Just writing down the seed in a random book in you house should be plenty safe. Or split them up between 2 books.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:33:18
Great idea will do it aswell!
@_date: 2013-06-23 19:56:09
I would even argue in Bitcoin their is no transmitting of any money. You could even say that everyone owns all the bitcoins at the same time. Just download the blockchain and you have all the bitcoins on your hardrive. The only thing you 'own' is a key witch let you update the location of the bitcoins in a public ledger.
No money is transmitted as it all stays in the same place (the blockchain)
@_date: 2013-01-10 18:34:40
