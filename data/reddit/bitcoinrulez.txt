oh yes they do. Sorry you can't argue with your hypothesis.

It shouldn't even happen once in ten years. But yes if it happens, you should check several sources you trust and if they all say the same you should press the appropriate button.

there have never been reorgs of more than 1 block for almost a year. So why is that a problem?
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:01:27
Already have more Withdrawal requests pending  down to 1 BTC.  None processed so far...

Centralized services work fine in most cases  as long as they don't breach some government backed monoply...

What you need to understand is, that printing money is the same as stealing from all the savings from all the people and using that money to create an artificial demand for a product nobody needed in the first place.   Once the money is spent the artificially enlarged  economic sector will shrink again to its natural size, but the people will remain robbed.  The only use of doing so is temporarily increasing the tax revenue of a nation.   
Unfortunately the natural size of the Greece economy is not so big.  The only mean to change this is to increase productivity.  It will be a very difficult and a long lasting process to increase that but there is really no alternative. Providing a stable currency is a first step.

well sorry. Australia will always abandon their blockchain when they realize that they can't import anything from China anymore because they have a different chain :-)
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:02:06
ok that's good to hear.  How long were these periods?
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:20:14
They would never do that unless there would be something fundamentally wrong with the blockchain outside Australia.   People act rational..

would be very cool if some FBI employee run off with the private keys...

easy get Requests without Authentication work fine but the other stuff...
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:31:57
explain why.  
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:30:44
Bitstamp was down quite a few times today. Should be up again soon i hope

In the whole history of Bitcoin you would have always come to consensus with that option.  And yes that's the whole point of that option not to come to consensus all the time, because you don't wanna consent with an 51% attacker!!
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:56:26
not true.  The gold price is somehow rational as a war has a permanent effect on the economy and on the money supply.  
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:29:06
don't get it. Sorry. People will try to keep the number of blockchains as low as possible  because they can't interact if they have different ones. So there will only be one blockchain in 99,99999% of the cases. 
In case of an attack, it would be obvious which chain is the attacker chain. Honest nodes could simply ignore that and continue with their business.  
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:00:20
Hot for sure. I still prefer  ChatSecure, which is completely free, open source and not centralized ...
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:09:04
hope you received yours as well
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:35:09
i also received one over 100 BTC on June 10th in less than an hour.  I'm still worried!  
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:42:04
bots are indeed not working as the API is still DDOS protected it seems...
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:18:21
Yes in case of a 51% attack this can be good. Because just the existence of that option make any 51% attack even more senseless...
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:48:59
Open Source is still the killer!  I would never use anything else....

Don't support this site unless BTC is cheaper than CC.
