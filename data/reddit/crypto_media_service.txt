i see your point but as i see it the “sexy” amount can be fixed with saying that a fist is 1249 satoshi, which almost sounds like the money we know. bt we just have to get use to prices sunds high. 
And before we see mass adoption we have to see an easy way to use lightning networks so that we don't have the pending process, when trading in normal stores

Personally I think Craig Steven Wright is a big fraud and lack to produce the evidence to his claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto

I believe bitcoin will lose the fus long before unless we see some major updates long before especially on the powerconsuption and scaling front, other cryptocoins will take its place.

The idea of a phone with the secure cold storage for cryptocurrency is great and I do believe let the future lies in cryptocurrencies and therefore technology must adapt and I see this as the first real example of technology adapting to blockchain technology on a consumer level

This is a good example of Social Media influence, trying to impact price. Not that it will work with a one day old reddit profil. But imagin an account there is more than one year old spreading such FUD that might have started a snowball

Liechtenstein is taking the right approach for the future venturing into blockchain technology because for smaller countries it is imperative that  we start getting in on blockchain technology to stay on top of the  technological development in Denmark we are slowly lagging behind if our government undertaking an active approach to blockchain technology
So I look to Liechtenstein and use it as an example when I talk to Danish politicians

I am not saying i´the mempool was not pumped, but to make Bitcoin great we needed to address scalability so when adoption as a payment system goes mainstream, the not so hardcore adopters will stay.

It is not only PayPal believing in Bitcoin A single investor has thrown in 400 millions on investment in Bitcoin 
Besides that we are at a time where a bitcoin has to prove itself,  and what we need is not a sky rocket to the moon in the slow and steady climb,  and that is only possible if we look past the FUD and into the basics behind Bitcoin it might take some time before most people investing in Bitcoin realised that we need to look past all the FUD  and aim for a steady climb

I like how Micheal says blockchain can move us away from the banks. And WFP has found a way to move away from the use of banks, thanks to blockchain technology and help refugees to prove their identity. I have made an article highlighting it at  and hopefully it can inspire other to move away from banks.

It maybe a bubble I actually hope it is because we see think it is negative but look at the tech bubble now the tech industry is getting bigger and bigger, look at rail mania I the UK I bursted and afterwords the UK got on of the bigget rail network. And I could go on with bubbles that have created bigger industries after they burst.

The article does have a good point, and is spot on whene they claim that Bitcoin is easier to understand that the euro. 
Manny people don't know that the euro it is a product of one bank, which has influenced politicians to approve it, countries to accept it.

From what I have seen it's because some technical analysis points in that way,  but make sure you're careful not to believe everything you hear.  there are many people out there spreading fear uncertainty and doubt besides that's a lot of news which are not positive on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a matter of fact most of them forget there are other coins like Bitcoin. 
 navigate the cryptocurrency market is to listen to  for the rumours but not letting them influence your judgement,  do your own analysis and your own research and not long ago I read an article on what news and  social media influencers are sometimes doing to the market  you can read it here

Just a reminder that there are payment solutions out there, so the slow adoption is coming, and in my town I can pay with cryptocurrencies for my haircut, electronic cigarette and when I need to buy flowers for my girlfriend. So it is moving the right way. 
And for inspiration I included an article on payment solution in cryptocurrencies 
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:42:30
Well let's look at MasterCard which has a capacity to do 56k transactions per second  (TPS) but on an average day does 4k TPS. So the bitcoin network needs to hit at least 4k TPS  before it is going to do the right impact, but with lightning network we are getting to a place where it is becoming possible. I just have another question on my mind is bitcoin to complex for ordinary people?
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:49:55
Never had a problem with them, they dobbel charged me once, but got it back quickly. It was a flaw in my payment providers system so they can't be faulted for that.

It is a little surprising that companies which make the profits from trading bitcoins has not collapsed and by company's I mean those companies like coinbase  which is not Direct exchange but a company which buys and sells Bitcoin,  but I do think companies like that will begin to collapse if this continues for a year or two but hopefully bitcoin will rise again before long
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:50:19
Let me stop you there you don't have shares of Bitcoin, it would be like if you said you had shares of dollar. Bitcoin is a currency there for your 0.09398012 bitcoin won't change. And now to my question where do you get your bitcoin prices from? Because every exchange has a different price. 
And if you have bought with a 1000 dollar remember there is a fee on purchasing that might eat some of the 30% gain. 
Otherwise I see your logic and it make sense to me.

Not entirely if you want a public secure ledger you need to tokenise as an incentive  to get outside consensus for maintaining the ledger. If you want it to be a private ledger then you of cause don't need to tokenise it

I think you have a good point, I don't think we will se a total goodbye to Bitcoin, and when that is written I do think in buying the technology will give more profit.

You might have used a scam wallet, if not there are the option that you might have unknowingly shown your seed or private key. It is important that you observ some basic rules to help securing your cryptocurrencies.
1. Never store large amount in a hot wallet
2. Make sure to keep your antivirus software up to date. This goes for phones to (her is a guide on android security  )
3. If you ever need to type in your seeds make sure to change wallet afterwords. 
4. If you ever scan your privat key with another device change wallet.
5. Make sure to only download original wallets ( her is a guide on wallets I have found to work well  )

You come with a good point and that is why we have a writer looking into disrupting government as we know it, but this requires people to take up the combined power they have to change their local system and before summer we will offer a long article on the matter until then I hope people will begin looking more into the tech behind Bitcoin because it has potential to change the way we keep different records
