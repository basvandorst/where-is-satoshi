no. A pyramid scheme is a very specific style of scheme. It would involve having people in lower classes below you, and those people having lower classes below them, and continuing down. Bitcoin and most crypto currencies technically speaking are sold on equal levels. Just because a guy got in before you, doesn't mean you pay a different price now. It is possible that there are schemes going on within bitcoin, but the economical structure as far as we know it for bitcoin is not a scheme that has happened before.

is  the name for bitcoin cash? Why would anyone involved with the real bitcoin have FUD over lightning network?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:55:21
that is kinda crazy. What is the bots opinion on b-cash?
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:54:48
exactly. There are thousands of coins that can do this, and better. BCash is just an attempt to hang on the coat tails of bitcoin.

this is good for no one but Roger Ver. This is deceptive marketing at its worth.

so this context of saying "so that website is completely unrelated to my goals, and I don't know who owns it" changes when the website is sold? Doubtful. my guess, his response now would be "It's unrelated. There wasn't anything there when I started."

not conned as a short term investment. It is entirely possible to make money off bcash. But for the new guys who don't know the history, they could go long on this, which is really unfortunate.

What? the worry here is the effect that this massive sell would have on the market and future markets for bitcoin. irrelevant of what anyone thinks is fiscally irresponsible, in the real world most of us here want bitcoin to succeed. In the real world what this guy did was irresponsible, playa, for the market as a whole, and he could care less about people like you (that meaning anyone but him).

Um I think you have it backwards, likes s2x and hates it I thought.

before fork no, after fork you will need to split the coins if you want access to both currency.

I would mine a more profitable coin, bitcoin is only profitable for ASIC miners. 
If you have an Nvidia gpu then you should mine Vertcoin. There is a website, whattomine.com or something like that, that analyzes your computer and will tell you which one to do. That is how I learned about mining Vertcoin. If you have AMD gpu you will need to do some more research.
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:13:39
What are you talking about man? That statement was in context of the distrust that the fud of this event has had. It literally has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin, but the societal opinion on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:47:10
Its too late to move your coins for the 25th hf due to the premining by the dev team. It isn't going to succeed, there are more effective and trusted teams that offer asic resistant coins.
I would recommend moving bitcoins over to a wallet for the november update.

I hate that this subject is so contentious, but I have money invested and I want to stay as educated as possible, which means entering the warzone. 
I understand your point, and I think quite honestly it is the truth. I just wish it wasn't. I don't see why exchanges would support one side at all, when they can make money on both. The scary thing in my mind is that lets say you don't know about the fork and you send all of you bitcoin to an exchange that only supports 2x. Now you accidentally send both of your coins to that address. If that exchange also has the same address for both 2x and 1x coins, they would only have to add the 2x coins to your address on the exchange, and the 1x coins can be collected by the exchange with the original user being none the wiser. To that original user they sent their bitcoins and received them in their exchange wallet, not knowing that there was an equivalent number of coins being sent out and received directly by the exchange. It just seams fishy.

no reply protection, forces out small miners, turns hash voting power towards largest farms, largest farms can work together to effect the economy on their control, insider trade, make money off casual users.
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:11:11
The question is does a supporter with the mining power and resources of 1000 people on the other side mean they have the support of an equivalent 1000 people? Like most of us, I am very confused about 2x, but from what I've read over the past couple of day is that 2x is supported by major mining farms and large accounts while it is opposed by small users and the developers

Most people that know how to handle a hard fork make money through splitting the coins and selling. And what I mean by that is that they can sell the new coin and increase their total number of bitcoin and regains it's previous value after some time.
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:45:33
bitcoin gold is just vertcoin with a premine. The Bitcoin gold team will be mining for 25 days by themselves to give to themselves for development. Especiailly considering you have an nvidia card, check out vertcoin. Tons of user experience with mining on 1080's. The devs never premined and have run based entirely on donations, which they reach monthly from their active community.

the only listed reseller of the ledger nano s on the companies website is amazon for the  United States. Check the company website and tell me a more secure location to buy the device in the US from, as I would also love to get one.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:20:54
my big question is where is the hash power coming from? Is it possible that the largest mining farms were approached and persuaded to back s2x, thus making a false flag that most users are behind it? I am just really confused about all of this and wish it could be discussed more openly without fights breaking out.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:46:28
please everyone notice that the team backing out in this email never agreed to NYA. they agreed with a sentence and then were included in the NYA signers list. This seams incredibly fishy to me. could someone explain why it isn't?

what about no replay protection. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:06:11
please get whatever money you have on coinbase into a wallet before the fork. It will save you much heartache when it comes time to split the coins.

The majority of business owners that accept bitcoin immediately exchange it for a fiat currency upon receiving the coins. At the end of the day it is just another revenue stream that is starving for physical products for digital currency. Just as people often are more frivolous with credit card than they are with their fiat, many people become frivolous with their crypto in bull markets. As some one in such a massively saturated market as clothing business's, you should use whatever tactic you can to build your brand and cater to a community that often have in flowing passive income (mining) that are looking to use it. IF someone wanted to pay you in gold, you wouldn't have to hold onto it and wait for it to gain value, you can sell it that day at an equivalent value. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:42:57
it is backed by people who stand to make a significant amount of money if only the segwit2x coin survives. the only reason of no replay protection is the hopes of killing the other coin after fork. 
I have posted on a segwit2x forum about what potential benefits could come from the no replay protection, I will update this post if there is anything that changes my opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:55:57
the problem is that this coins community isn't prepared for this fork and without replay protection most new adopters and non miners wont be told that they need to seperate the currency. By having both coins use the same acronym, all trading through that acronym can only be from one of the two coins, and the other coin, if not properly seperated, will be sent out along with the intended bitcoin and lost forever. Idk if the names are bitcoin1 and bitcoinA, and none of them get to keep the original bitcoin name, but we need to seperate them so people don't lose money which would shift public opinion against crypto and cause a long term dip among the most trying times of government restriction on crytpo, thus taking a giant hit to the decentralization of bitcoin as a whole.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:23:19
you need to put your bitcoin on a desktop or hardware wallet and wait. Depending on the fork you will probably need to seperate the coins. If s2x is developed without replay protection then you need to be hyper cautious and get ready to split your coins. The split process is complicated so wait until after the fork where there will be tutorials about how to split and watch them 6 or 7 times. If you screw up the switch and s2x has no replay protection you are fucked out of your money.
