What purpose does 2FA serve if they can get in just by hacking the Gmail account?  2FA is supposed to be independent of the Gmail authentication(password reset).  I agree the Gmail shouldn't have ever been hacked in the first place, but how did the 2FA also get hacked???

Ok, we found the problem, the friend had SMS messages forwarding to her email.  Bad mistake.  Authy isn't broke.

It is on its way home back to the factory.  But DCBitcion  is working to bring ATMs to the DC / Baltimore region.  Where would YOU like to see one?

You can only contact support via Email.  That's not as immediate as I'd like to see.  While I get the cost of handing all support calls via phone is cost prohibitive, I'd like to see Coinbase have an emergency phone number that people could call when they detect suspicious activity on their account.  I'm thinking it'd be really cool if by just the mere act of calling the number from a registered phone number for that person's account would immediately suspend all activity on the user's account, which could only be unblocked by a phone conversation.

What purpose does Authy 2FA serve if it can be reset via Gmail?  It likely isn't Coinbase's fault but perhaps there's a problem with Authy if it was  reset / subverted just by using Gmail.   Then again, its not clear, perhaps the cell phone was also hacked, we're still investigating.

Bitpay says they have reinstated ATM cash withdrawals, I haven't tested yet. I had problems with their app on Android not working, so now I've switched to
