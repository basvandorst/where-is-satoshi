How is it different than accepting credit cards for your books? You get a payment from the CC company every few weeks into your account. Instead with bitpay, you get a payment every day. Both of those payments are in USD. Not sure what the issue is...?

I talked to the CIO of a major (really major) corporation about Bitcoin and there is so much negativity surrounding it at the corporate level. I can't code very well (unless you count SQL) so all I can do is spread awareness and squash some misconceptions about it in my corporate environment.
You don't need to code to contribute, but being emotionally invested certainly helps even day to day conversations with people who have no idea what Bitcoin is.

I'm not saying it's right, but it's not a direct link to any of what's quoted in the rule. Just curious where the slippery slope ends.

Even at .5% the payment option pays for itself in the first year. The fact that major retailers are starting to accept it makes my job easier. Once a direct competitor accepts it, we will definitely add it as an option.

This was a cool part to read:


A simple wallet with core functionality. Owners have the ability to purchase bitcoins from the branch, sell their bitcoins for fiat currencies, and manage or send to a Bitcoin address of their choice. There is no charge for using the wallet service and the private keys are protected via multi-signature and 2FA by default.

Why don't we reserve judgement until we find out exactly what the rules are? Honestly, I'd feel safer if I had money in a US based exchange compared to Gox or BTCe. 
If coinbase turned around and said they are opening up an exchange, they would have MASSIVE volume just from the already confirmed accounts alone.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:01:08
I would hazard a guess that you use the lowest amount needed to be included without a fee.
Also, since everything is visible, the org running the vote will know which addresses haven't been spent(due to miner collusion, bad luck, user error or whatever), and whether that matters for the voting outcome. If the transactions are just unconfirmed, then I'm sure they would offer a bounty to have them confirmed.
I imagine a voting machine to handle all the addresses and sending and such that uses your voter card with a QR code encrypted with your SSN that fills in everything for you, all you have to do is select who to vote for.

It's too bad they didn't list it on their payment options page. Not only does it allow people to pay with BTC, but it spreads awareness. I realize that isn't the goal of MBAM, but clicking on that button wasn't very intuitive either.

Ok, but when you're talking about 1150 TH of hashing power, you go into that with more than a few days of testing. Would I like more info? Of course! I think they are doing their due diligence as they seem to be truly interested in moving to p2pool, especially because we voted on it.
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:32:35
Also, I've seen the argument at how easy it is to steal bitcoins from an online wallet service, but what they fail to mention is that online wallets (the good ones anyway) only have a certain amount of funds (float) kept in a "hot wallet" for the day that gets replenished from cold storage daily or weekly.  
Coinbase reported to have over 90% of their funds kept in cold storage.

I can't speak to all your points, but coming from a retail background(I'm a data guy), we do most of our business in the oct-dec months. If he is expecting the same (which most retailers do), then what we've seen so far is not what he expects Month over Month for the rest of the year.
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:13:06
I spend regularly and re-buy the BTC that I spent (plus some usually to make even numbers.) I use it mainly to keep my credit card info out of databases that are out of my control.  
That being said, if the price is much cheaper somewhere else, it'll be hard to justify spending my BTC. If you can save on processing fees and the guarantee of no chargebacks, isn't that worth a small discount?

@_date: 2014-01-29 21:23:26
That's only if they keep all the coin in digital wallets and not in cold storage. I would hope they keep most coins in cold storage so a hack will not deplete the entire exchange. I imagine it takes some work going back and forth loading up their cold wallets to replace the BTC withdrawn from the exchange.
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:43:15
Arbitrage between each other though. The prices people buy/sell at (privately) are moved by markets largely inhabited by traders who thrive on volatility. That just bugs me.

purevpn is amazingly fast and you can pay with BTC. The only downside is running a client app instead of a static vpn IP.
I've been using it for a month or so routing all my traffic through the netherlands (from so-cal) and I haven't seen a hit to my day to day browsing. (I have to turn it off to play games though..)
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:47:14
What's humorous about that is I work for a major corporation (you've definitely heard of us) and I have a close relation with the ecommerce VP. The ONLY reason we aren't accepting bitcoin is the fact that they are worried about the relationship to the drug world. While your points hold some water, when I can tell the VP that we can save $150,000 if only 1% of our online revenue is in bitcoin, that carries a lot of weight. Not even taking into account all the NEW customers we would gain. Also not taking into account the refunds which we would give out as merch credits and save MORE money. Adding it to our website would be on the order of about $25k. The numbers are very nice for large corporations, which is why you see some big ones starting to take it.
Personally, my company is big enough to pay the 1% fee for all the customer service that comes with it (and what my calculations are based on) so I don't see this being a big deal for the companies who have the pockets anyway. This benefits the little guy the most and is a huge deal for payment processing.
Worrying about a 51% attack when the company receives USD is silly anyway.
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:47:01
We have no way of knowing where they get their coins though.
My point is that the market is moved more by exchanges where traders thrive on volatility and less so by the massive user adoption who are buying coins off of these exchanges.

There isn't anything inherently different from using a credit card processor though, except for the lower fees. All of that we have to deal with on a day to day basis. How is bitpay different?

The price will go up when there are more buyers than sellers. Retailers accepting it doesn't mean anything unless people are buying bitcoin to spend there. There is no incentive for the public to buy into the dream yet.

If my son can manage to keep his wallet safe and successfully use BTC to buy drugs online without me knowing, then I think he's ready for the internet. It's easier for him to take his allowance and get drugs/weapons from the kids at school, and gambling is a lesson everyone learned at some point. And porn? Really?  
Lessons aside, if BTC teaches him to be more secure with his machine, then I don't care what he does with it. Honestly, he just spent $50 on jewelry and matching TShirts for his girlfriend of 2 weeks. I think I'm safe. :)
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:17:32
As it stands now, there isn't much making people want to acquire BTC. If retail shops offered discounts (looking at you amazon/newegg/etc) for purchasing in BTC, then users will want to capitalize on it.  
I know processing my rent check every month costs my management company money. If I could save $20 a month by paying in BTC, I would certainly do so. Not to mention they save the uncertainty of a check cashing at all. 
What will drive adoption is benefits for the consumer, whether that's fraud protection, libertarian values, instant global transmission, or even just cost savings. The reason will be different for each person, and all it takes is the barrier for entry to be lowered, and public education.   
I'm sure Circle and other companies focused on adoption will speed this up, but we're in a waiting game now. Retailers accepting it are only part of the answer, we need people. Companies keeping some BTC to spend will do wonders as well methinks.

You keep saying "username", but as they explained, it's the hash of your home directory. I don't know why you're up in arms over this. Add the extra args (you have to do this with any mining software anyway, seriously simple stuff) and be on your way.
You can't match the hashes on bitcointalk because as he said it's the home directory path, not the name, which to me means c:\Users\coin\ for my mining machine, but would be \home\coin\ on my ubuntu one. Even though the name is the same, those won't be the same hash.
Have you ever ran a website? I have IP logs of everyone that has ever connected to mine. Does their policy say that their app logs IPs? Likely a legal wiretapping thing declaration, like the notices that say your phone conversations are recorded when you call a support line.
How on earth does your home user path link you to transactions on the blockchain? If you're talking about using IP addresses, refer to my above statement. They even *explicitly* stated that IP logging was *NOT* ok.
Non-issue imo.
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:16:42
If it helps, my company always takes the "customer is always right, no matter what" approach. Like I said earlier, our image is everything. If you call our customer service line, you don't even get an automated directory. 
If a company like Newegg, that has a customer service quality that is known throughout the business as being excellent, can accept bitcoin without issues, then I don't see why we can't.
Unfortunately, your points require someone from overstock, newegg, or some other large company accepting BTC for goods and not services to really answer. The move makes sense for us financially, but the muckity mucks can't look past the shady parts of Bitcoin.

I compare it with paypal and that makes a lot of sense to them. We are paying a lot of money to paypal for less than 1% of our orders. Integrating paypal cost us the same that it would to integrate bitcoin.

So what you're saying is that we will refuse to refund the customer when something goes wrong?
And you just proved my point that bitpay is no different from using a normal credit card processor except for the *customer* giving up their ability to do chargebacks. The *customer* gets to decide that by using bitcoin to pay for things. If they are worried about it, they will continue to use credit cards instead.

While your reasons for running the system inside of a VM are valid, that's not what I'm arguing against.
"Just run it in a VM" does not answer the windows build question. I already run a windows server locally and would rather run a native app instead of within a VM. I have OB installed on a raspberry pi to play with, so it's not like I'm adverse to using linux either.

The problem is to set the namecoin address you need to sign your address and Armory signs differently than the reference client. Eligius won't accept any changes from an armory wallet because of this. I'll need to export my private key from armory, import it into the reference client, sign, and then erase it all again compromising all the security I put in place.
I hope armory changes their signing process in the new update.

I completely agree, but surprisingly the volatility isn't the problem that my circle of people keep bring up, it's more the drug dealers/money laundering/illicit side of things that they can't get past.
I think we're in for a volatility roller coaster with it ending up somewhere much higher than it is now. It's a really hard sell, but I've been focusing on the fact that there are billions of dollars wrapped up in bitcoin and as long as the security is sound (which it seems to be) then it will be here years from now. 
My son just asked me last night for his allowance in bitcoin so he can buy stuff online without a credit card. This is where the magic will happen. When kids grow up never having a credit card or a bank account, they will hate the current system even more.

When I told him I could buy anything on overstock with it, he asked me if he could too. When I said you needed bitcoin first, he asked for his allowance (which is $5 a week) in bitcoin so he could shop online.

Also, the new antminers have both the PCI-E connection and the standard three 12v three grounds on both blades, so you can use either the 6 pin PCI-E or strip an 8 pin and use those cables directly.

That wasn't my point. In the current banking system, try moving around this much money, this quickly, this securely, without paying any fees.

Buying/Selling 1000 BTC on bitstamp moves the market so much more than buying/selling 1000 BTC from circle.
I realize you can't buy that much at one time, but I'm not just talking about my influence.
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:26:11
So that's a no then...? :)
@_date: 2014-03-16 14:32:05
Basically all you need for the antminer to work are three 12v wires and  three grounds. How you get that it totally up to you.
Personally, I would rather have a different PSU for each antminer, or maybe 2 at the most. Using 3 is just going to max the PSU and not be very energy efficient, while introducing lots of issues with non-standard setups.

Well, now it is. It wasn't when I first clicked on his link.
It's just funny to me that reddit gets to claim no responsibility when people link celeb nudes on here, but are hosted elsewhere, but (indirect) linking to dox hosted elsewhere is a no no.

1% has been the typical response to a large corporation accepting it as payment. Overstock and Tigerdirect both have said that demand has been more than what they estimated.
I like how you know the internal workings of Bitpay and what would happen during a 51% attack. It would have to be a pretty devastating attack to deplete the cash reserves of bitpay, and at the same time there will be much more to worry about then receiving a few thousand dollars one day.
FYI: We did almost 200 million in online revenue in 2013, will be closer to 250 million for 2014.
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:56:54
Because we aren't a saving society? (at least in US we aren't.) Some people just need the actual saving part taken out of their control. BofA's "Keep the Change" program is pretty successful, and it does the exact same thing (minus the BTC part).
edit: A word.
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:26:51
Well that makes sense. Thanks for taking the plunge even though it wasn't something simple to set up. I saw your tweet about spending the BTC on an Iron Key from TigerDirect so I'm assuming you're keeping part (all?) of your revenue in BTC?  
I'm so happy when I don't have to give my credit card info to *another* source. This is the main reason I use BTC. It becomes my money to lose, and not the 500 different attack vectors that I've given my info to over the years.

Any info on advertising spots you've purchased? I was curious to see what my coin would be funding.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:45:38
If you don't mind me asking, what do you normally make off the ads per user? I imagine in my head that it's only a few cents, and only if the ads are clicked on.

I just bought some more. Dang I feel better now.

Honestly I'm not that intimate with the inner workings of everything yet. After dicking around with it for a few hours I gave up, which in hindsight has cut me out of some NMC. I will look those utilities up and see what I can do with them.
Ultimately I wanted my offline armory to stay offline and encrypted, but it seems I need to break some rules to get some of that sweet sweet eligius NMC.

Thanks! I was wondering when those were going to confirm. Now what to do with the gold coins...
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:03:54
Which is why you only take verified purchased from reviews with grains of salt instead of all of them. Yelp reviews have a "checked in here" counter, amazon and newegg both have a "verified purchased here" icon. There can still be gaming of the system, but much harder when you have to arrange a purchase for every single gamed review.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:24:58
Thanks. I absolutely love not having to worry about my BTC. I've spent close to 4 BTC online (not much, I know), and not one problem so far. Buying 2 miners from Bitmaintech directly from China was especially nice because I don't have to trust that entity with my cash, only that they will deliver my product.
@_date: 2014-07-12 03:06:13
Yes, but buying shares from havelock are buying from people selling. Don't they need to have something like an IPO to sell them?

Ok, but how do the shares that were converted from the loan pay the loan back? Aren't they still outstanding? Or are the dividends from those shares paying the loan back?

If by "wasn't free" you mean that they had programmers already hired to integrate it into the site. They had to pay their salaries yes, but it's not like they went out and hired a bunch of bitcoin specific developers and then fired them after the implementation was done.
It may have take money out of a different budget, yes, but this was likely very minimal out of pocket expenses on overstocks part.

The problem (as I understand) is that the original transactions that gox sent will have failed and not recorded in a block making it impossible to track down which ones were the failed ones and which were the malformed ones that went through(included in a block).  
Unless there are people out there recording every transaction broadcast to the network including ones not included in the blockchain?

I've been toying with the idea of doing this in my local mall in a kiosk. It's much cheaper than a shop, and the traffic would be wonderful to fuel questions about Bitcoin. As long as you're on the up and up, what is the downside?   
I was planning on selling gift cards for stores in the mall to pad my bottom line, which would let people with BTC buy anything at the mall too.

I want to get my family and friends to have the option of using them or saving them. I'm setting up my mom's shopify site to accept them, so I wanted them to be able to immediately spend them there to show how it worked. 
Giving them the paper wallet and then importing the public key off the wallet into the blockchain app on their phone should be secure as long as they keep their paper wallet (with the private key) safe, right?
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:48:26
Wait, so you're saying you don't mind having to go through the hassle of canceling and getting a new card? I'm not saying it's the end of the world, but it's not something I'd want to go through again.

According to  the private key still needs to be scanned off the paper wallet to be able to spend the BTC loaded from the (watch only) wallet. Is it only the first time? As soon as I leave work I'll be able to test all this out.
