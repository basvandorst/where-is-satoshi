Good on you. I personally use coinbase but have never had a problem. I know this happens rarely but it’s going to happen with any exchange. I use coinbase because they are one of the few that are insured up to 100,000 per use account in the even of a data breach on their end or any kind of solvency issue with coinbase itself. Due to these protections and insurance I feel safer than almost any other online wallet.

There are tons of arguments both for and against large block sizes. Large block sizes do absolutely nothing to centralize bitcoin. The main advantage is reducing transaction costs which actually DEcentralizes bitcoin from miners. And are you running your nose off of a raspberry pi? Any modern server should handle the new block size. My old laptop can handle the new block size, as I am currently running it as a node lol.

Awesome! I’m a CS person so this is what I understood but I was just concerned because I couldn’t find any info on differences between SSD partitioning and Hardrive partitioning. I have read in a few places Apple has actually been able to reinstall instances of their OS on top of this data through some process they have that basically restores your machine to its prior state. No idea how they do that, I’m assuming some kind of build in thing for their file system architecture that allows the recovery to resort? If this can be done I’d be extremely excited. I do not have my hopes up however as I’m still worried part of the data may not even be recoverable or I won’t be able to find the Jaxx data I am looking for.

This article is ridiculously bias and is written by someone who obviously doesn’t understand nor care to understand the Bitcoin Space. It also has just simple mistakes in logic which I’m assuming are based on grammar. Such as he states where money is scarce in countries like Zimbabwe? He means not scarce or that value is scarce? They have 100 million dollar bills used as toilet paper because it’s cheaper. That is the opposite if scarcity. 
Although bitcoin was used on the dark web, at the beginning, suggesting that Bitcoin is heavily tied to the dark web is a 2012 scare tactic. Less than 0.1% of Bitcoin is used for dark web purchases today based on the accounts that hold and do not spend bitcoin.  This person shows that the average person does not understand bitcoin besides what they’ve read from main stream sources 5 years ago.

Another significance difference includes how the creation of the currency occurs. First currencies tend to cost very little to create compared to their value. To "create" bitcoins however, miners spend large amounts of money on maintaining machines. This gives an initial value to the coin, that effort and cost was put in to add the coin into circulation.

I found some places already if Apple wont do it even though I’m under warranty for $150 they do data recovery. I just didn’t know if my situation applied.

It will likely either never come to market or fail completely IF their goal is to compete with current crypto currencies. It would not be a bad idea to have a coin that the govt controls that can be sold and bought with bitcoin, while allowing citizens to use it anywhere and forcing to be legal tender. This would allow governments to continue to control money IN their country and allowing it to be easily transferable to a global currency. Much more like you are investing in the country. Not saying it’s good or bad but allows countries to modernize their currency systems.

So Google doesn’t run the entire play store? Every single company is centralized. That’s literally part of the definition of a company. You can create decentralized products, however there is no largely used or for that instance any to my knowledge decentralized App Store.

Most people who retired cashed out enough BTC to live off and held the rest. For instance, one of my professors cashed around around 2500 BTC at $4,000 and still holds 7500 BTC.  This means he has enough Fiat to retire and live his remaining 40 years off of it but still holds BTC that he plans to leave to his children or use once bitcoin becomes a standard currency.

Ah yes you are right. I did not notice that. Still that’s if it hit the price. I’m assuming it hits $10,000 before the end of the year. It’d have to not reach $8,000 for profit.

You will be in the negative mining with these. Unless you are using a LOT of Antminer a you will not profit with any machine and the amount of work needed to keep machines running 24/7 is a full time job. Do not mine with these. It would make WAY more sense to sell these and buy BTC with the profits. You would make exponentially more doing this. Trust me, you will get nothing out of turning these into miners.

I wish they’d add some kind of foundation where it pulls from an online database with the hash code so it basically would support any currency. Just need something like that so we can have wider support. Also I really want a USB version.

The main purpose is to replace fiat currencies and it can since you do not need an inflationary asset. A deflationary asset can become a base currency in economic models, it has just never been done before. The term “hodl” is just against us NAIC selling such as the China incident. Which to be fair, hodling works out well for most people who aren’t day traders.

Even if Trezor or Ledger don’t, you can get the keys to recover the coins on any exchange. As long as you have you passphrase and public address from the wallet. But if you do this, highly suggest moving bitcoin into a different wallet before claiming it since this does put your wallet at risk.

The $300 is coming from someone willing to buy the coin at that price. Someone people will want to support the other chain. The price isn’t set based on anything except people are buying at that price. If bitcoin stays the same it means people are willing to buy for that price. If the other chains coin is worth $300 people are buying at $300.

Call their customer service and explain the problem clearly. If they say theirs nothing to do ask to speak to their supervisor. Repeat these two steps until you can get someone that can help. If you really did not violate their terms then seizing your account with a balance actually constitutes theft and a violation of their terms and conditions. If you did violate their terms, you are out of luck since you agreed to their conditions.

I have one! Haha. That’s where all my other crypto is. This was 2 currencies which are ICOs I have faith in. Couldn’t transfer them yet because they are still in ICO phase. I’ve got a Nano S I got about 3 months ago and I’m loving it.

"Hodling" does not mean don't spend bitcoin. "Hodling" means not selling bitcoin for fiat currencies when it starts to decrease in value. Everyone in this sub would encourage anyone to spend the Bitcoin they have at any change they have. Most people, myself included, tend to buy something with bitcoin then immediately repurchase the bitcoin I just spent. This lets me not decrease my investment in bitcoin and still encourage businesses to take it.

0 countries do. Legal tender means that government organizations but accept it to pay debts. Which means you can pay taxes, fines, etc with it. They just identify it as tender. Pretty much every country only accepts their standard currency or government issued certificates for tender as their legal tender.

It is true that you run that risk. But it is much smarter to risk loosing the alt coin rather than bitcoin. I am also assuming he isn’t too concerned about privacy if he’s asking these questions here. I’m assuming no one is targeting him for any reason to justify being that concerned over someone following his address. But this is likely the best option since it does completely protect your bitcoins against any reply protection, which I assume was his ultimate goal. But if you want to not worry about replay protection, I’d recommend waiting until a trusted wallet supports the alt coin, so you do not have to worry about the exchange duplicating transactions.

I buy on price points. I'm buying a portion at $3900, more at $3800, more at $3700, etc. I'd figure out the total amount you want to spend and spend it exponentially as price decreases.

The main difference is the limited supply. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin which controls inflation. However, there is nothing that prevents unlimited amount of any fiat currency from being printed. This is the main difference between bitcoin as a currency vs fiat.

Its not very difficult with quantum computations. For instance, quantum computers that are currently in testing have solved ssh private keys in roughly a week, which before would take regular computers years. If quantum computers become accessible and reliable, bitcoin keys will be the last problem. We will have to completely reinvent internet security. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:04:26
But yes to answer your question you can take the number of possible characters in a private key and take it to the power of the number of characters. For instance a 4 digit pin has 10 values 0-9 and 4 so it has 10^4 possibilities. A private key is in the millions of trillions if I remember correctly, but a value so large that guessing is essentially impossible.

It would be much more interesting to see their account vs customer rate. As in what percentage off accounts created purchase $1 or more of a currency.

There’s 0 proof all of these companies want to centralize bitcoin. If anyone wants centralization, it is the miners. Coinbase just provides an easy to use platform for those not as familiar with the workings of crypto currency or those that are not as technologically capable. Miners have much more to gain, such as price control and distribution control. The largest mining companies have very little competition and can heavily influence progress based on their signaling. Coinbase is easily replaceable and has more competitors that I can count. You can hate on Coinbase all day, as I often do, but saying that they are the forces behind centralization is as harmful as it is incorrect.

I like that plan. Apparently Apple does offer data recovery if you are under warranty? Hoping they still offer this, not sure though. Otherwise I’ll save the drive, rebuy what I lost, and wait to see if its ever worth it.

Gonna ask in the Bitcoin group what kind of crypto you should mine?
@_date: 2017-10-08 03:19:22
What a good idea is to protect against this is to move your bitcoin after the fork to claim the alt coins. For instance, after the split create a new wallet, send bitcoin to that wallet, then claim the new alt coins using the old wallet. That way no bitcoin is it that wallet and no longer at risk of replay. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:37:33
Nope! Don’t want to touch it since I figure Apple has a better chance with not messing it up than me. They apparently have speciality recovery software for their File System as well.

But if bitcoin hits $10000 then you don’t get the money still. You have to be the closest.

Agreed but that’s with rapid deflation. We are talking about simply avoiding inflation as a result of increasing supply. Once it was adopted globally, there would be no more deflation. There would be a set amount of adapters and supply.

It would be a bad idea for devices to be unlocked with private keys due to side channel and other hardware security attacks. For example analyzing cpu frequencies to detect correct points in a passphrase/incorrect points. It’d be a bunch better idea to simply have a physical item needed to unlock hardware wallets such as a different code (pin) or a different QR code you could print out on paper. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:27:51
It is possible with a fork. A million dollar BTC would still be a penny in USD per satoshi. Once BTC reaches 1mil I do not think penny equivalent values will be necessary. Pennies are already rarely used. I could see at this point any value lower than a dime not even being relevant. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:05:30
The equivalence would be “Hey my private key is one of the atoms on earth. Can you guess which one?”.

Litecoin. Its built basically to be used for day to day transactions on top of bitcoin. Bitcoin at its current state fails to be able to be used for day to day payments in the future. If it can’t reach this level, using Litecoin as a replacement for say a physical “wallet” and bitcoin operating as your “bank” makes the most sense.
