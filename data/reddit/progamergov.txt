Let's see what the damage is using them:
1. Age limits 
2. Government records
3. Regulations 
4. They may try to bend the laws to make them a monopoly
5. They are centralized 
6. High barriers for entry
7. Provide a reason for the US government to try to control Bitcoin
1. If they are hacked, they still have to pay you back.
2. Bitcoins will have a larger presence on Wall Street.

There may not be any other digital currencies that are better than Bitcoin at the moment, but that doesn't mean there never will be. Satoshi was a genius, but that doesn't mean his work was a 100% perfect or that he is the onto genius. You are basically promoting the idea of a central monopoly of a signal digital currency. I thought Bitcoiners hated the bank monopoly? So why do you not want competition for Bitcoin?

@_date: 2014-06-06 04:40:14
I may not be the best for this because I am still learning and basically a noob at this, but here goes:
BIP38 is used to encrypt your private key that allows you to access and move funds from your wallet. BIP38 requires a pas-phrase instead of a password. 
The crypto card website says this about pass phrases:
 
Bad Examples:
“the rain in spain falls mainly on the plain”
“what goes around comes around”
“she sells sea shells by the sea shore”
 
Good Examples:
“cat mike taco splinter does spline turquoise 25087″
“righteous salmon code bottle swivel next prosper fetch”
“taken soup hole mischief doctor net plank twist”
NOTE: Please do not use the example passwords we have listed above.
Cold storage keeps your wallet off of computers. But requires a way to access it. If you forget the pass phrase your out of luck. Your BIP encrypted wallet has a normal receiving address that can be used safely. 
I suggest researching cold storage and BIP38 encryption more before using them. 
And remember to make at least a few back ups of the passphrase and wallet addresses. Put these back ups in a secure location like a safety deposit box at a bank. (I know banks suck, but at least they can be useful storing passphrases and wallet address incase you loose the information.) These paper wallets are for incase you loose your non paper cold storage wallet. This way you can get another non paper offline wallet made or move the funds out of your account and into a new one.

The guy in charge of one of the exchanges wanted this to add a barrier to entry that benefitted a possible monopoly by him.

They don't have to willingly give it a position of legal tender. They will be forced to.
Sadly it looks as though crypto currencies will eventually be forced into a war with the existing elite and old people who hate change.

But we needed something that was really good. Not for the everyday masses, but for people like Edward Snowden and Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2014-06-22 01:29:48
That was a difference time. Many things that occurred in history were considered ok at the time, but that doesn't mean it's the same today. What is right and wrong is what the majority thinks. Or at least the ruling power. This means it's always changing, and hopefully changing for the better.

This seems like a serious problem that could end up with banks becoming more powerful from crypto currencies. But if it was easy to fix it would have been fixed already.

Decentralization allows for the correct course of action to have a chance to take place. While centralization leaves it up to a few people who can be corrupted, bribed or malicious in their intent to solve problems.
@_date: 2014-06-06 20:49:47
Cut out the bureaucratic people who abuse the power and replace them with an AI. The AI can then cut out the corruption and abuse. But if not done properly an AI can be humanities downfall. If it's done properly, it would advance us at a rate that's too hard to keep up with.

Wouldn't it be hilarious if the Scotish Yes campaign, with their image of fighting for the ordinary folk, became the country to legitimise this fraudulent "currency" and turn billionaire 1%ers and organised criminals into trillionaires.
Actually ... no ... It wouldn't be hilarious at all."
So sad... Poor soul!
Edit: 
Also this: 




If Bitcoin is ever to become a standard for trading goods, it will have to be regulated, since its users will be required to pay taxes like VAT and capital gains on transactions just like ordinary money. The regulations also protect people from nefarious deeds.
In the US and the UK, if your bank loses your money through theft, you are protected (up to a sizable sum). Those who lost thousands in the bitcoin heists were not."

It's not like they are just going to be gunned down. They have a choice not to cause lethal force to be used. The poachers can choose not to shoot back or to not shoot the animal after warning shots have been fired against them. 
You think of it as a black and white situation were poachers are poor and starving people who are just trying to feed their families. You criticize me for being black and white about it because I say they are not all poor misunderstood people. A large number are in it for the huge profits so they can get rich. These people have no regard for the potenial to cause the ecosystem to collapse or make an animal completely extinct in the wild. No one has been doing something effective enough before these guys to prevent the extinction of these wild animals.
Anyways I am not sure how we can be debating on something that we don't have all the details from and have not seen first hand. But if you wish to continue this conversation, what are your alternative solutions that are just as effective or even more effective that can be done now? It's easy to say no to violence because you are an outside observer, but this is inheritally a violent black market trade that won't go down without a fight.

Capitalism and communism both suck, but they both have their positive points as well. Socialism is needed, or a better system is needed regardless of what the people who fell for propaganda say. We will find better solutions as time goes on.

You shouldn't tell people to avoid altcoin trading. Newbies should avoid it until they have learned the risks, and how to understand the markets. Instead let them know it is risky, and very hard to do. You can make a lot of money, but you have to work hard and constantly follow the markets. It's not a get rich quick kind of thing. Unless you are extremely lucky you won't make that much. 
Most importantly don't listen to what people in these communities say. They want you to make them rich. Crypto currency prices are a war of perceptions.
