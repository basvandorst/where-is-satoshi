Exactly! You didn't even read the first 4 lines from that wikipedia article:


Give people free anything and they'll abuse it. It's an unwritten but truthful law.


Yes they will


Oh come on, no other coin is used as much as Bitcoin. The fee market is the ultimate demonstration of that.
Look at ETH. As soon as they actually started using their network they congested it. 
I don't know how things work in your country but in mine, ISP cap the bandwidth because people download like crazy.
People like you think we have infinite resource and that we can always double capacity, but that's always false.
Where do you think you are living, in a perfect world?!

I guess we can only make as much noise as we can about it, asking wallets providers, exchanges and other services like coinmarketcap, maybe the latter type can be easily convinced.

One more reason to tell them.
Since they already know the price is so high, telling them that a bit it's just 0.000001 BTC will make them able to understand why there are "two prices".
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:28:45
It simply means moving decimal points. I think machines and software have no problems doing this, while humans tend to stick to habits they already have i.e. dimes and cents. 1 satoshi become a cent and 10 satoshis become a dime, while 100 satoshis is a bit/usd when BTC will hit 100,000.

Except that when you buy bits you do it on an exchange and the blockchain is never involved in merely buying and selling operations.
But this does not have anything to do with how we want to reason about fractions of Bitcoin. So go complain about that it in a more appropriate post, I guess you can find as many as you want in the sub for whiners.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:56:57


@_date: 2018-01-04 19:17:20


It has more appeal to buy Bitcoin.


Yeah, with 2-3 dollar you buy 0.0002027 BTC, or 202,70 bits.
Which is the easiest to reason about?


To do that you would need to buy/sell the same amount of BTC as before.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:55:23

I hope you are smart enough to answer those questions the right way.
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:49:58
I think it does, but not in the way you would like to.


Many don't even ask if they can buy a fraction of BTC, they just assume they can't. They don't even try to compare fractions of BTC with daily fiat banknotes.
Try them to reason about 0.00001 BTC to express 15 $ cents, their brain explode because they are not used to more than 2 decimals.
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:54:55


This is so scientific! Last time I checked computer science was still science. We don't do random things just because.


Nobody knows for sure, maybe it will be a matter of few months maybe a little more. I mean many people exited Bitcoin because of high fees so maybe without that people exiting a 4MB increase block would be totally meaningless.
Maybe if we had risen it to 4 MB people would have started paying their coffee with Bitcoin and that would have increased the demand instantly (few weeks). A dumb thing is still dumb even if the damages come with a delay, little or big it doesn't matter. 
What matter is that linear increase doesn't scale, period! If you are not patient enough and you want to start paying for your coffee today with a cryptocurrency instead of getting rid of your fiat money first, then go using some other crypto. I'm here for the long term, and as of now no shitcoin is promising as much as Bitcoin, because they don't even try to face reality, the just have slogans and it doesn't matter what tech they think they have "invented" because their userbase is so tiny and so no one uses their coin that vast majority of those shitcoins will fail before even have the chance to prove their claims.

Nope, you can't, there is no turning back from that.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:42:09
The idea to use bits instead of satoshis is that we are already used to think about prices with 2 decimals. 1 satoshi is 0.01 bits. When Bitcoin will worth 100,000usd 1 bit would be 1 USD and so 1 satoshi would 0.01 USD.
It doesn't need LN to make sense. LN is a scaling solution and does not have anything to do with BTC denomination.
Maybe you mean Bitcoin won't make any sense without a proper scaling solution like LN, but this is a different thing.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:15:05
Big investors don't follow CNBC Money advice. They will not come back invest into Bitcoin when LN will be fully functional and broadly deployed because at that point it will be too late. Big investors are investing **now**. It's people that will realize too late that Bitcoin was recharging and they will have to pay a higher price to buy back in because the next bull run will drain money from altcoins like a black hole.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:07:47
Grudge aside, this is good news. We just need one or two big names and it could spread sooner than we think.
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:42:55
What you are not thinking about is that once you increase the block size you can't go back.
A blockchain that increases in size too much is dangerous, I don't care hard drives are getting bigger and cheaper, the problem is you also have to compute the blockchain not just store it.
So we need to increase the block size only when software are coded so they use on chain transactions only when strictly necessary. 
Oh by the way I love the part when a lot of people will get reckt in the shirtcoin shit storm. Because it's how things have always worked since there is free market: people really learn only then they lose money.

Yeah, exchanges are suspending registrations because there are so few people trying to get in. Surely the growth is following the same curve from 2009 to 2016.


Really?! You want to lower the conversation to mere semantics?

@_date: 2018-01-10 11:30:18
Eventually, they will also increase the block size, maybe not as much as many think.
They don't want to increase the block size now because it will only scale linearly. If you double the blocksize now and you only get double the transactions you achieved shit result. It won't scale. If you double the blocksize later and you get 100 times the transactions then you achieved something.
Also this 
as u/saisacorp pointed out
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:50:21
The exponential demand is quite proven: exchanges are suspending registration. I'm not such a big social media user, so maybe I'm not the right one to say this, but I don't recall anything like this happened before, that multiple businesses had to temporarily suspend subscriptions for a specific service they all provide.
That's why I mentioned induced demand. I think the choice of not increasing the block size is wise, because Bitcoin is not ready and we can't risk to ruin it because people want to become rich in a matter of few months, that's not why Bitcoin was created. So people will have the time to learn why Bitcoin exists and why we have to be more patient and people who are not patient can go get reckt on all the shitcoins they want. Then they will have time to think and to learn more.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:04:02


Yes, but this stands true for any cryptocurrency.
Second layer solutions are designed to allow for very low fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:29:01


(EDIT:) Some crazy surges in the transactions count are at least suspicious. Why someone wanting to actual send BTC would send so many transactions so much above the confirmation threshold?


Low fee spam builds up, it's necessary to start filling from the bottom, then people out of FUD strat paying insanely high fees, especially when BTC price raise. Spam it's an operational cost (like electricity), you invest a certain amount with no return at first, but then you collect some profit that maybe let you go breakeven. Real users will pay very high fees to stay above the spam, the more the users raise the fees the more the spammers can raise the wall. At some point, the spammer will have no need to add new high fees because the real users will keep them high.


I'm not sure to understand what you imply. Can you elaborate?

@_date: 2017-12-21 00:54:11


Are you retard? 
It has ONLY to do with transaction weight in bytes times the satoshi/bytes fee you decide to pay. 
If you are claiming you can set 0 satoshi/byte fee then you don't know what you are talking about. A cryptocurrency that allows for free storage on its blockchain (because 0 fees translate into that) is a doomed project. Free means you could abuse it, and be assured that someone will abuse free resource.

Also use segwit addresses for your transactions, ask your exchange to implement it if they didn't already, use a wallet that supports segwit if not already, and so on.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:43:45


I think it's an attack. But I would be curious to actually see if it's not profitable. I think you don't need more than 20% hashpower (yes, just my personal opinion, I would like to see some math about this) to at least break even the costs. 
I can't even imagine people keep adding transactions over transactions, especially new "adopters" that we would better call new buyers because I'm sure 90% of new "adopters" are leaving their BTC in the exchanges.
So there is no proof that is adoption either.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:36:37
So what?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:28:46
Coinbase is damaging their customers on purpose by not implementing Segwit.
Trezor wallet not only implemented it in early August, but they also made it the default and called **legacy** the traditional Bitcoin addresses so to not incentivize you to use it anymore.
This is how you do something good for you clients. And Trezor surely has way less employee than Coinbase, so the only reason that comes to mind why Coinbase still not implement segwit is they are trying to boycott it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:10:06


Your is not even logic. You just need to collect part of them plus the higher fees that people pay. It's an operational cost that might be even profitable.


Or you can spam the range above the next 2 blocks confirmation and so you can fool people into thinking that fees are going to raise a lot in the next hours. So people set insanely high fees even when not necessary.


Not directly, but surely they contribute to FUD


Maybe true in the short, but not true anymore in the long run. You invest a lot to start the process but then it levels up and you might even have small profit because people start setting insanely high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:39:46

@_date: 2017-12-20 10:00:17
I don't know, when I look at the mempool stats and see 50,000 transactions instantly added I don't think about *adoption*. Especially when the new transactions pays so low fees that you know they will not be confirmed for days.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:54:02
Currently, there is no cryptocurrency capable of serving millions of daily transactions across the world. No one is capable of scaling to that size on chain, it's insane only thinking about something like that.
No cryptocurrency can be a unit of account because even Bitcoin with the biggest market cap still has big volatility.
Since Bitcoin gained this big popularity so much ahead of time, Bitcoin developer (no core ones) are developing second layer solution that will allow scaling.
Bitcoin surge in price will contribute making it less volatile in a near future: the more the market cap increase the less volatile it will be.
So wait and enjoy becoming richer every day it pass! You don't need to buy coffee with any cryptocurrency, use your damn cash, to the point that when Bitcoin will be ready you would have gotten rid of all of it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:41:33
Also, it helps spreading awareness of SegWit transactions and of course LN tech.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:08:11
In fact you start to fill with zero satoshis TXs, then you step up gradually from 1 sat/byte to 100 sat/bytes and even higher. It's gradual, it happens over several days.
And spam is an operational cost that the miner can even profit from if done when Bitcoin enter in a bull run and people want to send many real transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:35:53
100,000 USD for 1 BTC means 0,01 USD every satoshi

If by getting your feet wet you mean you bought some, well your feet are still dry on the beach.
Watch some introductory videos from [Antonopoulos youtube channel]( and then, if you want to be educated on the topic and not just informed, watch this [not-too-much-technical course from Princeton University]( and then you can say your feet are wet.
The Antonopoulos videos are easy to follow because he doesn't go into technical details (he does have some more technical if you'd like) and it's a pleasure to listen to him, some of his analogies are brilliant.
The Princeton course is really fascinating when I saw it the first time I didn't know anything about Bitcoin and it blew my mind.

I can't see a fundamental change like that happening in a near future.

I myself reason about it in mBTC every time, so i guess it would be wise adopt mBTC on exchanges too.
But i think it would be more effective to show **both the representation** so that you know it has a high value and you can buy a fraction of it.
I think it's important to remark that it has a high value.

Besides, saying nothing has intrinsic value is even more silly.

"Intrinsic utility" is a quote from Antonopoulos, credits go to him not me. Many of you should try to watch some of his videos, I assure you he will help you understand the implication way better than what a discussion on reddit could do.

I heard in Venezuela they are actually doing mining, especially ETH.
The problem is, how can i buy Bitcoins if my 1000 euros aren't enough anymore to buy food, clothing, pay taxes, pay bills and other things i need to live, because prices skyrocketed?
Let's say that at the end of the month, -100 euros out of 1000 euros 
 salary have left. I need to do a withdraw to cover those -100 euros. So you see, if i already have Bitcoins i could somehow manage to handle it.  If i don't already own any, and i don't have savings, how could you think i could buy some Bitcoins?
You see, not everyone have savings, many have mortgage and debts of any kind. 1 out of 10 people in Europe don't even have a job. 
Let's look at Italy savings situation. 17 people out of 100 have less than 1000 euros in savings. And then 57 people out of 100 have less than 5000 euros in savings. Do you think they will buy bitcoins in the event of a financial crisis hitting Italy? Do you think Greeks are doing any better?

You talk all high and mighty but i think you are only looking it one sided.
I think this is more complex than what you say.
If Bitcoin were a just a speculative means, merchants wouldn't accept it as payments. People wouldn't hold onto it as a store of value.
There are plenty of financial product for big player. Bitcoin is not that.
The average people is one of the constituent of the Bitcoin and Bitcoin success, without them there would be no Bitcoin.
People mysteriously trusting Bitcoin made it possible. Big players came later. And if people loose trust or can't afford to use Bitcoin anymore, then unpredictable things happen.
It's not as simple as you want it to be.

Actually i think it depends on your country regulation. 
Right now in my country Bitcoin stands in a big grey and very foggy area, because they (politician and regulators) can't understand Bitcoin and it still catching very very few attention by the common people and even less by the media.
You have to think that here we pay in cash 83% of our purchase. Basically we still live in the stone age.
Last november the tax agency issued a paper which deemed Bitcoin to be the same as ~~cash~~ ^(ugly word) banknotes and they made things confused more instead of clarifying them and now economists (the very few that dares to state something about it) part in two groups: who says Bitcoin is not subject to capital gain taxation and other that says it is.
I'm sure they will clarify it better only when they will find some rich guy evading taxes to a large extent (a lot more than few thousands euros), but i don't see it happening in the next 10 years because as i was saying Bitcoin is not popular here. 
And If you are wondering [ my country is in 56th position.

Until they offer the service (and until they shift to bcash completely) you can try:

If those are your (whoever you are) BTC then you want to be sure that the BTC will be included in the next block. 
Otherwise you would have to put new BTC in the network to go on with the spam attack.
It could be a low amount for a player with big pocket, but maybe even a big player doesn't have much anonymous BTC.

On Bittrex you pay 0.25% fee for every trade, period. On other exchanges they have a distinction between maker and taker.
You just need to put an order at a price no one is asking. So you are a maker and you pay a lower fee. On kraken, for example, makers pay 0.16% while takers pay 0.26%.
Makers are the ones who decide the price, takers are the ones who buy at market price. 
If the lowest price in the ask order book is 4,100.00 then you go bid 3,999.99 (or less if you think it will go down, but that's another matter). This way you'll pay maker fees, ie. 0.16%.

If I did understand it correctly a decrease happen when the last 6 blocks required more than 12 hours to be mined.
If they can stop difficulty to drop "helping" to mine at least 6 blocks every 12 hours they difficulty doesn't change. And so that blockchain remain useless.

You don't need this kind of speculation to guess that the more Bitcoin becomes popular the less Bitcoin will be available. It is simply something can see reflected in its price.

The poorest country and people in the world will use, actually they are already using, Bitcoin while we lucky people can hold it. Holding it help in keeping the price a little more stable while spending it help making it wide spread.

I played very very few video games in my life so I think I don't get your analogy.
Yours is not even logic, it's just a statement, it's just your statement and luckily it doesn't get real just because you say so. Otherwise, everything would be worthless and I wouldn't like a world like that.
If you like to play the snob relativist it's ok, but I'm interested in cheap philosophy. The topic was something around Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:52:59
There are only 16.5 million Bitcoin currently and there will never be more than 21 million by the end of the year 2140.
How many people are there on the planet? Like something around 7 billion? Do the math of how many Bitcoin we could have each if it was distributed equally. 
Let's say 300,000 satoshis each person. What a satoshi is? Is 0.0000001 Bitcoin. And yes, you could send that amount to someone, because Bitcoin was designed so you could divide it that much.
So, like **you don't buy an entire bar of gold**, but you can still buy gold, the same can apply to Bitcoin. 
You can buy half a Bitcoin, or you can buy the thousandth part of it.
You would not become rich in a year from now just buying half a Bitcoin or an entire Bitcoin, but you surely won't become poorer. Your money will be worth more, much more than having them invested in the stock market.
But more importantly you would own your money. No government would be able to froze your Bitcoin account.

Try to convince them that when you'll do the same, in 10 years from now, using Bitcoin is revolutionary.

Paying with my phone? No, that's not revolutionary, doesn't matter if a bank is not involved.

The Greeks right now don't have enough money to think about savings. Many of them need more than what the actually have.

In one word. Fungibility.
Let's say you have photos of the banknotes you carry in your wallet.
One day you get robbed. 
A year later your are in line at the bank and you see the customer in front of you counting the banknotes is going to deposit. 
You recognize one of them is yours and you have a picture of it to prove it.
But no, that's not your banknote anymore, you got robbed and the person in front of you may have received that banknote in a perfectly legit way.
You can't claim that banknote even if it was robbed from you.
After a certain amount of transfers, you can't prove anymore if the new owner is the one who stole it from you.
If you loose fungibility your currency loose it's value.

Think of Bitcoin as a bank check.
Every time you send Bitcoin you have to destroy your old check and make a new one. Because this is the way the protocol works. You can't send a corner of a check. You spend it entirely or not at all.
So if you have 2 "Bitcoins check", but you need only to pay 0.1 Bitcoin, you would have to write a check for 0.1 Bitcoin to the recipient, and another check for 1.9 Bitcoin to yourself.
Your wallet do it automatically every time you don't fully spend a "Bitcoin check".
Your balance is the sum of every "Bitcoin check" you own. So you might have 2 Bitcoins but that could be the sum of 4 checks: 1 bitcoin + 0.5 bitcoin + 0.3 bitcoin + 0.2 bitcoin. When you spend Bitcoin your wallet select among the "bitcoin check" you have available.
The bank check is just an analogy, they don't call them checks but unspent transaction output (UTXO).

To put it simply a fork will produce a new Bitcoin blockchain (the blockchain is the ledger in which is registered the ownership of all the issued Bitcoins).
So after the fork, there will be a Bitcoin twin that will share the previous history with the original Bitcoin but will have a different future.
If you have Bitcoins before the fork you will have the twin Bitcoins too, the forked ones.
If you have your Bitcoin on a wallet that let you control your private key then you would be able to claim whatever forked coin will be created in future forks.
On Coinbase you can only control how to spend your coin but they don't give you control over your private keys. So it would be them that would have to claim the coin and then give you access to the forked coin. But they could decide not to support the forked coin, or it could take months for them to enable the support so you would not be free to claim the forked coins unless they allow you to.
That's why people withdraw bitcoins on wallets that allows them to control whether to claim the newly forked coin or to wait and see.
Coinbase is not particularly fork-friendly. They still don't support the fork happened on August 1th, while most of the other Bitcoin exchange already have.
I would strongly suggest to anyone to have their bitcoin in a wallet they fully control, meaning a wallet that allows you to control your private keys. 
I would suggest to you to watch as many videos on youtube as you need about receiving and sending Bitcoin with different wallets. The steps are always the same so you just need to gain confidence about the basics. It's only a matter of sending bitcoin to an address and receiving them on an address.

I'm not sure I'm following, what do you mean?
That's one of Antonopoulos' talks. He was talking about the illusion of protection in the stock market.
He was saying people think their investments are safe because the market we all know is regulated. Regulations equal illusion of protection against... say sub prime case to just make an example.
So he says best way people learn how to not lose money is by losing money, hopefully losing what you could afford to lose so by the next time you know a little better, and then again into a new cycle until after losing money, again and again, you still have some money left and you are more aware of how the market works.

Also, you would need redundancy storage or you would have to stop to offer the service in case of device failure. Redundancy means you would have storage devices not fully employed. Looking at this, in the same way, isn't it a waste too?

With Trezor (and with other [HD wallets]( HW or SW) you have a recovery seed that consists of 24 words. 
With those 24 words you can recover your wallet on any other HD wallet.
You have to store (in the exact order) those 24 (or 12 or 18, it depends) words somewhere safe.
Yes, that would be an additional point of attack if it wasn't for the fact that it is highly recommended to enable an additional passphrase you need to type in whenever you want to use funds from that wallet. You shouldn't write down this 25th word, it should be kept in your mind only.

The checksum is the end of the address and if the recommendation is to look for the checksum part to be the same then it's not only a matter of validating the address but to have it generated so that the double sha256 of the hashed pub key has the same 32 bits that end up being the checksum.

I take it that one of the problems you don't care Bitcoin should be able to address is centralization.
Because the path you suggest leads inevitably to that.
If a big miner can sweep out the entire mempool to collect fees, he will.
At this point, it should be proven quite definitely that miners are greedy, period. They don't have social incentive to do what they do, they only care about profit.
Small miners, on the other hand, will mine block with 1 transaction only trying to compete with bigger miners, by any means necessary. But this also means that when the reward will be mostly fees, smaller miners will have to give up.
Knowing things about markets doesn't help much if you can't make that knowledge to fit into the bigger picture. There are multiple aspects of Bitcoin you need to take into account when trying to decide which path the development should follow.

@_date: 2017-09-23 12:10:22
1) Everyone knows cryptos market manipulated. What's the problem, do you believe the fairy tale that other markets are not?
2) Of course Bitcoin goes through bubbles. Again, what's the problem? The current market cap is so tiny compared to other markets that in a couple of years these past bubbles will seem like a smooth curve in the charts.
3) A benchmark to value Bitcoin? How much would you value a currency that is borderless, open, transparent, decentralized, uncensorable... Priceless.
4) Bitcoin already has rules to, it's called consensus and you can try to cheat on it but you will lose your money.

Have you looked at the transactions I pointed out in this post (not just the charts)?
It is spam. And miners are the only one that could collect back at least part of the fees that it cost.
Competing miners will surely mine higher fees transaction, not the huge amount of 5 satoshi ones.

You can only regulate how exchanges work, governments can't dictate rules about the protocol.
So if governments set rules to avoid illicit behavior on exchanges how would it affect the protocol, how could it be tantamount to shutting it down.

@_date: 2017-09-24 01:02:22
I thought that full nodes were the ones guaranteeing that miners don't make a cartel and basically do whatever they want.
But, yeah you are right, why would we need to audit exchanges, or banks or other financial institutions. C'mon just trust them, all the numbers just add up, right? Why should we bother checking?
Also, what's the point on the blockchain, just use a SQL database. If you are saying that people should not be able to verify all the transaction that you send why use a blockchain in the first place? You don't need it.
Just trust the miners, they are doing their work completely selfless. They do it for the greater good, they don't want more money for themselves, that's a big lie that core devs spread out.

Why don't learn more about Bitcoin before accepting one or the other solution or even both?
From your comment, I guess you are a newcomer in this space.
No one said users are in total control. Who says that is wrong. Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized even in its own governance. The fact that it's difficult to change Bitcoin rules is a future, it's by desgin. So yes, users who run Bitcoin node, users who trade Bitcoin, users who hold Bitcoin have some control. But that's not the whole story.
Antonopoulos explains this way better than I could ever do so I'd suggest you to watch this short clip 
Also, I'd suggest you to browse Antonopoulos youtube channel because he is a great speaker who, as of 5 years ago, dedicated his career and basically his life to spreading knowledge about Bitcoin and you will surely find many interesting clips about several arguments.
Bitcoin is not as simple as many believe it is. If you want to dig a little deeper I'd suggest you this article:

You can delete emails, but try to delete something from a blockchain! Those spam transactions are permanently engraved in the blockchain. Thank God doing that has some cost and the block size is not infinite.
Edit: Also I guess you can't send attachment bigger than few MB unless you pay for a premium email service.
Edit 2: Well you can send bigger attachments, but using **2nd layer** services you need to link in your email ;-).
An authority filters your emails telling you what might be spam, but the purpose of Bitcoin is to not have an authority. 
An authority stops spammers using blacklists, but again, by design, no one can do that in Bitcoin.
Also, email providers put some spam advertise in the web interface you use to access your email and monitor your emails to guess what kind of advertising you might be more interested into, so no it's not for free, people gave up to privacy to have "free" email services.

You mean it's been at least 2 years they struggle to find a compromise.








But I'm pretty sure who wrote the message, I did paste in my previous post, meant that you can't develop a software with no team in just a couple of months and plan the fork before the software development has been completed. They are still working on it, and they want to deploy a software developed in such a hurry on a network worth 90 billion USD, that's crazy. And you would lie if you'd try to tell that you'd put your money on a software developed like that.


This is amazing. You are trying to deny history develop on precedent events by proposing an extreme example that should induce people to think the opposite. And I'm would be the one going with the slippery slope argument?
Honest question: if it happens once, what stops CEOs from gathering again to decide the future development of Bitcoin, again? What should stop a similar event if it already succeeded once? If you have even a shred of an answer I'm all ears.


This is the apotheosis. You are not even talking about the same topic anymore, amazing. Are you a politician? Because if you are not you are missing a big opportunity to a rich career.
A decentralized network changed by a handful of people, not common people but enterprises CEOs. This is a joke. But hey, you are against women right to vote if you try to oppose to a fork that doesn't have broad consensus. But hey, maybe we can find some sentence in the whitepaper that taken out of contest could prove us right modifying rules without consensus (actually, food luck with that). 


So enlighten me, what model do you suggest to develop an open source software? Get rid of all the devs you don't like? Give the commit right to whoever asks for it? Should we model it like wikipedia, where everyone should commit anything they like? No seriously, if there is a better model for that why didn't you tell us about it from the beginning?
There is something more to say about the development of the software, maybe I'm going to expand on this later.
You can fork the Bitcoin network, you can have your own dev team like Bitcoin Cash did. But why do you have to develop a software that only purpose is to swallow the Bitcoin network without even bother to have broad consensus? This is why it's a contentious fork, this is why is a takeover attempt. 
What you want is not Bitcoin if you are ok with a handful of CEOs overtake the Bitcoin network. Your hate for Core devs are making you blind. Go use XRP if you want a Corporate coin, it's cheaper, it's faster and you don't need consensus to make upgrades, everything is smooth.

You clearly don't deal much with the average people. (Edit: they are not stupid, they just don't know things, like many need a doctor to understand what disease they are affected by)
You need to make people the most aware possible of what threats are out there because if you just tell them "install this and install that and use software A" they just start trusting software and they think they are completely safe and then when they feel most comfortable about their safety is the moment they are more vulnerable.
They don't need to feel protected and safe, they need to be terrified about possible threats.
**Edit**: It's like what Antonopoulos says about protecting investors from doing bad investments
It's just the illusion of protection, because when they don't know anything about threats and how to avoid them because they think they are safe after installing a particular software, then they are not even capable of checking if the software is still running after a while.

If you have a Coinbase account you can access the GDax Exchange  simply following the procedure described in their support site 
GDax is owned by Coinbase that's why you can login with your Coinbase account and transfer funds to GDax and vice versa.
Buying Bitcoin from an exchange, especially GDax, mean you buy at lower fees (if you are a taker) than on Coinbase or even have with 0 fees (if you are a maker). Take a look at their fees help page 
Since buying Bitcoin on an exchange is quite different from buying Bitcoin on Coinbase I'd point you to this video  that explains exactly what you need to know (for example the difference between maker and taker). 
Edit: in this other video  you can see how to transfer funds from Coinbase to GDax and vice versa.

Hardware wallet. Specifically, my choice is for the Trezor.
With an HD wallet, you can import your xpub into your hot wallet on your smartphone and that allows you to check the balance and to send BTC to your cold wallet creating new addresses for every transaction.
Using a passphrase you can basically have multiple wallets within one single Trezor. Every time you want to use the Trezor you input the passphrase. You can have different passphrases for different cold wallets. So you can have passphrase A which you use for a minor cold wallet A. You can have passphrase B for a B cold wallet you keep more coins. You can passphrase C... you can imagine where this is going.
You should be familiar with 24 (12/18) words seeds. The passphrase is nothing else than the 25th word. So a different 25th word will yield a different private key hence a different wallet. 
So, even if someone could use a microscope to read the private key inside your Trezor, they couldn't do much without knowing the passphrases you use for your different wallets.
To me, this way allows for much more flexibility.

Because Satoshi was talking about it when the network didn't have any value. Nowadays the network value stands at around 90 billion USD so why the hell a group of miners that have the change to team up and plot something, would ever decide to destroy something worth a fortune?
Really, the 51% attack is the least likely, I'm willing to take a bet that we will never ever see it happening.
On the contrary, a spam attack is so sophisticated that people even doubt it is actually happening.
Hence my surprise when I read you talking about 51% attack. By no means the call it the Goldfinger attack.

You clearly don't know what you are talking about.
First of all, at present time the biggest part of the reward comes from block mining itself, 12.5 BTC. So you have not much power in that regard.
Second, if you take away the only incentive that keeps the network safe you are destroying the network value. So again you can't take away the reward.
Your claim that it does work for email is fallacious, so why do you insist on this. You don't even have a real case scenario where what you propose is actually working.
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:29:24
You should take a look at this 
Bitcoin will always be under some kind of attack. Part of the value of Bitcoin comes exactly from the fact that it is (or it becomes) resilient to those attacks.
We want Bitcoin to be the Internet of money hence, as much as the Internet survived and still survive to scams, viruses, spam, [the 5 trillion $ bubble of the dotcom]( malware, DDoS attacks ([every single day]( we want Bitcoin to mature and survive to forks, spam attacks, sybil attacks, corporate take over, possible bubbles (who says Bitcoin is in a bubble don't consider that Bitcoin is still way lower capitalized than how the doctom bubble was 93 billion vs 5 trillion).
If Bitcoin fails to survive to these attacks then Bitcoin wasn't a good project in the first place. But for now it seems it is surviving very well.
You can't just think of Bitcoin as an "easy" way to double your investment. 
When you want to get someone on board, you should explain to them "exactly" what Bitcoin is and not just suggest it to your friends because you are confident enough in this technology and you had some gain investing in it.
You can't just talk about the bright side of Bitcoin to your friends. 
Whenever I explain Bitcoin to people who want to invest money in it I tell them about Mt.Gox, I tell them about private key theft due to malware, I try to tell them as much as I can so they have a bigger picture of it. I don't feel at ease when they just invest in it because I did and because I believe in how revolutionary is this technology.
I'm confident that as long Bitcoin remain decentralized it will succeed.

I was forgetting about the first part of your question. Well, I never used Coinbase so I wouldn't know exactly which steps you should follow.
I just searched on youtube recent videos about sending bitcoin using Coinbase and receiving them with airbitz
Basically, on Airbitz you need to generate a new address for receiving Bitcoins. Then you need to paste the address on Coinbase or any other wallet that allows you to send bitcoins. When you copy paste an address, always check the first 3-4 characters and especially the last 5-6 characters of the address you pasted (last characters are the checksum of the address), this is because there are malware that when you paste an address they will replace it with one that might look like it. It's impossible to generate an address that starts and ends with the exact same characters so you just need to be sure to check them before confirming the transaction.

Why people wanting to move liquidity to and from exchanges because something is **happening right in that moment** would want to constantly (not in the initial phase only) set fees so low that they will surely miss anything that's happening? Weren't they in a hurry to move liquidity?
Thousands of transactions where under 5 satoshi and they continued to grow.

Be aware that if you lose your Airbitz password and you didn't set a recovery question you lose access to your funds and they can't help you because they don't store your password and they can't reset it without the recovery question as they clearly say in their FAQ 
I would recommend you to read all the FAQ section  Airbitz is a simple and powerful wallet for people that don't want to learn all the technicalities about private keys and such, their goal is to make it look like a home banking app, but still, the security model they implemented is such that if you lose your password you lose access to your Bitcoins. 
Hardware wallets are designed to never leak your private keys outside the device itself.
Meaning when you want to send Bitcoins to someone, you access to a web app, you digit the amount of Bitcoin, the recipient address, connect the hardware wallet and confirm your transaction on the web app.
At this point, the web app, through the browser, sends a request to the hardware wallet providing the hardware wallet all the information you inputted in the web page. The hardware wallet uses the private keys to sign a transaction then it sends the signed transaction back to the web app so the web app needs only to ship it to the Bitcoin network. The private keys are never stored on your computer, they will stay all the time in the hardware wallet.
No malware could extract the private keys from the hardware wallet because the device is designed to **never ever** send the keys outside, they didn't implement such a functionality. It only signs transactions you specify on the web app page.

I don't mean that miners do that trying to profit from it directly. It would require them to be colluded at some level. 
I just want to point out that it is less expensive then it is usually believed. And if they see it as a mean to achieve a goal they can invest some few BTC in doing it. And it seems it's working, because the only reason most people want bigger blocks is to pay less fees because most people don't care about technical implications.

No, you don't need to deposit BTC into the node wallet. With some wallet, you could route your signed transaction through your own node to increase privacy. Don't know if that's possible with Trezor.

BCH entourage claims they are the real Bitcoin. This equates to destroy the "other" Bitcoin.
2X people want to change the rules without even bothering about broad consensus. They are doing it to the point that they coded the 2x node software so that it hides its identity, so you can't decide to connect to those nodes or not.
Core devs don't want to implement changes that will put at risk a 70 billion market cap coin just because someone says so.

You can spend your Bitcoin while HODling at the same time.
You can have a small amount of fiat let's say something around 200 - 500 in an exchange as a reserve (depending on what are your spending habit). Or if you are not in a hurry to make the purchase you can transfer fiat to the exchange when you need to buy something with BTC.
Then you can purchase the product you want to buy with Bitcoin and at the same time, you buy the same amount of BTC you spent on the product.
This way you make BTC economy to flow and you don't have to give up on HODling.
Basically, it's like spending fiat but using Bitcoin.
Let's say you spend 0.1 BTC on a phone and you immediately buy 0.1 on the exchange, you basically spent 0.1 x 5700$ = 570$. But the merchant received BTC.

Premise: I don't know who Bernie Sanders is, I'm not from the US so no, I won't read about him on wikipedia.
Well, we are not talking about some garage project here, I know there are plenty of failed projects and inventions in history.
We are talking about projects that reached a widespread public and then at some point, after they've been laughed at, they failed or it became clear they succeeded.

You say that like you believed you just need to say it out loud to make it becomes true, but at some point you actually said it out loud and realized they are just words with no magical power.
To be honest I copy pasted those words not because I want them to make Bitcoin succeed but instead I believe Bitcoin will succeed and that makes me think those words are appropriate, not the other way around.
It's just like saying I really believe Bitcoin will succeed and I predict they will try to fight us. But that way it seems more powerful. I don't get why that sentence bothers you that much.
Looking at history the most appropriate example that comes to mind is Edison vs Tesla about AC. But I guess history is full of similar episodes. 
Maybe you find examples of the opposite.

Well, their update will not be an update, because 2MB block could take very long to propagate to the miners.
EDIT: It could introduce an enormous amount of latency for 2MB blocks to propagate, it could be unusable. Hence no actual upgrade.
I still hope Core devs can pull a rabbit out of the hat and let us be able to completely ban btc1 nodes when they don't propagate 2MB blocks.

A full validating node STOPS invalid blocks and TXs to propagate because in order to propagate an invalid block or TX need to be connected to a malicious node that will propagate the invalid block/TX.
Actually, you need to have a large network of malicious nodes to be able to spread invalid blocks around and hope they will reach a miner because a miner will connect to a fixed amount of node and that's it.
If a miner manages to connect only to valid nodes (and it will because it will ban malicious ones) at some point it will stop accepting new connections because it reached the desired amount. 
Then you'll have to route your blocks through the nodes the miner is connected to.

Even if it's just for a couple of months (until the threatened 2x hard fork) run a full node (if you can).
Edit: You just need to lend (to the community) a small part of your bandwidth in order to keep the Bitcoin network safer (for yourself too).
Don't think it's something complicated, you just need to make a couple of clicks to install the Bitcoin Core software.

They (2x) don't want it, they want to change the rules of Bitcoin because they decided so during a closed meeting they had.

They just want to make Bitcoin rules go where they want to.

Oh, so the problem is you can't deal very well with that example.
I'll walk you through it: people who know things so that they don't need to go to the doctor are people who studied medicine.
Sometimes even people who studied medicine need to go to the doctor too, maybe a specialist or maybe to ask a consult to a fellow doctor.
The same way a programmer may need a consult from a security expert, but you know, at the end of the day it only depends on how deep you need to dig on the matter.
You know, for example sometimes you don't need to visit a doctor if you have just a little cough, maybe you can just ask the pharmacist.
As I was saying it's just an example. Usually, you do examples to make it easier to understand a topic because you don't want to go into details because details complicate things.
But hey, if an example is so complicated for you maybe you should... I don't know like stop replying nonsense and making a fool of yourself.

To put it simply, malware can operate at the system level so if your device has been compromised an app could fail at protecting your data.
Also, you might lose your phone. 
You should think as the wallet on your phone as the actual wallet in your pocket. I bet you don't go around with 1000$ in your pocket, right?
If you have even just 500$ worth of Bitcoin you might want to but a hardware wallet, like the Trezor (my choice) or the Ledger Nano S.  Especially if you plan to hold onto your bitcoin for a while. I mean 0.16 Bitcoin on January was just 160$ now they worth 1000$. 
 - **Samourai** is a very interesting project because it aims at protecting the users privacy. 
 - **Electrum** is fine even though it couldn't be that user friendly.
 - I would suggest **Mycelium** too, it's a bit more intuitive.
 - For very very noob people I would suggest **Airbitz**. It keeps a copy of your private keys (encrypted so only you can use them after decrypting them with your pin) on a decentralized kind of storage. If you loose your phone you can recover your keys by installing airbitz and logging in with your user password and pin.
 - **Jaxx** seems fine even if very very slow (Oneplus 3T) but you would need it only if you are interested into a multicurrency wallet.
 - **I would strongly advice against Coinomi** If you want to know why you could read here  about a recent embarrassing fact they got involved into.

Unfortunately here in Italy people are reticent about digital payments in general. 83% of payment are still in cash. While in Europe the average is 65% (only 49% in Holland).  
In 2011 they banned cash payment over 1000 euros, but last year they raised the limit to 3000 euros.
Not even Bitcoin awareness is spreading here. The vast majority don't even know about its existence.
My colleagues (IT firm) just merely know the name Bitcoin, they just think it's kind of weird digital currency like the one you use on video games and since it's internet related they distrust it so much they are not even curious about it. 
They got just a tiny little bit curious when TV talked about it on january because BTC price was ahead of gold. By the way, BTC never got on TV news again since then, not even when it doubled the gold price.
Don't count italian people among the possible early adopters, even in case of a new financial crisis. Technological innovations here comes very late.
It would be definitely impossible here to do such a thing like living a week only on Bitcoin, not only because you couldn't find shop accepting it, but it would extremely hard to find people on the streets that could exchange it for fiat. 
Personally i have more than half of my savings in BTC and when i say it to people they look at me like i'm a complete fool instead of getting curious.
