what's the latest on Schnorr signatures the the developers actually making their wallet Segwit capable?
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:46:34
but surely they are OK to have the keys with no bitcoin in? (moved after fork).
...it's what I have been doing... Is my wallet at risk?
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:28:13
why is that?
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:20:34
what website can i track the percentage of all segwit transactions? 
what percentage do we need to get this to so we can start feeling better about transaction fees?
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:57:49
I have an older version
Do I need to uninstall that first before downloading the latest version (and then input my seed).
Or, do I just download the new one and input the seed – in affect temporarily having 2x versions of electrum installed on the same PC?

.........for those who have been around a long-ish time..
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:55:48
this makes perfect sense.
as does just some communication from CORE.
where are they? where is the plan?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:03:49
i posted the same question yesterday and the post was deleted. 
we do this now we kill bcash and improve bitcoin.
its a simple answer, surely? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:33:08
any reason why?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:30:20
can they not just copy and paste segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:34:13
if it was done recently it will probably appear in time. The exchanges are getting battered right now with new money entering the system.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:15:06
HODL indeed, lol!
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:32:58
any reason why?
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:09:02
I'm being serious.... If they cant shut down BTC-E (for whatever fake reason they tried to), they wont shut down any exchange ANYWHERE!
It's the Pirate Bay of the internet.
 for their 100% new site, and if you want to buy some coins or do some trading, do it here...
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:22:22
look at their official twitter.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:52:11
they even refunded BCH.
BTCE need supporting and applauding. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:58:03
BTC-E deserve respect.
They even dropped BCH.
Quite f*cking unbelievable.
 trustworthy exchange on the planet and should be supported by the Crypto community...
You want Crypto to survive? Support BTC-E.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:12:14
So let me get this right…….
If I had 100 BTC I will have 55BTC in my account.
And 45 worth of tokens (45 x 3k = 135,000 BTCE Tokens?)
How would I turn these tokens back into $$?
If I had $100,000 on the account, I’d have $45,000 given to me in coins and have 55,000 BTCE tokens?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:23:17
Agreed... But if you want to give someone the fee - give it BTC-E.
Do it for the crypto world. Supportt BTC-E.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:10:38
More free money = more free bitcoin!! 
I love hardforks
Who doesnt love dividends??
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:15:30
it isnt hard, just remove from exchange.
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:41:21
Can you list the positives of this over binance? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:36:03
'muh hodl' had worked well since the beginning of Bitcoin...
we were proved wrong once! 
hopefully this time next year 'muh hodl' will still have made sense.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:27:38
after Gox and BTCE (and many others)..... worrying its following a similar pattern.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:23:07
 of Crypto
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:29:01
CEX.IO on $2644
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:19:53
How much has everyone lost?
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:33:41
if this is true I'm done with Bitcoin...I didnt have much, but enough to stop caring. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:36:31
It will stop and plateau but God knows where.. 15,000

*So for those that don’t know, Gab is a social media platform that promotes freedom of speech. It is in direct competition with Twitter and has the potential to be a real competitor. It has many users that are banned from other networks because reasons and feelings.*
*It’s owners love bitcoin. Endlessly promoting it on social networks.*
*They love it as they know the powers that be cannot control it like they do with freedom of speech.*
*My thoughts – can we somehow get Gab to implement a Lightning Network tip bot on the site? Anyone in the know of how this could work needs to contact Gab and see if they can work it up together.*
*If all users were given a certain amount of Satoshi’s it can be used instead of the “Like” button and I should imagine it would go viral and be very popular. Other competitors (Twitter/Facebook), might also not want to be left behind in the “content wars”.*

Patreon banning people for "wrong-think" and Gab actively looking to implement bitcoin on their social network could see us return to more positive times ahead.
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:38:58
  
Lightening Network tip bot on Gab…
If this happens – MOON.
