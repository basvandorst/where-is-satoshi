Oh, I totally didn't mean it that way, haha silly me. I guess what I meant was to increase the number of projects that I will be paid with bitcoin. I will still accept Paypal projects and the like, but I would prefer bitcoin from the latter.

I'm actually a very excited with OpenBazaar and I've created a website design for them for fun.

When we worked on eduluminate.com, our client decided that they will do the copy writing themselves, and they will just change them. I may be being biased, but I think our portfolio doesn't really look scammy.

Really glad you guys like it. Aside from doing the design, I also coded the it as well. Had to take into account that the UI will be used as an ATM, and not a website. 
This is actually a finished project, and all the files are already sent to the client. I'll send over your comments to my client! :)

Glad you like it! I've actually contacted them before I made the design, and already showed it to their lead dev.

This is a very different case. When you buy an Android phone, you do not have to read up on anything on how to use this. It is very easy to configure, and you only need to press next on majority of instances when setting up your phone for the first time.

Majority of the population doesn't need to use Photoshop though. PS is used mainly for their jobs or hobbies. This is a totally different case with having somewhere to put your money for safe use. 
If I need a place to put my money safely, I just go to the bank, give out my ID, and done. With hard wallets, etc. I have to read up on documentation, pros/cons, etc. Aside from that, I also have to worry about my computers security and getting hacked and losing my money. This is rarely the case for banks since you have insurance on your money.
