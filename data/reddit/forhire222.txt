Maybe he's dead?


The real Satoshi would be able to quite easily prove without any doubt that it's him. Nobody has done that.


There's a limited supply because the rate at which new coins are created decreases until it hits zero.


He never revealed his real life identity.
All of these questions can be answered reading the wikipedia on Bitcoin.

It's the pool of transactions that are waiting to be confirmed by miners. That's all it is. Only 1MB worth of transactions can be confirmed every 10 minutes, so transactions sit in the pool while they wait.

No, because by design there is no spam in Bitcoin. These people are paying for their transactions to be mined, their use of the tech is just as valid as yours. Nobody gets to decide what is spam and what isn't, or question people's motivation behind transactions.

Nodes don't make money. They lose money. Nodes are what you have to run to use Bitcoin, and not trust someone else about the state of the ledger. If you use a wallet, and it isn't pointing at your own node, then you're using somebody else's node and trusting them. Which essentially means that you're not using Bitcoin.

The problem with this is the second sentence.
Bitcoin is not a community. It is only a technology. The "community" that forms around it is completely irrelevant, and to be honest probably detrimental. Take a look at this sub, it's just an endless stream of zero-quality posts about whats happening with the price now, what might happen with the price in the future, quasi-motivational speeches about how to not worry about the price (when it's going down), drama calling other members shills, and the occasional post that shows that nobody here actually understands even the basics of what a hash is.
That's pretty much 99% of this sub. Anyone who thinks this has any value at all is kidding themselves.
Core developers do not need us to continue making bitcoin. They don't need the "community" to keep making Bitcoin great.

Bitcoin does not guarantee fast or cheap. So go use something else.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:17:58
No, they're not. They don't violate any aspect of any Bitcoin specification.
There is no requirement in Bitcoin that your transactions be either cheap, or fast. That's not written as a requirement anywhere. Take a look.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:08:23
It's not because you miss the opportunity to make money.

I'm guessing someone is dumping it to keep the profitability of mining it just below the BCH altcoin. If you look at  you'll notice that even during the oscillation period that makes BCH minable, if Bitcoin just gains a little bit more value there will be no reason to ever mine cash, and it will die.
As soon as Bitcoin got close, it's price was tanked.

It has bigger blocks, so it's not the same code.

The benefits of decentralization are mostly invisible until you see what happens to those people who throw it away. That will be the wake-call to many. Remember, every single alternative currency system that has ever been around was taken down sooner or later by governments and LE.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:35:11


99% the same code is the difference between a self-driving car breaking in time or driving off the edge of a cliff. Do you think you'd be able to scramble 1% of a person's DNA with no adverse effects? :S
A single comment in bitcoin can turn it into PayPal-levels of centralization.
BCH is more centralized because of the code changes that allowed it to have bigger blocks. This is the entire reason everyone opposes big blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:03:56
That was fantastic.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:08:52
They're not against increasing block size. They're against increasing block size at a rate that would increase centralization.
All current data says that just to *maintain* the current levels of decentralization, which are poor, blocks should be lowered to 300kB and grown at ~17% per year. That's a fact.
So why are people demanding 8MB+ blocks? There is no reason except that they simply don't care about centralization, it doesn't affect their business model. They want more transactions, more adoption, cheaper fees, at whatever expense, even if that means abandoning the Bitcoin vision and turning it into a worse PayPal. They simply don't care.
You'll notice that all the "big block" people have financial ties to established companies in the crypto world that will benefit directly from bigger blocks. While Core &amp; Blockstream have none, except baseless accusations of secret patents that they constantly deny and nobody can provide any evidence at all that they own.
That's really all there is to it.

99% of them exist for no other reason than to scam users. It isn't nearly as diverse as you think it is. Bitcoin Cash is one of those.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:08:36
No. Stay far away from BitPay, they're trying to trick users into using an altcoin that doesn't have replay protection with btc, so people may get all their real Bitcoins stolen. Again, stay far away from BitPay.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:37:26
No, bitcoin cash exists so that miners can seize control of bitcoin. The need to scale is why SegWit and Lightning exist.
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:45:07
Because that's the only way to actually be using Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:28:38
Afaik market cap of alt-coins is not accurate because developers of those coins hold massive quantities. A more accurate measure would be the total value of transactions over, say, a week period.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:57:34
You're giving into massive centralization of the network just to appease big organizations with probably millions of dollars. There's no reason to do this.
Compromise for the sake of compromise almost always leads to poor results. SegWit already allows for more transactions to fit into blocks.
 the resource costs for bitcoin (Bandwidth for instances), push most people out of ever considering running a full node themselves, and as a result the network is already centralized. The best thing to do would be to decrease block sizes. But, due to the drama that will cause, the second best option is to just leave it at 1MB for the next few years as technology catches up.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:25:36
It's already highly centralized. The average total bandwidth costs, not including the initial download, is about ~300GB/month to run a full node. Since many people have limited data plans, such as myself, even in places like San Francisco, this makes it simply impossible to run a full node without getting calls from your ISP. If it tried to run a full node at home, I would genuinely be risking my internet being shut off.
Raising the block size to 2MB would easily double this, making it even more prohibitive than it already is.
It's also important to note that node count is not all that matters, but also where the nodes are ran. 100 nodes under AWS do less for decentralization than a single node running at home. If people are forced to move from running nodes on their Raspberry Pi's to cloud services, even if node count is the same, this is a massive blow to Bitcoin.

Take a read through "Mastering Bitcoin" and make sure you understand all of it. It's a rather simple read, and the book is free online.
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:36:30
There is literally none of that in bitcoin. There is barely even cryptography in bitcoin.
Most of bitcoin is just a few discrete concepts linked together. If you understand the general principles behind P2P networks, Public Key Cryptography, and basic hashing, you know 100% of the tech behind bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:28:07
It wouldn't matter, because you would be able to put some kind of price tag onto the side-product being produced. Then you factor that price into the cost of mining bitcoin, and all you've done is find a way to make bitcoin mining more profitable (or cheaper).
Thus more people will start mining, the market will get saturated with the side-product ("prime factors") you are producing, and the value will drop, decreasing the profitability of mining.
Eventually it balances out and you end up where you are now.
Tethering random side-products to the PoW accomplishes nothing in the long run. It's actually important that it cannot be used for anything other than mining.

The less time you allow between the two spends, the more likely it is that the merchant will notice it before giving you the coffee.
If you wait a longer period of time, such as paying for the coffee, taking it, and walking out the door, the less likely it is that your double spend will succeed.
So you're stuck having to choose between sending the transactions close together, or far apart. Neither one will work.
