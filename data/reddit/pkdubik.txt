Could you explain further?  I don't see your point.

Let's hear it then

Were you able to get this worked out?

Why only if it drops?

Think of it not as "risk".  Try using the word "cost".  It cost him his time.  It cost him (or someone, if not him) electricity.  And it definitely cost CPU cycles (you seem to miss the concept of having those CPUs do one thing and not another...).
Are you familiar with how any insurance at all works?  It would work the exact same way as that.  A majority of users paying for a service (repayment in the case of theft) that only a minority actual use (when theft does occur).  Pretty simple!
I'm going to ignore your last statement.  I think you are misunderstanding the conversation far more than the last user you responded to.

I am American and thus have access to all this.  I would be willing to help if you want to talk about it.  It's a lot of money, so we'd need to figure out a way to make you comfortable about it, but it's an option.

Could you each give me a few sentences on your position?  Why is Ripple good or bad?

Okay, sounds good.  Let me know if you ever need help with it though.  I am sure we could reach a point at which you are comfortable doing the transaction through me.  I live in nyc, so I'm easy to meet if you are on the East Coast.  The value for me would be high because I would be helping someone with something I believe in.  Also, I am young and have only been mildly exposed to the business world, so even tangentially seeing what you do would be good for me.
