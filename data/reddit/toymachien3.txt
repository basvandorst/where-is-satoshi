Nobody is ever able to know what will happen after the halving. It can go up, it can go down, it can do nothing at all. You are just making a bet and you COULD have massive gains or losses. If you're not ready to lose everything, don't do it.

I'm sorry. To actually answer on your question: Yes you'll be able to sell your bitcoin anytime if you use an exchange like Kraken. If you don't intend to sell them, don't store them on the exchange website. Transfer your bitcoins to a bitcoin wallet. For added security, set up a 2-factor authentication one.

Kraken is my favourite and I think its the best option for you. It is the cheapest way because of the exhange rates other services offer but you need to set up an account first. You can also buy btc at localbitcoins if you do not want to set up an account with an exchange. But be aware, the prices are higher and choose a trustworthy vendor.

Hodl never stops until you die, your kids die and their kids die.

No, it would still be visible through the blockchain. This is not the subreddit for these types of questions! Go to the other ones! I advise you to not use third party tumblers.
