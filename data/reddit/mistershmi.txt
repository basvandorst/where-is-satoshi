- sensuous gardens for martyrs


- murdering people who reject or demean their beliefs


- extra-judicial honor killings


- suppression of women


- a religious text with 109 verses with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels and calling those who do not join the fight 'hypocrites' and say they'll be sent to hell


- a prophet who slaughtered non-believers, took child brides, and was a genuine tyrant




Narrated 'Aisha:
that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).

If there’s one thing this sub will never forget it’s the treachery of Roger Ver and Coinbase. Those two things have been constants from the day I joined this sub a couple months ago.

if you really believe that, then there is no point in debating this with you.

I don't respect "religious beliefs" that consist of:
- sensuous gardens for martyrs
- murdering people who reject or demean their beliefs
- extra-judicial honor killings
- suppression of women
- a religious text with 109 verses with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels and calling those who do not join the fight 'hypocrites' and say they'll be sent to hell
- a prophet who slaughtered non-believers, took child brides, and was a genuine tyrant

Because insider trading occurred
Because they did it completely unannounced
Because they did it right before a difficulty increase 
Because they supported S2X and previous Bcash pumps
Because Brian Armstrong and Roger Ver are buddies
Because Bcash is literally one of the least legitimate Altcoins they could have chosen from (imagine if they did ethereum Classic...that would never happen)
Because they did this BEFORE implementing Segwit, which was way more important
Because they literally said the other day in a press release they wouldn’t be releasing new stuff like Segwit  because they were more focused on stability and security, then they went and did this, all in the face of constant outages anytime their traffic spikes, and further showed this with the total bug laden shitshow that was this Bcash launch
