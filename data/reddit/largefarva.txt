Okay, I've been following this for a few weeks. What possible benefit could there be to giving these folks your money over buying yourself? I doubt they will dabble in altcoin day trading , and the number one rule of security with btc is to never let someone else control your coins.

My take is that Pokerstars bought FullTilt in order to quiet down investors and avoid a crushing amount of regulation, or an outright ban of their industry.  They didn't buy a failing business to turn it around, they did it to stop the bleeding.

Bingo, that's the jist. The trustless and irreversible nature of bitcoin is a double edged sword. It's fast, easy to use, but also simple to fuck up.

I've watched a lot of CNBC's "American Greed".  Here's what usually happens:

-make a run for it while employees are left holding the bag, to buy some time before an arrest warrant goes out.

"password" instead of "private key" 
"account number" instead of "wallet address" 
 enforces the idea that it's all stored in the cloud, and all the different clients just let you log into the system.  It also demystifies the whole thing to old people by using concepts they already know. 
Also implicitly discourages people from using online wallets.   "so you're telling me all they do is hold my password and tell me my account balance?" 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:10:40
Because people are stupid and refuse to listen to advice. We're still seeing it with cryptsy and btc-e.

@_date: 2014-02-04 02:46:25
Not sure how you made the connection of Metcalfes law to the situation here. We already make do with multiple currencies in Europe without blinking an eye.  I can swipe my card and have it magically dispense Swedish krona, Norwegian krone, finnish kroner. With today's technology, (especially with cryptos!) the name of the currency is nothing but a unit multiplier. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:45:42
I think a better analogy we should make is that bitcoin is the Esperanto of currency. It's nobody's daily currency, but it's the great equalizer when trading across borders.

I always find it ironic that there are so many computing resources working to mine and secure the network, yet the most secure way to store your coins is writing it down on a piece of paper and hiding it the old fashioned way.

People in Zimbabwe would disagree with him too, i think. I agree that bitcoin is redundant in economically stable countries, but it's a very stirring alternative in countries where people are not so fortunate. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:20:08
Serious question, how do we improve BTC usability for normal "everyday" scale transactions such as buying a hotdog or a pair of socks?
The vendor would either need to:
a. wait ~10 min for a confirmation to come through the network (inconvenient for the consumer)
b. let the buyer walk away without network confirmation (which I could easily see a fake payment app to scam the seller).

a buddy at work bought washington mutual (WM) back when the price was 5 cents, dropped about 10k into it.  Was ecstatic when there was news that it might get bought out and the price tripled.  Then not so happy when they declared bankruptcy and value plummeted to zero.  and stayed at zero.
For about 3 months, every time i passed him in the hall i said "woo hoo!".  He didn't find it as funny.
