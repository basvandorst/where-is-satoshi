An American. USD is our local money. The federal bank ensures its steady decline in value via interest or dark magic.   So if I take enough money to buy a 1000 hamburger and hide it under my bed.  In 20 years I'll only be able to buy about 500 hamburgers.

I'm just broke AF and under employed. 
If I was working full time, hells yeah I would. 
(I'm actually buying anyways, but its like 20$ worth).
