Not sure how they'd legally implement a guilty until innocent policy, unless they had reason based on criminal history. Joe Schmo shouldn't have their funds delayed or frozen just because it triggers the alert by being over $10K - that's really not much money at all.

Yes, it triggers a report. It means nothing. There's no reason they'd be "holding it up" unless they have reason to believe OP's money has criminal ties.

Because my bills are currently paid from there, and cash itself is trash just the same. I have more in crypto than fiat.

I use a bank today only because I have to. Crypto isn't to the point yet where it's feasible to not use a bank.
Banks are crooks and I look forward to their demise.

If you've done your research, you'd know BTC is a sack of shit right now that does nothing but holds alts down which have real potential. Diversify.

Sure, the true shit coins. But there will be great coins still around, and new great ones with them. Bitcoin will become the alt or forgotten shitcoin if it can't solve scaling. Even then, waiting at least 20 minutes for confirmations is absurd when other coins do it much faster. There really isn't much reason for Bitcoin to stay on top when it's the best at absolutely nothing anymore, is there?

Just because YOU were late to the game doesn't mean you should wish bad things on other people.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:09:51
Completely wrong. Research before spreading your ignorance.

God forbid someone actually use Bitcoin as a currency to buy something!
You idiot.

Fuck banks.

They're polyurethane and better than even the best leather. My previous vehicle (before Tesla) had all-natural Laguna leather by ELMO. The Ultra White "pleather" is superior even to that. And almost any "leather" in an average car is cheap shit.

Just all depends on how you look at it and the person who receives the message perceives it. Frankly I wouldn't give a shit if this is "defacing" because it's true. Bitcoin needs more public attention and this is just another way to do it.

Mining is nice if you have hardware to do it. Even just using my gaming PC to mine whatever the most profitable coin is, I essentially invest $10 a day into BTC and my actual cost (electricity) is only about $1 per day.

I have 2 Titan X Pascal 2016 cards. ZCash mining is typically what brings me the most cash. It was alternating between that and LBC for awhile. Back in June I was making $30 a day.

What can you tell me about whether or not someone has to file form 8938?

The idea of Tether is a god send when trying to short during a market dip though... used it several times with success to either increase my holdings, or minimize risk. I know Tether seems shady as fuck... but it works. Only concern is whether or not it blows up one day and everyone left holding it is screwed.

Couldn't you just send the coins from your paper wallet to your Coinbase wallet address?

A $14.90 fee for a $1,000 exchange is absurd? Hmm... 1.49% seems reasonable to me.

Ah, gotcha. I'm new to this. Thanks for the info.
