That's why you can create several wallets, isn't it?

Yeah. People can argue all they want against any individual being able to do whatever without being tracked, but rapists, pedophiles, drug abuse and so on will still exist regardless of having such a privacy-focused system in place or not. It's like saying cars are not viable because accidents can happen. It's not the car's fault, it's reckless driving, improper roads and signs, etc, and those should be addressed individually, not be a reason for the system not to be implemented.

Indeed. Most if not all of the mentioned problems are deal breakers to me.  is the one that upsets me the most. (Meant  on my last reply, will edit)

Guys, honest question (in a comment since I feel creating a thread for this isn't worth it): I've never invested in bitcoin, but I'll currently have a little more cash left over. I'm thinking of investing around $100 each month, building my wallet little by little over time. Should I do it?

Woah. ~~ \ already invalidates any interest I could have in ETH.  
EDIT: Meant  instead of  although all of them are pretty bad imo.

Man it pained me when the other dude tried to argue "who says what the worth of it is?". Sounds like something someone who's in a very layered bubble would say. His following replies reinforced that.
