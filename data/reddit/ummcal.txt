It's a great investment, but please  DO NOT BUY NOW. Just look at the graph, there will be a crash to ~300. Put your money in Bitstamp or whatever and make a buy order at $300. Forget about it untill you read in the newspapers that it crashed.
I'll be downvoted for this but is not the best playce to ask whether or not you should buy some.
