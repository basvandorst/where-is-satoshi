I also recommend Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:41:58
Nice to know, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:05:24
I agree on hardware wallet or even Desktop/Web wallet, paper wallet let's say is that is too hardcore and unpractical when we're in the digital age. Bitfenix for trading is a great choice!
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:00:23
I agree, why would people trade on IQ Option? If you are serious about crypto trading I'll recommend you exchanges such as Bitfinex which is currently the biggest and most advanced exchange out there. Their registration will be open back by January 15th for those asking.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:49:40
I suggest you use Bitfenix as your trading platform but aswell increase your investment budget. Bitcoin fees are currently way high and can cost up to £11 alone in transactions fees, or trying buying a forked version of Bitcoin like Bitcoin cash or Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:42:30
That's correct buddy.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:29:53
Same for me. +1 Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:28:12
I agree patience pays off.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:23:45
But meanwhile, you can still trade while they verify your account. Bitfinex is opening user registration again this January 15th.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:23:35
Arbitrage at its finest.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:27:01
How can you say that, are you able to see future or something? Cause if it happens, I would be more than happy to buy as much as I can.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:48:28
From Bitfenix I experienced a great service and resolved my issues. Hope yours can be resolved too good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:09:55
I wanna get that art too, it looks cool.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:16:16
If we adopt it they have too. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:37:24
Who wrote this article? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:07:45
Seems like a good choice, hope you will get some profits off it. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:05:22
I filed my ticket like 2 weeks ago, but they resolved it within 48 hours ago. But I suggest you be patient, as during holidays traffic loads tend to spike, so is normal that they are experiencing delays. Heck, even some exchanges aren't accepting new users because of the high demand! But Bitfenix will serve you your justice, no worries mate! 
Happy new year!
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:13:45
rt. don't share your personal details anywhere else but only on Bitfenix official websites.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:28:49
Don't get worried, ignore people who are trying to scare you with the prices and HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:24:36
It needs to be at r/bitcoincash
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:21:24
I hope you are able to return people their funds, imagine how happy the would be.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:47:43
This is Reddit and you're able to commnet or post your opinions, news, and more... Enjoy!
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:34:22
I was waiting for this sale to be honest.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:55:49
You have interesting way of telling stories.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:58:07
And now it has gone down...
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:44:18
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:09:37
Lads this is just the 2nd month of 2018. We have a long way to go with a lot of profits ahead!
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:00:35
Basically, because BTC is the face of crypto like the USD to FIAT.
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:46:14
They have been lowering it.
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:31:37
Report this scammer.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:41:41
I see but people sometimes get too paranoid about what's going on in the cryptomarket and they just spread FUD so is better to keep calm and let the CFTC do their job.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:10:51
So accurate.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:37:27
Yep, it has been quite awhile already.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:28:05
Nice! Congrats on your smart trade!
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:16:29
Well, It has surpassed it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:50:40
It's exactly like that.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:21:51
Sadly that's the truth. There is no moral in this game and you need to know how to play and trade your cards correctly if you want to generate profits.
@_date: 2018-03-05 05:10:08
True, but people mindlessly follow everything that he said.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:21:42
Exactly, at big exchanges such as Bitfinex it can be done easily.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:16:10
Being investigated doesn't mean you're guilty.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:53:28
Getting them back to Bitfinex and get ready to enjoy Segwit on its fullest :)
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:59:12
Yep, because Bitcoin can.
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:46:50
Nice, hope you enjoy your trip!
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:46:51
I hope GPU manufacturers sort out this situation soon.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:09:06
I agree with you. Upvoted!
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:38:39
They're used to another type of stuff and now because they don't get crypto they want to discredit it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:41:24
Nope just bringing out a new alternative for users.
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:31:40
Just as a daily dogecoin chart.
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:19:23
nice way to explain your own situation.
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:46:26
Nothing much man, seems like Roger Ver is trying to get his coin up a little bit.
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:01:51
Keep it going guys, it's becoming interesting.
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:15:10
People are gonna think you are weirdo or something.
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:49:51
That's why they suggest you not to store your funds on the exchanges.
