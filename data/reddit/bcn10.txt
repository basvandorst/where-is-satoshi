Dude please have like a 70/30 BTC to fiat ratio. I don't know if you read charts much but it's not looking good 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:44:58
is bitcoin your first time buying into something that traded like a stock? take a peak at the charts. BTC is on a very large leg down at the moment

Did you get to the end with all the nice stuff ? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:25:23
hey man, you are young. chalk it up as a learning lesson. you will be ok in the end. i promise. dont beat yourself up over it. Your life is worth more than some money you will earn multiple times over in your life

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:06:21
Some of the financial advice in this sub is crazy lol. If you think investing into bitcoin is better than paying off debt then you are in some serious trouble

@_date: 2017-11-10 22:27:30
bruh, your asking questions about things that have not happened yet. No one on this planet has any clue exactly what will happen. buy and hold if you believe, sell and cry if you dont. thats it.

bitcoin cash pump and dump 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:11:12
no. do not do this. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:12:39
it literally says in the first sentence that a betting website is taking bets on IF McDonalds will start accepting it.. reading is good 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:21:11
that would only increase the value of the ones in circulation

@_date: 2017-11-30 18:10:07

Is that really true ? I thought you only get 20% of the gains assuming you own .20 BTC
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:39:23
Sorry I misread his comment. I thought he said if it goes up 200 he gets 200 only if he owns .2
