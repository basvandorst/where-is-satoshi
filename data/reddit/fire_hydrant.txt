How did you print a physical copy of the Gyft Card?  I have only ever used Gyft cards by showing the QR code on my phone at the check-out.

Assuming a price of $0 as the cost basis from mining would make the accounting so much easier.  Then the only time you pay taxes would be for capital gains.

Regarding the issue of "collecting" the tip.
Send a paper wallet via UPS/USPS - and require a signature on delivery.  This will be confirmation that someone in his office has accepted it on his behalf!

I am in the same boat here - I just received an invoice from TD for the full amount of my purchase, which I paid in full in Bitcoin.  How did it end up working out for you - any suggestions?

Anecdotal evidence?
I, too, could hand pick examples from the past and prove a point for anything I want.

Does running A/C to cool said mining operation count in electricity usage?  If mining pulls 1kW during summer, do I calculate the additional cost of A/C unit to offset this heating?

Those multiple $300 Amazon Gyft cards add up quickly, though :)

I think you may need to multiply the x axis by a scaling factor? If the fluctuations were every 100 days, the period is T=100 (days).  This would correspond to a frequency of 1/100 (1/days).  f=1/T.

Are there plans for Geant4 to run on GPUs in the near future?  As far as I know, it only runs on CPUs now.

If this is truly frequency domain (as OP suggests),  then the units would most likely be inverse time (1/days).
