I recently signed up for cryonics (with a level term life insurance that pays for it in case of my death, really cheap actually (the cost of cryonics is $28,000)), maybe I should do something like this...

Just remember that, in the long run, you can only lose money. Those sites choose the probabilities so that on average they gain money. So unless you have somehow the opportunity to exploit the system in ways the provider did not intend then gambling is never a valid strategy to make money.


Playing a few times for fun is fine but expect to lose money.

I like it. 1 bic = 1 **bi**t**c**oin

If this would work, they would have no difficulties getting the funding from investors. Fusion energy is not some obscure project that only a handful of people care about.

There are altcoins that do just that.

Well, you probably didn't pay taxes.

My suggestion: bic (from **bi**t**c**oin, pronounced bik)
* it's derived from the name (that means it's exclusive to bitcoin. The problem with names from pop culture or famous people is that they don't help to distinguish bitcoin)
* there is no obvious preexisting connotation
* the [proposed]( small b (**ƀ**) still works

I don't think there should be a need for altcoin discussion here. Everyone is free to create their own multireddit with etc if they want to read news about altcoins.

I never actually had problems with country restrictions with PayPal.
As you said it works just fine for microtransactions most of the time but it still feels hacked together. It just adds another layer above the banks but doesn't solve the problem. For example, it's highly centralized. You can't found another payment processor company that also uses the "PayPal protocol". Also, PayPal often has to act as an escrow service when it comes to chargebacks. Escrow is of course very useful but I don't think only one such service for all kinds of businesses is the best solution to this. Right now, every time you buy something from a vendor with PayPal, you have to identify yourself not only to the vendor but also to PayPal as a third party.
Also, you definitely need a bank account for PayPal.

Well, as far as I know Reddit's vote fuzzing adds equal numbers of downvotes and upvotes. So the "sum" (or rather the difference) of all votes stays the same. ([Here]( is a post about the reasons to do this.)

I guess so. Otherwise it wouldn't make much sense.


I also saw this being mentioned here and if that's true, I don't see how one could trust zero confirmation transactions at all...
But you have a misunderstanding there. A transaction always spends all coins, so to say. The coins that you want to keep are transferred back to you in the same transaction ([here]( is also a discussion of this). So every transaction must have a known predecessor.

That's so stupid. Why doesn't the military use cars in combat if they're so effective? How would you even do that? It might be easy to kill a bunch of people standing on the road, not seeing you coming but they would only need to enter the nearest building or get onto some kind of plateau and they'd be safe.
Maybe you meant 'I can imagine some very unlikely circumstances where a person without any training in either can kill more people with a car than with a gun'.
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:16:09
Srsly, is OP this stupid or is he the scammer?

In my opinion, it would be a waste of bitcoin's potential if we concentrate on those applications. What you described can be handled with fiat just fine. Maybe it could be handled with bitcoins even better but it's not one of bitcoin's killer features. And there is still the question of legality.
What I would like to see more is the usage of bitcoins as micropayments on the internet. [This]( is a really great idea for example. I feel we haven't even started to realize the potential here. I want to buy high resolution versions of pictures on deviantart. I want to buy albums on bandcamp. I want to tip people for their mixes on soundcloud. I want to buy computation time on AWS. All those things with bitcoin. This is what the internet is about. It shouldn't matter in which country I live and which bank I use. This is why we need magic internet money.

If you are looking for an actual answer: it's for historical reasons. r/btc split from r/bitcoin years before the BCH hard fork. And originally r/btc was just about Bitcoin (there was only one Bitcoin then). Then during the big blocksize debate, people who were pro big blocks tended to discuss in r/btc and people who were anti big blocks discussed in r/bitcoin. Then the compromise agreement failed and the big blockers didn't want to wait any longer and forked. As r/btc was mostly big blockers, r/btc became, more or less by accident, the place to discuss the forked coin BCH.
There has been discussion to rename the subreddit ([example]( but it would take some effort to move everyone to a new subreddit.

I agree with you. It's ok if you can choose the level of anonymity you want to have when buying things with Bitcoins. If I buy things with credit card, the seller also knows my identity. If I buy drugs with cash around the corner, it's kinda anonymous but things can go wrong. You can do both with Bitcoins.
This whole idea of 'Coin Validation' is just stupid though and it will show soon. We will surely find other ways of making sellers and buyers happy.

That's not the point. The statement was that:
ROI &gt; 0 =&gt; break even
He didn't state the opposite:
break even =&gt; ROI &gt; 0
which would have been false.

That's more of a question about the interface of your program than about the protocol.
