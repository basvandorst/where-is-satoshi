"The question is then, how does the smart contract know the exchange rate of USD to bitcoin. It's living on the blockchain so doesn't have access to external data."
I would imagine it is hard coded to forex API's that are worldwide standards.
"The CEO seems to say "large holders of Bitcoin", but somehow claims that by taking this side do not take on any risk. I don't see how that can be true. They leverage their Bitcoin exposure."
They do take on risk, but they are rewarded by accruing interest for this exposure. He says they would collect a fee equivalent to 6% ish interest per year, which when calculated in the serveral hour or several day smart contract, ends up being a very small price for the other party.
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:37:13
Good point. I wonder if that is/could be mitigated by placing actual BTC in the smart contract as collateral? Obviously it would a static amount, but that could at least represent the lion's share of the fund in case the exchange suddenly went belly-up.

Additionally, The phone DOES have the private key. Also, currency exchange is indeed an MSB, but I think the difference is that it isn't as strict as a money transmitter. For instance, I think you can get up to $10,000 of currency exchanged without ID. No paperwork.
@_date: 2016-08-30 02:31:46
As I have learned, paxful is getting the majority of its business from backpage.com users and advertisers. I'm not sure about LBC.
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:13:39
So as far as I understand:
1. The money sender will pay an MSB (money service business) in their local country with local currency. Example: I am in USA and I walk to the 7/11 MSB with USD in hand.
2. The local 7/11 MSB will take my USD and instantly buy a smart contract from an exchange where the exchange agrees to pay out BTC equivalent to whatever currency that is pre-determined at whatever date they choose to exchange it. The exchange accepts the volatility risk for this in exchange for a small fee. This smart contract is also know as 'digital dollars'
3. The person's phone will then automatically have the 'digital dollars' sent to their phone from a crypto exchange. Again, these 'digital dollars' are essentially a smart contract located on the blockchain that guarantees the exchange (or lender) will pay however much BTC is required to equal the chosen currency at the time it is redeemed. The reward for the exchange or vender is that they will receive a small payment for their acceptance of volatility risk.
4. The sender now has 'digital dollars' on his phone and can send these 'digital dollars' to his grandmother's phone. This is where the smart contract essentially changes hands when the sender willingly hands over the keys to the smart contract 'digital dollars' to his grandmother in Mexico.
5. His grandmother then takes the 'digital dollars' smart contract to her local MSB 7/11 and hands her smart contract to the MSB 7/11 and they hand her pesos.
6. The MSB 7/11 now has control of the smart contract and they can turn it from 'digital dollars' into BTC or USD via an exchange as they see fit.
As I see it, the key difference between Abra and Western Union is that when you send money across borders in Abra, it is PEER TO PEER. You are sending smart contract guaranteed 'digital dollars' to the receiver PERSONALLY. Abra never holds keys to your 'digital dollar' wallet and the 7/11 MSB doesn't either. With Western Union, they take control of your funds and use their own business to send the money to across borders.
The main thing that Abra is doing is getting around the bureaucracy of money transmitter laws. Because Western Union is the one doing the cross-border transmission, they are required to fulfill all sorts of bureaucratic bookkeeping. In Abra's scenario, the only transaction that is subject to the law is when you exchange your local currency for 'digital dollars' with the local MSB 7/11. This transmission isn't classified as a money transmission though, it is instead classified as a 'currency exchange'. To my knowledge, the 'currency exchange' laws are much more lax and the MSB 7/11 doesn't have to do all sorts of identity verification and bookkeeping in order to do the exchange.
This workaround could be very big in my opinion. Let me know of any thoughts you guys have on process!

I agree with OP, and have sold off about 10% in the last week. I see two potential "bad news" items in the next few weeks that, if they both happened, could easily send Bitcoin back to sub 600.
1. If the ETF gets denied
2. The exchanges in China decide they are not going to be able to live up to the BTC withdrawal promise, or possibly even worse.
In all honesty, I see the ETF denial at 60%, and bad news from China at 60% (The difference between CNY/BTC and USD/BTC shows that the Chinese are rather pessimistic about their situation imo). Together, we have a 36% chance of shit getting REAL UGLY in the next few weeks. Book SOME profits guys...

Did you not read my post at all? While the BTC volume is flat, the actual USD value of those BTC have changed drastically. The actual VALUE TRANSFERRED is much higher.
@_date: 2016-06-23 07:41:17
I doubt that, considering the total lack of liquidity. A month of saved of coins = 43,000. It only takes 1000 to drop the price by 13 dollars on bitfinex, and after that it becomes even easier. Granted it would be spread over the exchanges, but not enough to counterbalance 43k. The miners absolutely have manipulation power.
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:40:54
But the Chinese are fully awake, and their response was actually fairly meh considering the news. On the contrary, the USD exchanges are pulling the BTC up now, not the Yuan exchanges...

When I say 'connect', I mean 'receive'. I'm sure they are optimized ASIC's, but does that rule out entirely that such a software modification couldn't be made possible? Perhaps have the Blockstream sats transmit in exactly the same way that the GPS sats do, only have the software interpret the data differently.
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:46:52
Agree, I am not an electrical engineer and I admit that I do not have the technical experience to know for sure that this is 100% possible. Based on what I did read, if there is a limitation, I think it would be legal rather than technical.
And to clarify, I did not say it would be done over the GPS network as you have assumed. Rather, it would be done by application software 'hijacking' the GPS receiver hardware within cell phones and using it to connect to Blockstream sats instead of GPS sats, temporarily.

I don't have time to fully translate all of the fluff, but the direct quote from him says that large Chinese miners have already decided not to go with BitcoinXT. In addition, he says that "the miners will wait for the core developers to reach consensus before changing, and if they are unable to do so, the miners will do all that is necessary to defend the stability of bitcoin."
To me this means that they will wait for consensus to make any changes at all and that there "defense of stability" simply means that they will not do anything or make any changes until the community is in agreement.

Well, that is partially true. 25 cents is actually a bit steep. I would consider it if it were maybe 10 cents, AND if I they made it harder for me to find for free on in the internet.
My own preferences aside, Itunes PROVED years ago that people are WILLING to pay for music even when they can get it for free.
Itunes also PROVED the power of pay-per-song, instead of the more predominant subscription services that were being offered at the time which all failed.
People don't like to commit to having a subscription. It is like another bill that one has to pay every month. But an impulse buy of only 10 cents? Sure!!! Psychology plays a role of great effect here as well...

I am an investor on Jam. The key to getting any loan funded is a good pitch. Honestly if you had a D- rated loan and a good pitch and a low enough request amount, it would likely get funded.
Having said that, the bigger question to ask is whether or not taking a loan out at a high interest rate is worth it for you. Do you genuinely feel that you will be able to repay AND that the loan amount will help you in the long term?

I too have used both websites for about 3 months now and my results are mixed. BLC had a default rate of 35% for me. BTCJam so far has a default rate of 16%. BLC provides better statistics and I can clearly see that I will lose money to the tune of 20%. BTCJam however has less telling statistics which I consider to be borderline deception. The NAR metric they use starts out extremely high (250%) and rapidly drops with every default. I now stand at 50% for BTC loans and 20% for USD denominated loans, but they continue to drop with every default. Who knows where I will stand after 12 months.
Some time ago BTCJam posted an estimation of ROI for their autoinvest feature and they provided an expected APR metric. Why can't they provide the same metric for their other loans? I'm not a finance guru and I don't understand these metrics very well but it seems like they could come together and calculate an expected APR with honest expectations for defaults and such.
BLC on the other hand flaunts their low default rate but what they don't tell you is that a lot of their loans are 'reputation loans' wherein the borrower cannot even pull the money out so it isn't even a true loan. BLC lowers their overall default rate this way and it is a form of deception.
I have stopped lending money on both sites for now but I have not abandoned hope completely.
Both websites are rapidly changing their polices in an attempt to improve the system as a whole and I believe they may actually work in the future.
When I get to six months I will write a more formal review.

Localbitcoins is used to move money anonymously and to escape capital controls. It mostly is NOT a speculation vehicle. Therefore, calculating the amount of VALUE exchanged in USD terms (versus actual bitcoins which change dramatically in value based on speculation) shows that the FUNCTIONAL USAGE of bitcoin is increasing over time.
This is why I like looking at LBC volumes. The bid-ask prices are too far apart to use it for speculation purposes or day-trading purposes. Instead, it is a measure of actual functional use of the coin. And as many people are aware, the volumes that show up through LBC API's are only half of the story.

Yes but a Sybil attack via nodes would cost money, and not be sustainable over the long term. Correct? Ironically enough, the cost of the sybil attack would be directly proportional to the cost of disk space and bandwidth, which is EXACTLY what limitations we want block size to be about.
You might sybil attack for a few weeks, but over time you would have to relent, and as the node count dropped off after the attack, the block sizes would correspondingly shrink until equilibrium was met again. The most damage you could do is a few weeks (months) of larger blocks, any such 'gains' made my the attack would be paid for down the line by the decreased node count and corresponding block size adjustment lower.

The reason is that BATPOOL signaled for the first time it was supporting BIP91.
Traders need to be watching the blocks very closely. A change in a miner's signaling is going to cause huge swings.
If F2pool, GBMiners, Bitfury, or any of the 1%+ miners switch, expect another swing.
