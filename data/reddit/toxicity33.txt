How much is a good starting point? I'm literally a broke college student struggling to pay rent. I only have .03 BTC, is that enough?

Yeah, that's what I'm scared of. At the same time, that's why I didn't put 1K+ into bitcoins in the Spring and god damn do I regret it now.

True, I'm new to this. Roughly what is their median point at which it fluctuates? When roughly should I invest in LTC. I'm new to things like this
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:11:19
Any guides or anything?
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:02:21
Wait, what? Could somebody explain this to me like I'm five? 
I'm an absolute broke college student desperately looking to find a way to pay for next semester in the next few weeks.

I have a piece of shit laptop with an average nvidia card

I don't know anything about LTC. How stable is LTC?

You're a really generous person. If bitcoins aren't a "thing" by the time I'm done with college(8 months) and I have enough to do the same, I will. 
Seriously, really nice of you. Bitcoin awareness is key!

May I ask when/how you'll fix the "multiple address issue"? I like the idea, but could see that ruining it in the short term. 
Edit: I'm a broke college student, I don't wanna be a dick, but if it gets my $50...

Yeah, exactly. I completely agree, that's why I'm serious when I say that's awesome of you! 
All I could afford was 20$ for myself. I'm just glad I got into it.
