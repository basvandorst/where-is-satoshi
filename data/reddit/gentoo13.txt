OK, decrypted it: on 10. 11. 2017 the price of 1 BTC will be 293,246 USD. :)
@_date: 2016-08-24 06:13:07
A more pessimistic interpretation would be: on 10. 11. 2017 the price of 2 BTC will be 93,246 USD.

Never listen to the trollbox wisdom. Don't panic buy/sell when someone says the sky is falling etc. Do your own price predictions otherwise you'll burn your money jumping in and out.

A couple of questions for you:
1) When is Litecoin support coming?
2) How many times a day was Charlie bugging you with the same question No need to be very specific, I am sure you were not counting. An estimated average will do :)
3) Who came up with the idea to name your new node that supports Litecoin "Toshi"?

Sounds great,

I am BTC-poor atm, therefore I've sent only a couple of mBTC for a cup of coffe. Should you consider accepting LTC I'd gladly send more.

1) It is yet unclear how EU is going to tax BTC to fiat trades. They may chose to tax every profitable transaction rather than taxing total gains within a time period. In this case I am better off trading BTC-LTC than BTC-USD, since I'll only have to pay taxes on gains when I decide to convert BTCs to Euros (if I ever decide to do so)
2) It may turn out that after multi billion dollar business start entering Bitcoin on a somehow larger scale existence of a more flexible coin is needed to test innovations before they are introduced to Bitcoin.
3)Speed of confirmations *does* matter in many circumstances.

Post transaction ID or it did not happen.

This is simply great!!!

Thanks, it works. Everything OK.

How do I get a valid gpg signature from Wladimir. I get the message that his gpg key has expired.
gpg: Signature made Wed 08 Mar 2017 07:43:28 AM CET using RSA key ID 36C2E964

He'll drink vodka with Putin, and solve all problems of humanity along the way. Everything will turn out perfectly fine.

I find this totally unbelievable.
booking.com says they charge 314€ per night. Hotel is therefore making 50.000€ per day. Blackmailers asked for a modest sum of 1.500€?
Paying to blackmailers is against the law. I cannot believe that hotel management paid the sum, and went public with this, potentially exposing themselves to a much larger fine for violating the law. I truly find this unbelievable. This must be some kind of a joke.

True, but 2,000,000 10€ banknotes can. :)

This must be blockchain.info specific.
Other blockchain explorers do not show negative balances, e.g.:

Many thanks for your clarifications. Now this yes/no situation is a bit less puzzling :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:38:42
Yes, of course. The diagram should be read bottom-up. For example, when you are in a "Do not buy Bitcoin" mode the negation "No" leads you to a philosophical question "Do you want to own Bitcoin?".

Dear ECB,
I have a 10€ banknote, serial number NB4909472361, in my wallet. Are you, or any other financial intelligence unit (FIUN) able to associate my identity to this banknote?
If you are unable to do it with the banknote _you_ issued, why do you think that this should be made possible in the case of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:36:41
Japanese Yen, Russian Ruble , Australian dollar etc. have status of currencies, but you can't pay taxes in Yen, Ruble etc. within EU.

Yeah, any color - as long as it is black.

I could start with anti teenage pregnancy campaigns, etc., but I think that FOSS projects, and Bitcoin devs really deserve some Bitcoin love.

Best time to buy is exactly when everyone is screaming that Bitcoin is going to zero, etc. It means that you are going to buy low :)

You are 38? No offense, but at 38 you should already take care of your own Bitcoins, US dollars, Euros, or whatever you use to pay your bills.
You really should learn to respect your parents. Did you ask yourself why your mother bought you presents?
Please, go to your mom and apologize. You'll understand when you'll have your child/children.
