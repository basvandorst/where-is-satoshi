Open an account here
Initiate ACH transfer or wire transfer.
Click buy bitcoin button, spend money at the default limit order value. 
You now have bitcoin.
Then generate a bitcoin address at warp wallet with a numerical sequence taken from 99 coin flips.  Send the bitcoin to this public address, once you've printed the private key.
You now have bitcoin off an exchange.
Don't store the private key on your computer.
If you can run warp wallet offline, even better.  You can download the web page to do this.
If that is too involved you can let the exchange hold the bitcoin if you are comfortable with that risk.

I create cold storage addresses by feeding and verifying a 62-digit sequence of dice rolls into the github-sourced bitaddress brainwallet function.  Written out by hand.
Sure, the government knows how much bitcoin I purchase via Coinbase, and they can know the address I send it to, but they have to physically extract the private keys from me.  They were never copied and pasted, printed, etc.  Everything is created offline.  
Can the NSA crack invisible ink on paper without an infrared or blacklight flashlight from an online location?  Hell, if they can do that, they fucking deserve my bitcoins.

I use the github supplied bitaddress offline as well.  
But I use the brainwallet function, but with dice rolls, not random words.  I roll dice 62 times and use that as the seed, then hand write the public and private keys and verify with the software.  
This way you dont trust software random number generation or combinations of words.
Dice rolls with vegas style dice are truly random.

Short version: It's quick.  Once you go through the red tape, that is.
Same thing applies to shady business or hackers: They never had access to the cold storage private keys.  
I don't mean to downplay the situation, if given a choice I'd not offer that information up, but until I get paid directly in bitcoin I have to run everything through my bank.  If coinbase or a similar service ever insisted on sharing the private keys to any address I transferred to, we'd part ways that day.
Once my coins are out of coinbase, they really are completely liberated.  No big deal, imo.

Sorry.  I'm new to mining.
Lets say I have 100 shares of peta mine, with a current dividend of ~ 0.0017 btc / week.
In a month the price of bitcoin hits $5,000.
But the block reward has not changed during that time.
At that point, would the dividend be wildly different than previous weekly averages?  Or still around 0.0017 btc/week?
And assuming peta-mine holds the same amount of hashing power of the network during that time as before.
edit: I guess another way to put it would be, does variance change when supply/demand changes?

I have done plenty of ACH transfers to TDAmeritrade.  Doing an ACH transfer to this bitcoin exchange is limited to $500 a day, and takes about one work week for the money to arrive.  A waste of time.
The only two means of transferring cash to this exchange are ACH and Wire Transfer, so I chose to send more money in a shorter time frame.  Now that I've seen how slow it is, I may do ACH transfers in the future, but I could go either way on it.

If you want to avoid the premium, you need to procure your bitcoin without intermediaries that survive on the premium.  They aren't doing it out of the kindness of their hearts.  If you buy it personally from individuals you can get it at cost and move it to your address for several cents.
Sort of like trading cash for gold from an individual instead of a broker or coin dealer.
You can also try your luck at trading on the exchanges and purchasing below market value.  That would help mitigate the exchange premium.

Bitcoin is not immune to price volatility, but it is immune to debasement.
The math behind it is sound, and is a far more robust foundation for a currency than any nation state that becomes your third party risk.  (There is no Bitcoin Government to go kaput)
Under almost all conditions there is no logical reason why the entire market would cease purchasing coins if the price dropped considerably.
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:05:15

With respect, I've never seen that definition of socialism before.  I understand it to be the exact opposite of what you are describing: where the state owns and manages the means of production.  
Voluntarism is probably a more accurate word to use here, as it specifically indicates lack of a coercive centralized authority.

They employed an agent who stole millions of dollars in bitcoin and threatened to murder people.  Then they stole these bitcoins as part of a raid and used the threat of future violence to get the owner to agree to surrender them, after which time he still received two life sentences for running a website anyway.
The agent received 6 years.

The part that gets distorted is the belief from said people that it is not themselves who have figured it out; it is the market.  The idea of an organic price discovery non-distorted by direct manipulation does not seem unreasonable, given the FED's stated goal of preventing asset bubbles - via direct manipulation.  The basic idea is that people on the ground can assign prices to goods better than the guy with leather elbow patches and some whiz-bang algorithm he just dreamed up.
