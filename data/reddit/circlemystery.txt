I earned it by working at a estate agent, so i should be able to spend it on what i like. But i think they are just too worried that i will lose the money.

OK thanks, i will take that advice on board.
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:29:48
Its my own money. I got $250 in my bank account and a extra $1000 in cash i am only going to invest a small amount $10-$30

@_date: 2018-08-29 11:31:20

@_date: 2018-08-31 10:07:15
they are just not allowing me to invest in bitcoin. I have a feeling that they will beat my ass if i do it at 17
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:50:02
Thank for the advise. I will probably start with $10 maybe that will convince them
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:31:15

@_date: 2018-08-30 08:15:01
I will be 18 in July of 2019. I am only going to invest $20-$50 into bitcoin, i dont see why they have a problem with that. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:04:23
Ok i will probably invest small 
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:29:53
I will give them a talk about it today. Hopefully i could convince them.
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:28:10

@_date: 2018-08-29 11:21:49
Shall i just wait until im 18  to ease relations? i will just ask them if i can invest at 18
