i ended up going through multiple guides to be sure i dont screw up. it all worked as expected. Like i mentioned, i would rather worry and be cautious then lose them. With the ledger it was suprisingly easy, just needed to keep address straight from bitcoin (legacy/segwit) to cash (main/split). But it all worked, can now sell some bcash to pay bills.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:41:40
Thanks! So would have to move btc to a wallet that supports those other one's, and do similar split procedure? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:04:41
I have seen them, still worry. I know dumb :/ but wanted more input before trying today, that's all
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:18:23
You can laugh all you want :) thanks for the input
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:32:31
Look at nice hash today, biggest reason not to keep in exchange, unless you trade or want to flip quickly. If you want to store, definitely cold storage like paper or nano or something. Worth the extra cost.

Ja z Rzeszowa, żona obok Częstochowy, a teraz jest w Krakowie. Lubię przyjeżdżać, tymbardziej że bilety z Chicago kupuje a oko 380-450 w 2 strony. Dziękuję bardzo :) przekażę żonie! I uwielbiam bitcoin. W rok poszło z 6k/7k na oko 120k teraz. Nie mogę narzekać. Szybciej rośnie niż byle inne investycje.

Hardware is easier, less likely to screw up, then have paper copies on top of that. More points that control. Having 1, still could lose it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:41:40
My entire family keeps telling me to cash out. They said it at 12k then dipped to 9k. Etc. But again my brother told me to sell at 2, 4, 5, and 8.. Still haven't listened. I always expect dips, but I'm in it for longevity. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:21:29
The original 7.4 I aquired over a 3 year period. Never did any research, on what is best practice, etc. Left them sit in my full node for 3 years, till one morning they were gone. I never figured out how my wallet got stolen, but it was irrelevant, they were gone. It was simple ignorance, and stupidity and my fault. At the time was around $4700 I lost. Bought the next 10ish over a few months at around 6k total, then learned to use hardware wallets, etc. Best part is, if I hadn't had lost them, I would have had 7.4. But because I lost them I bought more. Go figure what my logic was for that at the time...
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:28:01
That is my thought exactly, slight dips happen but not worried about overall price. Still a fraction but feels odd to sell. It's 2.30am here and have to meet up with a stranger to get a large amount of of cash.. . So haven't really slept.. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:01:05
Yea exactly, went from 6k or so to 150k.. I check here often. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:15:56
Personally I think as the information gets spread out, regardless how people buy, it will drive price up. For example, flew to Europe Friday. Spent 20 hours in Iceland, 24 in frankfurt before reaching destination. The sheer amount of interest from people all ages was astounding. Had questions everyday if I even mentioned bitcoin. The news coverage in each country is much higher than 6 weeks ago when I was here. To each their own, but I think a first it will spike, as long as people believe.

Lol, we are both from Poland (I moved with parents in 96) she moved to the states to be with me after we met in 2012, while she worked at a university alumni summer family camp. She moved and left school early to move to be with me. 5 years later she decided to wants to finish school. So went back, but kicker is she would have to wait a year before resuming where she left off. So now she's not in school, but learning other interests privately or on her own. Spending time with family that is normally 6000 miles away. While try and fly back often. i
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:43:48
Still buy 100$ a week regardless of price. We have to believe! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:48:21
Keep buying and keep telling my family I'm not selling lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:30:49
What do you mean corrections? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:01:29
I'm with ya, my wife found out when it hit 2k. Now she tells everyone it is the single thing I will ever get away with and not get in trouble for doing behind her back. ���� wish I had more, but I'll take some over none lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:30:06
Np, it was my lesson I learned relatively early in bitcoin, good thing it happened then, and not now at 14k.. I don't think my psyche could take it now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:50:33
Ja jestem zapisany na maile od thriftytraveller i scottsflights I jak przyjdzie coś tanie to kupuje jak najszybciej. Już 3 raz w Polsce w tym roku, i nigdy więcej niż 500 nie dałem. Z boston/NY Sa po 300 I mniej do frankfurt naprzyklad, i z Frankfurt Ryanair do Krakowa za 20-50$ w 2 strony. Jak można parę miesięcy do przodu planować to dużo można za oszczędzić. Też WOW przez islandje tanie są bardzo.

If you can't afford to part with the money, don't buy. Yes hindsight is always 20/20 but can't look at past. If you afford to put that 100 Euro in, without hardship and wait, why not. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 13:01:30
I feel your pain, I didn't learn everything I should about wallets/backups/etc, got complacent with my wallet, lost 7.89btc. That was not a fun morning. At the time is was around $4200 and my wife still brings it up after a few months. I know I fucked up, but I quickly learned about the ledger nano s, have gotten 10btc since and at least now I shouldn't lose them. I am not rich, I spent way too much this year on btc but my wife doesn't need to know that :) good luck!  Don't give up
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:53:13
Just recently flew Chicago to London, same documentary. Then on way back Dublin to Chicago had it as well. In a few weeks going to Iceland as a layover before Frankfurt, betting it will be on there as well.

I read through my policy, I've seen them cover weirder shit. It's worth a shot, either I get something back, or nothing. Insurance any time I've ever filed a claim doesn't need proof necessarily. Think of "losing" your phone with att, happened to me. Since you don't have the physical device, they can't prove whether you lost it, sold it, are hiding it etc. You sign a document that if they find out you lied you are liable. Like I said, I'll try, nothing in my policy that specifically excludes it. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 12:32:06
Ledger is on its way already, just sucks to start from a fraction of a bitcoin that they couldn't take :/ took me years to get to 7. Sigh
@_date: 2016-10-22 12:32:45
Thanks, ledger is on order
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:00:20
great sense of humor, i dont rip off people IP's. i specifically pay for a seedbox since we live in such a free country, lol, its intention isn't exactly hidden.
@_date: 2016-10-22 12:25:43
You would only need the system drive right? My computer has 30 some TB of shit on it :) at this point it doesn't matter what someone sees, I already lost that money. Nothing else of value on it, besides my logins to banks, which I've started changing anyway. I have started going through all important sites to change passwords just as a precaution. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 20:01:21
no other alt coin wallets installed on my machine, none. never even attempted others. i have others coins but on Bleutrae and others but nothing locally installed.

@_date: 2016-10-22 12:28:04
The second machine is a Mac that sits in my office I and only I use it. That I can guarantee, and that thing is only used to browse reddit and use Rdp to connect to home. I'm fairly sure the wallet got pulled from Amazon cloud drive. I accidentally added that directory to the backup, and it sat there. If someone got access to acd then they found it there.

Windows 8.1 Enterprise N, Version 6.3 Build 9600.
Bitcoin Classic v1.2.0.b1 (Rarely use this computer outside of using it for PLEX streaming and pulling TV shows/.Movies from seedbox to computer over FTPS). 
Nothing else odd, only thing ive added or updated is Sonarr in the past week. Nothing else has been installed or downloaded.
Im really sad now, i spent a while collecting those, buying them as i could, now to just lose them like that, is really shitty. I wont be able to reinvest that much in quite some time, and its the worst thing. This completely trashed my hopes of bitcoin as an investment. :'(
@_date: 2016-10-22 12:35:40
Thanks, I didn't know that. As I mentioned, it never was an issue, I assumed by running the full node I was helping the cause, now it just bit me in the ass. Besides keeping my computer running for the last few years, using bandwidth/electricity constantly. I lost a lot more money in one swoop :(
@_date: 2016-10-22 12:38:58
Classic came right from classic site, checked history of last time it was downloaded. Sonarr as well, checked that last night. Looks like the wallet.dat was grabbed off my ACD and cracked. Guess password wasn't trying enough :/
@_date: 2016-10-21 17:33:43
nothing, like i said, on the 17th i sat down to stat setting up sonarr, and that was it. nothing else, i didnt even finish setting it up, fell asleep. Previous bitcoin transaction was 5/5/16 so a while ago from that client, and i havent done anything else in the client besides letting it run in the background. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:43:03
I believe I did, I haven't even checked, but the wallet had a password from when I set it up years ago. Was just a shitty password :/ sorry I answer sporadically, I still work 10-12 hour days 6 days a week. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:42:32
Unrelated to bitcoin, a guy by the exact name owes me money (about 20k from sale of something) that is under a personal guarantee and isn't paying, every time I see his name posted, it makes my blood curdle more.. Sigh. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 19:51:00
nope, just look at my replies above, nothing besides Sonarr was installed and that event wasnt setup completely. so unless that is compromised, i am out of ideas. nothing in logs, etc. as my other replies say.
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:52:59
Thank you for the suggestions, I will order one tomorrow once I calm down a little. Would you mind explaining why one would be preferred? Or what the difference is? Oh I will keep going, my own stupidity and laziness cost me enough so far, but I don't blame anyone but me. Starting from zero or almost zero really isn't a good feeling :/
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:13:17
usenet i quit using a few months back now, the content was disappearing quickly. I switched to mainly private torrent sites and a couple RSS feeds for tv shows that get mkv files. i never click on the files themselves if anything. I let plex index them and then stream to TVs that way. unless something was hidden in one of those, i havent looked for "free" software on any website in about a year. This computer became just the host for plex, bitcoin node etc. im guessing i had an issue with mentioned. Somehow they got my wallet.dat and screwed me over. Malewarebytes was running as well, its why the whole issue of my machine getting hacked is getting less and less likely. neither have found anything running or in memory. The scans are still going though.
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:04:21
all the inputs are from coinbase, where i purchased the bitcoins over the past few years and then transferred them in. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 04:58:14

i guess learn the hard way ehh? no issues for so long, never thought it would do something like that, then one stupid thing goes poof. there goes over 4k of an investment. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 02:53:37
Thanks, no one deserves it I hope, and I do not wish that helpless feeling on anyone, it currently isn't pleasant. I know it was my mistake, that does not make it justified or OK. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 12:37:22
I'm guessing that's what happened with ACD. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 19:50:20
Wallet was but it was loaded into the node to run constantly. i have kept the node running nonstop for 3 years, but i guess that will stop now. The password was unique to the wallet, its not one i use anywhere else publicly.
Maybe?, but i didnt even setup Sonarr, so unless it was already a bad exe that i got from them, i think its unlikely, yea the service was running so unless someone used that port to get in i cant think of anything else that changed. I checked windows logs, software installs, downloads, etc. nothing is different than the other months of this computer running and just serving plex out. Only way i connect to this computer is remote desktop, so i checked that, and nothing in the logs showing anyone logging in at 3am. This just really really sucks, its something i have been in favor of for a long time, now its dashed all my dreams and hopes of this ever being a viable thing. If someone who knows a little about computers, does whatever to do to cover their ass, and still cant stop this from happening how does the average joe schmo that has a problem remembering his email password suppose to adopt something like bitcoin? (ignore the rant, its just me being mad). I have found nothing on my computer that is suspicious, out of place, nothing. Its why i am still very confused. i get my system is compromised, but how is the better question. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:39:59
Fairly sure they got my wallet.dat and password was too easy. I originally set that password before I started using lastpass to generate random harder passwords
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:38:46
Yea, easy enough I guess, my fault either way, still sucks :/ since about a year I've used last pass to generate random for everything, but that I never changed. I know, big big mistake
@_date: 2016-10-21 20:00:14
yea i get that now, like i said, never had issues, they always sat there, never had any problems getting hacked/compromised, so had to come from 3rd party software. Guess ill start rebuilding those coins, which really sucks. Life really has a way to kick you when you are already down :/. just for shits and giggles im going to contact my renters insurance see if they will cover, its theft one way or another. unless they specifically state that cryptos aren't covered, might get some money back at least.

Scanned all 19.5 million files, nothing out of the ordinary, in either malewarebytes and Kaspersky. I'm betting they got the wallet.dat and cracked my joke of a password. I can't prove where they got it, but have a good guess.

Oops read that wrong, hey if cable or satellite wasn't such an expensive crap shoot I would rather have cable. Downloading is just easier
