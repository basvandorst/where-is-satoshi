Wow, incredible, thank you! I’m in!!

Get your alts, china is just now waking up..
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:05:58
exactly, also think about time change. It's only 6:05am in China, get ready! If you're buying now, don't blow it all, prepare for further drops..

I guess I'm curious on why it's still unconfirmed after 45 minutes. Somewhat new, and never seen a transaction that large or take so long..
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:57:10
Makes sense if blocks are taking longer than normal, I'm assuming that's due to increased difficulty? 
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:55:22
Noticed that too, Lol
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:52:04
Is that large transaction a reason my small amount isn't confirmed? I honestly haven't seen an unconfirmed take this long..
@_date: 2016-12-31 04:46:02
Just got mine as well, got a good laugh and thought, isn't this a little late? Who's running PR at Coinbase? Did I just miss a release after the IRS inquiry?

I work in the App space and there are tactics to essentially target those user that have never submitted support tickets/feedback or exclusively target power users within the app and prime them to review. It actually works better than you'd expect, we've run campaigns in this regard and will see a huge influx (200-500) of positive reviews in short periods of time. Of course this relays on your Daily Active users which I'd expect theirs to be fairly low (&lt;1000). I'm basing this number on a lifetime 590 reviews, 9% is a high value/influx.
Regardless, this does seem suspicious but Apple can't identify users other than IP/location, DMA, along with other default attributes, so it's not fully enforceable unless they can 100% identify them promoting the app from within, plus 55 reviews isn't much for a flag here. There are also ways around what's mentioned above, family/friend asks. Unless there is a transaction involved, free access, payment, etc. again, nothing can be proved.

You are a gentleman and a scholar.
@_date: 2016-11-08 02:37:19
They're big on blockchain, so that doesn't surprise me. They also just published a huge "Tech Trends" White paper, about 20 pages on the advancement and driver behind it all. Goes without saying, cool shit to see a top 4 moving that way..

Can to elaborate on the moon shot?

If you think about buying or selling bitcoin on eBay, think again. Bitcoin isn't reversible, but PayPal is.. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:40:46
What's a decimal? You mean like cents?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:22:51

Well if I could remove it I would, just after views not upvotes..
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:32:26
After views/exposure not upvotes, I could careless about karma.

I bought a $150 mining contract last year that’s still running, I’ve seen about $840 to date from the purchase. Not bad, but if I had to do it all over I would have just bought the coins as I would have made more on holding.
Just to clarify, I was very uneducated in the space when I bought it. For the record, don’t purchase cloud mining.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:03
Actually really helpful information for the noobs. However, I was messing with you..
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:15:47
lolol, hello Dunder Mifflinite

Honestly that’s a huge misconception, my friend said he wasn’t going to invest because it was at $9k already and was too steep on an entry point. I quickly corrected, he owns Bitcoin now.

Thanks. House built in the 60's, total renovation 2 years ago. Wallet has finally started to recover..
@_date: 2017-04-23 12:15:22
In this scenario a softfork wouldn't be ideal..

Options to pay in Btc too..
@_date: 2017-04-23 22:47:49
Thanks, and I wish it was only 10btc. The most expensive thing you'll do once you've purchased a house is renovate a kitchen. The smallest things are expensive and start to add up quickly.
@_date: 2017-04-23 02:52:59
Same, that's how it all started..
@_date: 2017-04-23 02:43:27
Yeah, I'll put in a good word..
@_date: 2017-04-23 02:40:46
Ha, not yet..

He’s saying ripple is shit
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:33:12
Did the same the other day, everything was in perfect condition and untampered. I’m assuming you had to set up a pin upon turning it on? If so, good to go!
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:23:19
Amazon has some as well, some sellers affiliated with Ledger, some not.i posted about this about a week ago, and ensuring mine wasn’t compromised. Essentially, if it comes with a pin or doesn’t ask you to set up a pin it’s been modified. 
Also, some great tutorials to walk you through the process. Something doesn’t align don’t send coins to the address.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:25:08
Exactly, now just sit back and HODL!
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:10:30
How enforceable is this though?
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:29:23
I see pros and cons of the currency but I do have some interest to see what happens with other potentially competing projects, VeChain or ChainLink.
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:30:13
Thanks for that, they really cover all aspects here. I’d love to hear what percentage of miners actually pay taxes upon gains.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:29:31
What is this?
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:28:52
Cashing out into fiat or just transferring back into a wallet? I’d be interested to hear responses on what constitutes cashing out and where taxes apply.
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:37:48
Until it drops again, it will be interesting to watch the next couple of months..
