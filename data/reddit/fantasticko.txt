bitcoin is easy to spend. Tons of sites take it online.  And then there's emerging VISA Debit cards (such as xapo and shiftpayments) where the balance is held in coin and when swiped, it outputs USD or whatever local currency.

The Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of the Investor Advocate will host a public conference, characterized as an “Evidence Summit,” to discuss, among other things, potential strategies for enhancing retail investors’ understanding of key investment characteristics such as fees, risks, returns, and conflicts of interest. An objective of the conference is to marshal research from the fields of economics and cognitive sciences to help inform ways of thinking about investor behavior and identify areas for possible future research to be conducted under the auspices of an investor research initiative led by the Commission’s Office of the Investor Advocate ... etc etc..

Everyone's so busy being funny, they missed that OP was asking HOW would he get access or spend them -- not WHAT would he spend them on -- if I'm right?

he could download a wallet on his phone and zap QR codes everywhere IRL and online.. or he could transfer to various exchanges to transfer to other fiat, etc.. or he could put it all into a visa debit card (like xapo or shiftpayments) that holds in coin and when swiped, outputs USD or whatever.  All are valid.
