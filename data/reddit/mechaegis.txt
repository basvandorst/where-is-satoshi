Those are some very expensive pizzas.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:46:18
why is it sub 10k though right now?
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:44:03
What was the reason behind the dip recently?
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:37:25
that's a pretty hand btw.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:47:46
What was the reason behind this recent dip?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:18:12
Do you know if you made the transaction with a credit card or a from you bank account? Credit cards are instant and have a slightly higher fee. Buying via bank account always have a pending 7-10 days (always 10 days in my experience) till coins are deposited but have lower fees.

Question, how did one obtain BTCs back in 2010? I had graduated high school a year prior.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:30:08
I remember hearing about Bitcoin back in 2009-ish. I had just graduated high school. I just thought to myself "huh, that's pretty cool." Never thought about it again. 
Fast forward to just a month or two ago, I am watching one of my favorite Youtubers' mention Bitcoin reaching 5,000 USD. That got me interested again. I hate myself coming in so late but, hey of the $120 I have put in, it has only gone up.
As of right now I have maybe $120 in BTC and a little in LTC, ETH and maybe XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:47
why must you burst *my* bubble?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:55
I swear it was just sitting at 3,100 USD. 10 minutes later I check Coinbase app and its skyrocketed to 8,500 USD. WTF?!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:00:11
ehh it'll probably go back down around 17-18(?) December for the fork - "Super Bitcoins."
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:24:37
So like what happened to the guy that bought it? Does the pizza place the made the transaction now have 10,000 BTCs?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:06:39
We are nearing 20K soon. I am sure many other exchanges will slow down a little.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:50:12
Had to jump out of bed for this. Pretty sure something is up....doesn't spike up this quickly. I am waiting for a drop somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:27:25
probably near the date 17 December as another fork is to occur. "Super Bitcoins" 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:12
it just froze...
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:45:05
I put maybe 300 in as of right now. So far I have made a hundred extra in return. Not to mention the 25 into ETH and LTC, each that have only gone up.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:21:13
I am gonna be honest what is FUD? 
But yeah that is good to hear. After most outlets, malls, stores, and ATMs enabled BTC transactions it'd be crazy to have BTC ousted like that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:37:53
I thought it was the 17 of December but anywho. 
Another BTC fork - "Super Bitcoins"
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:53:49
see thats where you went wrong. I would give but, your arms have to be broken : /
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:44:56
I have not looked nor have read the article but, I as a Muslim would have owned BTC anyways. 
However, this is good to know as I have not told anyone in my family that I have investments in Crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:47:53
I have the ID from GDAX but, I am pretty sure thats their internal ID number. 
I'll come back to it in the morning.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:35:15
till next time.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:03:39

@_date: 2017-12-05 08:47:34
From what I remember about a month ago, I got verified with Coinbase/GDAX using a web cam to take a picture of my Licence (front/back).
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:00:01
I am still waiting for my ACH BTC purchase from 3 weeks ago.

@_date: 2017-12-12 02:21:24
GDAX is owned by Coinbase. If you sign up for one you have both. I am on mobile, there was a post not too long ago about using Coinbase and transferring over to GDAX to avoid fees.
As far as using other exchanges someone else can maybe chime in on that. I have always used Coinbase/GDAX as of two months ago. I am considering Bitstamp as well.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:22:04

How do I go about claiming coins after a fork? Next one is to be ~~on 15 December~~ (Super Bictoin).
edit: 12 December
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:08:21
I joined in at 6500 USD. I have about 120$ invested into it. So far it has only gone since entering the market.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:46:05
My experience with Electrum has been pretty good to me. After that I have got myself a Nano Ledger S.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:45:33
Yes. Yes I have. But I also am a chronic daydreamer so
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:12:56
I am unaware of any at this moment. I do know that there is one on the 17 of December known as "Super Bitcoins."
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:21:18
What would be the proper method to obtain/claim fork coins?
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:25:02
memes please....and jokes
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:30:33
Well...you know maybe a little less than that as some people make mistakes and send BTC to an incorrect address or forget their seed to retrieve coins.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:37:38
Fire Sale!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:47:33
hold em. I have not invested much into BTC yet. I would like for it to grow and see where the road map for the tech heads down.
Do I need to do anything special to claim after the fork occurs (This is my first fork)?
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:47:40
It will go up and it will go down
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:53
I know man. I have been waiting for about 7 hours to move some into HW.

whats "AR"?
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:00:54
[Yeah I got the same thing.]( I don't ever remember clicking on referral link. But then again I don't remember typing in "coinbase" into google. 
I guess whatever link I clicked on wasn't a standard URL to coinbase. but ehh, 9.99 USD in BTC is still 9.99 USD in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:51:52
ahh I see. I'll check back at it in a few hours.

Yes, they do ship to the states. I placed an order on 28 November. I just got it yesterday, 04 December.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:15:33
Its still good, I bought $10.99 @ 7,200. It dropped down to 5500 the next day :/ I bought again as the price climbed higher. I am now looking at maybe at least $100.00 in return.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:49:18
I am sorry, can someone give me a ELI5 on this? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:11:44
Didn't recently SK want to ban or prohibit the use of Bitcoins?

Yes Sir/Madam,  won't fail you again.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:50:01
I jumped in at around 7200 USD. Felt like it was just last week...it been almost over a month maybe two now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:39:57
oh..what the heck did I read. What is this [Super Bitcoins and Platinum btc ect.](
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:24:13
I guess wait for Monday as the weekend is not considered as a "Business day"
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:26:49
I use Electrum 3.0 till Nano Ledger S arrives.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:58
Whats the reason though..
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:22:07
This is my first fork. How do I go about to claim them? If I have BTC on a ledger do I also get coins from the fork?
Thank You.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:49:08
I had maybe a hundred (maybe $150) or so into Bitcoin before getting a Nano Ledger S for 49.46 €
(58.23 USD). I had $25 into LTC ( USD) and ETH ( USD) each. 
Since then, all three have only gone up. LTC and ETH alone have paid for the HW.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:54:34
Lol for real man. It's still dark outside here on the East coast. Sprang out of bed to look at GDAX on the recent rise in ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:49:35
wait there is another fork soon?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:30:17
I am sorry but, how do we know that 25% of BTCs are lost?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:50:01
Here now you can do it again. Just in case some of ya'll that couldn't be there for the break of [12K USD.](

@_date: 2017-12-09 10:21:44
Can I get a ELI5 on what Futures is? 
I know it's something related to prices and betting if it'll go up or down on a _future_ date.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:33:40
wut?! So that is what that other poster was talking about. I have no idea.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:06:16
It take time for it to get there.
I usually check  to keep track of my transfer conformations. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:41:56
wait, 2040?! I thought it was 2140?
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:03:43
Maybe, maybe not. It looked pretty stable at around 11.3k-11.5k. I was getting worried it won't drop. Looks like its approaching 11.7k. I guess just wait it out for now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:59:25
[I mean you could attempt a pretend buy to see.](
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:29:05

If I have some BTC in a hard wallet. Do I also get whatever new fork occurs?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:31:56
Just in case for those of you that missed the surpassing of December 06, 2017 [14 K BTC.](
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:57:57
If you use a bank account to buy it typically takes 7-10 business days (mostly 10 days). Purchasing with a Credit Card is instantly added to your coinbase account. 
However, you will be paying slightly higher fee for the convenience for instant delivery.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:26:59
Seriously, I was waiting for a dip after surpassing 11k...never happened.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:03
Here take this. I was gonna save it for [17K]( but ehh what are you gonna do.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:56:46
Seems like a wall at 11.5 K... really anxious right now.

this is if you decide to change into USD right? What happens if I want to never go back to USD and keep my crypto in BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:51:22
Why dropping right now though, last time it was due to a fork. What is the reason this time around?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:58:25
I have regret not buying enough. I should be glad I got verified early on two exchange sites (Bitstamp and Coinbase) considering the fact that crypto is having a boom and everyone is stuck on getting verified. 
I got in  USD. One month later it's heading towards 11k with no signs of letting up. Everything is comfortably sitting in Nano Ledger S.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:53:35
This is sucks, BTC increases faster than I can get paid each week.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:48:39
editing is not something that I wanna spend time on. I just record it with whatever I am listening to at the time.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:19:14
I don't remember if I did this as well. I live in the US and required to enter my SSN/Driver Licence (front and back). My guess its just to make sure that it is indeed definitely **YOU** signing up for purchasing crypto.

@_date: 2017-12-05 08:32:18
For Desktop wallets, I have used Electrum 3.0 - Pretty simple, Send address, receive address, amount.
Hard Wallets I have Nano Ledger, others have Trezor. 
I have been told countless number of times to never keep coins on an exchange unless Day Trading. I have maybe a few BTC (less than 0.01 btc) on Coinbase. 
I use Coinbase to deposit USD, transfer to GDAX to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:09:01
Thanks for making me laugh today.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:38:50
wait wait hold up you can have coins expire?! I understand that you shouldn't keep crypto on an exchange site but, how does this happen? Can they do this? I have a pending transaction for about 2 1/2 weeks now for about 125 USD. I don't want the same thing to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:47:03
where do you see 30k users. Its below 25k

A month ago I hear about BTC breaking 5,000 USD on one of the youtube channels I watch. I jumped in at $7200 and bought I a little a week later. Placed an order for my Legder Nano S just today.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:26

I put $10.99 in yesterday. but it'll be there by next week...
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:29:24
Its all good. I just got myself verified two days ago with GDAX. Linked my bank account, went to deposit 10.00 USD (very slow I know). It should be there in about the usual 4-5 days but, you know what, its all going to BTC so it'll be alright. 
Nano Ledger S should be here Friday : )

@_date: 2017-11-24 12:47:48
I had gotten one from amazon before but had second thoughts about the price and sent it back. It was around ~103.00 USD : / 
Didn't think Ledgerwallet.com would participate in "Black Friday" since its from what I have heard is mostly an *American* thing. I know Canada has their Boxing Day deal which is similar.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:33:34
Shit....I bought almost at the peak of 7200 USD. That sinking feeling when it drops almost 1000.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:22:26
DAMN just a few minutes ago it was around 10,500. Now its around 9,600.

[GDAX]( and Coinbase errors.

What other coin converting exchange sites does everyone else use? I was looking to put a little into other coins.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:26:08
I went with Coinbase/GDAX signed up and verified almost two weeks ago. I have linked my bank account and CC. I made two or three test purchases, nothing large enough to consider transferring on a Nano or Trezor, yet. 
Although, it is **highly** recommended to do so once the risk of losing coins becomes too high.
I keep it in an Electrum desktop wallet for the time being. I don't day trade, way too hectic for me. 
Bitstamp I have heard is also pretty good. One I am considering becoming verified with simply because of additional coins they offer.
I hope this helps. : )
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:06:05
At the moment I am working with an Electrum 3.0 desktop wallet. In a few weeks I should be getting my Nano Ledger S. l'll move everything in there soon.

I am sorry I meant to say a partial amount of a one BTC. About 40 USD.

Are you comfortable with Hard Wallets like Trezor or Nano Ledger S? If not then I think paper wallet is your best bet to be far away from any hardware technology. I do not fully understand how to setup a Paper Wallet so do take care if you decide to go that route. I myself use Electrum and soon to be Nano Ledger.

I put 10.00 USD in just last week with Coinbase. I feel absolutely silly jumping in this late. I remember hearing about Bitcoin some years ago and thought to myself, "neat, I wonder how that will turn out." 
Better late then never.

While doing a flip.

Lowest I saw was [8595.55 @ 1:36](
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:27:33
I mean technically yeah it did "crash" but, it reached even higher the next time.

Time to buy some more BITCOINS!!

I had a 7 year old Emachine laptop. I thought I could put it to some good use. Maybe I could use to do some folding instead or use that trade-in program offer from Best Buy.

A little off topic. What other coins does everyone else recommend?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:09:50
During tax season, How would you go about reporting this though? I joined around last month into the whole crypto scene. I certainly don't remember any of the losses or gains while trading. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:45:38
At this point I feel it's all about that profit returns. We are all here to make money. I have so far put 20.00 USD into BTC thus far. Is there a method to the madness?
I, for sure do not fully understand crypto myself but, if I can make a quick buck from "trash" sure why not.

For me it has typically taken at least 10 days. To deposit from my bank into Coinbase. 
Transferring from Coinbase to GDAX is instant. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:33:20
I am gonna wait i bit more, seems like its siting decreasing. According to GDAX/Coinbase its around 5750 and dropping...
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:45:50
wait wait, should I put a little into Litecoin now? Not really sure what this means.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:05:06
Noob incoming: if I have a few bitcoins in an electrum wallet, will I also receive the segwit2x coins after the fork?
Will I have to do something special to claim them?
Thank you.

Electrum 3.0 for the time being till Nano Ledger arrives.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:57:37
What's a good alternative besides Coinbase/GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:42:43
I jumped in maybe a week and half ago. I put in 20-30 USD so far between $6500-$7200). Looking at it now sitting in my Electrum wallet I feel a bit silly as it could have been so much more if I had invested earlier. I keep my hopes with me as I know to periodically deposit each week.

I bought back it was at an ATH around 10-14 k. I'll probably just wait till I can break even. After that I'll hope for it to crash like it previously did.
I still remember when it was at 3k earlier this year. Definitely should have bought more but was too stubborn and filled with regret.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:13:28
Haha same here... I made my first purchase when it was at the height of 72000 USD. Looking at it now it's hovering around 6200 USD.

Anyone know why is this happening though? I bought last year moved everything to a ledger and completely forgot about it. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:16:28
How much did they overcharge?
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:37:17
did it surpass 20k? I thought it only got to 19.7k.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:06:03
Is anyone able to explain why is it dropping?
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:33:18
I am so glad I got my *i*5 4690k and got an R9 280 before all of this BS...but then my asus z board stopped working and now I am sitting at stock 3.5Ghz... - _ -
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:54:49
any bets on how low it'll go?
I predict around 4500
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:27:08
I am in the same boat. Barely know the ins and outs about crypto currencies. I feel like I missed out so much. But then I think about it, all of this is pretty new to begin with. 
That euthremun(?) is still pretty low. Maybe it'll yield something in the next few years.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:45:51
wait wait wouldn't that mean that it'd take 7 years for the transaction to be received on Earth to buy more? The data would have to travel through space back to Earth.

I just recently got into it. Still learning and all, haven't thrown really money at it, yet.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:13:44
this is actually very true for the past couple of weeks/months.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:10:52
As someone that is not familiar with crypto currency, is it too late to get into the coin market?
Where should one start to learn?
Thank you
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:33:57
lololo omg 
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:01:13
I am in the US. As someone new and still learning. How many exchange sites does everyone use? 
I would like to use Bitstamp to buy some other coins that I am eyeing. 
GDAX seems like the go to for most in this post. Seems unsafe to sign up for both seeing as how I am pretty much required to input my SSN into almost all exchanges?
Should buy some BTC from GDAX and convert whatever amount to another coin of my choosing? 
Thank You.

Interesting thanks, I'll be sure to learn and never overextend my spendings.
