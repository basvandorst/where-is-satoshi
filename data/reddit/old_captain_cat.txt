Actually tons of interesting coins are there. Odn, prl and upf are all there. When I go on a 4chan shill hunt I usually find the gems there. Only have play money there, binance is my king.

Why is this sub still angry? Fuck. Did you not all make extra money from the fork? Who cares about the other side. Live a good life. I am a tolerant person but I don’t like this sub very much anymore. You used to be cool guys. It probably won’t be either bitcoin as world currency anyway they are both too slow and expensive for top tier.

Dude, you have a time machine. You can go back and rethink that strategy at the very least.

This is what Segwit and lightening network aim to solve. Bitcoin Cash split off to follow the original use case of bitcoin as cash payments. The two coins are now linked in a death match battle to become the one true bitcoin. Damn entertaining stuff! Get on board this wacky train!!

Bitcoin cash is the fork: bcc or bch. Hardfork, not a soft fork. Also not called an alt coin. A bitcoin fork.

This is silly bcc is bitcoin too. Bcc disagreed with small blocks and went down a different path. Bcc and btc did equal work in getting adoption in vendors over the past five years. Don't pretend they are 'newcomers' and standing on shoulders of anyone. This is a split of direction and not an alt coin. Call it what is is and don't be emotional.

Came to the comments to write this same thing. A country is producing gdp. Bitcoin is a transaction mechanism. This is like comparing the fluctuation cost of carrots to the bank valuation on farms in various regions. Just plain idiotic.

In Chaldean numerology BCCI is equal to 9 there fore 9 plus 12 and subsequently multiplied by 1 million is the reason I chose 21 million bitcoin to be the number and also because of a bunch of other reasons that I backwards engineered therefore half life 3 is confirmed. And also I am Jesus. And the moon landing was who shot JFK.

What score is this post?

Korean? I saw the same argument made in clear English by a Korean crypto youtuber and professional investor a couple of days ago. China has an endgame they are playing to harness crypto. Your theory fits that of Bitcoin Seoul.
This is necessary to crypto success. China is smart like that.

Bitcoin is not cryptocurrency's final form. It is literally the gold backer at this point. Reason: transaction times suck, and it doesn't decimate far enough for the planet. Something new is coming. Personally I haven't seen it yet but a coin is coming that won't inflate so hard and becomes the cash.

I paid $200 aud about 3 years ago... this is honestly the most fun I have had with $200 in my life! To the very low orbit moon!
