When is the AMA session?

Hi great development!
A question: both the trezor and my phone have micro USB sockets. I was looking for a simple short cable to connect both, but these are difficult to find. When searching for OTG cables I found mainly micro USB male to female USB (big) cable. Any advice? Is micro-b to micro-b ok?

What if you'd use the generated heat for heating your house, would that make it profitable? 
@_date: 2016-04-24 14:43:25
True, only by hiding your btc capital you could avoid paying tax, illegally. In my country there is a specific heading "other assets such as Bitcoin" in the yearly declaration. I assume even preventing the exchange to other currency would not exempt btc from being taxed. Luckily value increase is not counted as income here, only a small percentage of the total value is taxed.
@_date: 2016-04-16 11:36:52
After the halving the miners still need to pay the electricity bills. Do we expect a drop in difficulty, or will the miners just make less profit after the halving?
@_date: 2016-04-10 01:41:36
Great piece. 
Could the Bitcoin ecosystem eventually offer levels of privacy and fungibility similar to Zcash featured at the end of this article? 
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:28:56
Thanks for sharing. Reads like a suspense thriller. Sell the script and recover from the loss I'd say.
A pity Bob didn't take the opportunity to return the funds and leave quietly after being discovered. 
Congrats and keep it up!
@_date: 2016-04-12 14:09:09
There are millions upon millions of bitcoins in cold storage. 
A more relevant number probably is the total  minus  
The amount of  sold for covering electricity costs by the miners may be significant compared to that number. 
However, the electricity has to be paid for anyway, so only when the difficulty drops less btc needs to be collected (through mining reward and fees) and exchanged for fiat. Or, perhaps miners are presently making lots of btc and selling them for fiat, and after the halving they will loose their surplus above electricity costs.

Ship for filthy rich has sailed, let's jump aboard for a more reasonable 40k per Bitcoin rich now.
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:31:35
As of today Bitcoin is still hardly a payment network rather than a storage of value. Try trading $1000 worth of gold for the same negligible transaction fee as Bitcoin, either before or after the halving. Good luck.
In the meantime, Bitcoin based payment networks are in development as well. Wonderful times.

What about top 1% btc hoarders? 
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:16:28
Not sure wether 1 euro will correspond to same value in Bitcoin (0.05 or so). I assume it could also be a colored Satoshi which represents the euro. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 12:50:09
Congrats with your returned small fortune.
I actually had a similar problem earlier this year, where 2.76 BTC were booked from my wallet. I thought it was caused by me being enough dumbass to store my wallet on an online NAS server (even though encrypted). 
The transaction ID is:
Subsequent transactions seem to be meant to fractionilize the BTC to make them untracable. 
Anyway.. in case anyone has any advice. I guess it is learning money..

I stopped running a node when the blockchain size started to exceed my SD card. Ability to support segwit introduction however is definitely enough reason and incentive to upgrade the setup and fire it up again.

Switzerland, like EU member Luxembourg have been rich countries since long before the union because of a strong banking sector (Switzerland in particular by offering secret banking). Norway is rich because of a shitload of oil and in the future who knows a shitload of thorium. I am sure these two countries stayed out for libertarian reasons.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:45:31
My understanding:
Soft fork: old nodes still function, hard fork: each node needs to upgrade or is out. So even though UASF is forced upon miners, all users are still onboard regardless if they upgrade or not.
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:19:32
Saves a power plant or two as well.
@_date: 2016-06-25 21:44:03
Dream on. The vote to shut off Europe is coming forth out of fear for migration of people and conservatism, not libertarianism. It will rather redraw boundaries with a thicker line again, and add another layer of economic protectionism between countries within Europe. This apart from feeding another economic crisis can hardly be perceived as good news even from a libertarian viewpoint.

For each buyer there is a seller.

Well glad to see you perceive the Grexit as a good thing, not just as a Bitcoin investment opportunity regardless.
Not sure if leaving the EU will contribute to less government. And personally I see a lot of benefits living in within the EU, sorry to see Britain leave.

Thanks, get it. So (if not always) during a 12-word seed recovery one should make sure to work from a very clean computer. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 22:24:10
Same here.. 
Despite using so much resources, seems they just copied the mtgox balance without further investigation of ongoing transfers. I wonder where this money in limbo will appear in the creditor list.
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:46:56
The eagerness, almost celebration of the Brexit news by some bitcoiners appears a bit obscene to me, to be honest. Not as if it is a joyful event when a national currency drops in value. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:10:23
Hehe.. True if not for each seller. But at least the sum of btc sold equals sum of btc bought.

I don't think things like carbon dioxide emission or ammonia emission can be regulated locally without international agreements for instance. Replacing of the incandescent bulb, excellent example of an European agreement. International mobile phone calls at normal rates all across Europe, another nice example. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 18:35:33
I currently use a 12 word seed. Is this not safe enough you think?
And hats off for the continued support and updates to the Trezor team!
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:57:58
Not sure if the current price changes anything to the effect of the halving, since miners will have fewer bitcoins to sell regardless of the price. So with present attention and price rise in place, less bitcoins sold by miners will still have an additional impact on the price further upward I think.
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:43:33
Yeah, or to distinguish buyers with an outstanding bid at or below the present Bitcoin price, waiting for someone to actively sell at that price, from a buyer that actively buys the cheapest Bitcoin for sale, leaving the next cheapest Bitcoin at a slightly higher price. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:32:57

OK let's extrapolate till the next halving.

Nice discussion Guy's
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:06:10
It is a little scary spending time there, Kafka revisited. 
Is 95% consensus really a necessity? It gives an awful lot of power to a relatively small group of miners to block an exciting development.
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:23:46
Luckily the block reward drops every 4 years. 
The fee market does not necessarily scale with the btc price right..
@_date: 2016-11-20 21:15:39
Perhaps then we can conclude that democracy does work here, since the majority of network actors agree to adapt the proposals of the technically most skilled development team.
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:57:48
I assume the price of mining one coin will still approach the market price of one coin, but when the block reward halves, so should the mining expenses (assuming the bit coin price doesn't rise eventually).
Tx fees are indeed part of mining as well, but since the reward isn't fixed as in the block reward, there will be competition, and the miners accepting the cheapest tx fees will prevail. Might indeed result in a less secure network, but I expect responsible mining and wallet design may prevent this by using a reasonable standard fee as good practice. No miner will mine for free anyway.
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:36:00
Exactly, segwit.
@_date: 2016-11-20 12:26:00
Not sure if democracy is preferable at all times. I'd rather fly an aéroplane developed by the most skilled technical people rather than by the biggest political party.
@_date: 2016-11-07 12:41:05
Good points.. heat pumps need only 20 to 40% of the energy compared to resistive heating, so it seems unlikely the mining fees from asics will compensate for this. But perhaps there are devices thinkable that can presently only be made using resistive heaters where asics can fill in this function.
@_date: 2016-11-22 08:16:18
I see your point. When the market cap does indeed reach such levels though, then a fraction of a bitcoin would still be enough incentive to keep the hashing rate high. In 2040, market 1 trillion and 0,2 BTC block reward, the block reward would still equal present day levels. The kid would still need a big USB miner to get a block. 
Interesting problem in any case. I guess the solution lies in working towards a really distributed network again, 21 inc like.
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:15:23
Oh please.. 1MB block size yields 7 transactions per second. 2 MB yields 14 transactions per second. 
Four.teen.transactions.per.second.... for a global payment system. Wake up. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 08:40:53
If they shut it down, the confirmation time will double for at most one month, and after the difficulty correction business will be as usual. But there are probably more nasty things that can be done, like prioritizing certain transactions and slowing others. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:15:53
Thanks! 
So it would not be possible to replace everything older than one year by a hash? I guess we would also need to keep track of each address and holdings, which Bitcoin presently does by remembering all transaction. I am aware that it is necessarily a different model.
Your last remark I don't fully get, since after a year of recreating the blockchain till today, we are one year with increased difficulty ahead as well?
@_date: 2015-07-31 08:53:57
That would be good news. But these fake accounts sold their fake bitcoins for real fiat. Still the overall balance is not sufficient. I guess the difference is in the increased value of Bitcoin over time. Can't imagine half a billion fiat money was spent unnoticed.
@_date: 2015-07-24 08:13:14
Could a bitcoin-like protocol also work by just storing say last years transactions, and cutting what happened before? 
In any case, I think A in one or another form will be viable eventually. What about a side chain taking care of microtransactions without storing all data infinitely, just per day or week.
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:16:41
Still don't get this argument. Apart from the 48 weeks you'd also need to keep up with the progressing existing blockchain, so your calculation should include the needed hashing power for the future 48 weeks as well? This would cost more than a 51% attack, even &gt;100% of the present network strength. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 21:40:21
It does make some sense though to increase electricity cost for everyone to subsidize solar panels? Solar panel owners benefit because of reduced energy consumption, which benefits the whole country in the end.
@_date: 2016-09-07 23:12:40
Interesting. Why would Orange offer this, how do they benefit from Bitcoin payments?

Great news, thumbs up for sensible voters out there.
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:33:53
A truly decentralized mining system though may make the system less agile: instead of a handful of mining conglomerates, tens of thousands or more micro miners would need to be talked into a hard fork if needed again in the future.
Let's get it right once and for all with the upcoming fork, and after rely on off-chain developments for the rest of eternity.
@_date: 2015-03-14 02:01:00
Ok, Thanks again, I should have checked out some more posts here before posting this.

Thanks for the link to this article. Could be much faster though according to this schedule, 12.2 seems around the corner. Main hurdle to be taken indeed is 95% miner adoption requirement. Hopefully the classic miners will allow for quick intro of SegWit. At least they have a big stake in it as well, so I would expect a quicker activation of SegWit.
@_date: 2016-05-20 08:25:20
... SegWit enabling off-chain scaling as soon as Lighting Networks are available, which are also being tested on the testnet presently. 
One day we may be glad the actual blockchain growth rate has remained within the 10s of GB yearly for a while.
@_date: 2016-05-29 12:05:39
Yeah, I had a similar plan. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:55:07

Unfortunately my level of coding is amateur level.. Would this book with a companion C# course be doable? Will dive into it anyway!
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:31:21
These are great initiatives. But they just support sending btc from phone to phone.  What may have helped Mpesa go viral is the direct application of charging phone cards, offering direct value to users, whereas btc may not be directly valuable within some present economies.

Great job. Final answer really touches on core challenge. You clearly focus on the long term viability of bitcoin as an independent currency.
@_date: 2015-03-24 12:05:49
I read also about using NAS as storage, since this is already running and consuming power anyway will try and use this option.

Yes, Ethereum is a great Development.
And yes, adoption of Bitcoin in developing countries is one of the best things that could happen to a lot of people.

Can you explain?
@_date: 2016-05-14 18:20:22
Do you expect a price drop at the time of the halving?
@_date: 2016-05-19 08:33:14
Are you in denial that scaling beyond the present Bitcoin scale is not solved for neither altcoin? Bitcoin is just the first to hit this mark. With current hard work on scaling solutions it seems a great time to get involved in the Bitcoin economy to me.

The mining equipment and electricity cost need to be paid for anyhow. When the hash rate is maintained roughly, which I personally expect, the $1200000 (minus profit) daily cost is maintained as well.
