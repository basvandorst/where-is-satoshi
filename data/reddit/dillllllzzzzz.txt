I don't invest in something I don't believe in. The developers in bitcoin are no where near the same level as in Ethereum, hence why jack shit has been done with bitcoin.

So another bitcoin version can be spawned? Lol

What are you spending with bitcoin? And 10 CENTS for a transfer fee genius.

Let's talk once bitcoin processes more transaction without having a backlog of over 200k

Bitcoin is a store of value because no one can take their money out in time with the transaction backlogs. Only pumps with rumors of hard forks and hard forks. 
Been waiting for a block size increase for seems like ever. 
Man, what a great investment.

How are the bitcoin fees treating you guys? My .10 transfers are looking good with ETH.

Bitcoin has been in beta phase for 7 years and Ethereum is been around for 2 and has accomplished more..��

Pretty sure shitcoin cash has higher fees, doesn't have smart contracts, nor can you build dapps on it, and it's 3rd in market value.
So how is it more valuable?  
And bitcoin itself is destroying the "common goal", I thought it was suppose to be a currency, yet it's a "storage of value" now.

Nah, we will be good eventually, once people realize how slow, expensive bitcoin really is. 
On the other hand, we'll have developers creating applications on ETH creating its own little economy of apps. 
We will be fine, on the other hand..what will bitcoin do? ����

I just don't understand..plus ETH handles way more transactions and does it seamlessly. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:05:44
Sooo..there's been an attack on the network for the past 6-7 months causing higher fees?
