You are in a unregulated market why do you expect the US government to come to your aid?  
However the TOS doesnt say I am going to steal your wallet it juat says they will not exchange usdt for usd and it is not usd.
Easy they are using the money to either prop up the market or siphon the actual USD out. Probably both.
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:27:59
Haha so how will you hold this company from thw british virgin islands to account?  Just because they are in a place renouned for scams and laundering. Even if you do catch up with them you have to argue against that they literally said it wasn't redeemable for USD.
Noone can say 100 percent what is happening as they control the exchange however the fact is hundreds of millions of fake dollars are being pumped into the exchanges.
The fact is if ths money was being used for what they say it is you would expect rapid rises. However we don't.
Your explaination is that people keep requiring tethers to put limit orders in lol.
Meanwhile tether prints money at a faster rate than the FED and you act like its business as usual.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:07:06
or maybe they see the writing on the wall and are jumping ship.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:08:25
It doesnt matter if tether is backed by assets or not.  You can't redeem usdt for usd from tether.  They  explicitly say in their TOS that it is not redeemable.
So even if it was backed you are shit out of luck as you cant redeem it. More than likely if it is backed by assets the majority of which are bitcoin because there is no way in hell they are securing 200 million dollars a day.
Its not a wild accusation 700 million tether dollars has been fed into the system in just the last week. 
There is no way that is all limit orders. It just doesnt add up.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:44:01
Yeah who knows.  All we can say for sure it that it doesn't add up.
The fact that the exchange is literally printing it's own money and seems to be actively be taking a part in it makes me think they are a bit more involved than trying to prevent the market from crashing.
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:40:04
Of course. It's like SQL Server.
Just a tool for organizing data.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:54:23
That is a pretty big stretch, it's going to hit a billion dollars worth of limit orders soon if that is the case.
Even more so that it is happening every single day.  How many hundreds of millions of tethers do you think will be printed tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:30:21
The fact the tether exists in the first place and is run by the very exchanges. You don't find that suss at all?
You have a place literally printing money and throwing it on their own exchanges. It has just about printed more money in the last week than it has in the entire year prior. They are printing at levels you would expect from the US treasury which is absolutely astronomical in size compared to bitcoin.
But no nothing suss at all :P

Blockchain is a trustless decentralized datasbase. 
Bitcoin is more of an application that uses blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:55:17
Here is the issue.
Given that 1800 extra coins are mined daily that means  bitcoin needs 22 million dollars of new money each day to sustain the price. Now bitcoin is about half of the market so say 50 million for all cryptos.
Now we don't have all the information on hand but we do know that tether has started to print 200 million dollars per day.
So why hasn't the price jumped significantly if there is so much new money daily? That is really worrying and suggest shady business. The fact that the exchange and tether and one and the same just screams something is up.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:28:02
Yeah but bitcoin is 50% of the market. So make it 50 million is required of new coins MAX and that is providing all the miners are dumping every coin they are mining into the exchange.
200 million tethers is entering daily at a minimum and the price hasn't been rising significantly. So why the gap?
Tether is currently printing on the levels you would expect of the US Treasury and they are astronomical in size compared to Crypto and part of what they are doing is replacing damaged bills.

All of which can be replicated.   Perception is whats driving bitcoin.

Go get em tiger.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:17:24
This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:04:40
What gets me is what makes bitcoin more valuable than any if the other alt coins out there? Really the answer is perception and it was first.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:15:23
Pretty sure it's the trying to kill people thing that he is in deep shit for.
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:37:42
Has anyone managed to cash out a single dollar of tether?
It doesn't matter if the money is there if no one can cash out.
@_date: 2018-03-28 07:58:15
No box?
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:54:25
Fucking bullshit they are ready.
I don't give a shit what technology it is accepting payments of any kind is fucking hard and takes a shitload of preparation.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:49:52
@_date: 2018-07-10 04:05:14
No it hasn't.
Also who has actually redeemed tether for USD?
The fact noone has I would consider a bigger cause for concern.  Even if they have the money in an account it is no good if noone can redeem.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:57:40
Yeah you have another problem which is the miners which need to sell coin to pay their bills. Until the coins run out this will be an issue.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:21:42
I have been in and out of bitcoin for awhile and to be honest I am not a fan. Seen the suicide hotline posted far too many times in these threads. 
It's like a financial market on crack, it goes to the highest highs and then 2 hours later while on a low breaks into your house and steals your vcr.  Will it come down to earth who knows.  However it has far too many crashes and one day I think it is going to stick, just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:38:02
Bitcoin does everything insanely fast. It grows in value rapidly and it crashes just as rapidly.
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:49:13
bitcoin thats why
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:57:28
Let's say I bought half a watermelon for 1000 dollars when a full watermelon has a value of 2000 and the watermelon value suddenly drops to 1000. Will I now have 1 whole watermelon or will I have lost 500 dollars?
