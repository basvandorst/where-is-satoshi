Joe Justice sounds like a fake name. Is it the name you were born with?

This is essentially true for all fiat currencies. The value of any currency is dependent on its users believing it can eventually be exchanged for things (i.e. "the promise of a widespread economy"). Speculating in Bitcoins is functionally the same as speculating in commodity futures or other currencies; its value is determined by belief and guesses about the future. It's not a special security.

270 Mhash/s average? You can probably do better on a 5850... Are you using the -v -w 128 flags? Are you raising your GPU clock and lowering your memory clock? You can probably get 300.

If you're intserested in it, why not research it? Bitcoin.org has all the links to get you started. I can tutor you, but not for free.

I recommend mining.bitcoin.cz. I use it.
(Note: I have no stake in this site and do not benefit in any way if people join it.)

It's not.

Yes, probably the easiest method.

Mining is self-limiting. If every computer in the world was mining, the blocks would quickly become extremely difficult to find and mining would no longer be profitable (i.e. the income would not be enough to offset the energy cost).
You might want to read the mining FAQ.

Mining with a CPU is not worth it. Got an ATI video card? Use it instead.
EDIT: Also, don't mine with the client. It sucks. Get poclbm or diablominer.

OP, why did you put your bitcoin address at the end of your post? Am I supposed to honor your begging simply because you made this (not terribly well-supported) declaration?
@_date: 2011-06-12 21:28:19
If the exchange is immediate, then you'd need a single escrow service with branches in Germany and Japan. And if you have that, then the service is doing the transfer internally and there's no need to involve bitcoin; the service just updates its ledgers. And there's still no anonymity.

The $1500 is what we call "unrealized gains." I.e. it wouldn't even show up on a proper ledger. And, supposing the US government knew about it, they would not tax that $1500 until it was converted back to USD (at which point the gains are realized). This is elementary bookkeeping.

Biometric measurements are data. Which means they can be copied, created, falsified. Which makes them useless for generating bitcoins (or doing anything securely at a distance, for that matter).
I don't think OP understands how biometrics work.

That's a specious argument. Someone probably used that one on the Wright brothers a year before Kittyhawk (i.e. "Birds evolved over millions of years...").
@_date: 2011-06-12 07:25:33
That wouldn't be sustainable unless you kept pumping money into BTC (which would just cause the average value to increase). Also, volatile markets encourage speculation.

You're asking an extremely small sample of random people to make guesses about the future value of a volatile commodity. That's idiotic. If you cared, you'd go do your own research.
Why are people so lazy?
@_date: 2011-06-12 21:22:28


Biometrics are hashes based on source data (e.g. an image of a fingerprint). So what stops me from taking random data of the appropriate size, calling it a fingerprint/DNA/whatever, and generating a hash from it? You would need some very advanced software to tell that it wasn't actually valid (and someone could use that same software to generate convincing data, so it's not a great solution).
Biometrics are good for building access and the like. Situations where the user only has limited access to the scanning hardware and can't manipulate the data after scanning. But at a distance, with the user controlling the scanning hardware and the software used to send the data? It's pointless.
@_date: 2011-06-04 02:47:09
Don't know why you're being downvoted -- it's a good point. Bitcoin wallets have the same risks as any piece of sensitive data. A lot of people are complaining about Bitcoin "vulnerabilities" that already exist when dealing with cash or valuable data.
(E.g. "Oh no, what if someone uses Bitcoin to hire a hitman?" Hello! People can do that with cash already! Etc. etc.)
@_date: 2011-06-12 07:18:31


WTF would a "controlling majority" be? Bitcoin isn't a company with stockholders meetings. There's no voting.
Also, transactions are voluntary. The only way someone can *buy* Bitcoins is if other people willingly sell theirs. You can't force someone to sell you Bitcoins.
But let's say some entity owned 90% of the BTC. What would happen? Would that stop the holders of the remaining 10% from using their BTC as they liked? No, it wouldn't.
@_date: 2011-06-01 03:00:39
If an economy and its medium (currency) are separate things, as you posit, then how can you say that Bitcoin doesn't have an economy? In fact, since its use is not restricted by any border, one could say it is linked to every "national economy."
I think you are tangling a currency's genesis (how it arises) with function. The former is an arbitrary artifact of history and is not necessarily relevant. For an extreme example, a government could suddenly declare that sausages are legal tender. The sausage currency would be backed by the exact same thing the euro is: People's belief in the rule-makers.

I think I put mine at GPU 830 (higher values made the blocks return invalid), memory as low as possible. I get 305 Mhash/s on my 5850.

The author clearly hasn't done much research. He could be right about the deflation problems, but I'm not trusting someone who's not willing to do proper research before declaring something a scam.

Couldn't Amazon just use software to set the BTC cost to the average exchange rate for the day (less a little to offset fees to convert to USD immediately after the transaction)?

Doesn't the difficulty double every x blocks?
@_date: 2011-06-03 22:52:42
I don't want to retread a bunch of stuff, but isn't eventual mass deflation a certainty? Eventually the number of bitcoins in circulation will stop growing but the economy probably won't stop growing. How can BTC not increase in value at that point?
@_date: 2011-06-04 11:22:44
It's entirely possible to continue splitting BTC into ever smaller pieces. Not saying this is a surefire defense against deflation, but this particular issue will not be a major obstacle.
@_date: 2011-06-12 19:16:02


What is the point of Bitcoin in that exchange? Why not just convert one currency to another without an intermediary (like what happens when you use a major credit card for these transactions)?
@_date: 2011-06-07 21:46:46
Amazon already deals with currency conversion. Why would it be stupid?
