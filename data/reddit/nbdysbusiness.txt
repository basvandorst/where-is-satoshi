Thank you very much for your thoughtful response.  I think this answers my question, though I wish there was a different answer to it.  There's still an uneasy feeling about storing most of your funds in an address that you've never tried before.  I also didn't know that your public key can make you vulnerable as you've stated.

There is safe, and there is also confidence in safety which I think is very important to less technical users.  One way to raise that confidence is test you are able to send some funds from your cold storage and keep using the same address and keys.  I think it probably just takes a long time to instil that confidence without sending any money from that address.

Also I think a better analogy to a paper wallet would be an unbreakable safe with a money slot and a digital lock that you can only try once.  At least with a piggybank you can always get out your hammer.

I think it's "in the past" but the lingering effects will take several months or longer for bitcoin to recover.  I think when people outside of bitcoin hear of a 60M hack, it stays with them for a long time.

bitcoinpaperwallet specifically specifies that if you spend your paper wallet you need to send all your funds to a new wallet.  It also doesn't refer to offline transactions

My point is I want to keep the same address for a paper wallet as cold storage and use it to send small amounts from time to time with offline transactions so I can keep it as cold storage.

I'd say you'd have a chip implanted that verifies heart rhythem, blood type, dna, and some other biometrics.  You can multisig with other family members

Blocksize increases will only get you so far. You will still max out at 15 tps.

I believe they are doing it on both
