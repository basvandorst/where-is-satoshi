Well as of today hese $20,000 in the green!

With BIP91 there is a hard fork to fixed 2MB blocks. With BIP148 there is no such hard fork and i dont think block sizes are capped at 2MB. Also who is controlling the codebase now - Miners or Core? There are vast nuances between how we get to Segwit.

oops you got there 1 minute b4 me. Youre officialy the 1st to announce this on reddit. well spotted

Good observation and theory. That means Slush vote is touch and go! Will monitor their next block signed for changes.

Were at 75.8% hashing  support now. As smaller pools come online it takes much longer for their blocks to come thru to be counted as their block frequencies are much lower
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:45:32
Its just the sum of the hash-rate share of each pool signalling for BIP91. It takes time to translate into the signalling stats becuase block counts need to happen to over time to include the full signalling of a particular pool

These votes are needed or else its a touch and go situation with the junior pools that have very wide deviations on their block aquistion profiles that dont neatly fit into 336 blocks
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:16:33
now maybe he going to panic about the flaws discovered in BU scaling and switch back to BIP91 ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:19:28
quite correct in fact the statistical variability of block aquisition rises as your hashrate falls, so to rely on 2.5 days worth of blocks to get proper statistical expectation from a small blocker could be iffy.
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:13:30
well spotted
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:46:39
Agreed. Otherwise a bunch of minors needed to carry us over the line and then we relying on statistical luck of the high standard deviation block aquisition profiles that wont fit neatly into 336 blocks
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:12:26
Yes we need at least 1 preferrably more of these majors to signal or else it becomes touch and go becuase we cant rely on the statistical certainly of block aquisition from the minors in a 336 block window
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:50:44
This is encouraging however the hashrate share of BIP91 signalling pools is shy of 80% and the 80% you seeing now is statistical good fortune on some lucky pools. Unless one of the remaining majors comes aboard or the larger pools increase their share of hashrate in next 3 days this means we will rely on luck to remain above 80% since the block aquisition profile of junior pools has wide statistical variance that does not fit neatly into 336 blocks

ROFL. You made my day. It was a blue Monday but now its better . Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:59:08
Astute comment. Yes there is no guarantee hashrate share will translate into identical Segwit % signalling. Especially if BIP91 relies on a large number of small pools to get to 80% becuase the statistical variance of theese small pools as to when they aquire blocks or not doesnt really fit into 300 odd blocks, more like 1000 blocks.

NYA was just the New York Agreement "promising to commit" but BIP91 is a commitment. NYA is academic, the buck stops with BIP91
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:43:16
Last block VIaBTC signed was for BIP91
