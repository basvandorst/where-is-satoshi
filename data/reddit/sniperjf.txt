both the searches and the rally relate to an increase in flow which can be attributed to new people. Meaning some of those people who searched found their way to an exchange and bought some bitcoin. 
If interest wanes that means that yeah the flow will slow down but it wont necesarily collapse it will just stabilize or go back to pre-search rise.
At least that's the way I took it

If you lost money in your investments you deduct some of those losses and get a tax break (I think it caps around 2,000 USD in terms of tax deductions).
But that's only if you sold the Bitcoin. Meaning you actually sold the Bitcoin at a loss. Which you could sell it today and rebuy it immediately after so that you can claim that capital loss, but the capital gain of your Bitcoin (assuming it recovers and moons) will be higher since the entry was lower. So decide what's best for you and careful if you do sell and buy as you will lose in the trade fees and potential price change between the sell and buy

It's probably easier to kidnap a person than to rob a store as the kidnapping can be done in a place where no one may notice it happening. 
A while back "Express Kidnappings" where a thing where people were taken, mugged of anything of value, and then taken to an ATM to cash out as much as someone could in a day, and then released.  I can definitely see this sort of crime happening with things like bitcoin if they force you to give up your passphrases (and to be honest, you can earn money back, but you can't earn another life)

This is FUD being spread.
There is nothing wrong with this law. In the US you are suppose to disclose your holdings of foreign bank account to pay taxes on it and for laundering purposes. It's in your benefit to do this so if you decide to bring the money to the US questions aren't raised on whether that money is legal. 
Because of the way Bitcoin works it can't be overseen by the US so it's treated in a similar matter. Nothing wrong with it. If anything it actually legitimizes cryptos even more which is good and lastly. When Bitcoin moons you will not have to explain to the government how you magically have millions of dollars when you cash out (because any drug dealer could cash out a few million USD and avoid laundering claims by saying that it was 'that Bitcoin they mined in 2010')

@_date: 2017-11-21 09:55:17
I did, I actually made a little extra since I got back in when I saw it stabilizing and then bought a tiny dip so it recovered any trade loses and technically made like .5% so while in retrospect it may have been dangerous I feel it was worth trying as had it crashed harder I would have made a killing. That said next time I'll hodl and just buy more

'Millionaires' don't just store money/gold in some vault Scrooge McDuck style....  they invest it in business ventures and diversify. That's how they became/remain rich in the first place... Most have debt as they get higher returns from their money than they do from paying back. So the logic is flawed here why they'd want Bitcoin. And as someone else said, How many 'millionaires' store a gold bullion in their 'vaults'.  Furthermore, one Bitcoin means nothing when you have can fractions of it. Lastly, stop trying to create FOMO. We all know Bitcoin is good and these posts remind me of the kind of crap people post in scamcoins

Here's the thing. Bitcoin may be finite but a fork can essentially double the amount of bitcoin. I say essentially because in reality it will be like Bitcoin cash where it does have value but not 50-50. Point is these forks can inflate/devalue Bitcoin as they happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:50:33

I mean think about it. A new iPhone/ps4/something comes out and you really, really want to buy it. You have $500 that you could easily spend and pay it. But you also know that if you don't buy it. That $500 will become $1000 in a year. Do you buy it or save? I face this every day when deciding how much to invest in crpyto and how much to indulge myself. It's a balance.
Some will still buy it, but in general less people will buy it than if that $500 remained $500 in a year or was really worth $450 in a year. So in general that slows down the economy when people buy less. Which is why high interest rates tend to slow down economies. 
Now obviously there is more to it but I think a good analysis on deflation would benefit us all. Just to understand better what a good balance would be since I feel deflation or inflation in extreme are both just as bad
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:00:32
While it is possible to optimize the mining which is what I believe AsicBoost did after reading about them,  all they really did was try to optimize all the computations. As for trying to cheat their way by guessing the right answer with machine learning. This is highly unlikely as that would be the equivalent of creating a program that could predict your passwords every time.
I don't doubt that they could design a heuristic to try and guess the correct nonce faster than it would normally take, but whether that takes them 1 year or 100 to actually do is anyone's guess. I mean keygens are cracked all the time but I doubt this is anywhere that easy.
So tl;dr I doubt it, there is no shortcut, and if they were to find one that would directly apply on other sort of np hard computations which would in its own be the breakthrough of a lifetime in computer science
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:28:52
With all respect to Bitcoin. It's not a bad idea to diversify and hold a bit of both. That way if you need liquidity you can cash out of one and not lose since I feel eth is less bumpy

I think this year we've gotten to the point where people investing in Bitcoin are more about making money than believing in it. That isn't to say the older guys are still there, is just that this influx of new people I just don't know whether this will be good or bad long term. (Good in that bitcoin grows, bad in that it can potentially make a bubble and raise volatility)

Before anyone celebrates. The bill has yet to pass the HoR before becoming a law. Also, the Arizona Senate bill includes a provision mandating that cryptocurrency payments be converted to U.S. dollars within 24 hours of their payment. Which means Uncle Sam won't be hodling any of it, but most importantly meaning that they recognize Bitcoin as a form of payment, not as a currency.
What I wonder is if the price of bitcoin crashes during the time they cash it out and they get less than you owed if they will accept the loss or request more

It was a comedy sketch, that's all. It's nice that she made it sound positive for the most part since she could have made fun of the crash and ended on a bad note. As for exposure, It may have raised curiosity of a few new people but this by no means is a major feat. It also hasn't made Bitcoin price moon or anything. Bitcoin has been featured in news shows before. If anything this may have helped introduce Bitcoin to a different demographic but unfortunately not one that really would invest in the first place

Also less incentives for miners which means miners may move to other cryptos that give better incentives which means less decentralization and higher odds  transaction fees will go up due to mempool increase which then means if those go up enough some miners will come back. On the other hand less miners will then mean the difficulty will go down which will bring more miners and the cycle continues.
All in all it will mean price will fluctuate more often than regular.
