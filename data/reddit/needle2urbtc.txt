2 and a half to three years ago I didn't really know what Bitcoin was only that I needed it to purchase things on the darkweb, so I would buy and make my purchases using Bitcoin because that's all they would accept. One day I heard one of my vendors talking about how the price increase as been great for them so they rarely cash then out to fiat. That's when I fist became interested. I've spent all my bitcoins since while they were still pretty cheap to buy, God I wish I knew what I know now. I did buy into ethereum and litecoin to HODL over the summer, which turned out to be good for me. I've now expanded into other alt coins. I feel like 2018 will be a good year 2017 was the year alot of people figured out that it's something they can do themselves without a broker easily from home. Once we get through this red sea I feel like we will see another tusnami of green. Although I really can't base that on a hole lot other than hopes and dreams right now.  The darkweb introduced me to cryptocurrencies and if I wasn't spending my money on crypto I would be buying things that would be way worse for me. Crypto, not the worst thing you could spend your money on!

Go to the green door in San Francisco and you can go upstairs to the green room and smoke. It's changing fast out west here. There are also special pop up events in the valley where you can buy weed from a bunch of different vendors and hang out and smoke, dab, etc while enjoying the market.
