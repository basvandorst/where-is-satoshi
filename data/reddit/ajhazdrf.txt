Bitcoin.tax will give you a statement of open positions at year end. Not sure if it’s necessary or not.

Does this mean that if your salary minus the projected capital gains owed isn’t a significant amount that it would make sense to retire for a year when you cash out? Or work part time? (Kind of what OP suggests with 37.5k salary)  or is that illegal?

Is this going to be safe to do? I want to dump 2x but have no interest in potentially dumping btc on accident. Don’t understand well enough, but the automated half custodian sounds promising

I was just thinking today about how I would even use my Ledger Nano in person.  I'd have to carry a laptop with my wallet on it too in order to send, correct?  Seems like a mobile wallet with a small amount would be much easier.

I was just in your situation and my transaction finally confirmed after three days last night.  Manually set your fee next time.

I have a hardware wallet, running a node just to host a wallet isn’t really the goal. I assumed based on posts here that adding (my minuscule) hashpower to a no2x pool would be helpful if a lot of ppl did it. 
I understand which side I want to support.  Not really interested in debating because there’s plenty of other threads for that.  Having a larger role in the network is my biggest motivator, so if you have tips on how to make myself useful it’d be appreciated.

So running a node is not actually helpful is what I’m gathering.

Good to hear.  I've seen people talk about some wonky $7000 fees.  The fast option for me was only $1.09, should have just done that.

When I started downloading it said 13 hours. Now it stays stuck in the 3 days to a week plus area at 0.18% rate or so.  My internet hasn’t slowed on any other devices so idk what happened. Doesn’t seem like it’s actually making progress even when I leave it on for days at a time.

This deserves its own post.  Would love to see actual counterarguments in r/bitcoin

What forums do you follow outside of Reddit? Been curious about that. I’ve read old forum posts where Satoshi was active but not sure on current ones.

Thanks for the replies.  I had never heard of transactions getting "dropped" and returned.  Learning new things +1

Import trades to bitcoin.tax, pay 15% (in US) of gains on investments held more than a year.

Could someone explain what exactly “8btc on a hard drive” means? You have your private keys written out or encrypted there or what? 
I’ve seen posts of “10btc” or whatever on a piece of tape stuck to the side of a hard drive that ppl have found but I came in during the trezor/ledger era, don’t really get this.
