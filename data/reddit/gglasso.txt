I'm not a financial advisor, so take this with a grain of salt. I love Bitcoin and do think it will play a vital role in our future, but if the money you put into Bitcoin for your daughter has a significant value right now, I'd pull a chunk and put into a safe investment.  
$50,000 with a $500 annual addition and 5% interest rate will work out to about $110,000 by the time your daughter graduates.
$100,000 with a $500 annual addition and 5% interest rate will work out to about $208,000. 6% interest gives you $237,000.
Even in 14 years that will nearly pay for a full four years of college, if not fully. Or make a hell of a nest egg gift.

Think of it as the unparalleled opportunity for complete financial autonomy. Welcome to the future!

For all our sakes, I hope you're right. I'd love to snag some more Bitcoin at $2,000 or less. That being said, even sub-4k is a good price.

There is no such thing as an "accredited investor" in cryptocurrency. It's far too young an idea with an incredible amount of volatility. Anyone claiming to be an "expert" is really just guessing. It's fun watching YouTube videos and reading analysis where people throw up fancy looking graphs and talk about "resistance," but their analysis is often incorrect. I wouldn't look at anyone who predicted the pullback at $5,000 to be some incredible soothsayer, either. Any dolt who holds Bitcoin knew there would be a sell off at the 5k mark, causing a decrease in price. Same will happen at 6k, 7k, etc. If you want an "accredited" opinion on personal finance, go speak with an advisor and open a diversified portfolio in stocks, bonds, etc. The average 5-15% current return on many investments is what I would recommend to most people, anyways.
If you truly believe Bitcoin will play a large role in the coming months, years, and decades, you would know that an individual holding any amount of Crypto is technically part of the mythical one percent. Whether that person's Crypto portfolio is worth $100 USD currently is irrelevant. They're still an early adopter, that is indisputable. 
Your snooty attitude is really unwelcome by all. Like I said, you must be a Bitcoin millionaire to be acting so high and mighty. And I HIGHLY doubt you are. Here's my "accredited investor" analysis...you purchased 2 BTC at $3000 apiece and think you are the next 1%. Get out.

Possibly. It's entirely speculation. Honestly speaking you have no idea what could happen. We could wake up tomorrow and it could be $10,000 and never drop below that price again. Entirely unlikely, but it could happen. It could also drop to $1 apiece and never gain again. 
People like yourself have been waiting for the optimal time to buy as if you can time the market. I suspect you're day trading, in which case all I'll say is good luck. Nothing backs Bitcoin? Quite honestly, there's more that fundamentally "backs" Bitcoin than the essentially worthless fiat you're currently holding. Not being condescending, but I am suspicious that you don't entirely understand crypto.

For all you know, owning 1 BTC could make someone a "millionaire," though I doubt anybody will care about the USD by that point. Honestly, for a Bitcoin god like yourself who is sitting on a small fortune (/s), you should be praying that 1 BTC goes that high, because then you can be one of the global elite!
Lose your attitude, "pleb." Sad that a shitter like you making fun of people learning about cryptocurrencies is part of this community.

Ever heard of confirmation bias? You don't get to cherry pick a downturn that is the result of news you had no knowledge of until a few days ago. If the price had never dropped I would have never heard from you again. That'd be like if the prices goes to $15,000 in December and I message you. 
You won't have the balls to buy at $2,000 if it gets there. You'll be waiting for $1,500. ZOOM OUT.
