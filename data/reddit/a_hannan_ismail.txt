No. Bitcoin is global. If one jurisdiction outlaws buying, holding and selling, business will simply move elsewhere. It will create a black market in the place where it is outlawed, with prices at a premium.
The issue isn't really about banning or outlawing it. I don't think the conversation is heading in that direction. Instead, the focus of attention seems to be on regulation and what regulation should try to achieve.
Regulation can go both ways. It can provide consumer protections, tighten AML, and positive things like that. That's what the PBOC has done this year to date. Or regulation can be so restrictive it stifles innovation and entrepreneurship.
We are beginning to see government and central banks thinking about sovereign crypto. I think that's where the debate is going to be: essentially a debate over which form of crypto we trust more.

Just buy a little direct. Ignore faucets. Don't use exchanges to store it. Coinbase is okay but they are turning into the Google of the industry.
Consider Uphold: 100%+ reserve, strong on KYC/AML, and you can convert to other currencies and assets on their platform if you want.

Holders do so on the assumption that other people will use BTC and demand for it will grow. Holding reduces the amount of BTC in circulation so if this squeezes supply then the price could rise.

Does this "help" bitcoin? Depends. If it is a payment rail, a store of value and a protocol on which we build things, then holding seems to fit into the second use case. We are beginning to see that happening. This suggests bitcoin is maturing, which i think is a good thing.

By waiting for skittish institutional investors get spooked by the volatility they've caused, wait for the price to fall, and buy cheap(er)?
In all seriousness I don't know. Not sure approval at this stage is a good thing. Much more interested in a really good bitcoin company going for an IPO at some point in the future. Something industrial. Financial instruments such as ETFs are one step removed from that reality.
