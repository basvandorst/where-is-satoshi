It went down like 80% a few years ago.

No one really knows until it happens.

How do you know you'll have gains? Just because bitcoin gained in the past does not mean it will continue to gain when you buy it. What if you buy bitcoin, and 2 days later it crashes by 30%? Then you will be in debt to the credit card company with 30% less money. Are you okay with that?


If you want stability, don't invest in individual stocks (which can suddenly crash by 20% if a company releases a bad financial report), invest in index funds.

Because Newsweek put it on their cover and it went viral across the internet. In the past it was always just a random blurb that didn't get much attention.

There will be no apology or retraction until the real Satoshi comes forward with proof (not likely). Or if Dorian can definitively prove that he isn't Satoshi (probably not possible). Until then, Newsweek/Leah will continue to claim Dorian=Satoshi even though they know they're wrong.

If Dorian isn't the real Satoshi then he won't want any bitcoins. Dorian claims to be totally unfamiliar with bitcoins.
If Dorian is the real Satoshi then he owns half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins.
Either way, sending bitcoins to Dorian is not very useful.

Okay, here's something for you to think about:
Dorian, who isn't the real Satoshi, was so shocked that someone would show up at his house asking weird questions about something called "bitcoins" that he just said whatever he needed to say to make the strange reporter go away.

Because he doesn't want Dorian's life to be ruined as a result of his fake name?

Gavin thought the reporter (Leah) was just doing a routine story about Bitcoin. Turns out she was harassing a guy who didnt want to talk to her, and Gavin now regrets helping her with her Bitcoin research.

Another point to consider, is that US population was 100 million 100 years ago. Today it's 323 million. If we didn't have steady and predictable inflation we'd be buying iPhones today for like $1.50.

The variable that holds the input file ($signature) is not the same variable that is used for decoding ($signiture).
