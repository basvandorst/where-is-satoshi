I did witness these mini-trades.   People we doing many .001-.01 trades in bulk.  I first noticed is when we were around 230 and a ton from 210 to 195.  At that time, I just unplugged because I was not going worry about people panic selling or manipulating.  People will just need to wise up over time.

They have a reason, this will open the way for a new Gox to step on the scene and it will ruin there reputation.  That is reason enough to care.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:36:41
Then you don't understand black markets.  All of those would apply to Bitcoin if is were made illegal.  Use your imagination.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:39:48
Everyone has their own agenda.  That doesn't mean it is malice either.  Remember it is usually not the host that choices the topics, guests and angles to use but the "producer" and the "producer" reports to management.  This means there may or may not be direct influence on coverage.  If history is a guide, then it is more likely there is a developing agenda on how to spin Bitcoin and also they do not understand it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:34:11
It is either you own Bitcoins or you don't Bitcoin has a fixed supply that is divisible.   So if you are offering margin, then you are extending it from your own supply.   In this case, is the company is offering margin, where are they getting the coins to offer you to trade with less than 100% of the amount?  It has to come from somewhere.   Also, they talk about allowing people to short the market.
Two questions:
1.  Why would you short a market that is climbing so rapidly?  If you are borrowing coins to go short, you will need to replace them but if your truly shorting, you are selling them when you get them, then waiting for a correction to purchase the same amount of coins for less.
2.  In normal markets, the shorting would be included in the daily transaction log and the short position would be reported and people would look at these numbers and research companies that had large short positions and figure out why and if they are correct.   In Bitcoin, how are they sending this signal to the market?  Just by selling coins and waiting for a dip?  That doesn't sound like a very sound strategy if you are calling it shorting.  In Bitcoin this act is just called selling borrowed coins hoping for a pull back. 
Like I said, in this market, it could pay off but the risk for utter ruin is very high.  Mark my words and watch.   People who don't understand how to operate in a FULL RESERVE market need to do more research.  Bitcoin was created partly to get away from these shenanigans but people keep waiting to bring them in, it is up to you how you want Bitcoin to operate.  I personally want people to take risk or don't, no games where you say your doing something when really you are not.

Your welcome.  Don't be intimidated to ask these questions.  I have been reading over ten years, technical financial books, economic history dating back 6,000 years and tons of biographies along with tons of other esoteric material and primary source documents just to scratch the surface where I feel I can debate some topics and positions effectively.   
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:44:46
Central banks will try and put Bitcoin under its supervision.  Only problem is they do not have the tools needed to actually do anything.  Mostly we will see regulation in the area of taxes (capital gains) and money laundering detection and enforcement. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:20:58
By definition that is different that letting someone trade on "margin"
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:32:29
I don't know "who" but a professional group is using techniques that are quite interesting.  The DDOS could just be the crowds stampeding.   What people should looks at is the trade data and how many small trades are taking place in succession only in one direction (lower).  There is where I would focus my energy.  Start checking IP addresses to see if you get any leads.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:25:46
You obviously were not watching the ticker and order book when this started happening.  Well I happen to watch it everyday and you see certain patterns and the last 48 hours I have seen very weird trade.  Tons and tons of very small trades.   We saw this before when some wallets started sending .0000001 trades back and forth many many many times.  I am not saying these are connected but it seems like this may of been a test to see what leeway they can get with the exchanges.   
@_date: 2013-04-01 05:36:22
Storage solutions are in development.  I am developing one currently.  But before they get vast support, you need the most important asset.  TRUST.  You can to trust in your counter-party to act in good faith and in your best interest.  This really takes time by dealing with many people in a fair and honest manner so they can vouch that you are a honest standup guy. Outside of that, treating Bitcoins like you would a bag of cash or gold is a good start.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:45:04
Only way your short at this point in Bitcoin is if you are sitting and waiting with cash.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:33:30
Yeah, it started around $233.00, before that there was some dumps and then they started.   They came in bursts too, just painted the ticker red.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:25:26
We shall see, doubful I would say.  Bitcoins are very useful for settling high-value transactions and their will only be 21 million nominal units.  Bitcoin is getting its legs, not likely to sit down right now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:27:03
I can't believe you didn't watch to see what would happen over the next 7 days.  You did commit way too much into a single asset but just taking a $60K loss like that was not smart.  
What is really happening is that she is not taking responsibility for her actions in allow this to happen and now she is cutting and running instead of facing up to the situation.  In the long-run, sadly, you may be better off.  You don't want people who will just bail when the chips are down.    I feed badly for you.  So sorry to read a story like this.

I think they may be testing the new page to show a BTC value.  I doubt they would triple the price of their units just because they can.   First that would create some bad PR but mostly their goal is to secure the network and raising the price would be counter-intuitive.

@_date: 2013-04-12 13:55:44
Yes there is profit in it but really at this point it would be wise to consider other motives than just profiteering.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:26:48
I have already been testing it.  Maybe "new" is not what you should be looking for and secure and audited is a better idea.

Then I apologize, but yes, in reality, you can.  
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:47:24
The shift that many people may be missing is that Bitcoin is less going to be a currency, and more a wealth reserve asset (ie: savings).  With what happened in Cyprus, that might be showing people why alternatives could be a good idea.
Paul is correct on the setting that is laid out for Bitcoin.  Hackable and dismissed are important traits to give it room to grow organically.  Even my dad is coming around to the concept.
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:50:59
Each Bitcoin can be broken down 8 decimal places, 1 Satoshi = 0.00000001.  This is the smallest unit of account in Bitcoin.
Do the math.

We could use almost anything.  The more you can purchase with Bitcoins, the better.

Nothing is truly safe and the farther away something is from you, the less control you have over it.  I would only advocate leaving the minimum BTC you need with any service while Bitcoin security practices get better.

This wasn't a comparison of his record.  The advice is good advice from anyone.   Trading a market like this is likely to ruin you.  Either you in it for the long-haul or not.  If not then yes, you will likely get burned.  We are seeing very odd tactics at work to peel people from their money.   My suggestion is to just tune out until the exchanges get their at together.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:18:20
How about this question, why do we need "high-volume" trading.  In the normal financial world it does add liquidity in the manner it is touted as.  It is really just skimming and now companies race to have the servers as close as possible so they can front-run trades.   This parasitic activity should not be something we should just accept as normal.  We can't effectively lobby against it in the NYSE or NASDAQ but we can lobby here.  .02(btc)

Unlikely you will go somewhere else, unless you want magnitudes less of volume and liquidity.   Mt. Gox likely is working on this issue as we speak, it is normal growing pains.  Be patient.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:22:10
Well how you would do it the same.   The would need to purchase Bitcoins that would then allow the margin trading positions.  What my comment is really about is their notion that Bitcoin needs short-selling on margin at this point in the game.  
@_date: 2013-03-25 03:58:01
They are going a great clip.  All except the problems orders for Batch  are shipped and Batch  will likely start shipping this week.  They are a small team but they are moving units out the door.  I have confirmed over 75 personally.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:14:16
That and I would add, HTF bots should be banned outright.  They add zero value to Bitcoin and only are used to skim small amounts through high-speed arbitrage.   If you limited trades to a more reasonable spacing, 1-3 seconds or example.   Also wash trade rules could be helpful as well unless you register and a broker-dealer.  Things along these lines would help.   
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:51:13
ASIC is the only equipment you should put new money into when it comes to mining.   Avalon is about to do pre-sales for Batch    BFL is still not shipping and we do not have solid guidance on to when it will actually ship.   Mining over time will become more and more capital intensive and it will being in the hands of people how are willing to put the money into it to keep getting a smaller pie.  
I would recommend either purchasing Bitcoins as a risky speculation or start a business for the Bitcoin community that we need.  That is where the real value comes from, we need more commerce.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:20:02
LOL, you may want to look into that.   It is surprising what is allowed these days.  Some of the stuff has laws against it, it just isn't enforced, or if it is, it is selectively.

@_date: 2013-04-01 16:50:10
ANSWER:  **BITCOIN IS BEING USED AS A WEALTH RESERVE ASSET** (ie **SAVINGS**) not as a currency except in high-value transactions.  When people start understanding this, then you will understand why price appreciation is happening so rapidly.  People want protection from the massive amounts of credit being issued daily around the world.

@_date: 2013-04-05 04:39:21
I have been saying that Bitcoin is more savings than currency at the moment.  Mark these words.   Fixed supply means that it has an inflationary limit.

Don't forget that gold was suppressed for a long time by fixing its prices.  Bitcoin doesn't have those problems so it is catching up quicker and will go much higher because there is only 21 million to be issued.

Shorting is a way to make money on an asset like a stock or bond going down.   What I am saying is that if the entire stock and bond market were on a cash basis only then you would see quite different trading patterns, akin to how it used to be before electronic trading.  These activities would happen but more rarely and you would need a compelling case for me to lend you my coins.  That case does not exist at this point.  Bitcoin likely is undervalued.   note:  This is not investment advice and one should consult a licensed financial adviser before making any investment decisions.
@_date: 2013-04-04 04:34:00
Crowdingfunding and lending is never safe.   It is all about how you handle risk and that starts with "due diligence".   Securities trading is still regulated in the U.S. (many btc users are in the U.S.) so that is an area people should contact an accountant and lawyer before investing in any unregulated OTC securities.    
There are two books I would recommend "How the stock market works" and "How the bond market works" to get some basic information.  From their, Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham and a book about growth investing would give you the two major strategies.  Then you want to look at fundamental investing compared to technical investing.   After reading those six books you should start to get an very basic idea of your options.  You will also read about other themes you can do further research on. 
Hope this helps.

@_date: 2013-04-12 06:44:16
Something like that.  It has happened on real exchanges.  I am not saying this was an offensive attack per-say but it was an attack for profit by profiteers at least by my estimates.  Normal traders, even speculators do not trade like that.  To execute at that speed, you have automated programs and that is still out of the reach of most traders.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:48:18
How so?  There are more than 21 million ounces of gold in the world, so I would say the more creditable store with the least supply is par excellent.  I do concede that gold has over 6,000 years of recorded history behind it.   What I am proposing is that Bitcoin is gaining in this area and it is being used for savings over being a currency.  Who want to sell Bitcoins for goods while the value keeps increasing daily?     Could be a bubble but I think there is something more after you take away the pure speculation.    Thought?
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:04:20
If you didn't know this.  Bitcoin is "cash" market with no ability built-in for naked positions or derivatives that are actually back 100% by Bitcoins.  This means anyone offering "leverage" is likely letting you trade on their own capital OR is going to scam you because they will not be able to fulfill you gains or cover their losses.   People keep thinking you can take anything from the factional reserve world and make it work in the world of FULL RESERVE bitcoins.  FYI - I won't work no matter who many ways you think it will.  If you are going to do this, it is likely you will be settled in dollars, etc.  In that case, are you really involved in Bitcoin or just trying to dress up something else and call it Bitcoin?   .02(BTC)
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:22:45
I understand exactly how it works, please don't get me wrong.  I guess what I am saying is that the trend is strongly in one direction at this point and anyone offering margin (loans) to trade against it is spitting in the wind and they are likely to get hurt when they have to cover their short.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:50:27
Well put.   I poll people all the time and even people in commercial finance go "huh, what is Bitcoin?"
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:44:01
Don't take this the wrong way but:  who that ***k would want to loan someone coins just to sell them?  If the person borrowing had the capital to do this, they could just buy coins and sell them to try and drop the price.  See what you are asking is will people accept a counter-party risk in Bitcoin when Bitcoin has no counter-party risk.  It makes no sense and people who try this utter rubbish are either going to default on people or ruin themselves.   This is a full reserve "cash" market so if you want to do something, you will need to take real risk for real reward.  No games.   Also, I will keep saying it, Bitcoin is savings over currency.  Just wait to see what happens when the market finally accepts that.   21 million and that is it :)

Use the Mt Gox price at the quoted price at this point.   You need to stick with the most volume because that equates to the most price discovery.  What this BTC24 price represents is an arbitrage potential.  Make sure to do your due diligence on all exchanges before you send any funds.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:58:01
That quite isn't all of it :)
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:03:55
At this rate, a month give or take a week.  Such strong demand.  105K volume on Gox.   Question is the just speculation or is the smart money taking a position?
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:16:08
Couple questions:
- Why do we need large institutions?
- Why do we care what speculators are hoping for?
- Why would people not just loan in other currencies and use Bitcoin as savings of wealth, compared to precious metals?
In closing, I don't think you understand what Bitcoin represents and what its highest utility value will be to society.  We don't need to compare it to the current system because it is inherently different, unsustainable and you have to have faith in men to keep the confidence.  We are seeing what that gives us.

I agree.  For consistency,  I would like "bit" at the end of each term. This would show a relationship to Bitcoins as branding.    Bitcoin, Microbit, Minibit, Nanobit etc, seem like obvious choice.   Maybe using "Bitcent" for .01-.99 could work for the first two decimal places.   Thoughts?

I really did just draw that comparison.   Both took human energy and work to produce.  Gold is an actual object but Bitcoins can move much more quickly.  They both have benefits.   Not just an ounce, but an ounce of gold just for a comparison of sorts.   Bitcoins are ultra scarce when calculated in nominal single units.

2.  Escrow is something that takes time as people's reputation gets around.  Personally I am to the point where I am requested to do it.
