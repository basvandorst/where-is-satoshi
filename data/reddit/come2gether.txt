one of the people working on bitcoin has made the same arguement you are making about the importance of getting big companies invested in it. also, i think if the government wanted to make it illegal they would have done it much earlier, before any of us had heard of it, and it had the chance to grow in popularity.

How many accounts were affected by the hacking
Edit I mean how many people placed trades and lost money because someonevtook over the account
@_date: 2011-06-26 21:19:14
considering how much the united states spends on defense, you may be underestimating its reach. regarding your first statement, my point was they are involved in libya, not egypt or tunisia.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:55:10
are they anonymous transactions? i am assuming their is no way to trace it based on the transactions that took place. you think he or she wouldnt want to come forward out of fear or embarrassment? 
@_date: 2011-06-19 09:42:36
your right, posting a chart about bitcoin has no relevance in a bitcoin subreddit. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:52:59
so that means they are going to break the trades? wow. that will piss off some people who bought at great prices. and they are going to resume trading at 17.50$?
@_date: 2011-06-05 23:17:47
the government will be losing power if bitcoin goes mainstream. this will be a very interesting confrontation. the inherent tension between the two will lead to a problem. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 21:43:57
i think if it goes back down to 2.50 then its not going to go back up to where it is now.
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:23:54
so take what happened this morning for example, if one exchange like trade hill had a circuit breaker and forced it to stop trading at $8, then another exchange like mt.gox without a breaker would have traded all the way down to 1 dollar. then how would the exchange rate work between the two exchanges since one exchange would be quoting price at $8 and the other exchange would quote the price at $1. i would assume that the next day either mt.gox would go back up, or tradehill would go limit down again. they would try to reach equilibrium with each other. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:41:28
can you explain what you mean by they moved 400k to another computer? 
@_date: 2011-06-27 13:06:28
are you implying that i think the us is responsible for everything? or that I think the US is responsible for these civil wars?
I'm simply cynical of those that are quick to think the U.S. is responsible for everything.
 There is no evidence whatsoever that the U.S. is responsible for any of these civil wars
**My position is that the U.S. had decided very early on to remove Gaddafi when the opportunity presented itself, or to create the opportunity,according to the article i cited**










**Reasons for supporting gadaffis removal:**


**As of May, the commander of the rebel forces is Khalifa Belqasim Haftar. He has close ties to the CIA, which financed his militia years ago. He lived a number of years in Langley, Virginia.**




@_date: 2011-07-05 19:22:25
how do you short it?
@_date: 2011-06-05 06:06:20
thats a very real question. how high could this thing get? can you imagine $200 per bitcoin? i honestly am questioning what is stopping that from happening?
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:33:45
thanks for the explanation. so in a nutshell, the hacker found an account with 500k bitcoins in it, and offered them all out at .01, and then bought them using fake accounts and withdrew them before they had a chance to rise in price? wow. from what i read somewhere else, he bought about 432k coins. the other 70k must have been filling people who had orders out somewhere between where it was trading and where the hacker was filled. i am suprised their werent more orders that got filled on the way down to .01.
@_date: 2011-06-12 03:48:12
that was a big drop.
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:12:23
this is exciting. i was a professional hedgefund trader during the 2008 crash, and this is similar. i think the exchange should institute a limit down halt whenever the market trades below a certain percentage each day. thats what all the real life exchanges have done since the flash crash.
@_date: 2011-06-12 04:18:51
i am wary. i am a fulltime trader and i trade primarily on technical analysis, and generally speaking it is very bearish when a stock pulls in below the breakout. this chart looks very weak to me.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:46:59
neither can i. in order to validate this theory, we would need to see proof from this person who just had 500k bitcoins stolen. where/who is this mysterious person? is it the same person who had his/her wallet hacked last week? this is all really strange.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:38:39
thanks for the clarification. I am trying to wrap my head around what happened. One further question then is if the hacker didn't access everyones individual account to move the price down then that means he did it from one account. And mt.gox cannot cancel the bitcoins because he already withdrew them using many smaller accounts. And then if that's true why did they need to hack the accounts to begin with. Didnt they just need access to one person who had a huge accoun. Also, who was this person with a huge account theyvused to push the price down.
@_date: 2011-06-03 14:10:47
you could have doubled your money. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:25:30
can we back up a second. the only evidence we have that one account lost 500k bitcoins is because we saw a large sell transaction occur, or am i missing something. based on that large transaction your concluding that it came from one account? can you imagine this person who hypothetically had his coins stolen. either he bought them recently in which case he hasnt had the chance to withdraw them, or he has had them for a very long time, and has been in the process of cashing out, so maybe he has way more bitcoins secured somewhere else, and was in the process of selling some of them. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:59:47
How do you think the hacker was able to find out which account had the most bitcoins in it. 
@_date: 2011-06-03 14:19:01
how much are you earning per week
@_date: 2011-06-20 22:08:24
so how many coins are missing from peoples accounts?
@_date: 2011-06-27 15:44:55
i have been having the same discussion with theoverture. i can feel your frustration. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:10:41
something doesnt add up. i doubt whoever owned 500k bitcoins left them in mt.gox out of stupidity. if their is no reason to keep that many coins then why would they do it? 
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:59:56
 i am assuming that the hacker used the compromised accounts to initiate sell orders of the peoples account in order to push the price down, and then the hacker was there to buy them all up with fake accounts once the price was below 10 cents. i am trying to wrap my head around what happened, and i was at first skeptical but it is seeming more and more like whoever stole the coins was successful. so since the price was pushed down invalidly because the users had the accounts hacked what happens to the money or coins in the users accounts? does that mean that alot of users who had money or bitcoins in the account now no longer show money within the account?
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:33:12
so can you talk me through how someone could have profited from this crash? 
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:35:28
that doesnt sound right. so your saying that someone could make a trade on mt.gox for 100k bitcoins and it wouldnt be reflected in the exchange rate until they withdrew the money? 
@_date: 2011-06-12 04:41:18
if you draw the uptrend starting from april this pullback broke that line. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:50:41
thats why other exchanges have limit days where the market is shut down if it drops more then 10 percent in one day
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:17:09
That is an important point. This should have been public information. Its the old saying that your only as strong as your weakest link. So in this case you have a great peer to peer encrypted currency but the exchange agencies are weak. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:12:23
its my understanding that all mt.gox users who had money and coins in the mt.gox accounts were used by the hackers to push the price down so that the hackers could buy up the coins at a low price. can someone confirm this? 
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:18:48
i think the multiple accounts theory is what makes the most sense to me. so according to your estimates the hacker withdrew 432k bitcoins at .01 cents from a bunch of accounts? and mt.gox cannot reverse these trades because they have already been withdraw? so my next questions is who was selling bitcoins to the hackers at .01 cents? thats why i think they must have had access to peoples accounts to tell them to sell the bitcoins at such a low price, because nobody would actually sell bitcoins at .01 cents right?
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:43:34
in that case i think mt.gox would still have the power to void the transactions. so, if someone picked up a many coins at .01 cents but didnt withdraw the coins from mt.gox, then mt.gox could say we are going to break those trades, since they are invalid (i assume that what they mean when they are talking about rollingback). however if someone bought a bunch of coins, and then immediately withdrew them from the mt.gox account then mt.gox would be powerless to break the trades, and whoever purchased them could get away with that price. can you confirm this? and even if mt.gox has a withdraw limit of $1000, thats still alot of bitcoins if you bought them at .01 cents. furthermore someone could have done it with multiple accounts. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 06:12:00
i just watched a youtube video of someone who was recording the flash crash, and he shows that 230k bitcoins were traded  then it went up to 5 cents, 7, cents, and then back to 10 dollars. So whoever bought 230k bitcoins at 1cent and quickly withdrew that money, spent 2,300 dollars to buy those coins, and they are now worth 2.3 million assuming the value of bitcoin is 10 dollars. so not a bad days work. but the price went up from 1 cent to 10 dollars in less than a few seconds. how could they have withdrawn that money so quickly?
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:48:57
thats cool. i am trying to figure out what exactly happened during the flash crash. at first i was skeptical that whoever caused the crash actually made out with alot of money. but the more research i do, the more it seems like his plan worked and he actually did buy a bunch of coins at a really cheap price. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 03:49:44
i would like to see some more transparency on the part of mt.gox as to what exactly happened. i am sure they are figuring it out now, but i would expect a more detailed report in the near future. also, if someone was able to hack into and find the password to someones account who had 500k bitcoins or whatever, why not simply transfer/withdraw all those funds to the hackers wallet. whats the advantage of using those coins to push down the market when they could just take the coins instead. secondly, i dont even think its possible for someone with 500k bitcoins to cause the entire market to go crash like that, even if you could place the offers wherever you wanted. thats why the market needs circuit breakers, to lock it down in case it trades below 10%. thats what most exchanges have in place nowdays. finally who was selling the coins to the hacker at .01 cents, thats why i think they must have had access to peoples accounts to get them to sell the coins at such a low price?? 
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:08:02
mt.gox website said they are going to rollback and resume trading at 17$ tomorrow. that means whoever stole the coins isnt going to get away with millions of dollars. 


Service should be back by June 20th 10:00am (JST, 01:00am GMT) with all the trades reversed and accounts available.
One account with a lot of coins was compromised and whoever stole it (using a HK based IP to login) first sold all the coins in there, to buy those again just after, and then tried to withdraw the coins. The $1000/day withdraw limit was active for this account and the hacker could only get out with $1000 worth of coins.
Apart from this no account was compromised, and nothing was lost. Due to the large impact this had on the Bitcoin market, we will rollback every trade which happened since the big sale, and ensure this account is secure before opening access again.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:04:05
can someone please send me a link to the interview
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:00:29
so is mt.gox going to break all the trades that happened? i gathered from the statement on the website that is what they are going to do.
@_date: 2011-06-15 21:32:23
looks to me like the market is in a holding pattern. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 01:37:15
I didn't mean to imply you thought it was a valid reason. Its terrible that nobody was talking about the bad encryption prior to this. I wonder how many users accounts had trades occur and loss of money because the hacker took over the account. 
@_date: 2011-06-18 21:38:31
his reply is a straw man argument. i think the charts are similar therefore i must think they are causal. 
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:52:57
thats not what shorting means.
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:14:38
its my understanding that mt.gox is going to be breaking all the trades that occurred after the initial huge sell order that caused the crash. can you confirm this?
@_date: 2011-06-20 06:52:33
mt.gox issued an announcement that only a few coins were stolen.[ this is a good timeline of the events that occurred.]( 
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:30:17
according to mt.gox they are going to rollback the price to 17.50 and not count any of the trades. so i assume that means they are going to break all the trades that occurred during the flash crash. so if someone picked up a bunch of coins for cheap at .01, those transactions will not be a valid. can you confirm this?
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:37:14
so for example, if i bought tons of coins at .01 cents mt.gox would invalidate those trades. thats what i assume they mean by rollback.  but i would like some confirmation on this. i am assuming it means that mt.gox is going to break any trades that occured after the huge sell order that caused the price to drop. 
@_date: 2011-07-01 00:51:25
can you explain what he means by 


and 


@_date: 2011-06-06 22:25:11
cool, thanks. thats a fair amount of money it would take to move the market. although hedgefunds getting involved could easily move it if they were placing large orders. so, i noticed on mt.gox that they have a trading api available, so that means algorithms are trading. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:32:38
how many trades are being cancelled, and exactly how many bitcoins are missing? because since not all the coins were sold to the hackers, (some were sold to innocent people who had bids out.) those innocent people that got filled and didnt immediately withdraw the funds are going to have the trades canceled. i assume the person who lost the bitcoins doesnt have any recourse with mt,gox. nor do we have any way of determining which account the bitcoins where orginally stolen from do we??. we really need the person who lost these coins to come forward and shed some light. how did the hackers determine which account had all these coins in it?
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:42:25
awesome coverage man. good job!
@_date: 2011-06-26 19:05:32

@_date: 2011-06-20 07:18:00
haha, i am unemployed so i usually stay up pretty late. for me the statement  "only a small amount of btc was stolen." is how do they define stolen? 
@_date: 2011-07-06 00:18:58
even considering the broad definition you cited, i would still argue that your strategy of "Sell some bitcoins then buy back later. If the price went down, you have more btc than before. If it went up, you have less." would not qualify as gaining from the decline in price of a security.
what your describing is essentially going long, selling part of your total bitcoins, and then buying back at a lower price. for example, buying at $5 selling part at $10, then if it declines to $8 you buy more. you would still be considered in a long position, even though you sold part of it and bought it back at a lower price. 
shorting means you borrow stock from a lender at $10 and then sell it back at $7 for a $3 profit. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:01:50
is mt gox going to break all the trades? 
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:15:10
so why was mt.gox using a broken encryption method?
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:01:25
Its my assumption that the money was withdrawn in bitcoin form vs dollars. Can someone confirm this. this has to be true,because if it was withdrawn in dollars, then we would be able to see where the money was transferred to. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 21:39:34
good price. hold on to it, you made a great investment. you might consider selling small amounts on rises, and buying them back on pullins such as this. its always good to take some profits.
@_date: 2011-06-01 21:02:52
only 2 minutes long?...lame. can anyone suggest where can i find some talks about bitcoin that are longer?
@_date: 2011-06-20 06:14:56
i just watched a youtube video of someone who was recording the flash crash, and he shows that 230k bitcoins were traded  then it went up to 5 cents, 7, cents, and then back to 10 dollars. So whoever bought 230k bitcoins at 1cent and quickly withdrew that money, spent 2,300 dollars to buy those coins, and they were in a matter of seconds worth 2.3 million assuming the value of bitcoin is 10 dollars. so not a bad days work. but the price went up from 1 cent to 10 dollars in less than a few seconds. how could they have withdrawn that money so quickly?
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:41:39
i had the same thing happen to me. good to know thats why it happened.
@_date: 2011-07-08 05:31:45
awesome. i know one of the difficulties in trading is that the market strategies change over time. so what was profitable in the past wont necessarily be profitable in the future. how does your algo account for that?
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:30:25
thats a terrible reason. 
@_date: 2011-06-06 09:27:21
how many bitcoins would someone have to buy to raise the value bitcoin/dollar exchange rate by $1. so for example how many bitcoins would someone buy to make it go from $20-$21? what is stopping it from going to $300? that seems like alot but once bubbles start they go way further than anyone could have imagined.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:43:35


can you explain what do you mean by that?
i was answering a post on another thread, and the way the question of people selling bitcoins at .002 was explained to me, was that the hacker found one account with 500k bitcoins, and then offered them all out at .001 and then just had a bunch of fake accounts ready to buy them at .001, and withdraw the funds before the price rose again. secondly, the hacker bought 432k bitcoins at .001 the rest of the coins where sold to people who had bids out somewhere between where it was trading before the crash, and where the hacker bought them. so roughly 70k was filled that way... my last question is who was the person who had 500k bitcoins compromised? thats the proof we need to see to validate the theory that it was only one account that got hacked. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:25:29
wow thats terrible. so who was selling bitcoins to the hacker at .01 cents? i think the hacker must directed users accounts to offer bit coins at unusually low prices, or how else could the hackers have bought 432k coins at 0.01 cents? no rational person would have been selling their coins for .01 cents. where can i watch the archived version of this live interview. 
@_date: 2011-06-12 16:18:49
i think your underestimating. the NSA budget is classified but i would guess its in the billions. you think with the technology and algorithms that can monitor every single email sent, that they dont have the ability to look at things like currencies? they probably have a whole department related to currencies. 
@_date: 2011-06-27 09:42:40
 I dont think its necessarily true that for the cia to be involved, then the united states must have come out instantly for the rebels. in other words, just because the united states didnt instantly support the rebels doesnt mean the cia wasnt involved. did you read the article i posted in my previous post? it gives evidence for cia involvement, this is pretty much known by everyone who studies these things. its not a secret. your refusing to believe that the cia is involved in Libya despite the facts, because it runs counter to your beliefs is a classic case of[ confirmation bias.](

how does he "not know" such a crucial peace of information. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:18:20
if i was withdrawing bitcoins from my mt.gox account, and it was setup with multiple account transactions, then my transaction would take place under the same "transaction" as other peoples withdrawals? whereas in a single transaction one account withdrawal would be done separately. can you give an example of when that would be an issue?
