Sorry, but "it will take months to get your money, or even to hear back from customer service" is not in their T&amp;C.   It's about keeping their part of the bargain up.  People need to know this before they sign up.  A reasonable person would expect  a reasonable business to answer support queries within a day or two.  My bank has small margins, and they picked up after 5 minutes of hold.
If they've traded $20B of bitcoin, as they claim, then a very modest fee is still a lot of money.
The fact that they're not returning money for months suggests to me that *they might not have the money*.

Here's a simple mathematical argument:  bitcoin is an unknown quantity, so it could go up by 10 just as easily as fall to 1/10th (look at past history).
If it falls to 1/10, you lose only what you put in.    So the asymmetry of up/down-side is why I'm placing a modest bet.

I'd do that but I'm locked out.

This is atrocious customer service.  Maybe the only thing that works (like with other companies) is people sharing their stories on social media.
I wish someone had told me "don't use coinbase; use a reliable seller on localbitcoin".  I've had good success with cash by mail using a high feedback seller.

Don't want to be dishonest with my bank.   I'm phoning now, giving them the whole story.

If one just wants to buy, I've found localbitcoin to be good, and some vendors working with cash by mail or deposit-into-account sell at the market price.
If one wants to trade, that's different, but maybe then one can afford to wait.
Also, for well heeled investors,  there's a Swedish bitcoin fund COINXBT accessible through more technical conventional brokers (stay away from fund GBTC - way overpriced).  If you can get to it, COINXBT might be a way of hedging a horde of conventional bitcoins.   For example, if you want to sell your bitcoin fast, you could short COINXBT to lock in profits, and then unwind your short as you get rid of coin.

Mine was pretty good - helped me fill out a dispute form.
I think that pressure from a bank will make them snap to attention much better than an ignorable message from a web form.

It was boilerplate - identifying details removed


Unfortunately it looks like your bank (xxx bank, xxxx) has reversed your payment with the following message: Authorization Revoked by Customer (R07). You can visit your account to review your payment methods and see further details.


If you have any questions in this matter, resources are available in our support portal.  [comment: *Ha. Ha. Ha.*]

They say "we're a bit busy; it make take a few days".    This makes me VERY angry.

Thanks. Looks like I don't qualify for the "3 common cases"
Maybe I'll put in a complaint, so the bank knows something is afoot.

Pretty sure you're wrong here: 
First, it is a *Contract* - terms we both agree to, not terms only I must follow. Quoting them:


Next, they do make certain promises:
Section 5.2:


[note: a 'reasonable person' interpretation of this would say that delaying for 'months' is a violation of the contract]
Section 6.7:


Section 7.2:


Besides the *clear promise* of a 24 hr response, there has to be a "reasonable person" criterion to what constitutes the time scale to withdraw money.  For example, by delaying for 3 months (like the June guy), they would exceed your 90 day access period to your money in a closed account, so they could take it, by the T&amp;C.

can ACH be reversed?  edit: once it shows up deducted, and they say they have it
