So would you have any recommendations about how I can quickly and cheaply as possible get cash into my BTCe account?

Most of the American one's have either something like a 95/100 exchange rate, or provide you a discount in the local stores when used.

Tip me too! 
@_date: 2013-09-16 06:35:04
I mean companies that pay you to bring traffic, display ads, referral commissions, etc.

Most people don't realize it, but even in the US, it is legal in some areas to have a "local" currency. So a town or community can have its own currency that is only accepted in their town for example.

This! What needs to happen (this is my guess for the first Jobs outside SR) is for Affiliate company's to start offering pay in BTC. There is a market there that should take foothold first in the blackhat world, and then slowly move into more legitiamte territory. Why this doesn't exist yet is beyond me.
