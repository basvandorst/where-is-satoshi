You were right! Holy hell, you weren't kidding. Reddit announcement talked about SMS 2f failing them. I just logged into paxful and switched to google authenticator. Thanks for your advice.

Very true. Thank you for your advice.

I see. Thanks. So I guess it won't be a real excuse for them not to use my service. If they don't it means they just don't want what I'm offering.

Amazing answer! Thanks for the insights.
Edit: Some costumes might be one-timers. Some could become loyal.  None of them would care about privacy because of this service. Nothing to hide.

Please, don't be hasty in judging me. I'm not looking for excuses to avoid bitcoin. It's quite the opposite. I'm looking for excuses to hold firm to my decision to use it. But there is something you said that really hit home with me. You said that it's our own duty to encourage the BitCoin culture which is true.
Now I remembered something. I expect that most of my client would be from the US. Is there any statistics that indicate that it's unlikely that my client would be not a bitcoin user?
Thanks for your answer.

I'll be providing a service, not goods.

Thank you. So the identification process is the biggest obstacle. Very interesting.

Freaking thieves. I'm glad all their attempts to get anything of value failed. But this proves that the habit of using the same passwords across multiple sites is dangerous.

Thank you. I may get me one of those. I don't have one.

Dammit. What a nightmare. I use strong passwords now for the accounts that I care about but it was still stupid of me to use that lame password for any account. I just didn't want the hassle of any chance of forgetting it and having to reset it again.
Thanks for the advice. A password manager is a good idea.

Whoa! Hold your horses, buddy. I didn't accuse anybody of anything. I thought there might be a breach and I thought I should warn people. I respect his opinion but I'm pretty satisfied with my choice of going with SMS. And thanks for your concern.
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:44:14
Yes, I did. Thanks for the advice. I did turn it on right away after the incident. I used SMS for all three operations.

I did, but only to warn them about this. They didn't steal anything. The wallet was empty. I just deleted my paxful account. I'm not using it anymore. Thanks for your comment.
