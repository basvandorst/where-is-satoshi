The bitcoin checkout button seems to be hidden at the bottom of the page and it won't let you complete the checkout.

Just tried it, so I'll let you know.

Dont do it. If you look at the cost and potential return its not a good investment.  instead find a data center and ship your equipment to it.

I ordered some bitcoins through them a while back that said end of day, but the coins actually showed up around noon est.

Maybe its just me, but with Mt. Gox and the other stories about bitcoin being stolen from online wallets, it makes me nervous to put my coins in them.  I'm talking about a way integral to bitcoin that would require no third parties.

Interesting read, but this seems to be applying more to DNS and not to bitcoin addresses, although perhaps it could be modified to work in that manner?

Namecoin is DNS for web addresses.  I'm talking about a DNS type address linked to a bitcoin address.

Or could it be that my nearly 50% tax rate from all the hard work that I do is supporting all that police force, etc, etc.
