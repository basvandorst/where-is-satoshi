I've read this in a few places today, all crypto related sites. Though absolutely no local announcement or even info about it in the bank's website. Plus did u see the fees? 3% + vat (21%)....
Fake news.

Unless you are a "US Person" or Eritrean there's no need to do that. Only Tax residence matters.You could still get a new citizenship tho.
BTW, I know where you are from, and unfortunately, Argentineans can't revoke their citizenships.

US citizens are doomed, that is correct. As for Argentineans, Tax residence is based on a 365 day of tax year absence, it doesn't follow the 183+ day all the normal countries do. You can thank Cris K. for that. Also it requires a tax residency change in the AFIP (done in person....) which will render you "un-bankarizable" in Argentina as they will revoke your TIN. So, unless you bank in Serbia, Philippines or Oman which are not CRS compliant, tax liabilities can haunt you at any time. 
You can contact AFIP online, and they will happily confirm this.

I highly doubt you will rule the caribbean, maybe youare related to somalis? Who knows on reddit ha ha.
Argentina is far from a shithole, I've been to shitholes, you don't want to be in those, and believe me, they don't look like anywhere in Argentina. Argentina has challenges that need to be overcome by itself and I hardly see that happening (Draw a parallel with ZA here)
But the Caribbean... well while I love it and I agree living there can potentially be great it's also quite underdeveloped.
You can rule hell, I would simply choose to go where treated best. Whether this place is Argentina, Singapore, Labuan or maybe, even, the Caribbean. Bonaire sounds lovely this time of the year, tho, when doesn't it? ;)
