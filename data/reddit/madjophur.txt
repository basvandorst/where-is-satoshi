Maybe that's because you averaged over many runs rather than just over time. With only one history, bad luck at some point in time will never be compensated by good luck later at ever larger difficulties... could that be the point?

I run electrum 1.9.8 on osx 10.9.3 too. Today it got stuck on "synchronizing". I tried to restore from seed in case the wallet was corrupt, but now it's stuck while restoring...  No need to panic though, as long as you have your seeds.
Edit: it works now... maybe there was just a problem with the servers.

Cool! So I assume this is the variance of the total amount of bitcoin mined?  I wonder if this difference between pool size is actually significant in terms of the margins involved...
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:16:27
I wasn't totally serious. I'm not sure how you got from the video that bitcoin should help fight crime in general, so I was trying to invent a possible link.

These trades don't happen on the blockchain. They only happen virtually within the exchange.

The text does says that its a commodity subject to VAT, but if I understand correctly, it also describes at least two solutions to this for exchanges. If the exchange can be thought of as an intermediary, then VAT is charged only on the fees. The actual exchange then occurring between individuals, no VAT is involved. Also, it says that no VAT is charged if the exchange is outside of Singapore.

I'm not a miner; I was just trying to understand how the increasing difficulty influences the choice of pool size, because of the post by . So theoretically it does matter, but given the actual numbers, sure, that doesn't seem to be so important unless you're so tight that you'd be killed by price fluctuations anyway.

An issue though is that it reuses a single key, which has implications for privacy.

Armory on mac always uses bitcoin-qt's blockchain. Nevertheless it takes it a long time (about 30 min) to analyse that blockchain and build its own special database from it.

I read your post but I don't see where the problem is in the long term. Why does it matter that only a few blocks are found before a change in difficulty? It's not like the work your farm did at a given difficulty is "reset" when it changes. The work does not accumulate; it's just a constant lottery.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:12:47
Yes, indeed.
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:12:58
Maybe, the implications is that the blockchain would free us from the need to give the state the power to enforce the kind of regulations which, once corrupted, make anti-competitive cartels possible…

I'm not sure I understand: within 3 sigma of what?  In any case, this result seems kind of buried in there now. Could it be worth it to make a new post about this calculation?

Does the website buffer contributions, and then distribute them to the recipients once the total reaches a sufficient amount? 
If not, it means that, unless people give very large single contributions,  most servers never receive anything because of the likely "dust" cutoff.

Maybe they will fall together with the bank cartels. It is obvious that criminal cartels would mostly die if not for their huge drug revenues, which is made possible only by the war on drugs. Who is paying politicians to keep this nonsense going? If not the cartels themselves, maybe it is HSBC and the like who benefit from laundering the drug money.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:53:30
That's interesting, but I don't think your conclusion is correct. What really matters is the variance over a lifetime. If we assume an infinite lifetime for simplicity, then at constant difficulty the overall variance is zero no matter how big the pool is. But maybe it is nonzero for an increasing difficulty, and then depends on the pool size..
@_date: 2014-06-14 12:04:22
Increased variance is certainly relevant in a game that you can only play once ever. 
Say I given you this one-time offer: I let you flip a coin, and propose to give you 1 btc for head and 3 btc for tail. You clearly have no reason *not* to play.
But suppose that, instead, the deal is you give *me* 8 btc for head and I give you 10 btc for tail. The expected return for you is the same as before, but you may not want to play that game anymore. If you so happen to get head, the fact that you could have gotten 10 btc is of little comfort to you now. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:23:04


Err.. so you'd rather starve waiting for your bitcoins to gain value?
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:03:21
Well, sure, but OP doesn't have many lives to average over. At constant difficulty, low variance is not a problem because it averages out over time. But this doesn't hold with a changing difficulty, as this become a one time thing and the frequentist interpretation doesn't apply since there is no possibility to average out.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:40:29
Maybe it is worth remarking that as the total time of operation increases, the variance does *not* go to zero, but to a constant that depends on the pool size.
If the difficulty was constant (as well as the block reward), a mining operation would yield a constant expected rate of btc. Moreover, the size of the pool used would not matter too much in the sense that the variance in total return grows more slowly with time than the expected total return.
However, the present situation is completely different given that the rate of return decreases exponentially (because of the increasing difficulty). In that situation, the total amount of bitcoin mined tends to a finite amount over time, and the variance over this total tends to a constant which depends on the pool size. Hence picking a smaller pool is a one-time gamble, which might present a risk for a large investment with a tight margin.

Oh, that kind of cartel. I'm not sure what he meant either. It does seem to be a general problem with capitalism that it allows for a high concentration of wealth which is then used to corrupt the system and break competition.

His first proposal was 20 times the current block size limit, not 8000. And remember it's the block size limit, not the actual block size.

I completely agree with that. I'm even okay with B2X winning over BCH. I just wish it was easier to predict exactly where to invest. The ideal would have been for core to not stale and make alts and my headaches flourish.

Even if everybody uses segwit, the blocks take 4mb, but contain only as many transaction as a ~1.7mb non-segwit block.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:13:17
Engineers should work on convincing the stake holders with good arguments. I've never seen an actual calculation from the small block proponents of what the optimal block size limit is supposed to be given a certain price per mb or other relevant parameters. 
The only work I've seen was the one related to the mining centralization, which concluded that 4mb is safe. But this is not even a problem anymore thanks to technical progress.

The spam is not supposed to be limited by the block size, but by the transaction fees. The blocks should be large enough that the fees prevent the spammers from filling them.

In proportion, sure. The important point is that the reason Bitcoin is usable at the moment is that fewer people are using it, not that it "ain't broken".

I meant it as an euphemism: it is not unreasonable to think that Moore's law will break in the relatively near future. No matter what you seem to know about networking infrastructure, I don't think making predictions 20 years in the future is that easy.

Moore's law is not a fundamental law of nature. It may well break at some point. In fact, transistors are already reaching the quantum domain.

These are huge differences. You must recognise that the ability to fork is the essential mechanism which makes bitcoin a decentralised governance system. By censoring discussions of such a fork you are hindering this process, giving undue power to a particular set of developers.

In 2011 I dismissed it because of its deflationary nature; I was still believing the idea that printing money is needed to push consumption and fight unemployment. My aha moment was when I fully realised that this philosophy is unsustainable and harmful as it pushes to waste resource to produce crap nobody needs or want. The problem is misdistribution of wealth, not unemployment. 
Given that we leave in a finite world, and that human population is about to saturate as wealth due to technology finally reaches developing nations, a constant money supply is perfectly logical. Any decrease in prices, if any, then simply results from the fact that technological progress allows to produce things with fewer resources.
