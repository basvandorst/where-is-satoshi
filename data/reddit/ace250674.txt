I heard it's 1% of world's population but that was from a year ago.

While 666 is called the "number of the beast" in most manuscripts of Revelation 13:18, a fragment of the earliest papyrus 115 gives the number as 616.

Don't release this about old denials when we're all waiting with slim hope of the September decisions. Bad article, bad posting.
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:08:32
Well let's say with most bitcoin realistic trend forecasts are putting it in a few years  X10 - x30 the current dollar value.
 In 10 years who knows, that's too far off to speculate imo.
@_date: 2018-09-21 18:19:06
Ok. Eli5: Bakkt is with big money company in America. Buy lots bitcoin for rich people.
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:56:12
��️ here's your medal
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:03:24
Buy now before it's too expensive, or not. I'm not your boss, do what you want. 
Wall Street are not trading with Bakkt just buying a lot for investors and making it easier (and more secure) for them. I don't see what problem this would cause (from my current knowledge on it). 
Bakkt is likely to be far more beneficial than etf.
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:26:40
Nobody cares. Bakkt is better

Iota the tangle possible use was downloading software updates I heard. Could be different reasons as well.
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:43:29
It bever does
@_date: 2018-08-17 15:40:16
This sort of thing is why we are stuck in this range for so long
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:13:43
It will arise again, taking much longer than 3 days though
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:33:27
The machines are getting better looking and eye catching at least.
@_date: 2019-03-14 09:43:42
Tightening range and early/mid April when we get to the end of the triangle we will likely see some volatility. Hopefully in the up direction for a change though. 
I'm worried it may repeat what happened when it sat at the 6k level for quite a while then sank 50% in less than 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 14:01:55
BBC news report today on TV didn't mention crypto once. Disappointing but not surprising.
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:09:32
Just give up everyone with this crap. Especially as no one is going to use a symbol just like the dollar sign. FFS 
@_date: 2019-03-21 20:37:59
Tone Vays (shown in the chart photo box) just said recently it's going to 6k soon which is not whats predicted on this chart. So which is it?
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:43:09
You're weak
@_date: 2019-03-05 21:26:43
It's stupid. We don't need it. It's a fraction of bitcoin with a symbol already. 
No one will use a "S" when it's so similar to the dollar sign anyway.
@_date: 2019-11-02 17:32:03
Venezuela has half the gold and much of the oil in the world. It's not poor. It's one of the richest countries on earth, just poorly governed.
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:34:11
Approx 1% of world population use crypto equals we're in the late majority nearly laggards? Really?
@_date: 2018-10-27 11:45:20
It won't make you rich but it'll save you some fees in trading. 
So in a way it's one of the few actually used cryptos out there with real world usage.

I searched for bitcoin price yesterday and it comes up with Google's own chart and price
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:07:18
It was going down a few weeks ago. Now it's going nowhere. See? Better.
@_date: 2018-10-13 07:28:56
Bakkt in November?
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:16:02
There's more countries than that. The United Nations member states are the 193 sovereign states that are members of the United Nations (UN)

I heard Scotland recently had produced 100% electricity from wind power so anyone mining bitcoin there or other similar countries are not damaging the environment.
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:30:14
I believe the bull run will start after G20 regulations are in place July 2018 (their self imposed deadline) opening the door to big investors and institutions. Thoughts anyone? More info known on this?
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:52:50
Just Google coinbase pro and transfer from coinbase wallet option to Pro website version (after 5 days) then you pay pennies not pounds in fees. Easy
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:48:19
I've looked around and tried a few. Even though coinbase Pro put fees up probably still the best and cheapest that I know of. Faster payments is back again.
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:18:35
I use my lloyds debit card to purchase all the time on coinbase. It's no problem. 
The annoying part is afterwards waiting 5 frickin days for it to be transferred to Pro version to avoid fees.
@_date: 2019-06-02 19:07:41
Needs more of a triangular shape for next phase
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:45:38
In enough time it will. Or you can buy a lottery ticket?
@_date: 2019-06-18 12:56:45
This a joke? Or you haven't done 1 minute research?

Yes, yes it does and it's great

Say something better not the normal teenage bullish wet dream crap you normally come out with or don't bother at all. Seriously it's getting boring.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:47:29
Is it though? 
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:29:57
They would go for a much easier more vulnerable coin before thinking of trying anything on the hardest most secure.
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:49:46
Or the UK could let the top people in Venezuela government steal it for themselves as they've destroyed the economy for years though bad corrupt ideas.
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:02:28
It dropped about the average of the few biggest historical drops roughly 85% ish. Whether it's going down again more than this I've no idea.
@_date: 2019-01-24 13:33:01
They had a patent for this filed a while back so it would be weird if they didn't use it. This was kinda expected especially after other phones have come out already with this facility.

Lol. You've not seen the new hydrogen car by Honda or others? Perfectly safe and electric car with hydrogen for fuel.   H20 pure water from exhaust. Most abundant fuel in universe.
I see why manufacturers haven't brought out more cars sooner with stupid comments like it's a hydrogen bomb! Obviously more marketing needed.
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:35:07
Did you sell some at a good high after that first lesson? Or just keep buying? You should have seen what could have happened unlike newbies coming in late 2017
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:35:02
I'm buying again in that range. Or it can just keep going up I'm happy either way
@_date: 2019-09-01 16:50:01
Maybe for now. I think it's a red box coming and we see the other side to the triangle, we fall to the support line. Keep us updated.
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:06:43
So if I understand you the price will remain around 8k for rest of year like futures show? 
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:22:55
Nice bits
@_date: 2018-07-26 06:06:58
No idea but from what they said earlier in the year I thought we would have it by now. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:12:23
Ok I like the points you raised, it's far from my favourite though but the Chinese seem to rate it highest in reviews of crypto so there is possibly high potential for the future. Or its a complete scam. Who knows.

Only diversify with crypto in a bull market never in bear market. Losing sats and fiat value is a double loss
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:19:07
Apparently 99% of bitcoin is in 1% of wallets. That may not help you feel better.
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:55:40
From another more recent report: Almost 90% of wallets that hold Bitcoin contain less than $340
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:04:16
Or just Bakkt instead? Settled in bitcoin and not fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:09:50
It's just giving it one term to explain what it is. Probably currency or commodity would be better. But I get it's possibly confusing thanks to bch.

Google litecoin and you get it defined as "software". Definitely some improvements needed on crypto definition on Google
