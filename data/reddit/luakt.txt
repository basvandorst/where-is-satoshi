It's real, I was suspicious so emailed them myself and got the same response.
Of course, I could be lying also... but that's up to you.

It's good but the process could be improved. You have to credit your account with dollars via Bitpay and wait for 6 confirmations before you are able to order the domain, which I didn't find out until I got to the payment selection for the domain. It's a minor issue but it's a little annoying.
They also rely on the user pressing the "Back to site" button on Bitpay to complete the transaction instead of using the IPN.

Thanks for pointing that out.

You can get the block in json format by changing /block/ to /rawblock/.
This should set you off in the right direction.

For the uninformed, this is not a legit site. Same guy who created mtgax.com and easzpay.com.
Don't use them.
