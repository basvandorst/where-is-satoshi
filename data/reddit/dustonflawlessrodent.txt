Ever been to vegas? It's just human nature. Not for everyone sure. But I think that as a general rule most people tend to fixate on what they're about to win if things seem to be in their favor. Even if it's just like $5 or so. I mean go from vegas to video game scores or rankings. Or even just reddit upvotes. Really, I think that in general if someone seems immune to it than it's just because their win/loss fixation is set somewhere else.

The fuss is because you used to be able to. I absolutely agree that it's a ridiculous thing to freak out about. But you'd have to be intentionally ignoring the complexity surrounding the issue to not understand 'why' so many people are freaking out. 
You can disagree with someone's conclusion while still understanding how they reached it.

That's what strikes me as crazy about this subreddit sometimes. I feel like the amount of people actually using crytocurrency as currency is weirdly small. There seems to always be this assumption that everyone is buying bitcoin to just sit on rather than use.

I'd say it's somewhat analogous to the longstanding linux or gnu/linux naming debate.

That's insane. Has anyone else had that happen to them? I knew bank of america was pretty terrible. But that's going from bad behavior to pure evil.

Call me cynical, or an elitist, or whatever. But perhaps the real lesson here is that "ordinary people" shouldn't be jumping into things that they're not properly prepared for.

Exactly. You look at the strength of any currency and there's obviously going to be rises and falls. But with bitcoin, all it takes is a glance at the value and you can tell when forbes or something wrote some stupid fluff piece about it.

As others have said, saying none is taking it a bit too far. And I can't really complain about the people 'here' who are hoping to make money off it. Keep in mind that they're the band-aid that keeps bitcoin from flat out hemorrhaging at times. Still, the "investors" really have been the worst thing to happen to cryptocurrency. 
The answer to pretty much any question about why bitcoin is rough to use for actually buying things comes down to people investing in it. It's the reason why networks run slow, why the values are so erratic, etc. 
It's a nice piece of tech-happy-hippydom that people keep moving in to gentrify and make "nice". And in the process screwing up everything good about it.
