No Bitcoin ATM operator should rely on Blockchain.info for any part of their business. They have proven to be completely unreliable.
Curious as to why you would want to rely on a third party when you could just run your own bitcoind server.

You are asked for the admin password.
One nice thing about the Project Skyhook machine is that the software is open source. That means anyone can step up and improve it for personal or public benefit. Don't sit idle waiting for Jon to do all the heavy lifting. Be the change you want to see in the world.

My Lamassu bitcoin machine is located at the Westfield Galleria at Roseville just outside of Sacramento CA. I will be launching a 2nd Lamassu at the Westfield Valley Fair in San Jose CA within the next 2 weeks.
IMO Lamassu machines are the best that is available. While they do require some technical know-how to get running I have found them to be very stable and reliable. I have had zero downtime in the 3 weeks since launch.
Lamassu support has been wonderful. I can't say enough good things about the company. It is a pleasure to work with them.
Only having been running for 3 weeks (and it was a soft launch, meaning I didn't do any real advertising until I had a week of stable run-time) we have done well over 10k USD of volume already. There is a steady (and growing) stream of customers using the machine on a daily basis. I currently have the commission set at 2% but that is likely to vary in the future. I am considering going -1-2% for Bitcoin Black Friday. 
AML/KYC solutions are being developed for the Lamassu. I strongly believe that by the first of the year there will be some major advancements which will make owning/operating a Lamassu a much easier from a technical and legal perspective.
I like that my machine runs a full node and doesn't depend on any other service (other then electricity and an internet connection). The way I am set up even if the mall loses power for an hour or two you will still be able to use the machine uninterrupted. Lamassu can never turn off my machine or change the way it operates. It is one of the few (shout out to Project Skyhook because the same is true for them) machines which you can actually OWN 100%, because the software running on it is open source. I wouldn't buy a machine that is any other way. I predict that those companies selling closed source machines will in time either have to change their business model, or go out of business.
If you are considering buying a Lamassu, or already own one (or more!) please PM me or contact me via support for more information. I am happy to help in any way I can.

Well done Gavin.

My machine in Roseville has been at 2% since Halloween when it launched. Today I raised it to 5% because its been cleaned out so fast the past couple days. My fees are variable.
@_date: 2014-10-19 02:53:23
Nice work!
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:06:02
If you long press the screen you get the kiosk mode menu. You have to know the password to go beyond there. If you touch the screen anywhere else the menu disappears.

I wonder if he meant to say (or really did say) that once ASIC chips become *common and inexpensive then they will begin to be used in new and diverse ways. Like in electric blankets, etc. That would make more sense to me.

It is an opportunity.

You can use the command "lamassu-transactions-csv &lt;email address&gt;" to have the transaction log PGP encrypted and emailed to you.
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:12:46
I am pretty sure these are the keys. If you don't have your code then consider purchasing a new cam lock from Abloy. The old hardware should fit and you can get as many keys with it as you would like.
It is good that we share our experiences so that we may both learn from each other.

The pic is from a couple hours after the tweet was made and not taken by the person quoted. I apologize if that is confusing.
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:17:23
Not yet...  :)
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:39:18
Thank you for sharing your experience! You were the 2nd person to use the machine.
It would be nice to have a nearby shop which accepted bitcoin. I wish they all accepted BTC. :)
I like your idea about showing that the minimum purchase is only $1. Definitely room for improvement so if you have any more thoughts I am eager to hear them.
$10 @_date: 2014-11-07 23:57:54
Where are you getting this information? As a Lamassu owner/operator I disagree.
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:55:26
Will do!
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:49:23
I do not think they will require any verification by default.
Very shortly I will be asking for more information, whether you are buying or selling bitcoin. FinCEN has classified bitcoin vending machines as MSBs so my hands are tied. I will do my best to keep things as non-obtrusive as possible.
@_date: 2014-12-31 07:43:29
The gap limit is how many unused addresses will be checked by the wallet before it stops looking. I believe that is in fact what you are looking for.
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:54:20
No daily limit for the machine itself. If I can't keep up with the demand I will raise the fee until I can.
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:43:31
As an owner of a Skyhook I have to disagree with your statement that support has been bad. Jon has always responded to my issues with working solutions, and done so in a very timely manner.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:45:42

It is a riddle from the Hobbit.

I see you launched on October 18th. You have 180 days from that point to register with fincen. No need to panic just yet.
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:22:21
Nice work guys!
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:58:44
Well done BitConsultants.
@_date: 2014-11-02 04:40:40
Just need to know your bitcoin address. The transaction limit is $1000.
I am actively working on AML compliance. Larger transaction amounts will soon be possible with what I hope is a non-intrusive user experience.
@_date: 2014-12-13 11:11:11
It is on the 2nd floor, near the food court. Right next to Pandora Jewelers and the elevator. I will see about getting listed on the mall directory. There is a mall map available on coinucopia.io.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:58:34
And in Sacramento!
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:53:32
No stores at Valley Fair accept it directly, but many do via Gyft (3% back!). Haven't counted how many at VF, but I do know 26 stores at the Galleria at Roseville work with Gyft.
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:13:04
Thank you for the shoutout and for helping us bring Bitcoin to Sacramento!
Now we just need some more businesses accepting it!
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:57:44
This machine only operates fiat -&gt; BTC. I do plan on upgrading it as soon as the Lamassu 2-way stand is available.
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:59:33
Attract mode is a great idea!
The hoops are coming (see my reply above). I will make the hoops as big and soft as possible.
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:34:08
Because banks.
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:37:10
Very impressive. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:13:18
I love these guys. They are the change they want to see in the world.
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:56:52
I see something similar to this as the solution and am working every day to make it a reality.
There is no reason you can't do trade amounts &gt;10k. Modern bill acceptors accept/dispense stacks of 200 bills at a time. The machines can hold well over $1M in trash cash at a time.
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:42:09


Hacking a single bitcoin machine isn't going to bring them all down. Besides, this isn't a risk to the customer since the machine isn't holding customer funds.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:31:01
This is correct. TX is the only state to have clarified their position on bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:00:40
This can be corrected by adding paytxfee=0.0001 to the bitcoin config file.
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:45:20
This shit sells itself.
@_date: 2015-01-29 03:31:28
How do I get the paper money people feed into the machine onto my coinbase account?
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:28:10
I can't wait until my machines are worthless. Seriously. :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 02:13:32
I might buy it from you. Contact me at support
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:12:23
Thanks for the heads up. I have contacted airbitz about updating the link.
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:18:27
Generate a new and unique address for each transaction and only give it to the buyer. If they can tell you what it is then you know they are the one who paid.
Or, if you don't want to use the bitcoin address for this purpose you could create and send them a code after/during payment which can then be exchanged for your item.
@_date: 2015-01-29 03:49:12
Banks shut down your account when you continually deposit a high volume of cash and send it to a bitcoin exchange. Banks don't want to have MSBs as customers regardless of the cash volume or the fact they are bitcoin businesses.
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:22:00
It is back up and running as of 6pm today. There was an issue with the machine's ISP requiring me to manually reset the modem.
Sorry about the down time.
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:12:54
Congrats! I have purchased two T&amp;N mattresses myself, and a friend has also purchased one. Excellent customer service and very comfortable.
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:35:13
It isn't a central issue.
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:45:58
I think you are right. 
Now make me one. :)
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:24:37
I started my machines out at 2% but had to raise the rate. The reason is that my supply of bitcoin is limited. When demand is greater then supply it is correct to raise prices until equilibrium is met. If you don't do this you will run out of BTC.
At 2% I have to do over $50k in volume per month to break even on monthly expenses. How many months do you think I can deposit $50k cash in a bank account and wire it out to Slovenia before that account is shut down? How about $100k ($1000 profit for the month)?
I will keep my machines at 2% or less for as long as you can supply me with an unlimited amount of BTC, in return for cash, at market rate.

You found us We at [Coinucopia]( have been working hard with the Sacramento Kings for some time now to increase bitcoin accessibility. 
For those who don't know, the Sacramento Kings are the [first major professional sports team to accept bitcoin]( in the United States.  
We're very excited about partnering with them and look forward to sharing more in the near future!
Until then, [here's a better picture of the bitcoin machine]( and GO KINGS!

Thanks for visiting our machine, we appreciate your business! As for our fees, they do vary and are usually between 5-12% higher than online exchange pricing. We are committed to bringing these fees down below 5% permanently but have run into issues due to bitcoin supply constraints. With banks being very wary of doing business with small Bitcoin companies such as ourselves we have had issues with obtaining bitcoins at discount pricing and regularly purchase coins at a premium ourselves. We hope that as bitcoin adoption grows we will be able to announce much lower fees for our customers. 
Please feel free to message or email us if you have any more questions. Thank you again for checking out our machine!
