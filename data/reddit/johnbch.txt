One of the best memes at this point. I literally get 520 every time i access kraken, after some refreshing it goes away. Maybe we should register kraken520.com or something.

If I talk with friends about exchanges, I always refer to kraken as "kraken502", like in "HTTP 502". And the 502 is the least of their problems if you ask me. Imho if you trust kraken with 200k you're either so rich that it doesn't matter anymore, or, you just had your first expensive crypto lesson (no, this reply isn't helping, but maybe it can help others: STAY AWAY from this exchange)

Ok, I must be stupid, but how is the actual calculation done from BTC to BCH? Take following scenario: I owned 1 BTC before the fork, stored in a private wallter. Since BCH is building on top of the BTC chain, I now own both BTC and BCH. My questions:
- How is the value in BCH converted? Will the BCH wallet first scan the chain to obtain my BTC balance and then convert it to BCH? How is this conversion done? This is probably my lack of understanding (as it happens with the other coins as well I'll assume) but how does it know how much BCH I get for my BTC?
- More technical, when I import only a private key into a BCH wallet, how can it ever re-assemble my BTC balance unless it knows which addresses to scan (and thus how many public keys to generate)
any light shed on this would be appreciated ;)

Of course you can spend both coins separately if you also bought them separately. However, in this case I only bought one coin, namely BTC and before the fork. How on earth is a fork able to let me spend that coin twice on both BTC and BCH chain? So you're claiming that if I bought 1BTC before the fork for 1000$ I'm now able to cash 1400$? (assuming BCH is 400$) ??
What I can understand is that (following your resume)  the BCH client will indeed show my balance even though I have 0BTC in the old wallet (as the BCH client will not see the new BTC chain). However, there has to be some protection that if I decide to spend my 1BTC as 1BCH I'm no longer able to spend the BTC in my new wallet no?

This does not compute in my mind. You are actually spending an input twice this way no? What does your '4.' actually mean? Like trading 1BCH for 1BTC or....?

Ok thanks. This is probably a wallet specific question, but afaik, my wallet stores stuff such as the addresses on which BTCs are received. It also tells the addresses already on which I would like to receive BTC on (but maybe not yet received). Fictional example: I have  500 addresses on which I have BTC. 500 addresses pending (and on which I might never receive BTC) and then again 500 addresses on which I received BTC, so there is a gap of 500 addresses (this is extreme, yes, but it's an example) My wallet knows the gap. However, if I'm only importing a private key into a new BCH wallet, how will it be able to get my balance? In other words, to be save once really needs to "convert" a BTC wallet to another one, no?

Ok, so why on earth would any one with BTC want to use BCH then? Supose I bought 1 BTC @ USD 2000. BCH is now worth lets say USD 400. So basically I'm losing USD 1600 if I would opt for BCH?

Just to be sure, I have the impression that some people assume they can sell there pre-fork BTC twice, one time as BCH and then still have it in BTC. This is incorrect, right? For ex. If I owned 1 BTC pre fork, bought it at 1000$. I now have 1 BTC and also 1 BCH. If I decide to sell the 1BCH my balance would be 0BTC and 0BCH and I would endup with something like 400$ (making a loss of 600$)

Eeuhrm, I'm not able to spend BOTH the BTC and BCH am I?
