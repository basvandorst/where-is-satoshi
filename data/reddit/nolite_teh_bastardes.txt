Which side of the fork fits this description better?
Breathe, count to ten, *think*.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:04:03
And, when preparing the 'close' transactions, how do you know what fee to set (what the market fees will be at some undefined time in future)?
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:50:19
You need to be 18 to use Coinbase. Don't lie about your age, you will lose your money.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:45:15
$20 *is* the promised low fee. Without segwit it would be $30. And next month it might be $100 so transact while it's cheap.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:58:41
They would get block reward but no transaction fees.
The economics don't work out--or they would have done it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:11:45
Users want cheap transactions. Users were told ad nauseam that Segwit will give cheap transactions. So users want Segwit. 
If I were to guess, I would say businesses are busy pivoting into other cryptocurrencies to save their bacon, so Segwit is not high on their priority list.

Just googled this, not sure how accurate: in 2012 there were 883M Visa cards in circulation.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:24:00


Approx. how many users would that be?
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:03:12
x^2 also implies $250K upfront cost for every user just in tx fees to open the channels (assuming 10'000 users and $50 tx fee) so I'm pretty sure it will be closer to x than x^2
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:40:16
Let's say everyone instantly switches to SW *today*, tx capacity goes up by 70%, fess drop a bit but are back up in about 6 months. Now what?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:23:01
Which one is it? Have you checked the viabtc accelerator?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:47:34
It's unfortunate but the network is congested and will be congested for a foreseeable future. For consistently fast transactions you can either try and outbid everyone else's fees or look into alts. 
It sucks but it is what it is.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:32:20
Maybe your friends do have millions but don't want to broadcast that
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:49:20
I'm not sure what percentage of the total tx size is the discounted segwit data but, yeah, sounds believable.
I personally would not call $25 "a lot cheaper" but that would certainly be an improvement.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:37:24

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:26:15
OK, thanks, I get your position. If an effective 2nd layer solution becomes available in a reasonable timeframe then this can potentially work. 
I personally will also be keeping an eye on currencies that try the sort-of naive on-chain scaling, with all its inherent limits and compromises.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:29:07
Do you know how much cheaper? $40, $4, $0.40, $0.04?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:29:18
$110 to accelerate seems expensive now, but sadly might in fact be the "normal" fee in not too distant future :-/
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:04:37
Yeah, I understand it's in a tough spot right now. What's concerning for me is that there are no near term plans (or even just intentions) to solve the capacity issue. It's the opposite, some Core devs will tell you that this is fine: fee market is finally here and works as designed, cheers! So I'm not sure how or when the weird phase will end.

I was under assumption that there was overwhelming industry support for Segwit -- as assured by coin.dance/poli, twitter polls and many loud voices here. Actual usage is steady 10% not 95+%. What gives?

Let's say a well-funded attacker gains 51% hashrate and starts orphaning all other miner's blocks. The other, original miners would then become "shitcoin miners", correct?
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:24:09
Yes, Lightning Network. You open a payment channel once and then you're able to do many transactions very cheaply and quickly. Things like pay-per-second, in real time, are possible. 
Opening a channel is an on chain transaction, so there's some upfront investment. There are also some engineering kinks still being worked out, but it is coming along.
Not sure what you mean by "handicapped by fiat".
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:28:34
Let's say a well-funded attacker gains 51% hashrate and starts orphaning all other miner's blocks. Which rule of "validity" would they be violating?

Segwit "discount", tether, cen-sorship. Yep.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:20:58
Sure, I just think we need to be upfront that longer term, on chain fees are not supposed to be low. On chain transactions are not for buying a pizza or sending $100  to a friend
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:52:20
How would that work with Amazon's volume and Bitcoin's 3tx/s?
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:11:10
Bitfinex pulls Mt Gox, all cryptos lose 30-70%. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 06:01:37
So how do you define it?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:17:53
Right on. The more fees you pay, the more security you get. In future $100 will be considered cheap.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:42:53
You are using it wrong. On chain payments are for $12K+ transfers, not $12. Fees are fine.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:32:51
You used too low fee. To make it cost effective, send bigger amounts. Or use cash.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:49:55
More generally, in bitcoin there isn't official-anything
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:27:54
On chain transactions are not for you then, correct. Lightning network will cater for small transactions. You can also look into using other crypto currencies or fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:17:44
A fee market is required to compensate miners when block rewards run out. We're not used to it yet, but this is the future
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:13:25
Fee market is finally starting to form. Bitcoin users are now bidding for space in the block. Think $20 fee is high? $200 will be a bargain if this thing starts to *really* take off
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:02:56
On chain transactions are not for buying a hot dog. Bitcoin is designed to be a settlement layer between banks and big merchants. For buying hotdogs please use LN or fiat. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:39:23
Invest a few days reading up on the underlying technology. Not such a sugar rush as buying coins on exchange but may be way more profitable in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:30:55
Check out coinmarketcap
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:13:48
It is not competing for retail transactions. It is a store of value and a settlement layer. For small transactions wait for LN or use cash.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:09:36
Fee is relative to the transaction size not the dollar amount. If you wanted to transfer $100K the fee would still be the same. Please don't use on chain transactions for trivial amounts.
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:13:13
I think if everyone do this bitcoin fees will be huge
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:23:08
You can also try a transaction accelerator.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:55:49
Likewise, what good is a car when you run out of fuel? You can always feed your horse and keep going. Slow and steady wins the race.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:23:28
Using a lower fee is fine but it is hard to estimate if it will take a hour, day, or will be dropped by the network. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:36:38
Mempool being "clogged" is a feature not a bug though. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:16:01
Correct, and indeed it is not planned to be a retail currency, but a settlement layer between banks and big merchants.

I'm not sure, sorry. I don't often transact Bitcoin, but when I do, I use a suggested highest fee X 2.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:05:36
No, the reason for big fees is that on chain transactions are supposed to be expensive: they pay miners to secure the network. For cheap transactions please use payment channels, offchain solutions etc.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:14:41
Things are moving. Just be patient.

Elaborate on the evilness please. What are their motives, how do they differ from yours?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:20:04
Fees are integral part of Bitcoin security model. They are only expected to go up as fee market develops. Right now transactions are discounted because of the block reward.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:19:20

Or tons of people trying to buy xmas gifts with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:09:49
There is limited space for transactions in each block.  As Bitcoin grows, and the competition for space in block gets more fierce, only high value transactions will be able to "get in". Like the settlement transactions between banks, big merchants and maybe wealthy individuals. Pizzas and hotdogs will be bought with LN or fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:25:33
You take your 1BTC to casino and sit down at a poker table. That's essentially what you do if you day trade.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:51:43
Bitcoin fees are designed to go up, not down. Fees go to the miners who secure the network. More fees--stronger Bitcoin. $100 fees will be a sign of success not failure.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:30:01
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:21:56
There is limited space in each block. People bid for that space with the miner fees. If BTC really takes off, $100 fee will be a bargain
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:01:32


You are completely right. We must pay the fee and be patient.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:19:25
How would Amazon use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:30:17
What if somebody keeps rebroadcasting that transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:06:11
Price stability, more utility (more places that accept it), more hashrate (security), more eyes looking at the codebase (security), harder to censor (security in numbers)
Bitcoin's mass adoption has been throttled by volume issues though while its rivals are going strong.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:30:31
Please don't use on chain transactions for such low amounts. You are basically spamming the network, and are a part of why fees are high in the first place
