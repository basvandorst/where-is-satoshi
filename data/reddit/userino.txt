I would be pretty stunned if Tor itself was compromised. Like Snowden (and actually Bruce Schneier) have claimed, the crypto is actually reliable. It's the squishy human operators who are fallible. 
Basically this:

So, it's well and good to speculate here on reddit whether credit and growth are good or bad. But the fact is, we live in a society where credit is a major form of purchasing power. Even if you choose not to take loans to boost your purchasing power, I bet it's probably in your best interest to understand how the system works.
By the way, I'm pretty sure we could have "credit" in Bitcoin. Just because there is no central bank doesn't mean that no bank can exist. Let's say I start one right now: the Userino Bank. Keep your Bitcoins with me! I have secure, private servers, and when you spend Bitcoins you're saving with me, I will kick back some rewards to you, like a new laptop! Oh, don't have any Bitcoins? Well, that's no problem; I will lend you some! Here, have a Bitcoin. Nope, no problem. Just make sure to pay me back 1.1 Bitcoins in a year, or else!
See? That's credit. There's nothing about Bitcoin that insulates it from credit (as far as I know).
edit: In fact, it seems I was in the dark. There are already Bitcoin lenders.

Fear . . . it's the mind killer . . .

Glad I bought that new cream. Significantly better than my old brand.

As long as we're going over the fundamentals (hey, a [How Does Bitcoin Work? video made the top today]( here is a cute collection of videos called [60 Second Adventures in Economics](

For a quick, engaging intro, I would add  There's a great, quick intro video there. That primer is very thorough, but legislators, and more likely their office help, are people, too. They have a limited attention span just like we do. So, respect their attention, and provide the important info up front.








Additionally, I applaud you for taking it to the top in Congress. Though remember, you have the most impact on your own community; think global, act local. So see what Bitcoin activities are happening near you, join up, and speak up.

Not sure what you mean by the price "issue." I don't think there is an issue. Even with US dollars, the price fluctuates relative to other currencies. The value of "a dollar" or "a bitcoin" is simply what someone is willing to exchange for it at a given time.
