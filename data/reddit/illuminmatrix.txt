A while ago someone was talking about in a Bitcoin chat about being hacked.  Turns out they used their same nickname on everything even on their Blockchain account, associated with the same address.  Someone apparently collected their info, figured they were worthy of hacking.  Dunno if that's your situation but it seems best to use different names, conceal your info and main address/es.

I do that too. Therefore "I am Satoshi."

Willingly ignorant?  I see many comments on the net about how people can't "use it for anything"  yet there's plenty of uses in daily life with them that are available.  Also, in general many have a soap box opinion of "I told you so!", abut the price goign down to  "It's a pyramid scheme!"  and "It's tulips!"

It still has a way to go.  Of the percent that know what Bitcoin or claim to know it seems a higher percent does not trust it.

Go for it, might just use it and I know others would!

No remorse for the banks that reap revenue.  How about them that steal from people with foreclosures?  Certainly is a bigger issue than people using BTC.  Next banks will be making big money on carbon tax.  Should BTC users pay carbon tax too while numerous big companies such as Apple, pay none?

Exactly, they don't understand any of it, thus why they are going to lose in bank haircuts, etc.

Sounds like a lot of them I've encountered on the net.  None of them have ever used Bitcoin but know everything about it because they follow "the experts" and soapbox the loudest that it will fail.
