Like I said, I've basically already made up my mind that I'm going to invest in Bitcoin, I'm pretty certain that it's going to keep rising at least for a while. I just wanted some other people's opinions.

Well the savings I have at the moment aren't really that much so even if BTC crashes completely I won't have made too much of a loss.

That strategy sounds pretty interesting. Thanks for the advice man.

Again, like I said, I've pretty much already made up my mind that I'm going to invest in Bitcoin. You know why? Because I spent a long time researching them and because I made up my mind that I want to. Asking for someone else's opinion is never bad though because you could have missed something and everyone in this thread apart from you had helped me or at least tried to help me. Several people have been extremely helpful to me already. I don't know if you've had a bad day or something but you have no reason to criticise me. If you don't want to help me then that's fine, just go away.

You're right but BTC is the only crypto currency with which I'm relatively certain that it will continue to rise for now. You make a good point though, I'll have to think about it. Thank you.

That would definitely be the smartest thing to do but my problem is that I don't really have the technical knowledge and experience that I would need. Investing in BTC is relatively easy.

Yeah, I'm planning on making it a long term investment for at least 5 years, most likely much longer. As for the dip, you're right, I probably should wait until the next one before buying. Thanks.

Looks like people decided to try out the Reddit marketing.
