You keep using these words, but I don't think you know what they mean. Anarchism and Statism are a legitimate dichotomy, you're either one or the other. So when you say:
"you anarchists need to understand that just because we don't agree with your raving anti-social attitude doesn't make us statist"
It makes me question your comprehension. If you are not an anarchist, YOU ARE A STATIST. If you believe that government can be legitimate, you're a statist. If you don't believe government can be legitimate, you're an anarchist.

In an economy based on a deflationary currency lending at interest could be profitable, however the creditee would need to be virtually guaranteed to pay the loan back, plus interest, even though wages, prices, and revenues would steadily decrease over time.

FinCEN claims that a money transmitters license is a prerequisite to selling Bitcoin for cash according to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, however, they are wrong. The first amendment states that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press. Therefore selling an item that is not backed by any physical commodity or legal agreement, but backed only by the information contained there in, is a constitutionally protected activity. If you want to be extra careful, only offer to sell paper wallets which you could prefund, selling information that is physically written down makes it easier for old judges to comprehend the first amendment implications. It worked for Phil Zimmermann when they tried to stop him from exporting PGP.

My sentiments exactly. Even if the allegations against Charlie are true, they don't constitute a breach of ethics.
The allegations against Brock are even more outrageous, insomuch as he was never even accused of child abuse or child pornography. If people had taken the time to actually READ the articles in question, they would have found that Brock was only accused of living in a house with a computer that contained child porn. All charges against Brock were dropped when the computer was found to belong to his roommate at the time, Marc Collins-Rector, a known perv. The culture of guilt by association in this community is disgusting, try putting yourself in Brock's shoes for a moment. Would you want to be vilified for the rest of your life because you'd chosen a bad roommate?

If people would have stored their bullion at home, rather than trusting it to bankers who they could not seriously expect to resist government, they could have maintained their wealth. Luckily Bitcoin allows you to truly control and secure your own wealth much more effectively than gold bullion ever could.

Everybody would have guns to enforce the NAP. That is the core tenant of anarchism, the universalization of force, not a monopoly on force.

Precisely. If one of your customers was to violate your nondisclosure agreement and surreptitiously disclose your proprietary information to the public, it would be trivial to remove any identifying information that revealed him as the culprit, rather than one of your other customers.

FinCEN claims that a money transmitters license is a prerequisite to selling Bitcoin for cash according to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, however, they are wrong. The first amendment states that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press. Therefore selling an item that is not backed by any physical commodity or legal agreement, but backed only by the information contained therein, is a constitutionally protected activity. If you want to be extra careful, only offer to sell paper wallets which you could prefund, selling information that is physically written down makes it easier for old judges to comprehend the first amendment implications. It worked for Phil Zimmermann when they tried to stop him from exporting PGP.

That depends on how broadly you define "the libertarian movement."

I also know some anarcho-capitalists who are positively ancient, and time hasn't softened their political leanings. Sounds to me like you just sold out somewhere along the way.

As a said, I would have had to review the article further. Holding someone captive is objectively wrong, even if that person owes you a significant debt.

If someone was going around paralyzing people and stealing their money, members of the community would probably be willing to contribute to a fund to punish the culprit.
If someone is financially destitute, crippled to the point of not being productive, and unpopular enough to be ineligible for private charity, then no nobody should be forced to defend their rights. It seems sad, but so is the fact that blind people don't win archery tournaments.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:00:37
It's not a non-sequitor. If you're unable or unwilling to defend your rights, you can't expect others to do it for you. To put it more simply, your rights can be violated with impunity. If you're unable to distinguish between a strawman and a comparison, it doesn't surprise me you're having trouble with this argument. It would only be a strawman if I then argued that your position is equivalent to a blind man entering an archery tournament. Instead I was using that comparison to illustrate the fact that life just simply isn't fair.

Digital currency can be owned because the asset itself (the private keys) is kept secret. Once you publicize a digital asset, anybody can copy it freely, and it ceases to be solely yours.

For the same reason that EULA are not enforceable. Because most people will agree to them with the express intent of violating them. It is safe for the customer to ignore the agreement because the infrastructure to ensure the contract is enforced would be infeasably invasive. The situation that would be necessary for IP to be enforceable goes beyond a draconian police state, into a sort of polyopticon where each individual is capable of monitoring every other individual's activity constantly and simultaneously.

Theymos is an anarchist, he's said so many times. Satoshi created Bitcoin to undermine government, as evidenced in the following quote:
"Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own."
Obviously you haven't been following Bitcoin very closely since it's conception. Bitcoin is for anarchists, by anarchists. It is a continuation of the cypherpunk concept of Crypto-Anarchism. It is meant to undermine government authority by facilitating illegal transactions and promoting tax evasion.

I'm angry because people like you who claim to support women's rights are in fact pushing to eliminate jobs for women. When you make statements such as:

You are attempting to universalize an OPINION. The FACT is that not all members of the female Bitcoin community have a problem with the institution of modeling. Case in point, the woman pictured.
If you personally feel that modeling is exploitative or degrading, don't seek out a career in modeling. Don't make the assumption that all women feel the same way, and don't try to destroy jobs for women who are OK with being paid based on their appearance.

Signalling support indicates an intent to run code, it doesn't indicate an intent to run code immediately. Like I said (and have said throughout) signalling indicates an intention to run code when a clear majority is established. The switch has to be coordinated, and no coordinated push to establish EC has achieved a clear majority. The coordinated push to establish 2x does seem to be holding on to a clear majority.
You keep your head in the sand though, I'm sure that'll work out great for you.

Exchanges aren't going to list a fork with a different PoW as Bitcoin, especially if there's still another fork using SHA-256. If you lose the name, you lose.

It would only trigger a PoW change on the chain with minority hashrate. The majority chain would retain SHA-256.

Miners do not necessarily have to mine the most profitable chain, they are free to mine whichever chain they want. If they are financially or politically incentivized to take a short term hit, they very well might choose to do so.
As for your second point, that's exactly what they are trying to do, destroy their competition. They don't want to rob the minority chain, they want to destroy it. If they're financially or politically incentivized to do so, they will.
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:28:03
Exchanges aren't going to list a coin without SHA-256 as Bitcoin, not if the other side still has SHA-256. The coin with the new PoW will be treated as an alt.
@_date: 2017-09-27 04:11:16
I doubt they'll list it as an alt if 1x is forced to change its PoW. Virtually every exchange is going to list the coin still using SHA-256 as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-27 04:58:40
So? Why do the exchanges care? They'll call the chain that looks and acts the most like Bitcoin always has Bitcoin. Some alt with smaller blocks that got destroyed right after the split will only be a footnote in BTC history.

I'm not conflating the two, I'm saying that in the event of a hard fork, wherein one side has an overwhelming hashrate supremacy, that side would be able to destroy the other side by forcing double spends into their blockchain. The only reasonable conclusion to draw from these facts is that the majority of miners have de facto control over the version of software that dominates the ecosystem.

The ability to do a 51% attack gives you the ability to destroy the attacked chain, or at least force them to change PoW. A chain that changes PoW soon after a contentious hardfork is not going to be consider the original blockchain.

It's a fact, not sentiment.
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:44:00
If one chain is full of double spends, and the other isn't, then the one that isn't is the survivor, and that was totally decided by the miners. Exchanges are stuck with the survivor, the only chance they might get to make a decision is whether or not they want to sell a chain with the original PoW, or a chain with a new PoW, as Bitcoin. Listing the chain with the original PoW as the original Bitcoin is the only decision that makes sense, but they're certainly capable of eschewing common sense.

You're right about one thing, even mainstream economists are being forced to face the lies they were told in college by the Keynesian "scholars." What you call "hoarding" I call prudent saving, not really a downside. 
The downsides of inflation, however, are staggering. Easy credit availability and the impetus not to delay spending lead us to a situation where people are encouraged to borrow themselves into deep debt, and leverage every position as much as possible. Short term gains are almost universally prioritized over long term stability. This has led to a wasteful consumerist culture that is entirely unsustainable.

Finally, someone making a valid point, thank you! You're right, of course, the majority chain would need at least 67% hashrate, but feasibly much more, to perpetrate this kind of attack.
All I'm saying is that if they end up with as much hash power as currently signals support for them, it's an option they have. So the whole "Miners are powerless, they control nothing!" rhetoric that is spreading in this echo chamber in ill informed, and dangerously so. Miners have more power than any other single class of Bitcoin user, even developers, I would argue.

You still aren't being objective. The assumption that a society without a Maserati in every garage and a 4K TV on every wall is somehow inferior is a matter of OPINION.

It may be small and old, but I'm very glad I didn't buy a larger home that I couldn't afford, saddling myself with a huge mortagage in the process.
As for your argument that the great depression was caused or exacerbated by deflation is an attempt to rewrite history. I'm not blaming you personally, this claim has been parroted by Keynesians since FDR's administration. Now if you are looking for clear cut examples of hyperinflationary spirals, there are a lot more undeniable examples such as Hungary, Weimar, and Zimbabwe.
This whole conversation boils down to one simple concept. Inflationary monetary systems incentivize risk taking, whereas deflationary systems incentivize risk aversion. Which will lead to an ideal social order is a matter if opinion.

I disagree. The great thing about Assange is that he makes sure to get the message out. Domsheit-Berg sabotaged Wikileaks because Assange made getting the message out a higher priority than vetting it to ensure the safety of government agents. This is also what makes Assange and Manning better than Snowden, Snowden could have dumped all of his files to the public, instead he turned them over to journalists who have only allowed the info to trickle out slowly. In retrospect, Assange's tactic of dumping it all ASAP, and ignoring the safety of covert agents, will go down in history as the more effective strategy.

Again, you are stuck in a Keynesian outlook, try being objective. The suppression of investment and a decrease in available credit are features, not bugs. The idea that unrestrained and wasteful "economic growth" is a universal positive is exactly the assumption I'm challenging. As a society we desperately need a system that encourages us to use our limited natural resources as efficiently as possible, not some Keynesian nightmare wherein exponential consumption is seen as imperative. 
The deflationary spiral is a myth. That is exactly how it would work if everybody could live on rocks, but in the real world spending is necessary for survival, as well as comfort and entertainment. I acknowledge that a deflationary system rewards those who can delay spending the longest, but since nobody can delay it forever, the spiral can't destroy the economy. Instead it reduces the economy to its most efficient form, where all spending has to be thoroughly scrutinized to minimize waste and risk.
The fact that we're still discussing this proves that you're more open minded than the average Keynesian, so please, take a moment to consider the long term results of a world economy that demands constant "economic growth" in the form of wasteful resource consumption.

"One is that the long-held argument is that security of the Bitcoin system
in the long term depends on fee income funding autonomous, anonymous,
decentralized miners profitably applying enough hash-power to make
reorganizations infeasible.
For fees to achieve this purpose, there seemingly must be an effective
scarcity of capacity."
To seriously propose we have reached a point where scarcity of capacity is necessary to fund sufficiently secure mining operations is blatantly disingenuous. The current block cap is being used as a cudgel to coerce the community into accepting an unwanted off-blockchain transaction reliant paradigm through exorbitant transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:34:54

@_date: 2017-06-20 22:26:58
Sorry, I didn't realize I was dealing with a newb here, so let me break it down for you. The original vision for Bitcoin presented by Satoshi was that eventually the block reward would be replaced with transaction fees as an incentive for miners to continue keeping the network secure. Creating artificial scarcity with a 1MB cap on blocksize is causing transaction fees to rise to an exorbitant level, even though the block reward is still more than enough to incentivize miners to secure the network. With larger blocks, Bitcoin could easily handle the current network traffic with virtually no fees at all, and miners would continue mining simply to attain the block reward. When I first started using Bitcoin it was quite common for transactions to be included in blocks with no transaction fee at all, this could still be the case if we regularly had blocks that weren't full.
The argument that larger blocks will cause centralization is ludicrous. Anyone who operates a full node (like I do) knows that the size of the blockchain is a miniscule fraction of the total storage space of their device. Even if it were necessary to upgrade to a larger storage drive, it would be a small price to pay to keep Bitcoin accessible to the entire 3rd world which is currently excluded by confiscatory transaction rates.
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:23:02
I'm not suggesting unlimited blocksize increases, I'm suggesting we remove the transaction bottleneck until it's actually necessary for transaction fees to take the place of block reward in order to adequately compensate miners. Charging users an arm and a leg to use Bitcoin at this early stage of adoption will simply drive them away, and side chains and LN aren't Bitcoin at all. If you're not transacting on the blockchain, you're not using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:30:28

The concept of usury (lending money and charging interest for doing so) is completely unnecessary in a deflationary economy. You won't get a loan, you will have to save until you can afford each purchase. Luckily saving is much more profitable in a deflationary economy.

Though I believe it will go up and up and up in the short term, there are some realistic black swans on the horizon. My current biggest fear is that a significant price drop might precipitate a drastic drop of in network hashrate, slowing the processing of transactions to a crawl until the next difficulty adjustment, which might take a loooong time. Also the devs are dragging their feet about removing the blocksize cap, which should be done sooner rather than later.

I disagree with the assertion that a US ban on Bitcoin would cause anything more than a temporary drop in the BTC exchange rate. Historically speaking prohibition has almost universally resulted in an increased value for the prohibited commodity due to supply restriction. While some curtailment of demand might be achievable through such a policy, this would be counteracted by the Streisand effect. In the end it would be a futile effort on the part of the regulators, which would only succeed in hampering the effectiveness of law abiding citizens, while benefiting black marketeers.

The student loan industry is probably the worst example of usury. Student loans put young people deep into debt, and the degree they receive is in many cases worthless. Even worse they drive the price of higher education up for those who wish to pay out of pocket, pricing out lower and middle class families unwilling to burden themselves with debt. Worse yet, the fact that student loans can't be defaulted on via bankruptcy leaves young people with no way out of the debt trap. With the rise of the Internet and the dawn of the information age, higher education is becoming an anachronism, while real world experience and autodidacticism are much more valuable qualities.

Kerzane, the fundamental flaw in your post is the belief that Bitcoin can be "stolen". Bitcoin can not be stolen, they can be inadvertently given away, however. "Stolen" implies taken by force, but no amount of force will move Bitcoin from one wallet to another, only the use of the private key can do that. As long as your private key is secure, your Bitcoin won't go anywhere without your permission. If you allow someone else to access your private key, that is the equivalent of leaving a wad of $100 bills lying on the street, the person who picks them up isn't "a thief" they are the new rightful owner, due to your poor security. Those people who claim their Bitcoin have been "stolen" are just butthurt idiots, pissed off because they left a wallet full of cash lying out in public, and someone more savvy than them picked it up. They are victims of nothing but their own stupidity.

Offline Bitcoin storage is actually relatively simple. The point is to save your private keys on an offline device. This can be achieved by copying your wallet.dat file to a portable flash drive, writing the private key down on a piece of paper (paper wallet), or using a private key derived from a secret passphrase (brain wallet). It is important to make sure that residual copies of your private key aren't still stored on an online device, so make sure to remove the originals once you're sure your coins are securely offline.

My sentiments exactly. Just like the FinCEN guidelines in March, this is another incident of government regulators imagining that they have the power to tell their citizens what they can and can't do with Bitcoin. In the short term this is bad news, because large institutions tend to take regulations seriously, but in the long run this news is as irrelevant as governments themselves.

People who encourage others to be civil and classy are unbearable.

Speak for yourself when you say "we" want bankers, politicians, and Keynesians on board. I personally want them digging ditches when their irrelevancy becomes apparent to all.

Take over the galaxy? This isn't Babylon 5. This planet (solar system) can only support a finite number of humans. Bring up galactic dominion again when you invent a practical FTL travel system.

The more I hear from Ms. Ploshay, the more I like her. (Full disclosure: I voted for Joerg Platzer)

You can't be serious? Banks protect you from fraud? The fractional reserve system is the largest fraud ever perpetrated in the history of mankind.

Good luck. I recommend you research all credit applicants very carefully. Remember, they have to outperform Bitcoin for your venture to be profitable.

Wat? One of Bitcoin's most important strengths is it's ability to facilitate unregulated commerce. I also don't think the general population is in favor of stopping illegal commerce, illicit goods are the second most consumed commodity, after food.

The dollars going up? The dollar has been consistently devalued for a full century, why would you think this?

For realz, my first thought was: "She looks so much like Melissa Francis, she could be her Mom!"

Joe can actually report facts? I thought his job was to spew bullshit about subjects he has no grasp of.

Varney definitely strikes me as a cult-type personality, however this certainly isn't due to an overabundance of control in his demeanor.

If you're too fat/lazy to take 10 minutes away from your computer to go down to the corner and pick up some fast cash, then you have bigger problems than liquidating your BTC.

Couldn't you just get someone else to scan their hand? If I was walking by and someone said "I'll give you $10 if you scan your palm here" I would do it.

Why don't you go break your own windows you statist Keynesian troll.

How is this at all misleading? Odom created OT, now he is building proprietary closed source OT software. This shows that Odom is not committed to the ideals of free and open software, in fact he is attempting to profit from creating "intellectual property."

Cash, precious metals, and gems can't be sent over the internet. Cryptocurrency exchanges are decentralized and while some are complying with regulators, others aren't. See LocalBitcoin.com for a list of AML/KYC non-compliant exchanges.
