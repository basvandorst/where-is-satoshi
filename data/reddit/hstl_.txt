and April 2017 reasons of this "bubble":
1) Japan is set to begin recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting from April 1
2) April 2017 news: Russia might legalize bitcoin in 2018

2013 is completely different. In 2013 bitcoin was not regulated by any law. Only in the end of 2013 China made some preliminary regulations. In 2013 Bitcoin was still a savage from nowhere. Nobody knew what to expect. 
Now Bitcoin is regulated.
And, the most important thing, now people consider Bitcoin seriously. Bitcoin was very stable in 2015, it stayed in the range 220-300 for the most of the year and in the end of 2015 it started to grow. 
Till the end of the May 2016 BTC was pretty stable (range 370-440). Then it started to grow (because of July 2016 Halving, i think). 
Then it became more or less stabilized till the very end of the 2016.
2015 was very stable for BTC, and in 2016 BTC showed very good growing without any intimidating moments =&gt; result: people noticed that and start to consider it very seriosly, trust and confidence in BTC and cryptocurrency increased a lot.
This bubble had 2 preliminary minibubbbles: December2016-January2017 and January2017-March2017. This 2 bubbles showed people that BTC can rise it's price without any shocking falls.
So, the fundament for this bubble was very very strong and robust:
1) Many regulations from a governments of different countries (China, USA, European Union) that made currency i suppose more controllable
2) Stable 2015
3) Growing 2016
4) 2 minibubbles without any shocks
Now Bitcoin showed it's robustness and high potential. 
It's a different story now.
Soon more and more people will discover what cryptocurrency is. 
Popularity of BTC will become increasing much more fastly than it was in previous years.
P.S. this is all my amateur opinion
