Shit I never know whether or not to take yall seriously because i really think it could be possible now haha

Some folks, like yourself, are so sure. I am going with it man I really hope so but sometimes when I read those "bubble" articles etc I get concerned. Again, I'm invested and along for the ride. to the moon

I like the optimism of your second point but there is a flaw in the logic. People who are willing to go into credit card debt for a volatile investment are not the type of people you want backing the rise of bitcoin. I know the type of people who are doing this, theyre fickle and will flake as soon as the drop gets below their comfort level.
I am very comfortable in what i invested in, as I can see  most of you are, so if hell did freeze over and bitcoin was worth 000 then I'd be ok haha. These people think they can get rich over night. we need to do better to teach people the vision and the tech haha

Yes very invested, thats why im curious to see what everyone has to say. Seems like this reddit is big on the holding

Appreciate the answer, Fair enough. I feel like there are quite a few horror stories on the different wallet platforms but coinbase seems legit to me. Figured i'd ask since im relatively new to the game.

This is just bullet pointing human insecurities. Saying "you have recency bias" and "you like popular things" can play to anyone. I'll hodl and steeze dick this old guy

So I should consider getting the ledger nano s then?

and what would you say to someone who suggests this is a bubble fueled by the hype surrounding uninformed &amp; fickle investors
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:25:52
Is there a reason you say 18.5 or is that just your guess
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:25:29
Yea, wait so bitcoins aren't real coins? I was thinking about a purse ):
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:29:53
Yea I guess thats kinda my original question. I understand not wanting to keep large amounts of bitcoin on a coinbase like platform. But if I needed to access the bitcoin-- needed to sell it... how do i do that with one of these hardware devices

No, I think surveying miscellaneous Best Buy employees is certainly not the worst group of test subjects for a Bitcoin questioning. I suppose I am just getting a bit skiddish at the thought of all the news coverage for it and the idea it could revert way back and take months etc to bounce back. Again, I doubt it haha but always got the worst possible outcome in mind.
Im on the east coast and its looking like 10k is imminent. good luck to you
