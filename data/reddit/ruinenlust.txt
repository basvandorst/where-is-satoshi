 * Customer: No biggie, I can just share my internet connection.
 * Mgmt: No, we're not taking bitcoin right now. 
 * Customer: I will only pay with Bitcoin
 * Mgmt: We'll call the police if you don't pay
 * Customer: I will only pay with Bitcoin
 * Police are called

Back in September 2013 there was a day that had 300 BTC of transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-08-24 19:30:22
Official rate is 1 USD = 8.39200 ARS
The blue dollar rate looks to be around 1 USD = 13.8 ARS

Payment processing was meant to be by Bitpagos
@_date: 2014-12-01 22:35:40
I wonder if the situation would be different if the customer had pre-arranged payment via Bitcoin and then the business could not take payment. I guess since the menu items still have a price in Pesos, there is still an obligation on the customer to clear any debts in legal tender.
Thing may get more complicated if there was something that didn't have a menu price. 
* "Can I have a special custom sandwich? and can I pay in Bitcoin"
* "Yes"
* "How much?"
* "It's a good sandwich, well worth 0.1 BTC"
* "OK, I'll take it"
* **munch munch**
* "Damn, that's a tasty sandwich. Can I pay now?"
* "Sorry we can't take bitcoins at the moment"

Finally resolved when it got to around 12 confirmations. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:40:56
I just thought, your friend could add in another 10BTC to that wallet, so the 100 BTC transfer would work?
@_date: 2014-09-11 20:31:34
Kept refreshing without luck. It just eventually resolved at about 12
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:39:57
This is interesting, but I wonder lets say you have 100 BTC in a wallet. You create a transaction to transfer those 100 BTC to a friend 50,000 blocks from now (~1 year). You don't broadcast it, but give them the transaction and tell them to broadcast in a year if you die. 
49,990 blocks later you are still alive, so you begin moving the money. You spend 10BTC on a party to celebrate living, but then suddenly drop-dead leaving the 90 BTC untouched. I guess the 100BTC transaction is now invalid and the 90BTC is lost?

The merchant could also have their wallet address printed out and check the blockchain on any phone to ensure the customer paid.

Nice, I'll be heading to Philippines mid-2015. Cardless ATM and good exchange rates looks like a great option.
They are currently offering 5000 PHP for 0.3425 BTC, which is 71.55 GBP. £71.55 would buy only 4774 pesos if I pre-exchanged the cash in the UK. So about 5% better with coins.ph
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:44:19
I agree there is no obligation. 
But I'm conflicted about the reaction of the customer. Maybe the customer strongly holding their ground means the merchant might realise they need to get their system working. Or maybe the merchant is now thinking, "Bitcoin customers are a pain in the arse", I'll stop even trying to take Bitcoin payments
@_date: 2014-10-04 09:29:37
??? So they sell to drive down the price, and then buy? Why would the buying not just lift the price. If i sell my 1 million BTC the price would temporarily crash. If I then used that money to buy back 1 million BTC then you'd expect the price to just rise back.

I tried a new deposit address and no better. Currently at 11 confirmations and not in my account yet. Has taken over an hour to get to 11, so irritatingly slow

"bed &amp; breakfast"-ing is the term in UK. They introduced the same 30 day rule to combat this. If you bought back within 30 days then the sale is not counted as a loss/gain. Can look at using a spouse to get around this. Sell your holding. Spouse re-buys, so you are not exposed to movements. In 30 days they sell, and you re-buy.

I think this is a poor analogy as u/tetondon hints to. There is a huge survivor bias in drawing parallels to Amazon. We know Amazon survived and went onto be successful. Plenty of companies went bust in the rollercoaster world of dotcoms. Easy to find a company that followed the same trajectory as bitcoin (and Amazon's start), but then collapsed to zero.

Not sure you can guarantee this statement. Lets say you invest 5% of your wealth into bitcoin. At the moment you can afford to lose that 5%. What happens if you lose your job, and your house burns down, and someone steals everything other than your bitcoin. Now bitcoin is 100% of your wealth. I imagine you are not going to want to lose that now!


It's 3 days after the terrible events described above. Your sleeping in a tree in the park and you are damn hungry, but bitcoin is down $1 on your original buy price. Never selling lower? :-)
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:23:40
I'm not sure 25,000 BTC is a big enough amount to be that interesting. A sell order of 5000 btc right now (24-Jan-2015) on Bitstamp would only drop the price at Bitstamp from $252 to $230. And I am sure if you staggered that sale a little, then a lot of arbitrage from other exchanges would kick in it would end up not even dropping as far as $230. 
9,000 sold on Bitfinex and 5000 sold on Bitstamp would drop both to $230.

The point about international remittances  is a great point! 
Western Unions revenue is $5.5 billion, though they offer a diverse set of products, not just person-to-person transfers. However their 2013 Annual Report does state "In 2013 wu.com money transfer transactions represented 3% of The Western Union Company’s total revenue." So just their wu.com service has $165 million revenues that bitcoin has the potential to limit and put that money back into the hands of people.
The annual reports states, "Beginning in late 2012 and continuing in the first half of last year, we implemented a series of price reductions in key corridors to regain momentum with our customers." - Maybe Bitcoin and other money transfer services are putting pressure on their profits.

I guess the one thing we can't tell is if such a selloff and sudden price drop would trigger fear and further drops. In the name of science, if someone wants to donate 25,000 bitcoins to me [ 14eSup1STzizqcv7LaFgWZu6GMbFzcX88t ] , I'll happily conduct the experiment and dump all 25,000 at once onto an exchange. I'll record and report my findings.

In the comments you mentioned lessons were learnt. Can you summarise what you learnt? 
Also interested to know if you think with those lessons you'd have done anything different?
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:38:24
Diversification (don't put all your eggs in one basket) is an interesting point  to consider with volatile assets. Lets say when you started that initial bitcoins might have been only 10% of your net worth. When they saw the 200x increase I imagine they made up much of your $500k of wealth. 
It is easy to keep thinking about those coins as the initial $2500 investment, and the gains as 'fee money'. And not rationally manage that $500k of value. Let's say you skipped ever investing in bitcoin, you never made the $500k from its rise, but then at the peak of the $1000+ prices you inherited $500k of cash. Would you have taken that cash and put it all into thousand dollar bitcoins?
Obviously you did cash out $200k into MtGox. I guess another lesson might be not to underestimate third-party risks. I've got friends that trade with bots and seem to make very small profits while having fairly large amounts of bitcoin under other peoples control.

Summary of Chris DeRose's interview:
* 1. Due to the very high Argentine inflation, Bitcoin is getting used much more as a store of wealth than in US.
* 2. BitPay sell themselves on their payout speed of ony 1 day, rather than credit cards typical 30 day
* 3. BitPagos let hotels accept foriegn USD transaction and then pay the hotel in bitcoin.
* 4. Due to restriction on USD, the black market rate for exchanging USD to Peso is 50% better.
* 5. Largest denomination is 100 Peso note (about $8) and the quality of the notes is terrible. Lots of wornout and damage notes. 
* 6. Because the biggest notes is only $8 lots of transaction involve lots of notes and there are lots counterfeit. So transactions are slowed by people having to spend a lot of time checking notes

I'm also interested to know people's experience. I used one in UK. But interface was pretty poor. Was easy to get confused by the process.
There is a Bitcoin meetup that regularly meets in Pink Cow. You might also find someone that would be willing to trade directly in-person.

I imagine their are design decisions that sites could make to limit the risk of these style of attacks. They could restrict the withdrawal addresses. So withdrawals could be only made to pre-arranged addresses. If you want to add a new address you need to do a TFA process and wait a set period. During that waiting time they can alert you via email/text alert about the new address.
