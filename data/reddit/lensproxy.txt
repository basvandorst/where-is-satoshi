Basically all the big brands have a different pricing strategy in Asia, and it's almost impossible to get the US price levels here (unless you source big quantities directly in the US). 
The thing with Air Optix Night &amp; Day is probably that (especially Chinese) customers prefer lenses with long term wearing periods like 6-12 months and Air Optix ND is probably the highest standard of quality in a similar category, so it's marketed with a high price.

Yes, no problem. We can ship worldwide by Hong Kong Post / Speedpost. With Speedpost you can have the package in Cebu in 2-4 days.

At the end of the accounting period, say, 1 month, you have some turnover in BTC (at this point very little) and some in paper money. Take the paper money and convert it to Bitcoin. Use Bitcoin to pay expenses.

We are trying, we really want Bitcoin to succeed. As consumers we are also looking for merchants who accept Bitcoin payments without payment processors.
This week we have persuaded 2 merchants in Seogwipo, Jeju (South Korea) to accept Bitcoin payments via Coin of sale - no conversion to fiat! (Check out coinmap.org and give them some business if you ever travel to Jeju).

Hi trilli0nn,
1) Yes we can save money if customers pay in Bitcoin. For example in China, the Cash on delivery service is anywhere from 2-5%. We save money on PayPal fees too. 
2) We have a permanent 5% discount on Bitcoin payments, and we are planning some cool new discounts feature for Bitcoin that will allow our users to earn Bitcoin for referrals. 
3) Since everyone at LensProxy is in a love affair with Bitcoin, we actually pay 100% of our expenses in Bitcoin. We don't mind the volatility since the long term trend is to the upside. We believe in Bitcoin as a currency and use it in our personal lives as much as possible.

Thank you for the correction / suggestion. Millibits are fixed and we will also add the option to display prices in bits. 
Air Optix Night &amp; Day are distributed in a 3-pack in Hong Kong (you can check it on the CIBA HK website).
Yes, we should probably add currency symbols next to the codes, it's been added to the to-do list.
Thanks again!
