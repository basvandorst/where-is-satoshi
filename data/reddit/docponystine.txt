Bitcoin has to be a bubble. It creates nothing, isn't used for purchasing and only has the value subscribes to it. Any thing with a price upwards of ten thousand dollars that does not produce anything of actual value has to be a bubble and it will crash. This remaining stable makes no macro economic sense. I would like to present the south sea Company. This comapany made not a single cent in it's entire time being a company, but it's stocks skyrocketed because people saw a few ticks upwards to begin with (and being an English trading company helped) . Because stocks rose, people bought stocks, because they bought in, the stocks rose. That's exactly what's happening here, and as soon as the amount of people willing to buy into bitcoin dries up the prices will crash down to earth once panic selling begins.
No currency should be an large investment. This is the functional equivalent of seeing the Canadian dollar rise in 1,000 in international value over 2 years and assuming nothing was wrong.

This isn't like a stock savings account. This is holding onto money not because you will one day need it and want to combat inflation using interest rates, this is speculating on a very limited distribution curency's future value.

Fiat currency is backed by national credit. Bit coin is only backed by confidence and that alone. The ratio of it's value to currency value isn't relevant at all and I understand Bitcoin can't be created at will.
What I am saying is that Bitcoin is a currency currently being used primarily for speculation and not transactions. This has stimeed supply by people holding onto it and so supply drips, creating an inflated value. Well, eventually the supply of people willing to speculate will drop or the supply will become too small and the price will drop like a rock.

So, the current value is extremely inflated and a bubble? Exactly like I said? I'm not saying that bitcoin is worthless, but it's not worth what it is now.

Then why are people holding onto it over spending it like an actual currency?

All of those things still do not explain this level of value to it. This rate of expansion in the value and this volatility in the market. It still produces nothing and it is still currently only being used for speculation. It is a bubble.

One can reason it's fundamental value is tied to it's uses as a currency. With it inflated this much it means its fundamental value is very, very low.

A Fiat currency with little real world use will 100% never ever crash.
