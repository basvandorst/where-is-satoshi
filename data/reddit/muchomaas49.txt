It's far better for you, which is subjective. I used to feel the same way as you, but now I don't care if I pay 2.99$ for a movie rental. This makes your group smaller, and less competitive. If the industry wants to start making it more and more unreasonable (commercials etc,) then I'll be back on your side. It's not a 0 sum game, piracy is just a strong competitor in the entertainment industry, and if they want to start doing stupid stuff again it will result in me flopping back to your side of things. I guess I shouldn't have said moral justification, but either way it's a personal justification.

I personally think it comes from an era when you simply couldn't get digital content. If you watch something like IT Crowd and see jokes about 'downloading a car' you would equate it to piracy being OK. When I first saw that episode it was more of an issue that there simply wasn't market for it, I couldn't hop on Amazon and watch a season of The Dog Whisperer, and there weren't services like Netflix readily available.
I don't pirate content anymore at all, I simply don't need to. The people who are still holding onto some idealized reality where pirating is still cool are people who either can't afford the product they want, or are making a moral justification on why they don't want to support the content creator.

Couldn't you store it in a trucrypt file?

The worst part is that I know exactly what could have done it:
KeePass/Last Pass
Keeping all information updated
Keeping passwords compartmentalized

There were many mistakes on my part, I just wanted to spread the word that being paranoid as fuck is a good strategy, but being paranoid and informed will help more in the long run.

Just to give a rundown of my last few weeks (probably unrelated to this, but related to bitcoin.)
Someone gained access into my Gmail account and started messaging people asking to borrow some bitcoin, then when the person didn't know who they were, they transferred funds from my google wallet telling them to order some bitcoin as it wasn't working for 'me'.
Not only was the person good enough to use clear english, they also used many of the same colloquialisms that I use. Once I gained access to my gmail, I update the older information, deleted all my older emails, conversations, etc, then 3 AM comes around and they gain access again. I didn't find this out until yesterday, but they actually had gained access to my old verizon account, had google revert the texting auth feature, and used the verizon feature to get my texts sent to an email, which is how they've been able to access that email for quite some time.
It's better to learn a few new passwords and compartmentalize them, then lose your Gmail account that you've had since the beta.

Again, I had the text-to-phone auth code enabled, and I have a different secure email tied to it (my work email,) so I'm not sure what more I could do. Care to explain what I missed perhaps?

I just got back into buying bitcoin, so I will definitely buy some weed with it.

Oh so it means what you're saying it means? Ok.

You can smell the desperation on people who refer to women as "females" it's just so cold and calculating.

Now I just want a coinstar for this!

:D I'll stay tuned, sadly my finances don't allow for a huge investment at this point, but I love the communities.

You're making the assumption that
A) They are making enough on the surcharge to pay for the cost and time to make the device.
B) That the technology that they took time to create and complete, is not going to be broken down and sold elsewhere, where someone can charge a smaller surcharge, and put the original makers out of a business that they created on the side, out of pure inventive willpower.
I don't think it's wrong for them at all to leave an option for tips. I think what they're doing is great.

It's a bigger challenge in Provo.

Well, I was bored, but right now it's a 100% house edge. 
I'll admit I'm impulsive, hopefully I can get some craps going, since that's the best you can do at most casinos. TBH, I thought it was better, but I have seen the actual percentages and I'm probably not going to play more than a couple of games (for shits and gigs.)

It's called pump &amp; dump, some people just don't get it.
@_date: 2013-07-26 21:31:35
Haha, I like gambling, it's just fun to me. I'm not exactly destitute or addicted, I just don't like going to casinos to gamble.
