Another aside: Reddit is cool because you can do this (conversation)
Yeah, some of the subreddits are pretty cool; hence be being here in the first place :)
I'm one of the people who, no matter if bitcoin goes to 0 or $300,000, I'm not selling. It's up to you to believe whether or not it's true, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter what you think but what I believe I know.

Logical fallacy: Begging the Question
Note the title of the post is "Why I'm Not Selling", not "Why You're Not Selling". Why do you think I'm trying to impose my beliefs on others? I just wanted people to potentially gain some insight as to why I am personally holding on to my Bitcoin.
self posts are circlejerk in nature; that's what subreddits are for

Association fallacy.
Then explain how I'm incorrect in stating something regarding people may believe in politics and economics more than bitcoin. This is the issue I am "begging" is true*, but I am allowed to do this because it is my belief. You can describe me as a politician as much as you want but is it really an argument?
*"True" as defined by something I personally believe
My aside: My friends wonder why I'm not on Reddit anymore; I rarely see constructive discussion.

People said the same thing when it was at 28, after I bought. "30 is the new 20". Did you have any conversations with people about that?

Oh yeah, my jimmies get quite rustled frequently on Reddit.
