Read the instructions on their site again. You have to close out of all apps. Hold the left button while plugging in the cable. Then open the manager app and let it update. If it just makes the windows plug in noise and nothing else try again with a different cable.

Or how about you stop bitching and read the instructions carefully. I would bet you the whole amount on that device it works. I have a solid amount on mine. As long as you have the private words idk why you are bitching. Either be intelligent enough to understand the hardware or gtfo.

Its 100% user error. Even if you are able to see the log(which you can btw) it wouldnt help you. I was in your same shoes and i figured it out eventually by i think switching usb ports. Because 3.0 wasnt working for me i had to use 2.0

“bottom” is when something groundbreaking happens with development. Until then its just a few devs saying their own way is right and nerds fighting over control.

And keep generating debt that is unpaid. Yea you fuck the banks, but we also fuck ourselves making interest rates go up. Crypto is made so you cant spend more than you own.
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:59:35
Ill think about it and well see what other redditors think. I think its fishy you have a 1 year account with only 1 comment/post.

No progress, just no mass transactions.
