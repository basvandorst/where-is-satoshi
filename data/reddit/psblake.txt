Long term solutions are like surgery. Short term solutions are like bandages. Thing is, sometimes you need to bandage a wound to prevent further damage, even if surgery is inevitable.
A short term solution does not eliminate the need to implement a long term solution, but it does give us more time to come up with a better plan. In software development, critical issues often need a "just make it work right now" approach just to keep things from getting worse before the long term solution can be implemented. I don't know if we're at that point with the block size limit, but the lack of consensus makes me think we will be before everybody agrees on a permanent solution.

In formal logic, an argument is defined as a list of statements, one of which is intended as the conclusion.

Are you seeing the outgoing transactions, or are you just seeing an empty address? If you see the transactions, did they move once, then stop, or have they dispersed multiple times?
If you don't see the outgoing transactions, you're not looking at the address which received the coins when they were mined (possibly loaded the wrong wallet.dat). If they moved, then stopped, they're probably in cold storage.
If they dispersed multiple times, did they leave the original address sometime after you last touched the flash drive in 2010?

I'm not aware of any service which performs that kind of forensic analysis, but it's not really sensitive information in any way. There's literally zero reason to withhold the transaction IDs, or the address(es) which held the coins originally.
Based on what you've said so far, that would have been a ton of bitcoin days destroyed - At least 100 blocks, 50 coins apiece, hadn't moved in a minimum of 2 full years, plus a few days (Dec. 31st of 2010 to Jan 1st of 2013), that's a bare minimum of 3,650,000 days destroyed, from what sounds like a very small number of source addresses (if not a single address). Given the patience, I could probably pick out the specifics just based on that.

I think most people had two primary objections to Leah's story:

2. It publicized private information which would facilitate harassment, and potentially put him at risk if any criminal were to take the article seriously (Essentially claiming "This man is worth upwards of $400 million. Here's his address. He doesn't appear to have any special security.")
Were it not for the second point, I don't think there would have been nearly as much outrage. The meme-activity of since then does not contribute to that point. [Someone claiming to be his brother]( (and who has presented credible evidence to that effect [here]( [here]( and [here]( has posted multiple times, and has not communicated any complaint or dissatisfaction with treatment of him.

I've seen them. I just don't follow the logic which indicates the NSA specifically as being a more probable creator of bitcoin than any of the other global entities which would have the resources to create it - or any more probable than an extremely intelligent cryptography expert who simply got fed up with the banking system.
Furthermore, the "How to make a Mint" paper doesn't describe anything remotely like bitcoin: It's not decentralized, it doesn't use a public ledger, and it takes a centralized approach to the system. Further, it clearly builds off the work of the 1992 paper you cited first, which *does* describe an approach more closely resembling bitcoin.

I did the math right. I did the reasoning wrong.
[**EDIT**] Your calculations are still off, though:
* Diameter of the Earth is 12742 km
* Volume of Earth is 1.0832e12 km^(3)
* 30,000 feet of atmosphere = 9.144 km
* Volume of Earth + atmosphere = 1.0879e12 km^3
* Difference between the two volumes (atmosphere alone) is 4,670,726,798.37634 km^3
* 1 km^(3) = [1e15]( milliliters
* Volume of atmosphere in ml = 4.6707e21
* Superhuman, hyperventilated Marilyn's breath = 7.7413E+030 atoms
* Marilyn's breath per ml = 1,657,408 atoms
***BUT*** there's a problem: The individual molecules breathed by Marilyn Monroe in all probability *don't exist anymore.*
[The chemical composition of air is actually quite complex]( - but each of those molecules consists of elements which bond in a variety of ways with other elements through natural processes which are ongoing and constant - biological, atmospheric, industrial, and agricultural processes break these molecules apart and rebuild them in different configurations *all the time.* Even the CO2 she exhaled would have undergone several cycles through any of the above processes, becoming entirely new molecules along the way - and may not even be part of the atmosphere any more.
So while there are very real odds that you are breathing some of the same *atoms* as Miss Mortenson, the molecules are a far different story.

No, I don't work there. I just have an understanding of the difference between a retail store and a financial service.
The moment a store offers *cash* refunds for *bitcoin* payments, that store becomes a *de facto* cashing-out point for bitcoin. People will then have the ability to purchase a large quantity of goods, then immediately return them for cash.
Whether or not that is the intended function of the return system is irrelevant: From a legal perspective, this ability makes the retailer a different kind of business, requiring substantial changes to their operations in order to comply with regulations.
Don't tell me what Amazon does with regard to returns until Amazon starts accepting bitcoin. If you want to cry foul over this, point to a store which both accepts bitcoin and issues refunds in US currency instead of store credit.

It seems like your reluctance centers around the potential that the payment/refund system will be abused:
* If the customer paid $100 worth of BTC, and you refund $100 worth of BTC, the customer is either confused or angered by any difference in total BTC refunded due to exchange rate fluctuations.
* If the customer paid $100 worth of BTC, and you refund the same quantity of BTC, regardless of the exchange rate, they are getting refunded a different value than the value paid at the time of purchase.
* If the customer paid $100 worth of BTC, and you refund $100 in USD regardless of current exchange rate, you've become a convenient means of cashing out BTC on-the-spot.
* If the customer paid $100 worth of BTC, and you refund the USD value of that amount of BTC based on the current exchange rate, the customer is again getting refunded a different value from the value paid.
I'll ask this question: Do you have any retail locations on or near the US/Canada or US/Mexico border, or any locations which accept any other form of foreign currency other than USD? If so, how do you deal with refunds in those cases?
Alternately, if I use a Visa card in Canada, the merchant gets paid in Canadian dollars, but my account gets charged in USD. If I have to refund that transaction, how does Visa handle that?

There's your answer, then. Treat bitcoin as a forex. If it's not possible or feasible to hedge against the exchange rate, hold off.


Well, that's kind of beside the point - I'm describing this scenario.
1. I, an American, buy something in a Canadian store using my Visa card. The item costs $5.00 CAD. I get charged approximately $4.64 USD (based on the current exchange rate). The merchant receives $5.00 CAD.
2. The next day, the exchange rate between CAD and USD changes dramatically for some reason. $1.00 CAD is now worth $0.75 USD.
3. I come back to return my item to the Canadian store, in Canada. Am I refunded $4.64 USD, or $3.75 USD?
Whatever Visa's policy is on this kind of thing should probably be yours with regard to bitcoin.

In such a model, the only way they could get into a fractional situation would be if they intentionally took the coins. A so-called "bank rush" couldn't happen unless they were already committing fraud. They would stand to benefit more from simply operating as a legitimate exchange.
MtGox has functioned as the barometer for bitcoin activity in the mainstream media. This most recent issue has caused the value to drop sharply on *all* exchanges. If MtGox did want to steal everyone's coins, the more they stole, the less they would be worth.

It's a vanity address which is almost certainly impossible to withdraw from. Address generation is randomized.

If you set out to create the key for a *specific* string or normal words, it would be even harder (as in, just as hard as breaking private key encryption in the first place).
In other words, someone decided on the string, calculated the checksum suffix to make it a legit address, and now it's a black hole from which no coin may ever return.

This kind of hammers home a psychological aspect of bitcoin which I don't see touched upon a lot: In most of the developed world, people expect digital currency to be secure, but they also expect another, more robust service, to handle and provide that security, rather than leaving it to the individual.
This creates two issues for bitcoin:
* Individuals are not generally savvy enough to provide their own security
* Third-party services for bitcoin (private key) security are, at this stage, amateur operations, providing little additional protection over individual security
Yes, there are certainly individuals *capable* of taking care of their own security, and yes, most people could be educated enough to become competent at providing their own digital security... but this demands that the user adapt to meet the needs of the software (the most doomed of any adoption model).
Until we have a reliable, accessible, ubiquitous means of private key storage and security, bitcoin will continue to be a niche market.

Physical currency.

My understanding of the sunk cost fallacy doesn't apply here, as there is still a strong potential for recovery. Unless I'm mistaken, the "sunk cost" fallacy refers to things like "I hate anchovies, but I already paid for the pizza, and I can't return it, so I might as well eat it anyway."
Loss aversion is a component of holding, but it doesn't appear to be a "sunk cost" scenario by my understanding of the term. It's possible I may have misinterpreted the nature of the term, though.

If PayPal did get into the bitcoin business, I suspect they would bring a payment system not unlike coinbase's, where you can send instant, confirmed, off-chain transactions. Regardless of whether or not it's *necessary*, some people will need the comfort of an established business standing behind their transactions before they're willing to touch bitcoin.

Overstock has done ~$500,000 in sales - which equates to roughly 500-600 BTC. On a slow day, that's around 1% of overall bitcoin trade volume.
If this were a factor, however, it would be self-correcting. The downward force on the value would trigger people buying more coins - which would exert an upwards force on the value. Until bitcoin reaches saturation levels, increased volume and economic activity will itself pressure individuals and merchants to adopt.

Snapcard.com was setup before bitcoin existed, but according to the [Internet Wayback Machine]( it spent all of 2006 completely dead, and turned into the site it is today in 2007. Poking around their other archived pages, I can't tell what market they were competing within, or even what their product was. The most information I can find is an image that says "Mobile Money" and another image stating that they attended "the Information and Communication Technologies for Development Forum (ICT4D)" in 2003.

By definition, yes. The blockchain *is* the ledger.


Is your friend's concern regarding storage space? Because the size isn't really an issue. Storage media is very cheap, and not all nodes have to archive the full blockchain.


Your friend seems to think that more transactions in a block means more computational power is required to solve the block. A block has the same processing requirements regardless of the number of transactions it contains.
The rest of your questions imply that your friend really hasn't even taken a cursory look at bitcoin and how it works. Most of it can be answered [here](

This is part of why I would prefer a more apolitical discussion community for bitcoin. Approaching bitcoin purely from a political stance, or a form of anti-establishment populism provides low-hanging fruit which is ripe for attack. The more we associate bitcoin with libertarianism, the more frequently the discussion will quickly turn into "here are the flaws of libertarianism." If you present it as a silver-bullet to kill banks, the discussion will become "here are the ways banks can't be replaced by bitcoin." If you present it as something which will destroy governments, the discussion will become one of tinfoil hats and anarchy.
Bitcoin will certainly have a profound political effect in the world, but to marry it to any specific ideology merely attracts opposition from that ideology's existing enemies, and turns away potential supporters who may not support those particular ideologies.

Ah, got it. Very few Target stores have a full-fledged supermarket grocery (as in, no fresh produce, bakery, meat/seafood counter, or deli). What they do have is sufficient for 90+% of most people's grocery needs, and they do offer pre-packaged options for everything except produce (I don't think I've seen pre-packaged produce in a regular Target, that is).
CVS - I feel sorry for anyone who has to rely on them for groceries. In that regard, they're little more than an oversized bodega. Their prices aren't as obscene, but they're not ideal.
Kmart is struggling to remind people that they even exist at this stage. As of February 2013, they had 1,221 stores, which averages out to about 24 stores per state - but I would be surprised if it's even as much as 1,000 today.

Actually, the credit card companies tend to act quickly and harshly whenever they're notified of this kind of thing, largely because, if a merchant posts a sign like this, that itself brings the matter of fees to the customer's attention.


Stores which stop accepting credit cards full stop tend to dry up and blow away in the wind. Credit card companies have absolutely zero fear that merchants will stop accepting their cards, regardless of how harshly they enforce their TOS.


"Nothing at all" is exactly what the credit card companies would prefer.

Not specified in that thread what kind of complexity the passphrase had, or the nature of the passphrase. He just says:


If he came across it, that means it was recorded somewhere else - which means he wasn't the only one to see it. If it struck him as a good passphrase, that means it looked complex and secure to someone interested in complex, secure-seeming passphrases.
So, between these groups:
* People who had seen the thing which was used as the passphrase
* People who had an active interest in complex, secure-looking data
* People who wanted to use a brainwallet
Where those groups intersect, there is a high probability that a brainwallet user would deem that value as an appropriate passphrase.
I'm sure people are using all manner of binary data as the basis for a passphrase: The SHA-256 of a ROM dump of a particular Nintendo game, or that of an Exact Audio Copy-verified flac of a particular track off a particular album, or even the Nth generation of a Methuselah pattern in Conway's game of life. Any kind of data can be hashed, and that hash can be used as the passphrase of a wallet.

... And then continued to post public comments on discussion forums relating to bitcoin under that same name. He wouldn't need to identify himself as the creator of bitcoin just to guide bitcoin development. All he would need to do would be to identify himself as an enthusiast, and demonstrate a working knowledge of the concepts covered in the white paper.


Which is more likely: Someone as intelligent and cautious as Satoshi slipping up and giving away his identity, or Newsweek's forensic research team being mistaken?

* Impossible to counterfeit
* Easily transferable across any geographic distance (without relying on a business to make the transfer for you)
* Independent of any government or corporation
* Pseudo-anonymous (if an address is linked to your identity, that address's activity is also linked to your identity)
* As secure as you are (Bitcoin hasn't been hacked, but individuals have had their keys stolen from compromised computers: If someone steals your safe deposit box key, that's not a flaw in safe deposit box security)
* Known to be inherently scarce (maximum of 21 million coins will ever exist)
* Known to be produced at tightly controlled rates (Rate drops by 50% at regular intervals, 21 million won't be hit for more than 100 years)
These qualities make it well suited as a method of payment, which creates a public desire to use it. As more people want to use it, demand increases. When demand increases at a faster rate than production, inherent value increases.
I think the key qualities here aren't just that it's impossible to counterfeit, scarce, and produced at fixed rates, but that these are *openly known definitions of bitcoin's standard.*

PayPal integrating Bitcoin could take a few different forms.
1. PayPal allows funding of your PayPal account using bitcoins. This is the implementation you appear to be anticipating. In the immediate future, the effect is that it becomes possible to spend bitcoins anywhere PayPal is accepted.
2. PayPal allows direct payment with bitcoin, giving the recipient the option of even withdrawing as bitcoins - but until the coins are withdrawn, performs the transactions off-chain for instant, guaranteed confirmation. This not only has the effect of item 1, it also strikes down one of the biggest legitimate criticisms of bitcoin: The inherent limitations of the blockchain in terms of scale and speed.
3. PayPal becomes a full-fledged bitcoin broker (a bigger version of coinbase). This would have the effects of 1 &amp; 2, but would also wash away the biggest barrier to public acceptance: Ease of obtaining bitcoins in the first place. While this is indirectly enabled by item 2, they could limit or try to block that kind of thing as a form of abusing the system. Actually having explicit "buy bitcoins from PayPal" support would be an enormous boon.

From the perspective of authority: Independence means that you're losing some control over whatever it is you're in control of in the first place. Your role and abilities are diminished. Eventually, you may lose that role and those abilities altogether. If you think of your controlling role and power as an integral part of your identity, you may see independence as a direct attack on yourself.
In simpler terms: Most often, the people who rise to power did so intentionally, either because they wanted power for its own sake, or because they needed power to accomplish some other goal. They want power, so anything that takes it away from them is undesirable to them.
From the perspective of the individual: Independence means accountability for whatever it is you're taking control of. Your responsibility is increased, and your day-to-day existence demands more effort and attention. Eventually, you may need to micromanage all the minutiae of your daily life, increasing your stress and depriving you of relaxation. 
In simpler terms: Most people have something that they're responsible for, but which they would be happy to "let someone else handle for me." Anything that requires them to fend for themselves more is, by definition, a source of stress. Dependence is easy. Independence requires effort.

* What do you think the blockchain is?
* What do you believe prevents someone from copying bitcoins without limit?
* When I send coins to someone, how do you think that works?
* Describe a 51% attack.
* How much space do you think a single bitcoin takes up? How many do you think you could store on, say, a DVD?
* What is the two generals problem, and how does bitcoin handle it in a new way?

It should probably be mentioned: Since Coinbase isn't an exchange *per se*, their trading isn't quite the same as open exchange trading.
In an open exchange, the buyer says how much they're willing to pay, and the seller states how much they're willing to sell for. When offers equal or exceed asking prices, the two are matched up on a first-come-first-serve basis. User pays other user, exchange takes a cut. Their completed "sell" transactions exactly equal their completed "buy" transactions.
Coinbase is different: They set the price. You can always sell your coins to coinbase at their buying price, and you can always\* buy from coinbase at their selling price. They do not necessarily have the same number of buyers as sellers. They really have two important trade volumes: Volume of coins *bought* by Coinbase and volume of coins *sold* by coinbase.
On an exchange, those numbers will be exactly equal. On coinbase, they would provide meaningful information as separate values, because they aren't going to be exactly equal.

Grover's algorithm lets you take an actual list of values (not dynamically generated, but a list you've stored, in full, on some storage medium) and lets you ask "Which of these candidate values will generate this output when using this function?"

I'll concede that point three isn't a definite conclusion, but hear me out: Intentionally doing something once hugely increases the likelihood that it will be done more times in the future.


Good question, regardless of the technological nature of the bitcoin protocol. I can think of only three possible barriers preventing this:
* Governments and legislators haven't thought of it.
Fun as it is to mock and ridicule governments for their incompetence, it tends to be a brainless, automatic reaction from governments to say "I order you to \_\_\_\_." It's probably safe to discount this as a contributing factor.
* Governments and legislators think it's impossible to implement at a technical level.
Governmental mindsets tend to be structured similarly to Freud's psychological model. There's the primitive id, deluded enough to believe that it can forbid the rising of the tide, the setting of the sun, or the defining characteristics of Newtonian physics, general relativity, thermodynamics, and even math - but there's also the pragmatic superego, and the mediating ego.
In this scenario, the superego understands enough of how bitcoin works to know that no government can just order it around. No matter how imbalanced the ego is, this still introduces uncertainty, making most of the government believe that it's impossible, or that it's *probably* impossible.
* Governments and legislators think it's implausible that a majority of bitcoin users would comply.
Similar to the previous point, but made more abstract and unpredictable by sheer human nature. While the question of "Is it technically possible" is akin to saying "can you build a holding pen for a large number of cats," this point is akin to the question of "can you herd the cats into that pen?"
If we voluntarily used majority rule to override the normal nature of transactions, all three of these points would go out the window - plus bitcoin users would less resistant to the idea of "The government is making use of an existing bitcoin control mechanism" than "The government is introducing a new control mechanism to bitcoin's design."
But regardless of whether (and to what extent) it would affect governmental policy regarding bitcoin, that still leaves the matters of conclusively identifying the specific stolen coins, and demonstrating that those specific coins don't currently reside in an innocent party's wallet and until the matter is actually resolved, the thief still has an opportunity to act.

I see the source of my confusion: The examples I've seen all use cases in which the asset is either consumed or naturally depreciates due to wear and tear - situations in which recovery is either logically impossible, or so unlikely as to not merit consideration (industrial equipment won't generally appreciate in value). I haven't previously seen the term applied to an abstract, fungible asset.
Question: I buy 1 BTC at $500. The value drops to $400 - my sunk cost is $100, from what I understand. I sell nothing. The value rises to $600. Have I recovered my sunk cost?
Alternate question: Same as above, but I sell 0.5 BTC while the value is $400. What is my sunk cost at the end?
Last question: Same as second question, but I sell it all at $400. What is my sunk cost at the end?

I'm not so sure. The general consensus is that the web's birth was around 1993. Five years later puts it at 1998. By 1998, the web was a firmly established technology, nearly as ubiquitous as color television. Most households already had at least one computer, and most of them had dialup, at a minimum. Virtually every library had multiple internet terminals available for free use by the public. The web was practically everywhere, even in highly rural areas.
I think it would be fairer to compare it to e-commerce. For instance, Amazon.com didn't even post a profit until their eighth year.

In that psychological landscape, people who do pay taxes are detestable collaborators, cowards, and appeasers. They view themselves as vigilantes retaking an extortion-terrorized neighborhood, and taxpayers as the weak willed shopkeeps who just keep paying the racketeers.

Actually, I had the Tennessee one wrong: It is *legal* to hunt whales from a moving vehicle. It is illegal to hunt other wild game in such a manner.
That's one of the "technically true" ones, as the legal definitions of prohibited wild game are broad enough to cover most things. The law doesn't itself say "you can hunt whales," it's just that whales are one of the animals which cannot be classified among Tennessee's prohibited wild game under this law. By the same reasoning, it could equally be said that you can't legally hunt deer from a moving vehicle, but you can hunt octopi.
The Kentucky one is unique to Louisville. The details of its origin are vague, even to those who have studied its history, but the general consensus is that it was enacted to prevent horse thieves from luring away the animals with a pocketed treat.

It's not publicly known how much bitpay sells versus how much they hold, and Coinbase's business model isolates their users' buying and selling activity until Coinbase needs to top up either their fiat or bitcoin reserves. We can't really authoritatively attribute them with downward pressure.
It seems far more likely that the downward pressure is the result of one or more whales setting up very carefully placed sell walls on the exchanges, nudging the price gradually one direction or another. Each time the price bounces off their current wall, they buy coins at the lower prices, using them in future walls.
Right now, someone on Bitstamp has nearly 200 coins with an ask price of 622. The price will keep touching that value, then bounce off it.
The problem is that, at the current trade volume, market manipulation is frighteningly affordable, and can be extremely lucrative.

I'm sorry you perceived anger in my posts. I assure you, none was present.


I agree that it's not ideal as a customer solution - but bitcoin's volatility makes bitcoin refunds problematic.
* If you refund the number of coins as coins, the customer gets refunded a different value than what they paid. Great if the value goes up, but massive complaints if the value goes down.
* If you refund the original value of the purchase as cash, you are now a financial service.
* If you refund cash based on the value of the coins paid based on the *current* exchange rate, both of the above problems apply.
Store credit equal to the dollar value of the original purchase is currently the best option available. Not great, but the one which poses the fewest legal problems.

You can. Can every bitcoin user? Can a majority, even? Can they do so quickly enough to say "I want to buy this thing on the internet," and a few minutes later, have ordered it? Can you shop on any website you like without creating an account there? Some people would happily pay the 2% for that part alone.
The point wasn't "you sometimes need a taxi, therefore you will sometimes need snapCard." The point was, "you fall into a category of people who do not personally have any need or desire for snapCard. Others do."
If you don't need them, absolutely don't use them. It wouldn't make sense. But some people do have a need, or at least a desire. For them, it makes sense.

Overstock issues store credit equal to the USD cost of the item at the time. That's really the only legal way to handle this currently. If they issued refunds in bitcoin, then you get into very hairy territory of whether to use the current or historic exchange rate. If you issue refunds in cash, hey presto, you've become a currency exchange, and you now need to register for a completely different license: Customers would have the ability to buy things with bitcoin, then immediately return them for USD, making them a *de facto* cashing-out point.
Store credit of equal value is the safest approach for both the customer and the merchant.

Probably. I think there was supposed to be some kind of satirical portrayal of shaky fiscal policy, framed in a paraphrasing of my joke, but it got lost in a tautologically flawed measurement of dollar value in terms of dollars.
A dollar is worth a dollar. It always has been, and always will be, regardless of whether it takes a billion of them to buy a single grain of sand, or if you could buy Switzerland with just one. One dollar is worth one dollar, in the same sense that one meter is a meter in length. The value could fluctuate wildly relative to the rest of the universe, but a dollar is always exactly equal to itself, gold standard or not.

A hypothetical candle starts at noon, and covers a 15-minute interval. The first sale in that interval occurs at 12:05.

My proposed design *does* only deal in transactions, not keys. I'm not sure what you're saying there.
Trezor does something similar, but uses a wired connection to read the requested transaction. If the keys (which *are* stored on the Trezor, otherwise you'd never be able to sign transactions) can *ever* be dumped by the user based on data input through the wired connection, that presents a potentially exploitable vector for a compromised POS terminal to attack.
SigSafe is secure in theory - if the term "non-exploitable air gap" can have any long-term meaning. I'll admit, I'm not an expert in NFC communication protocols, but I'm apprehensive of any form of communication which can occur without the user's expressed intention and awareness.

Irrelevant - They were not ignored during those low points. When you look at the historic data on bitcoinaverage during those two low points (which occurred on February 10th), their data is included.
I misspoke earlier - ignored does mean "not currently recording." You can verify this using the Bitcoinaverage API's historic [volume CSV]( - An exchange will only show a 0 when it's been ignored.
BTC-E hasn't been ignored since Feb. 4th, when a hoax was going around that they were under criminal investigation, and bitfinex has never been ignored since they were first monitored in November of 2013.
On February 10th, a total of 166,214.54 BTC was exchanged across all monitored exchanges. On Bitfinex, only 7,000 BTC were sold at that low price, and on BTC-E, only 5,000 - a total of 12,000 BTC, or roughly 7.2%.
Math time: You have 10 thingamabobs. You sell 9 of them for $1 each. Your average sale price is $1 per unit. You give away the last one for free. Your average sale price is now $0.90 per unit - You took a hit on 10% of your units sold, and your average dropped by 10%. That scales for any quantity, and any percentage. Meaning that, even if that 7.2% of the day's volume had been given away for free, the maximum impact it would have on the daily average would have been 7.2%.

It depends on the scope of information that the radio broadcast device is capable of leaking, and which firmware you're talking about being compromised. I see a few potential scenarios:
* Compromised POS terminal, wrong destination address shown: I don't think a dumb device would be any more or less advantageous here. This is the one I think would be hardest to effectively protect against, but also presents the lowest risk, as it would only redirect a single transaction.
* Compromised POS terminal, wrong amount shown: Neither a smart or dumb device would present an advantage here without adding significantly to the steps required by the user. This also presents little risk, though: Any significant difference in amount would be immediately apparent to the user themselves.
* Compromised POS terminal, attempt to dump private keys: This is the one I'm primarily concerned with, as it presents the greatest risk to the user outside the context of the specific transaction being attempted. Whether or not this would be possible with either wallet device would depend on the wallet device's design and functions, but would be more detectable on the dumb device, since the QR codes on both the terminal and the wallet could be reviewed by another device before the POS terminal could scan the wallet device's display. If the wireless device's keys could be dumped wirelessly, there would be no opportunity for detecting or preventing that until it had already happened.
* Compromised wallet - Impossible to protect against this through hardware design. There must be a layer of trust in the device itself.
* Compromised wallet &amp; POS terminal - The word "security" no longer exists in this context.

Customer support personnel must, by necessity, answer policy questions from the perspective of what the current policy is - not what future policies might be.
To do otherwise would require them to escalate a non-critical support request either to a higher tier (which is not considered appropriate), or forward it outside the support department to whichever person would be in a position to make such a statement (which is like an army private going to a general when an order is unclear). Change-of-policy questions are not support questions.
Even if the message goes to someone who could comment on or change the policy, most companies will want issue a press release before making any statement to the public regarding potential changes.

Such systems are not only unnecessary, they are a logical impossibility. There is no way to distinguish between coins which are lost (for any reason including death of the owner) and coins which are merely being held in long-term storage (such as a cold wallet).
It is the responsibility of the individual to maintain failsafes to allow for such an eventuality. Any other external mechanism would, by its very nature, enable the movement of coins without the owner's approval.

It's also "sa" in katakana. Which is kind of interesting:
Hiragana is used to spell out the syllables of Japanese words (including proper names). Katakana is used to spell out the syllables of words in other (non-Japanese) languages.
Satoshi Nakamoto is a clearly Japanese name (represented in some places as 中本哲史 even). So サ makes phonetic sense - but only if Nakamoto *isn't* Japanese.
I'm probably using a different definition of "interesting" than everyone else.

That's not quite the same thing: Overstock's items *were* on sale from their MSRP, but they were comparing the prices to other, similar items. 
Imagine a sign said "Don't pay $500 for a new PS4! Come to our store and get a pre-owned PS3 for $100!" That's an honest sign, but not a compelling one. Now imagine they erased "PS3" and "PS4", and replaced both with just the words "video game system." It's technically accurate, but implies an equivalent item, when it's actually an older model.

As desperate and flailing as _08 was, I think the most plausible explanation for their behavior was that they were sincere when they tried to sell BTC for &lt;$50 apiece in April (around the time of the crash), and everything since then was sour grapes.
There were times where _08's posts were almost coherent, and some even raised valid concerns over the viability of bitcoin, but most of what they posted was just insults, paranoia, conspiracy theories implying that bitcoin was the tool of Jewish controllers over mindless "goyim", and nonsensical confabulations trying show how random events would destroy bitcoin utterly (Silliest one of these I saw was the one claiming that Earth Hour would permanently kill mining).

Semi-correct. The blockchain is the only place bitcoin could even be said to exist. Bitcoins only exist as a record of their creation and a record of all transactions they've gone through.


Partially correct again. There is no "secret message." There's just a transaction. Whatever wallet program you're using basically posts a public note where everyone can see it, saying "these coins now belong in this other wallet," and is signed in a way which mathematically demonstrates you have the authority to make that transaction.


The fact that you actually got this essentially correct makes your sincerity extremely suspect, considering you were talking about obtaining [51% of the coins in another comment.](


Partial credit. Bitcoins only exist in the blockchain, and the blockchain is only valid if you have the whole thing up to that point. So, in the sense that you don't need a lot of storage space for a cold wallet, for example, you are correct - but in the sense of how bitcoins actually exist, you're way off base.


Incomplete. Explain in more detail. You failed to state what the actual question in the problem is, and how the blockchain and signatures relate to it.

Why not a group of independent cryptography experts? Why the NSA specifically, as opposed to any other entity capable of creating it?


Science fiction authors had been writing about anonymous electronic cash for decades before then. By 1998, e-commerce was commonplace. These were not strange concepts, and those aren't the distinguishing characteristics of bitcoin.
The big new ingredients bitcoin brought to the table were decentralized production, a public ledger tracking all activity, and peer-to-peer communication of the whole system. "Anonymous, encrypted, digital cash" just sounds like plain old e-commerce to me.

You didn't specify fixed length or an otherwise upper-bound limit on length for the part after the "-", so the question is unanswerable within the data provided.
However, assuming the sample "mbW53x3CuQ" code is the exact length you're looking for, then you're going to be cycling through:
* 26 upper-case letters plus
* 26 lower-case letters plus
* 10 digits
Giving a total of 62 possible characters per space. That means that the latter portion of this code would have 62^10 possible codes. Multiply that by the 25 possibilities occurring before the "-", and that gives you a grand total of 2.1822e19 possibilities.
So, good news: If you could throw the all-time-high of the full bitcoin network hashrate at this problem, it would only take slightly more than 10 minutes.
Bad news: That all-time-high is about 35 petahashes per second. If all you've got is 1 gigahash, you're looking at a 26-year wait.
And that's assuming the part after the "-" is always the same length. If it can be any length, you're buggered.

The average volume of air breathed per breath for an adult is approximately 500ml, or .5 liters. One liter of air contains approximately [2.652e22 molecules]( which makes 1.326e22 molecules of air per breath.
Marilyn died at 36, but let's be forgiving and round up to 37. Let's also be unrealistically in her favor by saying that she had a full adult lung capacity her whole life, and that she was a pretty fast breather the whole time - say 30 breaths per minute.
37 years = 13,514 days (including nine extra days from leap years)  
13,505 days = 324,336 hours  
324,336 hours = 19,460,160 minutes  
30 breaths per minute * 19,460,160 minutes = 583,804,800 breaths  
1.326e22 molecules per breath * 583,804,800 breaths = 7.7413e30 molecules  
Now, the world population is over 7 billion, but let's round down, just to further skew things in favor of the claim. Let's also unrealistically say that the world is averaging very shallow breaths of only 100ml per person. That's 2.652e21 molecules (1/10th of a liter) in one very shallow global breath.
7,000,000,000 breaths * 2.652e21 molecules per breath = 1.8564e31 molecules consumed in one global breath.
So, in one breath, the world cycles through a bare minimum of more than double the total air molecules Marilyn Monroe breathed in a lifetime - and that's assuming she never breathed the same molecule twice. This is an extremely unrealistic estimate, rounding everything in favor of your claim.
There just aren't enough air molecules to go around for your claim to stand up.

By "us," do you mean in general, or just the various fiat_sux# accounts in particular?
I'll put it this way: My projection was mathematically sound. Regrettably, that counts for little in terms of economics. Just as bitcoin's explosive growth came as a surprise, so too did its slow movement this year. Even when we experienced sudden increases or drops in price, these were fleeting and their effects short-lived.
Bitcoin's behavior defies all traditional economic wisdom. Show any market analyst the price movement during the slaying of Bearwhale (and even immediately before and after), and they'll accuse you of making it up. No matter how much you analyze and scrutinize the charts, bitcoin is simply too young a market to predict with any reliable accuracy. It will react unpredictably to new developments - and right now, almost *every* development is new.

By your reasoning, they would have to retroactively orphan *all blocks* leading to the first instance of an incoming transaction to any of the taboo addresses. And while I believe this is impossible, even with a 51% attack, let's pretend for a moment that it's not: This would rewind the block to the first instance of an attempted deposit into one of those addresses, mooting all the other forbidden addresses - and effectively nuking all other transactions up to that point, including any coins mined in the intervening blocks. Miners would not comply with that order.
But let's say the DOJ says "Okay, currently existing blocks are allowed to continue to exist, just don't let these tainted coins ever move again."
Startlingly enough, most miners do things with bitcoins other than just mining them. Many use them as a form of payment, accepting them and spending them just as anyone else would. This means that a lot of miners have a balance of more than zero coins. As such a list grows and the percentage of tainted coins increases, this means that some members of the pool would likely have some of the tainted coins in their own wallets. Now it's not a problem which just affects other people, but affects the miner directly. Since they can't ever spend the coins, they may as well have been robbed. It would be in their own self interest *as an individual* to do whatever they could to subvert the controlling influence of the order, including taking their hashing power elsewhere.
But even if that were not enough to disrupt the mandate, this would only work so long as the pool maintained majority control. As such a list of addresses grows, so too does the number of people who are either directly freeze-fined, or merely ideologically offended by the idea of such control. These people would also have a vested interest in subverting the majority control, and would aggressively add hashing power to the network outside the locked pool.
But even if *that* weren't enough, the other pool operators would now have a compelling reason to increase their incentive to new miners, attracting miners from the locked pool.
In all of the above scenarios, the ultimate effect is that the locked pool loses majority control, nullifying the effect of the order. As soon as they *lose* control, they won't be able to orphan tainted transactions anymore, making compliance with the order impossible. The locked pool dies.
You still haven't addressed my final question though: Why wait for *one* pool to get majority control? Why hasn't such an order already been issued to two or more pools totaling more than 51%?

Online payment currently requires another party - either the merchant or the payment processor - to have access to your payment credentials. If their system is compromised, either through corruption internally or outside attack, your payment information is vulnerable and can be misused. The more different places you input the information, the more opportunities there are for it to be compromised.
Used as intended (that is, you do not entrust your private keys to another party, and your wallet was created securely), with bitcoin, no one has your payment credentials but you. When you initiate a payment, none of the information you send puts your money at risk. There is no login, password, or card number which can control your funds. The data you send only authorizes one transaction, from a specific source, to a specific destination, in a specific amount. Any unauthorized change to any of those values would invalidate the transaction, and it wouldn't be processed.
Put simply: You have your payment credentials, and using them doesn't involve sharing them with a merchant or payment processor. Your information is exactly as secure as you are personally. It *can* be compromised, but only through your specific device(s) storing your private keys.

Or if their private keys were compromised - a malicious entity wouldn't have to vote on their behalf, but could simply send the coins to a junk address not associated with the election. Note that this depends on the security of the individual voters themselves, but also the security and honesty of the entity which generated the private keys in the first place - and this would be a government-contracted agency.
Or if misleading voter information got sent out, showing incorrect QR codes for some voting options (either leading to junk addresses, or siphoning votes into one of the other options). Example: Voters receive a flyer describing the various candidates for the upcoming local election, with QR codes displayed next to each option - but only the incumbent party's QR codes actually lead to the addresses designated for that election. The rest lead to junk addresses.

Moore's law refers to transistor density, which is itself constrained by the physical dimensions of a transistor. The best we can get right now is transistors approximately 10 nanometers in diameter (1e-9m). For that density to double every 2 years, transistor diameter must drop by 50% over that same period of time.
A lot of people don't realize this, but the universe actually has a physical resolution. No matter what superscience you wield, the smallest physical distance between two points in space is a planck length, approximately 1.616e-35m.
If Moore's law holds, in just over 171 years, each transistor on a processor will be somewhere between 1 and 2 planck lengths in diameter. Moore's law *must* break then, regardless of anything else. It is physically impossible halve any distance of less than 2 planck lengths.
[**EDIT**] Strike that last part: "Between 1 and 2 planck lengths" is nonsensical. Should be "exactly 1 or 2 planck lengths." Which is also nonsensical, because it couldn't function as a transistor at that scale.

If that was the implication from the headline, I didn't catch it. I know there's a big debate over the distinction between "You can spend bitcoin to obtain things, but the merchant receives fiat," and "You can spend bitcoin to obtain things, and the merchant voluntarily keeps bitcoin," - but the former is a necessary step to reach the latter.
Historically, two of the biggest barriers to adoption of bitcoin have been the difficulty in obtaining it in the first place (signing up for an exchange, overpaying on localbitcoins, etc), and the fact that it wasn't very liquid - the list of things you could do with bitcoins, even indirectly, was too short to be of interest to the general public.
Regardless of their (debatable) effect on the market value, snapCard moves bitcoin from a techno-niche novelty to something normal people can spend to buy normal things - and BillPay is a *huge* leap in the utility value of bitcoin.
You can argue about the semantics of whether this should have said "You can now pay someone with bitcoin to pay your taxes in fiat," but regardless of how it's phrased, this is a game changer.

Because the miners in that pool would be able to operate without restriction in other pools, and remaining in a restricted pool would substantially slow the network. The list of forbidden addresses would only grow over time, and since the order forbids including transactions with coins which have ever passed through said addresses, the propagation of coins from those addresses prior to that point would eventually taint a large percentage of transactions.
Unless the DOJ is offering to pay them to refuse such transactions, there is no reason for miners to participate in a locked pool.

We'll have to first solve for number of attempts required.
At the time I write this, the [odds of finding a block on a single attempt]( are 0.0000000000000000000138435428664968852592232124477933385. We'll call this Pb (probability of a block). The odds of a success on N attempts is defined as:
1 - (1 - (probability of success))^N
Since we'll be frequently referencing (1 - (probability of success)), let's call that Pfb (probability of failed block). In this case, it works out to 0.9999999999999999999861564571335031147407767875522067.
Powerball's odds vary, depending on the prize amount, and there isn't a single prize valued at the same value as 25 bitcoins (roughly $15k at today's rates). Let's assume you played the $10k prize with a Powerplay, aiming for a x3 multiplier (equal to 2 successful blocks in 1 week). The odds of getting the 10,000 prize are [1 in 648,975.96]( and the odds of getting the x3 multiplier or better are 1 in 2 (50% chance of getting the x2 multiplier, 50% chance of getting something better). So, we'll call the probability of getting your winning numbers Pp (probability of powerball), which means the probability of winning *and* getting a x3 or better multiplier would be Pp/2 - we'll call this Pm (probability of multiplier), which would make it 1 in 1,297,951.92.
Since we're looking for multiple successful blocks, that means we have to look at the odds of winning once in set number of attempts, multiplied by the odds of winning once in the remaining attempts (the set minus your success):
(1 - Pfb)^N * (1 - Pfb)^N-1
Which simplifies to:
(1 - Pfb)^(2N - 1)
So, we've now declared our variables, let's solve those equations:
We want Pm to equal (1 - (Pfb^(2N-1))), and Pm is a known value. We're solving for N (number of attempts), so:
1 - (Pfb^(2N-1)) = Pm
1 = Pm + (Pfb^(2N-1))
1 - Pm = (Pfb^(2N-1))
log(1-pm)/log(Pfb) = 2N - 1
[Which makes 2N - 1 = 5.565373455170071228045023 × 10^13]( Divide by 2 and add 1, and you get 2.7826867275851356140225115e13 - That's 27.8268-ish trillion attempts to get the same odds as winning $30k or better in powerball in one week.
Now, since hashrates are measured in attempts per second, that means we need to work with the number of seconds in a week: 7 x 24 x 60 x 60 = 604,800 seconds.
(Number of attempts required)/(total seconds) = 46,010,032 attempts per second - about 46mHash.
Running anything faster than 46 mHash over the course of one week will give you better odds than winning $30,000 or better in the powerball in one week.

Actually, my statement assumed that it *wasn't* removed from the set. If values were removed from the set as you went along, then the probability would not merely approach 1, but would equal 1 within a fixed period of time (equal to the total number of possibilities divided by the possibilities checked per time period).
Put another way: I've got a six-sided die. On any given roll, the probability that I will roll a 1 is 16.6...%. I'm going to roll it 3 times. What are the odds that I will roll at least one instance of a 1? What if I roll it 10 times? 20 times? 100?
No matter how many times I roll it, the odds of rolling a 1 at any given moment are still one-in-six, but the odds of rolling a 1 within a set of a given size always go up as you increase the size of the set - and the odds *never* actually reach 1, even if you rolled a trillion dice per second every day for a thousand years. There's still an infinitesimal chance that you never rolled a 1.

That's not surprising. It's not necessarily 5 million unique coins - If I receive a coin, then send it to someone, and they send it back, my address has "received" a total of 2 coins. For an exchange to "receive" 5+ million coins over the lifetime of a single address is not strange, as coins would be entering and leaving that address pretty constantly.

I think you've misunderstood the nature of private keys with regard to public addresses.
There are 2^256 valid private keys (less approximately 1.3827e13 addresses, but they represent less than a 100-decillionth of the overall 2^256 total).
Within that set of private keys, every one can be used to generate a public address - the process of address generation will never fail on a valid private key.
However, there are only 2^160 valid public addresses.
Since the number of input sources is greater than the number of possible outputs, that means that some of the inputs must resolve to the same output - in other words, for any given address, there are, on average 7.9228e28 private keys which will result in that address.

If his point was regarding the infrequency of difficulty calculation, that's something which can be addressed at the code level. The only ambiguity would be whether a majority would accept the change.


That is a clearly deniable statement. If it were true, the value would only go down over time. Value is also affected by demand. When new coins are minted, that exerts a downwards force on value, but this can be (and typically is) countered by increased demand. Or, put another way, an airplane isn't falling during takeoff.
But if it were true, that $40 figure is meaningless, since the same amount of BTC would be worth less and less, and that's assuming the total number of daily transactions stays the same. If it increases, the BTC paid out per transaction drops.
He treats the exchange rate and number of daily transactions as fixed values. His concern only makes sense if the number of daily transactions drops. "If people use bitcoin less, that will be a problem," isn't exactly Nostradamus material.

Your credit card company has control of your card and its activity. When you pay with a credit card, the merchant can retain your card information, which would be valid in the event of further attempted charges without your authorization. This information could be intercepted or retrieved at a later point by a third party, as the result of a security breach within the merchant's system. If your card is persistently linked to your account on the merchant's site, your login information is sufficient to make unauthorized purchases. If you have an online account management login for your credit card, that login information could be breached to obtain control of the card (however temporary). Your payment credentials are passed around among multiple parties every time you make an online payment, and you may have little-to-no knowledge of those parties or their intentions.
With bitcoin, your payment credentials are stored locally - they are exactly as secure as you make them (which is a double-edged sword). If you sign transactions using an offline device, then transmit them from an online device, your payment credentials are extremely secure: Randomly guessing the necessary information has a probability on par with quantum events which violate Newtonian physics.
Although there are other benefits, the locally-stored credentials factor is, in my opinion, the most revolutionary feature offered by bitcoin. The "merchant can retain payment credentials" factor directly led to [a catastrophic leak of credit card information for millions of customers]( Such a widespread theft would be impossible with bitcoin. Individual users might get infected with malware, but it would not be all bitcoin users. The POS leak included credit card information for every card which was scanned on the infected devices.
In the immediate scope of a single casual purchase, it may not hold much appeal or significant benefit over other methods - but in the larger picture of an increasingly digital world with sensitive information scattered across thousands of devices and databases of varying security levels, there needs to be a system by which an electronic payment doesn't involve transmitting reusable, highly sensitive data.

For anyone on the fence about snapCard, it's worth mentioning two other major features they have, other than just "spend your bitcoin wherever you like":
1. Shop anywhere with your snapCard login. No need for a separate account on different merchant sites. First time dealing with a merchant? You don't have to create a new account.
2. If you have any disputes with the merchant, snapCard acts on your behalf. They go out of their way to make sure you get the product you wanted at the advertised price.
Case in point: I bought a third-party gift card code from Target. Normally, one expects gift card codes to be pretty instant delivery. 24 hours later, no word from target, other than to say that the order had been placed (but not yet "shipped"). I told snapCard, and they found another merchant to provide the gift card code. SnapCard paid double to get my order resolved, at no extra charge to me. Maybe they can cancel the Target order, maybe not, maybe they can find offload that giftcode somewhere else, but the fact remains: The merchant couldn't fulfill expectations, so snapCard did.
Yes, I know how gushing and ad-like all that sounds. I know, snapCard testimonials sound like a TV-commercial version of reality, where everything is unrealistically clean, friendly, and fulfilling, but by Odin's beard, Thor's hammer, and Zorglak's deathbleed ray, that's how they do business - and I'm not one to throw around Zorglak's name lightly.
In my opinion, the 2% fee is a bargain price for these two features alone. Paying with bitcoin just makes it more convenient.

If the original objective was "Let's generate this specific address," then yes. If the original objective was "Let's generate an address which starts with 1Counterparty" followed by a seemingly intentional string of characters," then it is entirely possible that this address was generated by chance.
If we had been introduced to Counterparty with the address "1Counterparty12345678901234567-------", we would have accepted that as impossible to generate. Same if it was any string of all the same character, or any easily recognizable sequential pattern. They wouldn't need a specific address. They would just need an address which didn't *look* random.

Right now (the exact instant I'm posting this), I can offload my coins at a minimum of $880 apiece. By definition, if I bought below that, I'm coming out ahead.
On BTC-E, the only times that the typical price went above that value were November 26th through December 6th, late December 9th to early December 11th, and midday January 5th to midnight January 6th.
Going back through my records, I don't see any buys for my account during those periods, and I don't recall seeing any posts from you - but I may have overlooked some. You do post *a lot*.
[**EDIT**] It occurred to me that it's not quite fair to use BTC-E as a basis for losing money on the buy price - I could have bought coins from MtGox at the time, for whatever improbable reason. Interestingly, that just expands BTC-E's times by less than a day. MtGox did go over $880 back on the 4th, but it did dip down to just shy of $880 late into the night on the 7th - which, coincidentally was shortly after I saw [this post]( I didn't buy from MtGox at that time (bought from Coinbase), but your post did coincide with best time to buy in the past 9 days, on the most overpriced exchange.

Regardless of whether the company's assets and liabilities add up to a positive or negative number, MtGox has a disproportionate influence on the value of bitcoin. Even as calls for market tracking sites to omit MtGox from their figures, the other exchanges still follow whatever trend MtGox has going on at the time.
You can argue about whether or not their influence is legitimate, rational, or good for bitcoin - but it's silly to pretend they don't have substantial influence over the general public's perception of bitcoin, which in turn drives market trends. MtGox is where mass media looks for bitcoin headlines. If the price on MtGox shot up, even if the cause were some system error, the rest of the market would follow suit.
That control is worth a fortune.

SHA256 is not used exclusively by bitcoin, and bitcoin would be able to adapt to another system quickly - other legacy systems using it would be slower to adapt, and would be far more attractive targets in every possible attack scenario.

To me, the most interesting part of this is their justification for it: Specifically, to protect their own national currency.
Not because they think it will facilitate otherwise illicit activity. Not because they think it poses a security risk, or puts citizens' own finances at risk. Their openly stated justification for banning bitcoin is "if we don't ban it, people will use it instead of our money."

It's big, and it's certainly a cash cow, but it's hardly their primary interest.
Now here's a question to ponder: What if, for some bizarre reason, Target decided to become an over-the-counter bitcoin exchange, replacing their Red Card program with pre-loaded plastic bitcoin wallets, and charging some percent above market value as a profit margin.
Suddenly, more than 1,700 physical stores become over-the-counter exchanges - no registration, no setup, no need to arrange a meeting time, just "I go to a store, pay them dollars, and I get BTC."

Alright, take it from someone who has never ridiculed bitcoin: The community needs to adapt.
Bitcoin will not achieve optimal results so long as it is presented as an ideological stance in an economic revolution. The more we marry bitcoin to a specific political position, the more we alienate those who would be receptive to the technical merits, but oppose the political stance which represents it.
Bitcoin suffers if it is presented to the public as an us-or-them, down-with-the-man political rally. It mobilizes forces which have far greater control over mainstream perception and attitudes, and directs them against bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a communication protocol. The thing which it communicates, securely, is value. Users can confidently count on it to behave in specific ways. They can rely on its security, so long as they do not compromise their own security. They can use it to inexpensively transfer funds across arbitrary distances, semi anonymously, and without waiting for approval from an outside party.
These are not inherently political features. They have the effect of undermining one aspect of global banking, but global banking primarily thrives on interest on debt, not transfer fees.
*Everybody* needs to adapt as bitcoin grows, especially those who already accept it. We know the adjustment the public will go through, by definition - but we don't fully know what the public will necessarily bring into the equation. Of course we need to adapt. Bitcoin itself is built to be adaptive.

Sorry that I misunderstood which coins you were referencing.
For the record, though, the case against DPR is a criminal case - but the case against the SR coins themselves was a civil case. The forfeiture case is independent of the human defendant's case. The government actually files a suit against the seized property itself, to the effect of "Your current ownership is legally invalid, so we are revoking that ownership."
Criminal forfeiture would be assets which are actively being used to commit a criminal act - the gun a robber uses when he tries to hold up a convenience store, for instance. In those instances, it doesn't matter what happened prior to the current owner's ownership, nor how they obtained it themselves: In criminal forfeiture, the asset is a clear component of the accused's crime.

Secure mobile bitcoin wallets should be dumb devices. They should be offline, with no potential for an attack vector. They should only accept input in the form of QR codes and hardware buttons, and they should only output in the form of visual displays.
For a truly secure mobile wallet, you'd also need a separate online device. The two would work together like this:
1. Offline device displays spending address in QR-code format.
2. Online device reads spending address status and coin inputs from blockchain.
3. Online device displays that data in QR-form (Unless requested transaction amount exceeds spending wallet's balance)
4. Offline device reads wallet status data.
5. Online device displays requested transaction data (destination address and amount).
6. Offline device reads requested transaction data.
7. Offline device prompts user to approve or decline requested transaction.
8. If accepted, offline device signs transaction.
9. Offline device displays signed transaction data in QR code format.
10. Online device reads signed transaction and broadcasts it.
Sure it sounds complicated, but from the user's perspective this would be comparable to the steps involved in scanning a credit or debit card at a POS terminal.
Any more sophisticated data input/output would introduce vulnerability to attack. Input needs to be limited to known formats and types of data.

The email client is parsing it as month/day/year (or day/month/year), but I've personally encountered this on multiple occasions with international correspondence: Somewhere in between the sender and the receiver, something reported the date with the values in an unexpected sequence. Sometimes this happens because something in between is misconfigured, and sometimes it's because something on the sender's end is just poorly designed and doesn't conform to international standards.
Occam's razor says this is just a difference in date formats, and Hanlon's razor says it's likely because someone screwed up - but even if it were intentional date falsification, this is quite possibly the *least* interesting and newsworthy part of the whole "Satoshi's email got hacked" story.

In order, you need to get in immediate contact with:
1. A good accountant, to ensure that you dot all the i's and cross all the t's for financial purposes.
2. A good lawyer, because someone who has known you at some point in your life is going to find out you're rich now, and decide that they just might have a decent shot at suing you for something silly.
3. A travel agent. Book a vacation. Be unavailable for a while.
Do not cash it all out. Do cash some of it out into something secure, but spendable. See if you can obtain a guaranteed annuity for a portion of it, over a period of 20 or more years. Pay off *all* your existing debt, including your mortgage (if you have one).
Whatever fiat you cash out into, take it to a credit union. You should be able to get a checking/savings account which pays some token amount of interest in addition to having the convenience of a debit card for everyday purchases.
Before you go nuts with the shopping sprees, take a careful look at your living space - specifically, how much (or little) space you actually have. If you are renting someplace small, plan carefully for how much living space you actually need to be comfortable. *Do not gamble.* Even if you initially obtained that amount through gambling, walk away, you are ahead.
Try to remain as incognito as possible, but when word inevitably gets out, be prepared for a barrage of begging from friends and family. How you handle that is your business, but keep in mind the question "If I lost everything tomorrow, would I regret burning this bridge?"
Lastly, try to ignore every deposit address anyone tries to put in front of your face unless you are intentionally trying to give them money in the first place.

It just occurred to me: She's provably either lying or insane.
The way she tells it, her investigative team went through all their candidates and whittled it down to Dorian, and actively looked for any reason why he might not be Satoshi. She describes a sense *wanting* to find a reason, any reason, which would eliminate him as a candidate.
But that would mean that when they had exhausted all other options, they kept searching *on the basis that they believed they might find a reason to remove him as a candidate.* Which, in turn would mean that they either:
* Believed that their list of candidates was probably incomplete, or
* Believed that *nobody* was Satoshi.

I understand the risks in your use case. I do not believe that they are substantial risks in my intended use case. A vulnerability to BIP038 would become evident fairly quickly, and would only threaten my security if I had taken a photograph of the private key with &gt;~ 70% of the encrypted key visible in the frame, *and* did so on a compromised device.
If the vulnerability isn't found for years, the credit card itself will likely have expired, providing me a good opportunity to transition to a new cold wallet of the same format.
If the concern is unknown vulnerabilities, I don't see a reason this would apply moreso to BIP038 as opposed to SHA-256, which would present a much greater immediate threat (though one which could be contained after an update to the protocol).
SHA-256 may have vulnerabilities. They are not known. Since all probabilities are non-zero, and converge to 1 over time, that means that, no matter how improbable the existence of a vulnerability to SHA-256, it will always be more vulnerable as time goes on.
I appreciate you taking the time to explain this in a level-headed manner to me, though. We're probably pretty high up in ivory tower territory, considering the major financial vulnerability here is physically swiping your card through a POS terminal.

Here's what it did:
* Associated Bitcoin with two well established, successful, and still viable brands - one of which became a huge financial boon to early adopters.
* Trivialized MtGox's negative impact on the bitcoin ecosystem in general.
* Contrasted the accountability MtGox now faces against the complete absence of accountability Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs are held to.
* Emphasized that this was a failure of a single service provider, not of bitcoin.
* Directly described bitcoin as money, more than once.
* Mocked the technologically illiterate.
* Compared Goldman Sachs to Iran in terms of nuclear weaponry.
* Made the very name of Goldman Sachs seem toxic, based on the public reaction to their investment in Dong Energy.
* Closed on the idea that bitcoin isn't evil, and that's probably why people have trouble accepting the idea of it as money.
* Associated confidence in bitcoin with confidence in the internet in general.
* Made jokes which assumed the longevity of bitcoin, and not as the punchline.
What it didn't do:
* No nerd shaming.
* No mockery bitcoin as a concept.
* No declaring the death of bitcoin.
* No skepticism of the value of bitcoin.
* No questioning of the legality of bitcoin.
* No implication that bitcoin itself is a tool for money laundering or purchase of illegal goods.
* No implication of governments banning bitcoin.
Basically, it made bitcoin look like a good guy, and made established banking look cartoonishly evil. The whole joke was "hey, bitcoin, you're too nice. You need to be really corrupt and harmful before anyone considers you to be *real* money."

How do you prove something like this? What would the evidence look like? "Here's a bitcoin transaction of the payment?" That's not proof of anything other than the movement of bitcoins. Printout of the invoice? Oh, look, paid by check. I don't see the bitcoins. Voicemail from the dealership? That could be anyone and/or he said nothing about bitcoins.

Just humor me for a moment: Imagine a business existed which actually had a dedicated customer base who thought they were an awesome company. How would they communicate this?
It's like we can't conceive of a company with happy customers. "Tried snapcard, it worked, they're nice guys." There's not a lot to elaborate on there. SnapCard's basic characteristics are:
* Buy things with bitcoin that you wouldn't normally be able to buy with bitcoin
* Get friendly, direct interaction from the staff
Seriously, that's pretty much the extent of their strategy. *They do the thing they advertise*, and they go out of their way to be friendly and open about it. Reviews of their service are all going to pretty much be "Bought a \_\_\_\_ with snapCard, guys were super friendly, awesome experience," because *sweet tapdancing zombie T-Rex* that's what they do. When people say "these guys are friendly," they don't mean "had a polite interaction with a call center monkey." They mean, "these guys are practically chummy, but it somehow didn't come off as phoney." That, in itself, is a surprising, almost disorientating experience which is difficult to articulate without sounding insincere.

Good news attracts interest from outsiders who are new to bitcoin. They try to buy, but mostly get caught up in verification delays before whatever sites they try to use will validate their accounts.
Bad news rattles people who already own bitcoins. These people already have the ability to buy and sell, and if they're panicking, they sell, immediately.

Push transactions (payment initiated by the sender) versus pull transactions (payment initiated by the recipient).
When you pay with a credit card, you give the merchant all the information needed for them to take money from your account. There is no direct mechanism to prevent them from withdrawing too much, or multiple times. Your bank/credit card company might have fraud prevention policies, but these are based around social modeling and customer profiling. They will only catch fraudulent charges which appear out-of-character for you.
When you pay with bitcoin, you sign a transaction which is transmitted to the blockchain, authorizing the movement of funds from one address to another. You do not share or transmit any information which could be used to start another payment transaction, and the payment amount can't be changed without invalidating the transaction.
Credit cards are designed in a way which almost directly encourages fraud. Bitcoin is designed specifically to prevent this form of fraud.

Email did not harm UPS or FedEx. Banking is not merely a matter of storing and transferring money. Bitcoin has no equivalent of interest-paying savings or lending, and these are key aspects of banking.
But regardless of the probable effect on banking: If you come up to someone and say "hey, try this thing so we can kill banks," most people will want to avoid you.
It's not that I think bitcoin won't have an effect on banking. I don't even consider it impossible that bitcoin might truly kill fiat banks - there are no 0% probabilities, after all - but you won't win widespread public support if you campaign on that point as an ideological stance.
Most people don't want ideological reasons to try bitcoin. They want *practical* reasons.

If Food Lion actually sold digital giftcards online, that would be exactly how it would work:
1. You would take a snapshot (using snapCard's bookmarklet) of the digital giftcard item page on Food Lion's site, and include a comment specifying the dollar amount of the card.
2. SnapCard would prepare to purchase the card, then generate a bitpay invoice for you, including any taxes or fees Food Lion might tag on.
3. SnapCard would send you that invoice.
4. You would pay that invoice.
5. SnapCard would purchase the giftcard.
6. Food Lion would send you the giftcard.
The trick here is that Food Lion doesn't appear to sell digital giftcards for their own store.
That said, I was able to successfully obtain a physical Kroger giftcard this way, so it would come down to how long you can wait to use the giftcard.

~~Try transcoding a video a couple of times at 90% of its previous size. The difference is pretty noticeable. When you stream video at a lower bitrate than it originally was, you're re-compressing video data which was already compressed. Each time you do that, you lose more quality than you would have if it had been originally encoded at the smaller bitrate. It's not a matter of what device I'm talking about - It's all my devices, full stop. Any arbitrary device. So long as it's got the pixels, it will be displaying the same quality video.~~
~~My use case does not involve transcoding. I just copy a file onto a device. For me, using my tools, file management is every bit as simple and straightforward as navigating any tivo-like streaming interface.~~
~~But this is all tremendously academic. The discussion point I raised was that, even if you do stream it, you're still using the same, or close to the same amount of bandwidth as if you just had a local copy. For your use case, apparently that makes sense. For mine... that's just not practical.~~

Regardless of your identity, I am pleased with the course this conversation took. I would like to add, though:
I'll admit, it made a lot of sense back when you were doing short quirky vignettes of when you were only a lad, and returning to that innocence just once or twice is good for your soul - but I've heard critics cite it as chief among your nasty habits. Elfman's music generally suits your films well, but also has a tendency to stray into weird, science-fiction tones, whereas your films tend to be more snapshots of insanity - arguably, pictures of you and your own state of mind.
Of course, you're not my slave, and you may be asking yourself, "What do they want from me? They should butt out, this is my private life." To an extent, you're right, but people are not islands, and it's not too outrageous to want an artist to avoid stagnation. As fans, we close our eyes to faults and flaws, and try to believe that things won't get out of control. When the lights go out in the theater, we hope to see a perfect system of storytelling and cinematography - not a vain sacrifice to capitalism and glory. Be a little sympathetic to your fans. Stay true to your identity as an artist, and ask yourself honestly, "Am I the same man I was before?"
It's easy for me to critique, since I'm on the outside, and what I see as well intended advice might be what you see as a pain in the posterior. Do I, as a fan, even have the right to ask about your motives? Do I have the right to know?
Everybody needs some assurance in their entertainment, from the cool city-slicker to the lowliest insects. We don't want our art to be uniformly dull and grey. Matter of fact, we prefer fun distractions before our news turns to war again. We want to see Tokyo smashed by giant reptiles, and samurai doing battle with ninjas.
You know, looking back at the above paragraphs, I never intended the point to get lost like this. Last time I rambled on like this so late at night, I had to take the whole day off from work the next day. When I wake up and go back to read my sleep deprived writings, it only makes me laugh.

It's not like I can change you.

I don't really see any benefit to attempting to provide proof-of-purchase. It's virtually guaranteed to result in a moving goalposts argument.
"Here's the transaction!"
"That just shows that someone moved this amount of coins around."
"Here's a picture of me with the thing."
"Assuming that's you, this just shows that you were in physical proximity of the thing."
"Here's my receipt!"
"Here's mine from where I purchased the Death Star from Unicron, the planet that eats other planets. See where it says I paid in rainbows and kitten farts? Not convinced."
Etc. Most of the time, even direct communication with the merchant won't be enough, because they won't have had any direct bitcoin interaction. All they *might* be able to say is that someone else paid for the such-and-such which was purchased by so-and-so, but they're probably not going to be able to connect that person with the reddit account used to post the "I bought a such-and-such with snapCard" testimonial.
Now, I agree that the testimonials tend to have a very similar tone to them - and I think I know why.
The whole "Brand X was just great! I tried it, it worked, and it was wonderful!" style of advertising wasn't purely the invention of advertising executives - it was, at one point, actually how people would describe remarkably positive experiences. Even well into the late '90s, that kind of testimonial still held some value.
Then came the era of "Please post feedback!" reviews. "5/5 Great seller, would buy again AA+++++" reviews diluted the perceived value of strongly positive testimonials - but we *expect* disproportionately positive reviews of service that's merely adequate.
Yanni and the rest of the snapCard crew throw this out-of-whack by actually providing amazing support. They have treated every single one of my orders with all the enthusiasm that a luxury resort would extend to a VIP guest, and I haven't even spent what most people would consider a significant amount with them. Any time I submitted something their system wasn't (at the time) designed to handle, they worked with me to figure out a way to make it happen, and they've always left an impression of enthusiasm, friendliness, and sincerity.
On the internet, when someone says "amazing service," it has about the same weight as "hello." Words are wind. Hassle-free service and courtesy - even fake courtesy - are expected, especially when the business looks polished and professional. The kind of customer support provided by snapCard is startling.
It isn't that the testimonials are poorly written ad-copy. It's just that, being surprised by such a positive experience for such a straightforward service leaves a lot of people kind of dumbstruck. When they try to describe it, they gush. They actually are as happy as fake reviews pretend to be. They're the thing those fake reviews try to look like.

A lone cosmologist at one end of the bar has a few femtoseconds of surprise before the bar collapses into a gravitational singularity as the combined mass of an infinite number of mathematicians in a finite space almost instantly brings the bar's diameter below its Schwartzchild radius. Due to its infinitely strong gravitational pull, the singularity begins to pull every piece of matter towards it at the speed of light. The sudden collision of every existing piece of matter in existence (inclusive of the infinite combined mass of the mathematicians) at relativistic speeds triggers an immense release of kinetic energy, blasting every particle in the singularity away from every other particle. The particles evenly disperse across the whole of the empty void of the now dead universe. 3.2e16 years later, they begin to coalesce into planets.

Well, consider for a moment that you're talking about something over 100 years in the future. So the question is, what will bitcoin circulation look like in 2140?
If circulation has stabilized, there will be a slight deflation due to permanently lost coins, but it's doubtful it will kill spending.
If circulation is dead, the matter is moot anyway.
So really, it only becomes an issue when adoption is rapidly increasing - but even then, the deflationary spiral is self defeating, for two reasons:
1. People have poor impulse control. No matter how quickly the value might rise, there are a lot of people who want or need things now more than they care about more value later.
2. The free market at play: When the value reaches a point people are willing to accept, they will spend, which then counters the problem.

Putting an antenna on a device automatically means that the device is capable of transmitting and/or receiving data without the user's awareness or intention.

My apologies: My understanding of a cold-storage wallet was basically that of a long-term storage vault, independent of whether you transitioned to another device or not. As in, years later, even if you've neglected to import your address book from a previous device, you still have the deposit address recorded in case you need to send additional coins into your "vault." Put simply: I had only considered a cold-storage wallet in the context of "my private safe-deposit box, with deposits coming from me and me alone." I did not consider the idea of someone else depositing to my cold-storage wallet within that context.
You (and others, judging by the voting on my comments) apparently envision a different usage of cold-storage. I apologize for not recognizing this sooner.


While I understand the additional risk of revealing the card number within the use case you describe, isn't this an argument against the very existence of cold storage itself? If the concern is malware on the phone, your cold-storage key is compromised as soon as you scan it anyway, regardless of whether it's printed on a credit card or some other surface.

Private keys aren't money either. They are an authentication mechanism for a decentralized payment system using a unit of value which is also widely regarded as "not money."
Put another way: For any other commodity, currency, or value-declared item, if you search the individual long enough and invasively enough, you can eventually determine the quantity being held without the need to reference any other source.
If someone is "traveling with bitcoins," you have to reference an external entity - the up-to-date blockchain. Without internet connectivity, the balance can't be known. More to the point, the balance could easily change without any effect whatsoever on the storage medium holding the private keys. You don't have your bitcoins with you any more than you have the entire catalog of Netflix videos "with you." You have a device which, when connected to the internet, verifies a balance of value units noted within a persistent public record, which is itself maintained on thousands of other devices.

I think it's a branding move. PayPal obviously can't make bitcoin *officially* their thing with trademarks and the like, but they can establish the impression that they are the proper name in bitcoin payments, and that anyone else is just a lesser imitator.
When you think of flavored gelatin desserts, facial tissues, or cottony swabs, you probably think Jell-O, Kleenex, and Q-Tip, respectively. Anyone can make those things, and can meet or exceed their quality on every quantifiable metric - but the brand persists. I think that's what PayPal's going for. I think they want to become so deeply engrained that other businesses consider it more practical to just use their service than to create or support a competing service.

It means that the private key and public key are enough to receive coins and at assert control over coins you receive, but to actually send from that address, you need to in some way identify the specific coins you want to spend. This is done by identifying the path those coins took from their creation up until you got them.
Wallet software does this automatically, but the point is that transactions are more sophisticated than just "move this quantity to this address."

When you pay someone with a credit card, you're taking it on trust that they'll only charge you once, and only for the amount you were expecting. Since credit card transactions are initiated by the recipient, and the recipient is directly given the only piece of information needed to initiate further transactions, every payment requires a great deal of trust.
With bitcoin, transactions are initiated by the sender, not the recipient. The publicly shared information cannot be used to initiate further transactions. The amount transferred cannot be tampered with. Each individual transaction requires little to no trust.
That said: Your funds are only as secure as you are personally.

Yes, but wallet software doesn't generally display embedded messages.

Magic: The Gathering cards come in several types, but in terms of this video, only the two general types matter: Cards which do things (be it monsters which attack, spells or enchantments, artifacts, etc.), and land cards, which are basically battery cells to power the other cards. It's great to have lots of land cards - but useless if you don't have anything to use them with.
This gentleman stated he had 17 such land cards in his deck, and that he had drawn 14 of them - Meaning he hadn't been able to do anything useful for most of the game. Regardless of his opponent's skill level, he was a punching bag. He was powerless to defend himself, and his anger reflects that.
Magic is a game in which players meticulously plan and customize their deck of cards around their own personal playstyle and strategy. He probably had spent hours refining his deck to optimal performance, only to have it catastrophically fail in a tournament setting.

The complications with setting up that kind of rule for the automated address are:
1. The rules for a given address, once defined, would have to be permanent and immutable.
2. Any updates to the protocol would have to support legacy automated rule definitions.

Not quite sure what you mean here, but basically, they had just shy of 30,000 bitcoins which they sold in lots of 3,000 (one lot having less, since it wasn't an even 30k).
The sale took the form of a sealed bid auction, meaning each bidder only knew what their own bid was, and could only bid once on each batch of coins. Bids were accepted via post shortly after the sale was announced, and last Friday, bidders were able to submit bids online.
The controversy (if it can be called that) was the fact that they decided to go with such large blocks, making this a high-rollers only event. As is usually the case with forfeiture auctions, bidders had to pay a deposit just for the ability to bid - a $200,000 deposit.


A parody/troll account, mocking Mark Karpeles, the man in charge of the catastrophically failed MtGox exchange. Mark Karpeles is seen by the bitcoin community as something between a phenomenally incompetent scam artist, and an embarrassingly incompetent businessman who refused to acknowledge when he was in over his head. Karp Markeles says things to annoy bitcoin, and particularly picks on people who lost money when MtGox melted down.




SecondMarket acted as a go-between for people who would never be able to participate directly in the auction, bidding on their behalf. Interested buyers would send in their bids, SecondMarket would take the highest bids adding up to ~~$3,000~~ 3,000 BTC, and that would be SecondMarket's bid on one block.
SecondMarket had previously mentioned some numbers indicating strong interest - which suggests that at least some of SecondMarket's customers were bidding high. So, if SecondMarket submitted a high bid on each block, and lost on each block, the winning bid must therefore be higher.
The question on everyone's mind is "What were the winning and losing bids?" We don't know that yet.
[**EDIT**] Bids adding up to a full block of coins, not a mere $3k.

It may offend the bleeding edge sensibilities of some enthusiasts, but really, we should hold onto QR codes as a means of communication between bitcoin wallet programs. In fact, we might want to standardize them as the primary means of communication, for one simple reason: They're too low-tech to be used as an attack vector.
Any form of direct communication (wireless or hard-linked) opens the potential for a backdoor. No matter how secure it may be, the fact is that you cant know the exact bytes sent and received without careful packet-by-packet monitoring and analysis.
With a QR code, there is no way to trigger an overflow, create an error to execute arbitrary code, ping for unauthorized data, or otherwise poke, prod, and explore a device illicitly. QR codes are inherently restricted to a very limited set of bytes, and the data read from a QR code is either decoded for display, or discarded (if it doesn't decode properly).
QR codes are a *very* safe means of communication for bitcoin.

There is no reasonable context in which the CEO of PayPal could have meant anything other than "adding bitcoin as something people can use to fund their PayPal accounts."

Exchanges facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers. If they're above-the-board, their primary source of revenue is from transaction fees. They aren't considered to "own" the coins being bought &amp; sold.
Coinbase itself (currently) buys and sells directly to their customers. As a result, their pricing is based off analysis of other sites' market rates. As a result of *that*, buyer/seller activity on Coinbase is not directly represented in market graphs, and Coinbase sometimes has to delay or cancel transactions because their own reserves can't keep up with demand.
Coinbase is essentially a broker. If they were suddenly slammed with a ton of buy orders, it wouldn't have the same market effect as if those buyers went to the open market. By becoming an exchange, they are more directly participating in market valuation of bitcoin, and (most noticeably) would no longer have to delay transfers over several business days.

*Riffle* shuffle it on average 7 times.

I dislike the direct association of bitcoin with any political ideology. Frankly, I find the "bitcoin will kill banks and governments, yay" sentiment to be more harmful to adoption than anything else.
There's a tendency to put merchants on the spot and depict bitcoin as an ideological revolution - which is tremendously off-putting. Presented as a technology - you can accept electronic payments securely, with much lower transaction fee overhead, and never be at risk of a chargeback - bitcoin is appealing to any business, regardless of their political leaning.

That's not the only problem with my calculations above, though. OP asserts that 4TB could hold 2 years of transactions. According to their [fourth quarter 2015 report]( Visa processed 71.9 billion transactions for the 2015 calendar year. With 31,536,000 seconds per year, that works out to about 2,280 transactions per second.
As far as I can tell, the average bitcoin transaction right now is in the range of 550 bytes. If we were operating at Visa's capacity, that would put it at around 1,253,963 bytes per second. Multiplied by 31,536,000 seconds per year, that works out to more than 70 terabytes per year.

The receiving address is just that: A receiving address. You need the private key in order to have any control over the contents of that address. That private key would have been stored by whatever site or wallet application you used to generate that address.
If it's a website, you'll almost certainly need a password. If it's a local application you were running, there should be a wallet.dat file somewhere on your system which contains your keys. If you re-launch that program, it will automatically load your keys, and let you send from that address to any other address.

This ambiguity largely stemmed from the fact that, in many cultures,  numbers were not expressed as sequences of digits, but rather as combinations of specific value symbols. For example, the Roman numeral expression of 1,200 was MCC - the concept of zero as a component of this value was nonsensical in such a system. If zero were a number, should it be included in all numeric expressions? We normally think of four as "one less than five," but is it actually "one less than five plus zero?"
Eventually, the concept of zero was established as an arithmetic necessity, but early uses were standalone, rather than using it as a digit - this usage was functionally acknowledging the fact that "nothing" is itself a value, which can be the result of an arithmetic operation, and can itself be an operator in an equation with a non-zero result. The earliest known usage of zero as a place-value digit is the [Lokavibhaga]( dated circa 458 AD.

It may actually be clearer to not think of it as a graph, but rather look at a single PubKey's vertical and horizontal slices.
On the vertical slice, you're looking at a single PubKey's outgoing transactions, and the creation time of the reciving PubKey. Anywhere you see concentration indicates that this key has sent many transactions to PubKeys created during this point in time.
On the horizontal slice, you're looking at a single PubKey's incoming transactions, and the creation time of the sending PubKey. Anywhere you see concentration indicates that this key received many transactions from PubKeys created during this point in time.
One thing the graph does not indicate is when the actual transaction occurred.

The system self-balances.
Mining profitability is inversely proportionate to mining difficulty. Increased difficulty means more expensive equipment and operational costs to keep it running.
The more hashing power there is on the network, the greater the difficulty - this is a built-in property of the protocol. If it becomes unprofitable, and people shut down their equipment, the hashing power drops, then the difficulty adjusts, and it becomes easier to mine again. Lower difficulty means greater profitability, so the system will remain in equilibrium.

@_date: 2013-12-30 02:27:00
Oh goody, [I get to talk hard numbers again](
Basically, for each random key you generate, you've got, at best, a one-in-6.9595-decillion (10^33) chance of hitting an address with coins in it (and that's only if every address contains exactly one Satoshi, *and* all 21 million coins have been mined).
The probability of at least one success over the course of multiple attempts is equal to 1-(1-[odds of failure)^([attempts]). Now we just need to figure out a reasonable target probability.
The easiest way to answer the question "If x^y = some target value, what should y be?" is:
log(target value)/log(x)
In this case, our X is 1-(1/6.9595e33). Just to give us a fair shot, let's go for a target probability of 50%.
log(.5)/log(1-(1/6.9595e33)) = [4.82396e33](
Now we turn to physics.
There is an absolute minimum amount of energy required to store one *bit* of information: [2.85e-21 joules]( - that's regardless of whether you intend to keep it that way or not. Storing it in executable memory counts.
So, we've got to generate 4.82396e33 public keys, each of which is 160 bits long - that's a total of 7.718336e35 bits - in order to have a 50% chance of creating *one* collision with the currently-in-use addresses in the world.
7.718336e35 bits * 2.85e-21 joules per bit = 2.1997e15 joules required to have a 50% chance of creating *one* collision.
As a basis of comparison, one megaton of explosive force is [4.184e9 joules](
2.1997e15 joules / 4.184e9 joules per megaton = 525,740.92 megatons = 525.74092 **gigatons** of explosive force.
The most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated is [Tsar Bomba]( weighing in at, at most, 58 megatons.
So, how many Tsar Bombas does it take to give you a 50% shot of creating just one public key collision? *Over 9000.*
You'd be using energy equivalent to thousands of the world's most powerful nuclear weapons every time you tried for a 50/50 shot of coming *close* to achieving your goal.
No. This is not a thing we have to worry about.

I think it's great that Humble Bundle started accepting bitcoins, and the prices are excellent, but it's not really the same level of versatility as putting funds directly into your Steam wallet.

I apologize if I misrepresented your position, or sounded accusatory: I agree with many of your points - but if we try to advocate Bitcoin as a "please adapt to our system you don't already understand" kind of thing, we're pretty much doing the banks and money transfer services a favor.
Put simply, over to one side is "accept bitcoin." Over to another side is "do things the way you already do them." The further apart those two points are, the lower bitcoin's survival chances are. I'm advocating the baby step of making those two points as close together as possible, perhaps indistinguishable. Get bitcoin to be widely useful in its current form, without having to proselytize.


It would help our society - but I don't think it will happen, even if the market *does* shift towards widespread bitcoin acceptance. The people who jump in and ask questions like "what if I need to spend less than a whole bitcoin" may sound ridiculously inexperienced to us, but the very fact that they (kind of) know about bitcoins, reddit, and the subreddit, and know how to ask and respond to questions within that subreddit puts them tragically *above* average knowledge compared to the rest of the populace. Put another way: How many people understand fiat?
The point is, if we're aiming for "get them to understand it so they can use it," we're doomed. We should be aiming for "make it easy for them to use it, and help them understand *if they want to know*."

I mean, it's true that the coins you have on coinbase aren't necessarily in what you could call your own wallet, but for purposes of sending and receiving coins, it's functionally identical. Coinbase can create addresses for you to use to add coins, and you can send coins from your coinbase account.
But in terms of buying cards with Gyft, all you need to do is send a specific amount of coins to a given address - which is kind of an essential feature for any exchange or similar site, since you need to be able to transfer your coins out eventually anyway.

Two problems with SteamBits:
1. You can't buy Steam wallet credit, and are limited to the selection of games listed on SteamBits - which is not the full Steam catalog. Not only does it omit hundreds of individual games, it lacks most (if not all - I haven't seen any) of Steam's discounted game bundles.
2. Strictly speaking, SteamBits violates Steam's terms of service. In practical terms, it's pretty unlikely that you'll be in any way penalized for it, but Steam takes a *very* dim view of unauthorized resale of games. If they worked out which account(s) SteamBits was using to obtain the games, according to Steam's terms of service, you would be locked out of any games obtained through them. It's extremely unlikely, but the fact remains, SteamBits is technically against the rules. Buying gift cards through Gyft, then using said gift cards to purchase Steam wallet balance breaks no rules.

No, given that the leadups resemble each other, the obvious, logical conclusion is that they will behave very differently afterwards. Because history rhymes.

So, just to get this straight: Buying 1000 bitcoins prior to the lag spike would have cost around $200,000. At the record high, it could have been sold for $260,000 - $60,000 profit if it was timed carefully.
That spent the value tailspinning until it reached its current level (looks like between $150 and $180, depending on the exchange). Whoever sold those 1000 coins can now buy another 1000 coins for a fraction of their pervious value - which itself might drive costs back up - then trigger *another* panic sell by plunking them down in one batch, correct?
So to manipulate the market, either for profit or simply to destroy bitcoin (which is what banks and companies like Paypal would love to do), the pricetag is less than $1 million.
This is a greater vulnerability than any 51% attack.

It's worth mentioning that the poor scalability of the exchanges have a detrimental effect on clear valuation - new demand is slowed due to account verification delays. When those accounts *do* get verified, they create a surge in demand which was usually caused by events a week or more prior. Existing demand is slowed due to maximum buy limits on the part of the exchanges themselves.
So while "Demand (and supply)" is the correct answer, the thing that's affecting *those* variables is that the exchanges can't keep up with the load.

In the cosmological sense, a black hole is, by definition, a spatial anomaly from which nothing - not even information - can escape.
In practical terms, this really boils down to two counter-intuitive concepts:
1) Information is, in the realm of physics, the observable evidence of any object or event - Since nothing can escape from a black hole, that means that none of the physical mechanisms by which objects and events can be observed will work. You can't see something unless photons bounce off it and return to your retina. The same is true for any mechanism of observation: Some signal must return from the object or event to the observer. No such signals can escape from a black hole, ergo, no information can escape the black hole.
2) At the lowest, most fundamental levels, in the weird femto-cosmic world of quantum physics, matter and information are indistinguishable concepts. The universe is *made* of information. In this context, it is impossible for an object to be observed or otherwise interacted with, *no information exists for that object or event.*
_bc's statement was a technically correct joke. It does not imply that existing data is permanently lost when an instance of that data falls into a black hole. It refers only to hypothetical new information for objects which have fallen into a black hole.

[See this transaction?]( It was payment on a BitPay invoice, including a 1mBTC fee. It took more than half an hour to appear in the blockchain. The invoice timed out.
At the time, the fee was just $0.50, although right now it would have been closer to $1.00 - and yet, it still wasn't sufficient to get the transaction through in time.
And that's really the crux of the problem: Bitcoin is unpredictable. I've had transactions with fees which took *hours* to confirm even once. 


The entities who would want to impose regulation would have absolutely no problem whatsoever with causing a fork. In fact, opponents of bitcoin would probably *want* to create a fork.


In its current form, but has the technological capacity to. Remember, the 51% thing isn't democratic. It's hashing power which costs money - meaning those with more money to buy hashing equipment have more control over the overall network.
Can the US government do it? Maybe. Could the US + the European Union + Japan + China do it together? You betcha. Would they? [They did for copyright laws.]( I'm pretty sure the banks have more influence than the forces behind the Berne Convention.


It is extremely difficult to do, but they could, through a 51% attack - which is exactly what any regulatory body would attempt.


You are now talking about a parallel universe, because pretty much every bank will let you buy a candy bar with your checking account or debit card.


Bitcoin *can* do this, but won't necessarily do it with consistent reliability. Sometimes transactions get clogged up. I've performed approximately 1,200-ish transactions this year, and at least 1% of them stalled.


On the other hand, bitcoin inherently records everywhere your coins came from prior to coming into your possession. That's not going to stay completely anonymous forever.


Your wallet is not an analog to a bank account. Your wallet is an analog to a wallet.


I fully acknowledge those benefits - but in terms of how the average person or business interacts with a bank, those benefits are somewhere between irrelevant and nonexistent. The average person doesn't even think of international wire transfers - they never have a need for them. The average business has exactly one definition of "instant transfer": It means a transfer which *completes* (including all necessary verifications) in an instant. The average person has never had to deal with being blacklisted from getting a bank account. These are great benefits to bitcoin, but they are not deciding factors for the majority of people.
A few years ago, I had to transfer roughly $50,000 to Poland via wire transfer. Between the exchange fees and transfer fees, it would have been easier and cheaper for me to fly to Poland with a briefcase full of cash.
Bitcoin was in its infancy at that point, and wasn't really being taken seriously by businesses - but even if it had been at its current level of maturity, I wouldn't have used it. I can't reliably count on it to arrive quickly. When it does arrive, you either have to rely on an exchange to turn it into liquid assets, or a payment processor, or just keep it in BTC. Exchanges drag their heels. Payment processors frequently hit their bankroll caps. Holding onto it in BTC runs the very high risk of devaluing beyond any other kind of currency exchange rate. Bitcoin *will probably address all of those things eventually* - but it doesn't do it enough yet.
But yeah, you're probably right. I can't really be "in favor" of bitcoin. I mean, it's not like I [wrote a song about the day we hit $1,000]( or [suggested a more readily available means of generating a truly random passphrase]( or [worked out the exact numbers for just how hard it would be to bruteforce private keys]( (including the [odds]( or [gave some away just for the hell of it](

Why? It's how things work with electronic fund transfers for all other foreign currencies.
Let's say I've got a Visa debit card tied to my bank account. My account contains USD. I travel to Japan, and buy things with my Visa debit card (this is possible, I've done it, it's not even remotely remarkable). The merchant receives payment in the form of JPY. Visa/My bank uses the current exchange rate at the moment of the transaction to determine how much to deduct from my account, and also charges me a small conversion fee on top of that (less than what I usually pay in sales tax).
You're thinking of BTC as something which should replace the dollar, which is somewhere between *very illegal* and *physically impossible.* BTC isn't going to kill the idea of physical currency. Physical currency is, and always will be, an acceptable form of payment, alongside other transfers of money.
As stated by so many bitcoin advocates, "Bitcoin is like email for money." Email didn't kill paper. Bitcoin isn't going to eliminate physical currency altogether, or kill the idea of the dollar as a unit of currency. Bitcoin should be viewed as the national currency of the virtual world.

The phrase "counterfeit bitcoin" is akin to the phrase "counterfeit prime number." It doesn't make sense, conceptually.
Basically, if you can convince the blockchain that you have successfully created a (block of) bitcoin(s), you haven't counterfeited it: You've created it in the normal, intended way.
Bitcoins are created by solving an extremely complex mathematical equation in which multiple variables are randomized and unknown. The equation always has a unique solution, and a way of checking to see if that solution is correct. When someone finds the correct answer for the current set of data, the whole network double-checks their work: If it's correct, the system records (in a digital ledger which is referred to as "the blockchain") that the answer was found, who found it, and notes that the party responsible for finding it has created some coins.
The blockchain is also self-checking, and you can't just add "I created coins" entries to it willy-nilly. The means by which these records are stored requires the correct current equation solution in order to be recognized as valid data.
If you can get past all that, and manage to get a record in saying that you created a bunch of coins, then you have merely solved the current equation.
Once created, bitcoins only exist as records in the blockchain. The system knows where they were created, and it knows every transaction for them from creation up to the current date. Your wallet.dat file doesn't actually hold your coins: It holds unique, secret values which tell the blockchain which wallet addresses you own and are allowed to spend from.

I'm not sure there would be any need for a webspace just to perform the initial development - but you would probably need most of the following:
* Random number generation based on FM-tuner static would be nice for players which have the hardware - so you'd need documentation for how rockbox samples from the tuner (which is likely to be device-specific), and documentation for how to use that data as a RNG seed
* Otherwise, RNG based on one or more songs stored on the device could work - so mostly the same as the above, just using a binary file instead of the tuner static.
* For true in-the-field practical use, you'd need an algorithm for generating a QR code, as well as display libraries
* Documentation on Rockbox plugin development
* Documentation on private key characteristics
* Documentation on calculating a public key from a private key
* Documentation on calculating an address from a public/private key
* A halfway decent concept for user interface design
* A developing/compiling environment suitable for Rockbox development (there's bound to be a LiveCD for that *somewhere*)

The problem with explaining Bitcoin to a layperson is that you generally have two options:
* Don't explain the specific mathematics involved, and just describe the concept in abstract terms, occasionally punctuated with "which can be verified by math".
* Try to explain SHA256, transaction signatures, the hashing involved in the mining process, deriving a safe public address from a private key, and all the other higher math involved in the whole process.
The average layperson distrusts the first option, since it sounds like you're glossing over important details, and can't process the second option because, frankly, unless you've got a pretty firm grip on cryptography *before* looking at bitcoin, a lot of it seems like out-of-your-league stuff.

In terms of pure technical functionality, your coins aren't "in" a single physical computer at any given moment. Your coins only exist as a trail of records saying when and where they were created, and documenting every transaction they've gone through. That trail of records is stored in the blockchain, which is globally shared across the entire Bitcoin network.
What you *do* store on a flash drive/hard drive/whatever are the private keys which allow you to tell the network "Move this amount of coins to this other address." Those keys are 256-bit strings of data, and can be stored in their pure 256-bit form, or encoded into hex form, or (depending on the software used) other, more easily memorized formats.
In terms of how it works from a user's perspective, think of the blockchain as an enormous room filled with more lockers than there are atoms in your body. Your coins are stored in one (or more) of those lockers.
Because it's so massive, you can't just go to your locker to retrieve coins, then take them to someone else's locker: Doing so would take longer than the current age of the universe, even if you could walk at 300 miles per hour (assuming the occupied lockers are roughly evenly dispersed among the entire array of lockers). So they have a kind of teleporting system which can beam the coins to any other locker instantly.
Your coins are never anywhere other than those lockers, but your key for your locker can be on a thumb drive, printed on a piece of paper, saved to a hard drive, or just something you've memorized. That's the thing you store.
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:52:22
My beef with this: It implies a relationship between quantity of BTC and data size of its composite parts. That may sound trivial, but from the non-technical perspective, that suggests that transferring a large sum of money would take substantial bandwidth, and that your wallet file size would in some way relate to the amount in that wallet. Then you start to get people worried that they'll run out of wallet space, or that their mobile device might only have enough space for a limited number of coins.

You actually kind of touched on part of the topic you're looking for: The bank is instantly transferring the coins within its own system. That may sound trivial, since bitcoin is supposedly instant, but the fact is, bitcoin *isn't* instant. It can be - it has the potential to be - but it currently isn't. Most software won't even let you send coins if there are fewer than so-many confirmations, and that assumes your transaction is even showing up in the blockchain - which doesn't always happen quickly. I've seen transactions take hours to show up.
Since all three of your hypothetical people are just moving coins around within the same bank, the bank can credit the accounts instantaneously, without waiting on the blockchain to do a thing. They know they have the coins. It doesn't matter who has which coins until someone withdraws, at which point they just send it from their multi-address pool of coins.
But on the flip side: Bitcoin loans can only be viable if the interest rate is greater than the price fluctuation over the same period. Right now, a jump of 30% wouldn't really startle anyone who's followed the market for a while - but a 30% interest loan over the same period would be eye-popping from a bank.
Once bitcoin gets to what the banks can consider a stable value, their accountants will run complex equations to figure out probable fluctuations, and they'll set their loan rates at something bigger than the expected variance.

Alternatively: The average distance from Earth to the Moon is approximately 384,400 km. Using the 2.5e8 km Earth-to-Mars figure cited in the original post, that means that, on average, Mars is approximately 650 times as far away as the Moon.
Our "reached the moon" point was not clearly defined, but it seems safe to assume that it was between the $1000 point and the $1250 point (the then-current price of a troy ounce of gold).
So, if reaching the Moon was somewhere between $1000 and $1250 per bitcoin, then the proportionate value for "to the Mars!" would be somewhere between $650,000 and $812,500 per bitcoin. Even at the unexpectedly sudden bursts of growth already experienced by bitcoin, those values won't be reached for more than a year, at least.

Unless there is a logically sound or mathematically demonstrated basis and technique cited, no, it's not theoretical. You're hypothesizing on the effects in the what-if scenario of an unknown theoretical attack. The theoretical attack described in your linked article refers to a known attack which is too costly to implement, not an unknown attack with undefined methods.

So you're intending to sit and watch alongside the person who attempts to crack the password, waiting until they finish?
Password cracking for wallet files is a brute-force thing: Given the length of the password and likely characters (upper/lower-case letters, numbers, symbols, etc.), the password is cracked by attempting all possible passwords of that length, with those characters.
Even with high-performance, multi-core cloud computing services (such as those used by Wallet Recovery Services) this can take *days.*
Unless you know your password is short and simple, you're going to have to either leave the person alone with the file at some point, or be prepared to lock yourself in a room with them for up to 72 hours or more.

Well, let's see... It's estimated that there's about $10.5 trillion in actual, spendable money in existence (only about 3.5 trillion of which exists in physical currency - see, the dollar was doing virtual currency before it was cool!), so I'd say that's the upper-bound limit for a single Satoshi. I don't think it would be mathematically possible for the value of the smallest currently divisible unit of bitcoin to exceed that $10.5 trillion mark, unless they inflate the dollar to Zimbabwe levels - in which case, there is no upper bound limit, and the price of a loaf of bread is expressed in scientific notation.

I'm not sure I follow your math here. You're saying 1% wouldn't join your pool but 5% would, and somehow that gives you a 51% hashrate?
But in terms of pure game theory: If any other entity attempted this, it would be a war of attrition which would be a deadlocked stalemate until all other parties went broke.
But even then, an external party wouldn't need to necessarily get 51%. They just need to keep you from getting there yourself. So as you approach majority, external parties would be aggressively throwing top-end mining equipment onto the network. So then that becomes another war of attrition.
So, let's assume you've come out on top of both battles there. The number of miners grows daily, so you need to get ~50% of *their* hashrate too.
Short story: This plan defeats itself.

If you believe that, you and I are incapable of effective communication. I have asserted nothing of the kind. I like bitcoin. I use bitcoin. I *do* believe that it's vastly superior to banks as a means of moving money around *when it works properly* (Which it does at least 99-ish% of the time).
But most of that superiority is largely academic to the general public, and its stability will need a few more decimal places of nines before it really starts to get mainstream-walk-into-a-grocery-store-and-pay-the-store-with-bitcoin-and-not-a-giftcard-you-just-purchased-with-bitcoin acceptance.
You don't need to demonize banks in order to make bitcoin appealing. The more you do so, especially in ways which people might know to be flatly false from their own direct experience, the more likely they are to distrust your position.
Trying to equate a bitcoin wallet with a bank account is stretching the point pretty far. They are not the same creature at all. Perhaps it would be fair to compare them to a safe deposit box, or a reloadable giftcard, but a bank account has federally mandated guarantees against loss, and bank-backed policies against fraud and identity theft.
Making good on FDIC insurance may require a lot of red-tape, and it will only go so far, but it's better than nothing. The banks may not do a great job of consistently enforcing their anti-fraud/anti-identity theft policies, but they do better than half the time. Those things don't make banks good, but they do make bank accounts a completely different species of creature from a bitcoin wallet.
You want to win people over to bitcoin, leave banks out of the conversation. Bitcoin isn't a bank. Your wallet isn't a bank account. Bitcoin is currency, and your wallet is a currency-holder. Emphasize that, and the benefits that brings, but don't try to compare it to a bank. It's a shaky comparison to start with, and it gets worse when people start raising the subject of virtually anything else banks do other than money transfers.

Their site is pretty barebones, and could benefit from a few layout tweaks here and there (their shopping cart especially needs a sortable list view, and the ability to click an order to review/edit its details), but it is still *extremely* useful in its current form.
One thing I should point out: The ordering bookmarklet is currently geared almost exclusively around physical products, but I was able to easily place (and complete) multiple orders for digital goods. The most important detail is to add a note stating the email address to send the item as a gift to.
Short version: Use this service. It's simple, and it works.

Actually, even cold-storage coins could be tainted. There's no reason they wouldn't apply the criteria all the way to the first block, meaning any coins which have ever passed through a wallet connected to illegal activities would instantly get flagged. Day 1, tons of coins, both in active circulation and cold storage, would be tagged as tainted.
Later on, if they eventually determine that a cold-storage coin you already own existed in a criminal wallet at any prior time, *that* would be tainted as well.
The only coins which would be conclusively safe are the ones which you yourself personally mine - even the transaction fees would be at risk.

I'm far more trusting than that fellow, but having a handy source of random, offline data is pretty convenient.
Really, what I'd eventually like to see is a plugin for [Rockbox]( which accepts a number of different types of random input at the user's discretion, such as:
* FM tuner (if present - many Rockboxable devices have one)
* Microphone (same)
* Manual input of characters (cumbersome with many mp3 interfaces, but doable)
* Manual input of card-deck sequence (13x4 grid of cards, click to select the highlighted card as the next in the sequence - this interface would double as a form of error checking, since each card could only be selected exactly once)
And then, as icing on the cake, make it capable of displaying readable QR codes for deposit and/or key export to a wallet app on a separate device (assuming the device has a high enough resolution display - the Sansa Clip/Clip+ series might be pushing it, but the ClipZip is sufficient from my tests).
Boom. Cheap MP3 player to secure, offline, random key generator and address calculator.

Pretty much all of them. They can't really do regular memberships for subscription services, but if you shop on a site which uses any kind of "add to cart" process, that works fine.
The bookmarklet doesn't always detect the price with 100% accuracy (I'm not sure what field it looks at on Steam's product pages for instance), but it's manually editable, and the Snapcard folks will charge you according to the correct amount when the order goes through, even if you submit your order with an incorrect value in the field.
I've ordered games off of GOG, music off of Bandcamp.com, and a copy of Starbound during the pre-order stage, all of which went through just fine. For digital goods, I'd recommend adding notes to the effect of "Please gift to \_\_\_\_", filling in the blank with your email address.

Let's take a look at a hypothetical Bob:
Bob has never heard of bitcoin. He hears really great news about it, and gets interested in buying in. He looks around and finds a few exchanges. He registers, and *thud* runs smack into a verification delay.
Some arbitrary period of time later, Bob is finally verified and happily buying - and so are millions of other Bob's who all got in at roughly the same time. The price rapidly climbs in response to good news from days or weeks ago.
But now, bad news comes in. This doesn't attract any *new* Bobs. All the existing Bobs look at the bad news and their buying *immediately* slows. There's no verification delay because bad news primarily affects existing Bitcoin users.
To summarize: Value increases with adoption rate - but adoption rate is bottlenecked by exchange verifications. Value decreases based on the behavior of people who are already verified on exchanges.

This came up in another similar conversation before, and I'll repeat what I said there:
That's exactly how it works when you perform an electronic transfer of funds in any foreign currency. I live in the US. My finances are almost exclusively in USD. I have a debit card which functions as a Visa card, which I can use *anywhere in the world.* There is no onus on the merchant to accept USD. My money is seamlessly converted to local currency on-the-fly by a payment processor, at a fee.
I love bitcoin, but I fear that its advocates tend to think of it as a thing which merchants must adapt to accept, rather than adapting payment systems so that the merchants don't have to do a thing. I want Bitcoin to be the USB of currency, not the Esperanto of money. It should be something which works with the way businesses already work, not force them to feel like they need to choose ideological sides in some abstract economic/political revolution.
Businesses just want to make money. Trying to teach them a new definition of money is impractical and unnecessary, when the means already exist to adapt your system to *meet* their definition of money.

Right. One of the major points with bitcoin is that it's global. You don't get the "It's a Wonderful Life" crash on the Savings and Loan, because the exchange isn't just operating in Bedford Falls, and it isn't the only place to do business. The exchange is everywhere, and so are all the other exchanges, and they all do business slightly differently.

Bitcoin regulation is inevitable. The scope of the regulation is the only question right now.

I'll give Target the benefit of the doubt: The lack of details regarding the nature of the leak, and the wide timespan involved (Nov. 27th through Dec. 13th) tells me that it was almost certainly an inside job, and pretty definitely wasn't just a quick database dump of a table full of credit card numbers. This was an ongoing process.
Given that, it's entirely possible that the person responsible actually had access to, and control over, the POS terminal software responsible for processing transactions.

The trickiest part is concisely explaining how to verify signatures in an OS-agnostic way. From there, almost everything else is pretty easy.
And they wouldn't have to download from GitHub at all. PPF patching means you (specifically "you, bitcoinpaperwalletguy", not just a general "you, the user") could take your custom-made liveCD iso, run it (along with the original version it's based off of) through a patch generator, and come out with a small, easily distributed file which converts the official liveCD iso into a BitcoinPaperWallet liveCD iso. There are numerous tools which do this, although that introduces another layer of trust. I think there's at least one CD-burning application which includes this as an on-the-fly feature, though.
Writing instructions for setting up a VM seems a bit overkill, frankly. The kind of person who is likely to feel the need for that level of protection very probably already does it as a matter of routine.
Honestly, what is the VM meant to protect against anyway? If the attacker can falsify the download link, they can falsify the checksums and signatures. If they can modify the CD-burner's behavior to burn an altered version of the iso, your system is compromised beyond all hope of recovery. Even the software you use to *run* a VM would be suspect at that point.

Try doing the same with bitcoin. Hey, look, a fee.


It's also not universal to all banks. Plenty of banks don't have minimum balance requirements.


You are correct on this point: [I failed to do proper research.](
Just to play devils' advocate: Virtually every type of bank account is currently at least partially some form of credit - Even if you don't utilize that credit. Not that this remotely justifies the scope of the problem, but it's not a *completely* baseless concept.


I don't view them as equal, but it's naive to think that the bitcoin network won't ever blacklist transactions. That's already been discussed quite a bit with regard to the Sheep-fleecer.
The problem is, the banks don't just block transactions because they feel like it (although it may seem that way most of the time). They do so because they fear legal liability for criminal activity. They make stupid judgement calls erring on the side of caution because technology creates new financial complications every day, and conclusively going through the hoops to figure out the exact legal status of any given situation is difficult and time consuming.
When it comes down to it, the overwhelming majority of bank account freezes are due to fear of legal reprisal from the government - and as positive as the senate hearings were, the implication was still that bitcoin would be subject to some form of regulation.
The worst part is, I don't think there's a good solution here: I wish the banks were kept on a tighter legal leash, not a looser one - but the tighter the leash, the more hoops they have to jump through to do anything.


Now you're just being snide. I'm in favor of bitcoin. Even a cursory glance at my comment history will show that. My only argument is that the issues you have with banks are not universal, and that bitcoin doesn't solve all of them like some magic wand.

A better alternative would have to be at least as easy to obtain with fiat as bitcoin, and no matter how superior the alternative, adoption isn't going to be universally instantaneous.
Which means that there will be a period, however short, during which it will be possible to sell BTC for fiat, which you then use to buy BTA (BeTter Alternative).
The exchange rate will quickly shift in favor of BTA, but even if BTC drops to pennies per coin, people will still buy and sell it - not many, but there will still be diehards. So, even at its worst, you'll be able to turn BTC into some nonzero amount of BTA - and the same will be true for EBA (Even Better Alternative), BSA (Better Still Alternative) and TBA (The Best Alternative). The question will just be "how much?"

For the first part: This kind of depends on how you slice the definition of "a transaction" in data terms. [Here's some specs on what data might be present]( and some more on [how that data is formatted]( As you can see, it's a complex question, and the answer is going to vary wildly depending on the nature of the transaction.

@_date: 2013-04-10 03:21:35
I'm not sure I follow here, although I may be vastly misunderstanding how fees work currently. I was under the impression that the fees are added to the "bounty" of solving a full block - ie. 25BTC + whatever transaction fees there are within that block. You're saying that miners can somehow say "I'm going to go after a bunch of lower transaction fee items" and net some of the fees for themselves? I haven't seen anything remotely like that option in any of the mining software I've tried.
But even if the above is true - Wouldn't there be more of an incentive to go after bigger fee transactions, leaving the lower fees in the dust?

Well, I tested it with similar results. A few things that strike me about the site:
* They bill themselves as being a free service, not charging a commission. They host no ads. Ergo, there is no revenue generating factor for them.
* They have absolutely zero Terms of Use or Privacy Policies. So there's no telling *what* they do with the files you sell.
* The payment page queries this Java app: 
This is apparently how it's meant to check whether or not you've paid. The arguments it sends to that script appear to vary (presumably to watch the blockchain for a different address). The script returns what looks like JSON formatted results, but no matter what I feed it, this is what it returns:


So, on the balance: They could just be incompetent (badly formatted arguments for the script, didn't think to bother with a TOS/Privacy Policy), or *very* evil.

As in, "isn't it more likely that someone will crack a specific wallet program's RNG algorithm and seed source, narrowing the field to far fewer results"? Yes, because that's already happened a couple of times with poorly designed RNG algorthms (like the default built into the Android OS). But that's not the question. The question is purely "how much energy, time, and resources would be required to list all possible private key values?"

You use the bookmarklet to basically take a snapshot of a product page on pretty much any website, and their system gives you an invoice in BTC (through BitPay).
You pay the invoice, Snapcard buys the product, and it gets delivered to you either by way of the shipping address you provide to Snapcard, or (for virtual goods) through the merchant's "send as a gift" feature.
Right now, they're not really built with virtual goods in mind, so I'd recommend adding a note to the order saying "Please gift to (your email address)." I've done this several times, and it definitely works, and works quickly.

I hadn't considered that, and the odds are pretty good, actually: These high profile auction houses are often at the beck and call of the wealthy - and bitcoin has made some tech geeks extremely wealthy. These are companies which are accustomed to bending over backwards to accommodate customer needs. So long as they can go through a payment processor to minimize risk due to price fluctuations.
The fact that this eliminates much of their existing risk, while expediting payment in full within the same day (regardless of the whims of the banks involved) is going to be extremely appealing to auction houses which do not normally deal in on-site cash payments.

Competition in the marketplace. Multiple companies could develop their own implementations of a bitcoin note, intended to function as paper currency until the private code is revealed - a process which would necessarily destroy the note, or render its private key useless after being read once (for instance, the private key could be written to a form of memory wafer which disintegrates as soon as it is read).

It seems to me that, apart from the stated agenda, there could only be two other possible agendas for coInvalidation:
* Best case scenario: It's an attempt to devalue tainted coins, then buy them up on the cheap when they become worthless - later cashing in when coInvalidation inevitably goes away, or the standards of what counts as "tainted" get relaxed.
* Worst case scenario: It's an attempt to kill bitcoin outright, creating enough of a headache for merchants and users alike that it is only appealing to diehard fanatics.
In either scenario, mass tainting would simply further those agendas. Even if the stated agenda is the true agenda, mass tainting would be more likely to hurt bitcoin itself than coInvalidation.

[This post]( asserts an average daily growth of 0.6%. Assuming 30-day months for simpler math, 3.5 years is 42 months, which is 1,260 days.
Assuming .6% average daily growth, if you put in $100 today and did nothing else, you would have:
100 * 1.006^1,260 ≈ $187,696.30
Assuming  you did this every month for only 1 year, you would get the above plus each of the following:
* $100.00 * 1.006^1230 ≈ $156,861.47
* $100.00 * 1.006^1200 ≈ $131,092.20
* $100.00 * 1.006^1170 ≈ $109,556.32
* $100.00 * 1.006^1140 ≈ $91,558.36
* $100.00 * 1.006^1110 ≈ $76,517.12
* $100.00 * 1.006^1080 ≈ $63,946.85
* $100.00 * 1.006^1050 ≈ $53,441.64
* $100.00 * 1.006^1020 ≈ $44,662.22
* $100.00 * 1.006^990 ≈ $37,325.09
* $100.00 * 1.006^960 ≈ $31,193.31
* $100.00 * 1.006^930 ≈ $26,068.86
Add those together, and you get a total of $1,009,919.76.
You don't need to put in $100/month for the whole 3.5 years, if the average growth sticks to 0.6% per day.

For the lazy, the number they come up with is 1.41e24 - but the most important part of that whole document isn't the matter of collision, or even the task of generating and searching such a massive amount of data: It's the matter of bitcoin's intrisnic properties.
There will never be more than 21 million (2.1e6) BTC in existence, each of which is divisible into 100 million (1e8) satoshi.
2.1e6*1e8 = 2.1e14
In other words, even if there are 1.41e24 addresses generated, only 2.1e14 could even contain a single satoshi.
Ignore the time, energy, and other barriers to generating all those addresses: Let's say some supergenius superhacker from the superfuture has done that already: 2.1e14 / 1.41e24 = roughly a 1 in 6,714,285,714 of finding an address with money in it.
That's 1.41e24 addresses to get a 50% chance of *one* collision. Each collision gets this supergenius that 1 in 6 trillion chance of finding a satoshi.

Genesis 22:17 - God promises Abraham as many descendants as there are grains of sand on the beach or stars in the sky.
Assume really big grains of sand, 1mm in diameter. That means that 1 cubic meter would hold 1 billion such grains of sand (1,000 x 1,000 x 1,000). A building 10 meters along each side could hold 1,000 such cubes (10 x 10 x 10). You could easily contain a trillion giant grains of sand in a building the size of a house - more if they were regular-sized grains. Any given beach would have vastly more than a trillion grains of sand.
If you added up the total of every human who ever lived, you would fall significantly short of even 1 trillion - and not all of them would be descended from Abraham.
So, if biblical prophecy is to be believed, God would be welching on the promise to Abraham if the end times came for a few more millennia. Abraham's descendants don't come remotely close to being as numerous as "grains of sand on the beach."

Price fluctuation is at least partially a factor of the limited exchanges - which is itself a factor of the public perception that bitcoin is legally ambiguous.

As I understand it, bitcoin's solution is not to send messages, but rather to alter the landscape of the battleground itself - meaning the blockchain.
Messages (transactions) in the blockchain affect the blockchain as a whole - meaning that when A sends a message to B, A can publicly see that B received it. Downside: So can everyone else.

Okay, so from my previous example, let's say all the Bobs decide to include a transaction fee of half a cent - 0.000005 BTC. Do they get the same level of delivery speed as they currently would? Do they get in line behind all the larger transactions with significantly higher transaction fees?
How does the system itself adjust delivery speed based on a decreased transaction fee? If the big buyers are performing not only bigger transactions, but also a lot more transactions than all the incidental payments, how does the system weight the fees? Does it eventually adjust based on a percentage of the overall amount transferred? From a technical perspective, would the system itself be able to say "People are paying an average of .005% in transaction fees, anything above that will be given increased priority, anything below will be given decreased priority"?

You probably got downvoted for not showing your work.
A private key is a 256-bit value, meaning there are approximately 1.1579e77 possible keys (There are about 1.2288e66 *invalid* values, but subtracting them from the full set of values goes beyond the precision we're working with here). 1 trillion = 1e12
1.1579e77 values / 1e12 values per second = 1.1579e65 seconds
60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, approximately 365 days in a year gives us 3.1536e7 seconds per year.
1.1579e65 seconds / 3.1536e7 seconds per year = **3.6717e57 years.**
But wait, there's more!
Each of those 1.1579e77 values will occupy 32 bytes of storage space.
1.1579e77 values * 1.1579e77 bytes per value = 3.7053e78 bytes of data.
[According to WolframAlpha]( there are approximately 1e50 atoms on Earth. Even if you could store 1 byte of data per atom:
3.7053e78 atoms / 1e50 atoms per Earth = 3.7053e28 Earths worth of atoms
Beyond even that: According to [Landeauer's principle]( at room temperature, the absolute minimum amount of energy required to store one bit of information is 2.85e-21 joules.
The mass of the sun is approximately [1.988435e30 kg]( According to general relativity, 1kg of mass will provide you with approximately 1.7867e17 joules of energy (look for a mass-to-energy calculator if you want to double check this).
So we're storing:
3.7053e78 bytes * 8 bits per byte = **2.9643e79 bits of data**
Which requires:
2.9643e79 bits * 2.85e-21 joules per bit = **8.44822e58 joules of energy**
The sun will provide us with 
1.988435e30 kg * 1.7867e17 joules per kilogram = **3.5527e47 joules of energy**
Meaning we would need:
8.44822e58 joules / 3.5527e47 joules per sun = **2.3779e11 suns**
So, if you could use the entire planet as a hard drive, storing 1 byte per atom, using stars as fuel, and cycling through 1 trillion keys per second, you'd need 37 octillion Earths to store it, and 237 billion suns to power the device capable of doing it, all of which would take you 3.6717 octodecillion years.
Better get cracking.

Okay, this is going to sound snarky, but, how does bitcoin:
* Issue loans for small businesses, home ownership, or other large purchases beyond one's immediate financial means?
* Pay interest on savings stored as bitcoin? (No, fluctuating market rates do not count as meeting this requirement)
* Provide physical storage for valuables other than currency?
The primary means by which banks make money is to offer loans. That's really their biggest deal, and it's huge for them. You seem to be arguing that they only act as a place that holds onto your money until you want to spend it.


It is physically impossible for bitcoin to be more widespread than the internet, and there are plenty of places in the continental US where internet availability is a flight of fancy.
Beyond that, it relies on consistent service without downtime. It's one thing for someone to say they've paid me when I can check the blockchain myself, but if my service goes down for any reason, or is delayed, or if the transaction itself simply doesn't catch up, I have no means of confirmation.
Then there's the fact that an individual cannot monitor their balance without direct access to a smart device. I can count the physical currency I have in my pocket, and know how much I have available, no matter what.
No offense, but if you think bitcoin is going to replace physical currency altogether, you're delusional. It doesn't matter if every merchant in the world accepted it, physical currency would still exist and be widely used.

True, you set your own fee, and you can set one with a value less than .0005, but that increases the probability that it will get significantly delayed, with a net effect of decreasing the total low-end purchases (pay a noticeably inconvenient fee or risk the ability to spend in a timely manner). This, in turn, will give greater weight to larger transactions which *do* include the fee.
Put another way: Let's say bitcoin reaches $1000 per coin. Bob is a regular guy and wants to buy a $1.00 (0.001 BTC) snack with bitcoin. John is a financial broker, and wants to perform volume arbitrage on the order of $1000 per transaction (1 BTC), netting a 1% gain after the fees taken by the markets.
John will not hesitate to include a .0005 fee. In fact. He might include more - any amount between .00050001 and .00999999 would ensure that his transaction goes through quickly, while still retaining a profit. He may do this hundreds, or even thousands of times over the course of a day. If he nets $200 a day, 5 days a week, he's making $52,000 a year. If he included a fee of .005 per full-coin transaction, that means his 1% profit is now a .5% profit. To get $200 a day, he just needs to do this 4000 times in a day. If he's got electronic tools, or a large enough starting bankroll, this is achievable.
Bob is very unlikely to include a .0005 BTC fee, because that's an extra $0.50 for his snack. He's more likely to just pay with physical cash.
But let's say that, for every one like John, there are a thousand Bobs willing to pay an extra $0.50 for their snack.
That means that, on a daily basis, there will be a thousand Bob transactions with a .0005 fee, and 4,000 John transactions with a .05 fee. The higher the fee John is willing to pay to ensure swift delivery, the more transactions he will perform in a day.
The net effect is that the big-wheeler transaction volume will dwarf the casual purchase volume every time.

Funny, because whenever I've deposited money at a bank, my account increased by exactly the amount deposited - no fees. Same for when I withdraw funds to cash.
Conversely, bitcoin *does* charge a fee for every transaction (at least, if you want the transaction to complete in any reasonable period of time).


Arguably, this is just as much an annoyance as minimum purchasing requirements at the BTC exchanges.


Sorry, what? I know there are ridiculous identification requirements, but those are rules imposed by the federal government, not the banks themselves.


And any other service which has the ability to do so. Interestingly, this ability is possible within Bitcoin: If the majority decided to lock a specific address out, they could blacklist it from transactions, and it would never be able to spend anything.

Another success story: I bought a $5.00 gift card a while back, but the transaction took longer than 15 minutes to show up in the blockchain. The invoice expired, and I never got my card.
There was some initial confusion in pinpointing the specific transaction (I purchased another $5.00 card a few minutes later without issue), and by the time we'd identified the specifics, bitcoin had nearly doubled in value.
Normal customer service might have just repeated a "no refunds" policy. Friendly customer service might have issued a $5.00 giftcard, exactly as I had originally purchased.
Gyft chose a third option, working with Bitpay to give me back my original payment.
I can't say enough good things about Gyft. They were the first, and in my opinion, remain the best service for putting BTC to practical use among retailers who don't directly accept it.

So, you're proposing a separate record type in the blockchain, with the intention that it function as a form of long-term storage rather than "walking around money"?


So is 24 hours the minimum value for this delay? As in, I couldn't change it to 12 hours, or 6, or just 10 minutes?
If it's built-in that the account delay can't be set to a value of less than 24 hours, that would maintain the level of security you propose. That still leaves one potential vulnerability.
Hypothetically, let's say your superkey is compromised. You initiate a transfer from your account to your wallet for some more immediately spendable coins. The attacker (who is the one who obtained your superkey) notes the transaction and rescinds it. They can now hold your coins hostage.
They would then be able to send a small message-based transaction (text in the coinbase string) instructing you to send a ransom to a particular address, and only then will the attacker allow you to retrieve the rest of the coins in your account. They can continue to do this even *after* you send the payment, and probably would.

"Reset blockchain transactions" makes the application start from scratch recalculating your balance from the first block. Many applications which actually download the blockchain in full will (improperly) show your balance as it goes, recalculating incoming and outgoing transactions for your wallet as it comes across them. Rarely, such programs miss a block or transaction (had that happen a few times with the Android Bitcoin wallet - always got my coins back, but would sometimes show up with significantly more than I actually had - unspendable, of course).
Your 50BTC didn't get lost. The program had either not yet caught up, or didn't properly sync with the blockchain.

It would have an effect on the process of taking a public key and finding the corresponding private key - but that's a separate matter. This is purely the matter of creating a full list of private keys. Regardless of that, it won't have an effect on the energy requirements, as those are limitations of physical matter and entropy - and the best known methods of quantum data storage have only been able to encode one *bit* of information in an atom, not one byte (and they were only able to do that for a period of less than an hour).
Sure, advances will be made, but I don't think anyone's even hypothesized storing more than 1 byte in a single atom.

According to Gyft, it's not a matter of Gyft asking the retailers to sell their cards: It's the other way around. Hence their repeated urging of customers "Don't ask us for more cards, ask your favorite retailers to use us!"

Right, but if the larger fees are the norm, statistically speaking, across the transactions within a block, how does the computational difficulty scale?

Statistically speaking, unless the protocol changes to accommodate more decimal places, only 2.1e14 addresses could contain at least one Satoshi, and that's only if everyone only *had* one Satoshi. If anyone has more (and pretty much everyone who has any has more than one Satoshi), then there are fewer occupied wallets.
Within the set of 2^256 private keys, they only map to 2^160 unique wallet addresses. So the question is how does 2^160 compare to 2.1e14? One in a million? One in a trillion?
The answer is one in 6.9595 *decillion*. Since "decillion" isn't a commonly used word, I'll save you the bother of having to look it up: it's a one with 33 zeroes after it.
To put that 6.9595 decillion figure into perspective: The Earth has a diameter of 12,742 kilometers, giving it a surface area just shy of 50 million square kilometers. A square kilometer is 1 million square meters, and a square meter is one million square millimeters, meaning the surface area of the Earth, in millimeters, is just shy of 50 quintillion mm^(2).
So here's the game we'll play. I've got 140 trillion earth-sized spheres. On one of them, I have randomly selected a single square millimeter as the prize winning spot. Find it, and you'll get to spin the prize wheel to see how much you've won. The prize wheel currently has [about 22 million spaces]( 21 million of them contain less than a dollar. But you only get to spin the wheel if you can find the secret spot on the secret sphere.
Wanna play?

You can generate a paper wallet without an internet connection. Most methods of doing this will also generate a deposit address. So long as you don't reveal the private key, you're safe.

If it matters, many Rockbox-able devices have FM-tuners, and the sound input from those can easily be used as a random seed.

Or, you know, make *virtually any other change to world history.*
OP basically just claimed to be a member of a rebel group with nuclear capabilities, which is specifically planning on bombing multiple major population centers purely for the purpose of crippling their communications infrastructure - and all because of economic policy.
His group is supposedly willing and able to eradicate millions of people to change their monetary system. Given time travel abilities, why would such a group target now, of all times, to try to divert the course of history? Why not get in contact with DARPA and meddle with the development of the internet itself? Why not get in touch with Alan Turing and change the history of modern computers?
He's proposing making a pretty fundamental change to his world's history, completely erasing what he describes as the primary force of influence over his timeline. If successful, he and everyone he knows will un-happen. They won't have ever existed. He has no way of knowing what kind of alternate history this will achieve. Why target a point in history when Bitcoin is actually being taken seriously, and not a point in history when a gentle nudge would have gotten the idea of a cryptocurrency laughed off into nonexistence?
This scenario is so poorly conceived, it doesn't even hold together as a good tinfoil-hat conspiracy theory or a scifi pulp novel. You've got nukes *and* time travel, and you use the latter to tell people "please don't make money, bad things will happen"?
If his story *were* true, his group is too incompetent to have any chance of successfully launching their attack. In fact, if his story were true, it would be far more likely that the history he describes is actually his own paranoid delusions.
This is no chilling dystopian vision of a terrifying future. This is the confused ramblings of a hackneyed amateur author with no sense of internal consistency.

There is no such thing as 100% certainty. Seriously. Strange and seemingly impossible things can and do happen at the quantum level - and the only thing preventing them from happening on a larger scale is the incredible improbability of the thing. There's an infinitesimal chance that the molecules comprising your money will spontaneously exist in a far distant location, by way of quantum tunnelling. There's a chance that the world currency market could implode, rendering traditional currency worthless. There's a chance that everyone you've ever met is in on a conspiracy dedicated to taking all your possessions, and they're just biding their time until you've got an enticing enough bankroll.
The probability of someone cracking your private key without any means of seeing it, guessing a passphrase, or otherwise retrieving it directly from an insecure source in your vicinity is less likely than all of the above things happening at the same time.
So, if you aren't worried about losing your money due to conspiracy, financial collapse, or quantum tunnelling, you have even less to fear from the probabilities involved in brute force cracking of your private keys.

Then nothing you do will protect your coins. If they can perform such a feat, they can just as easily fake that public key for creating a checksum so that it comes up as kosher as well.


Most merchants use bitpay or some similar service for purposes of payment processing. If the merchant were to claim non-receipt of the funds, you could take the matter up with the payment processor (identified during checkout), who would be able to provide tangible proof that the payment was sent as described.


Back to the payment processor. The merchant is only responsible for funds they received. In all likelihood, bitpay (or whatever processor) has pre-generated a lengthy list of transaction addresses for that merchant's use. If so, the merchant would be able to look at the transaction the buyer is claiming, check the receiving address against the pre-generated addresses, and say "Sorry, it's not in this list."
Of course, those factors imply another layer of trust, which could be compromised - but you can't protect against everything. In terms of the buyer-seller relationship, it's covered.

I don't really get that it's a negative position.
Context here: This card is an agenda card, the only type of card which counts towards the player's endgame score. The 1 on the left side of the card, just above the text box, indicates that it's only worth 1 such point.
Netrunner is played with one player taking the role of a corporation, and the other being a hacker. The corporation scores agenda points by playing them facedown, then spending time and resources to "advance" the agenda. When an agenda is fully advanced, it gets added to the player's score. The 3 in the upper-right corner indicates that this card must be advanced 3 times in order to be scored.
This 3-to-1 ratio of advancement-to-points is pretty high for the corporation. In other words, to the corporation, this card requires a lot of effort for little benefit.
The hacker (runner) scores points by making successful "runs" on the corporation's cards (Including the corporation's draw deck, or R&amp;D). Any time they find an agenda card, they get the points. The condition on the card that the runner must reveal this card means they can't decide not to score this card if they find it in R&amp;D, and are required to take it and resolve its effect.
Being "tagged" in this game basically means you've given away your real-world position, and are vulnerable to physical attack. The corporation can then spend time and credits destroying the runner's equipment, and many other cards have more severe effects when the runner is tagged.
So contextually:
* This card isn't particularly valuable to the Corporation - it's really only intended to function as a trap.
* When stolen, this agenda reveals the runner's real position. This makes a kind of sense: The peer-to-peer nature of cryptocurrency requires a connection to a wider network, and every transaction is globally logged. In the fictional world of Netrunner's super-tech, it's not inconceivable that the corporation could leave an unprotected wallet lying around as a honeypot trap, having tagged the coins within already. Anyone who initiates the next publicly logged transaction for those coins would be the hacker, making them easier to find.
The ideology of whether BTC is good or bad doesn't enter into it. The agenda point establishes "this card has value," which is true for BTC. The advancement cost to payout establishes "this card takes too much effort for too little gain for the corporation player," which is true for BTC as well - large corporations aren't going to be remotely interested in BTC until it's much more widely known and used by potential customers. Creating and maintaining the additional tools required to deal in bitcoins would take time and resources for corporations (albeit a trivial amount of time and resources), but it wouldn't have a significantly beneficial effect on their bottom line right now. The "tagged" effect establishes that, if the runner takes this card, they aren't a completely hidden entity within the 'net - which is true for BTC as well. Unless you jump through a few hoops, if you spend a BTC, the IP you use to spend it is somewhat known. It may be one of dozens of nodes globally, but that significantly narrows down the list if someone wanted to trace you.
Obviously, there would be ways around this - you could pass off the wallet's private key, or initiate the transfer through a remote proxy, or shuffle the coins to scatter them, or just not spend them for a while, etc. - but in the purest sense, from the perspective of someone who might want to be a completely unknown ghost on the global network, *the act of spending coins which are known to be stolen is, itself, a potential vulnerability.*
tl,dr: It's a game. Within the game's mechanics and fictional world, this card makes sense. It neither advocates nor vilifies BTC in the process.

And even the "bitcoin is better for money transfer" concept becomes moot if the banks create a system of off-chain accounts for instant transfer.
Bank A has so many customers, but all their BTC are held in a dozen or so wallet addresses known only to the bank. The customers see their coins in terms of their online accounts. Bank B has roughly the same type of setup.
Bank A customer wants to send money to another Bank A customer: The bank just reallocates the coins in their virtual account. No blockchain transactions occur. Bank A customer wants to send money to a Bank B customer: Bank A transfers liquid assets to Bank B using traditional means, which Bank B then uses to purchase BTC from an exchange (which may well be themselves) - but Bank B customer instantly sees the funds in his virtual account.
Honestly, this is no more a death-knell to banks than IPv6 was to the internet.

I would respect the implication if it communicated something along the lines of "If you foresee doom and gloom for bitcoin, do you understand these concepts? If yes, then your advice may be worthwhile and enlightening. If no, I probably shouldn't listen to you."


I don't. Betamax was a technically superior format by every metric of fidelity. It was just tied down by pointless licensing fees, so everybody went with the cheaper option. Betamax didn't die because it was a bad idea. It died because Sony decided to charge admission to use it.
That's not the relationship between traditional currency and bitcoin. I like to compare it to broadcast TV versus on-demand TV. On-demand adoption was slow at first, and there were performance issues early on, but as it gained acceptance, it grew more robust, reliable, and cost-effective.
Bitcoin is currently at the same spot that on-demand streaming was just after Realmedia became passé. We've improved on the earliest, primitive uses, but we haven't yet reached the full maturity of Netflix or Hulu.
We will. Bitcoin fulfills too many gaps in the marketplace of ideas, satisfies too many wishes for the general public to simply die out. The only way it will disappear is if something better replaces it.

If it's a 50% chance it will go to 1000x, then you should invest as heavily as possible: The payoff is vastly outweighing the odds at that point. Sure you could lose everything - but you can't lose more than you put in.
Matter of fact, if there were just a 51% chance that it would double, that's still a good bet, in terms of probability and payout.

Because by being just a little patient, they would get full value for each batch of coins they trickled into the market, rather than getting full value on a tiny percentage, less on the next hundred-ish, and so on down the order book. As they drive the price down, their own coins go down with it.

No, the best I've been able to find is a few smirks and a sarcastic grimace.

Well, they could collaborate to destroy it, devalue it, or just plain manipulate the market all to buggery - but destroying it would just result in a newer cryptocurrency specifically immune to the vulnerability which killed its predecessor, devaluing it would create a massive buying spree, and manipulating the market would be largely indistinguishable from business as usual.
So really the only way they could make it go away would be to [offer a better alternative](

It's like a Seinfield gag.
"I want to buy this."
"Sorry sir, we don't have any."
"You don't have any... of the thing I'm holding?"
"That's right, sir."
"Not even the one I'm holding?"
"Oh, I can't sell you that one."
"Why not?"
"It's not for sale."

Play Bioshock Infinite. Now, understand that the pseudo-religious reverence Columbia has for American exceptionalism and the founding fathers isn't much of an exaggeration among the extreme religious right in the States.

Explain: If the site is doing this for *anyone*, for any transaction amount, it's a huge concern.

If their reasoning holds, you shouldn't spend currency you have at all. You should pay for everything on credit, especially no-money-down, no-interest-for-the-first-whatever deals. You're paying back a fixed number of dollars, but that number is gradually worth less and less. So long as the inflation rate exceeds the interest rate, you come out ahead.
This is also the reasoning which fuels the trillion-dollar-bill proposal for reducing government debt, albeit from the perspective of causing inflation, not planning for it.

Even if it weren't a leap (which I'm reasonably certain it *would* be a *huge* leap, based on how the law treats land and structures differently from virtually any other form of asset), it wouldn't matter: Market value must be paid.
