@_date: 2013-11-11 01:36:36
Make sure you keep up with the sell price on Coinbase.  I don't think they directly base their price on a particular exchange, so you may lose some margin when you go to sell.
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:56:34

Ideally the common folk in the future will be providing goods and services for bitcoins and not have to convert to/from state currencies.  For example they will work their 9-5 job and their pay will come in the form of bitcoins.  Again, I want to stress this is an ideal.  Right now we are in a period of transition and we must convert to and from the state currencies.  The goal right now is to get as many places as possible to accept bitcoins for payment, so that more and more people can begin using it as a medium of exchange.

Are you sure this is how Coinbase works?  Source?
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:22:30
I wouldn't be so sure about the salt. At least a few of the past exchanges have demonstrated gross negligence when it comes to security. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:18:46
I'm pretty confident in Coinbase. They've had a slightly rocky start but they seem to have good backing. They've also provided pretty convincing evidence that the vast majority of their coins are stored offline. 
I still don't trust anyone with my coins, though. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:17:42
A trivial amount of searching will lead you to these answers as these are fundamental topics.

In my experience, bitinstant.com was by far the quickest way to get coins. It did involve going to a brick and mortar (7-11 in my case), but I paid cash and got the coins instantly.  Great experience.
I've also used coinbase.com in the last week. First I had to add and verify my account which took about 4 days, then once I purchased the coins it took another 4 days or so to get the coins.

I have a lot of respect for Selgin and have read some of his work in the past. So far I am disappointed that he has not gone deeper on the topic. His comments on bitcoin thus far can be boiled down to:
* it's interesting 
* I'm not ready to call it money 
* it may be the first step to the future of money 
I really hope he does more work on it because he would be a valuable intellectual resource.

@_date: 2013-10-26 02:04:52
Coinbase is not an exchange.  If you want some place to instantly buy and sell coins, you want something like Bitstamp, Mt. Gox or BTC-E.
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:55:18
You also have to wait a few days for your bank account to verify before you can make your first purchase.

Unfortunately no mention of BitInstant in the title.  OP you may want to repost.
@_date: 2013-05-04 13:34:35
Can we stop referring to coin generation as "solving mathematical puzzles?"  Miners are rewarded with new coins because they used their resources to maintain the ledger/network. This sounds much more meaningful than just solving math problems.
Otherwise, this was a pretty good read. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 01:56:22
It's too risky. Unless you are actively trading on a daily basis, I see no reason to leave anything in Gox. Convert it to BTC and immediately move it to a wallet you control.

Won't Paypal shut this down as soon as they realize they aren't actually donations?

You may want to try localbitcoins.com first.  See if there is anyone in your area who will buy them from you.
If not, your best bet would probably be Coinbase, however if you do not already have a verified account with them, you may have a delay getting your USD.

OP is right.  Hacker carries a negative connotation with the general public.  It may be a compliment, but when someone from the general public or the media uses the term 'hacker,' they don't mean it as a compliment usually.

I hate that they portray these people as experts, yet they get fundamentals so wrong!
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:35:22
You should not be using Coinbase for daytrading because Coinbase does not allow you to maintain a balance of other currencies like USD.  Other sites like Bitstamp and Mt.Gox allow you to do this, meaning if you want to sell BTC, you can do so immediately and then worry about withdrawing your other currency later if you need to.
@_date: 2013-05-23 11:55:54

I successfully bought bitcoins from them this past week (for the first time).  Took a few days before they were in my account (as expected).  Once they were in my account I immediately cashed them out to a paper wallet that I have.  They were there immediately and confirmed within an hour.
Just thought I'd share a positive story.

Not correct. Fractional reserve banking means that you have a fraction of your deposits in reserve. Meaning you have lent out any portion if your deposits.

I know they were having issues last night but it could also be that you didn't include a fee.  I did this recently and after a few days, blockchain.info "reversed" the transaction because it went so long without being included in a block.  However mine was with a much smaller amount than 5 BTC.

I don't think it's that hard to buy, considering what you are doing.  It's not unreasonable for one to expect to have to wait a few days for verification before one converts between currencies.

In the same way you wouldn't carry around wads of cash, most of your coins should be stored in an offline wallet.  This way if your online wallet is compromised you have minimized your losses.  Not only that, but you've made your wallet much less appealing to a would-be attacker.
