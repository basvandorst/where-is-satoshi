Sounds like someone never initiated coverage on a diverse set of assets or better yet, positions. Lol. Stocks are volatile af rn.

It's just an idea with actions over time.

No. This is just a sign.

Are you sure you know what strategy means? Do you have a goal?

This is an extremely isolated perspective. Globe is huge, more people every day.

If you're speaking from an American or first world perspective, then yeah money is easy and low risk within that system. A borderless asset doesn't require international transfer. You just move your body. Which would be "free" as compared to "affordable" and better than convenient, it would already be done. These are existing advantages that should improve over time. A compelling case IMO.

Cause this is a "subreddit". Memes are high value and high frequency on reddit and its subreddits, but memes don't really correlate with actual market valuations. Reading the memes is similar to reading the op-eds of young folks. And young folks are funny, but they are just a hedge against their parents health concerns about old-age... Anyways, do you know what an op-ed is?

You're clearly the one overly interested in "rank" of market caps. Talks\_To\_Cats is describing how deep reorg/51% attacks would work on any crypto. The security you're alluding to seems irrelevant to this type of attack.

Gold proved that a universal store of value is a tool with direct leverage in globally critical events and can also be successfully traded as meaningless trinkets concurrently. Gold still has that leverage power but it is concentrated into the governments and institutions. There were lots of problems before governments grabbed it all up, remember your Pirates of the Caribbean my friends. But as being a universal store of value, gold remains unique and valuable. Meaningless trinkets are the damn best shit too, everybody knows it. And Bitcoiners been building \[sic\] trinkets for ten years with no signs of stopping.
Raw element holders should absolutely digitally diversify.

Headlines must be clickbait in these distracted times.
And I don't think you understand any of this... Anyways, to establish value of this asset (Bitcoin) the twins have created an entity and an instrument of considerable scale. So, their position and outlook is uh a lot bigger than "Who cares...?" You, giszmo, are the shit poster here. Clamoring for your own ignorance. And your upvoters are a sign of how early we are in the widespread ground-level understanding of Bitcoin too.

I didn't make it to the end despite the extravagant production budget. The writing had no value.

Asset class is having a global reevaluation. A lot of people on here seem only invested in Bitcoin, that's a weird way to try to understand the interconnected worlds of values. In order for Bitcoin specifically to rise in value, its future has to hint at greater usage or at least established patterns of use. Unfortunately overriding that concept, is that right now the future for all assets/money/living organisms... looks like a pain in the ass. It's called a bear market when people have no zest. Luckily we have democracy, and maybe we can swing things in an optimistic direction with some god damn votes in a few years.

Recessions aren't good for any thing. But yes, people have a new option now and that's good for everyone. Running into "safety" as the people say is a fearful move though. No one enjoys acting out of fear. 
So come wisely to Bitcoin and share in the hope, risk, event and opportunity that this young yet established universal store of value provides.

Bitcoin is more of a step along the eternal way towards justice and equality. America was a good step, now let's keep it going.

I can basically agree with all that. However IMO, "Ease and manage" is the goal everybody wants and it's primarily marketing talk. Improvement is what development is. On that note, has traditional money become easy and manageable yet? I can't tell.
Also, an "established pattern of use" doesn't have to be a lot of people. It just has to work for the right people at the right time. Consistency. For example, "I need to get the fuck out of Venezuela, I will convert to Bitcoin so I don't have to carry gold bars."

The Stonk Market is where you go to do your GBTC trading. And check all your other traditional stonks.

Interestingly enough, people living paycheck to paycheck somehow enable "the most powerful economy in the world". I don't quite share your Friday bump theory tho. But hey thanks for sharing, got me thinking.
