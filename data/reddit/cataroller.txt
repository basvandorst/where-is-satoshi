I think I spent that long at the bar at the Movenpick Hotel.  Didn't film it though, thankfully.

I'd email the CEO and say "I'm going to give you some exciting feedback in 5 days but I can't tell you what it is."
Give him a taste of his own medicine!

I love that the scots want to separate.  I'm not sure why - I just know if David Cameron and the rest of the tory cronies are against it, it must be a good thing for the common man.  Bitcoin is perfect for sticking it to the ruling classes!

This sounds like a load of rubbish.  Would anybody like to join me as a co-insulter?

I don't think your project is rubbish, I was making a lame joke about the name :)

We could use mechanical turk to get 120,000 people to email Amazon to take Bitcoin.  If we just had an email they can copy and paste then it should be cheap to do.

So who's executive officer of your commune this week?

No the fee is 0.12% of the highest amount in the vault, annual and paid in advance.
If you deposited 1 BTC and then instantly removed 0.5, you'd have 0.5 BTC worth of "free storage" for the next year.
