I got a better solution for you. Start with a fresh Ubuntu installation in Virtualbox and do this
* sudo -s
* apt-get update
* apt-get install npm
* npm install -g browserify
* npm install bip38
* ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
* browserify -r bip38 &gt; bip38.js
Most likely the errors you are seeing are due to npm being in a messed up state.

This is exactly what bitalo.com launched a year+ ago.
You may look at their volumes and wonder why it never caught on.
(There are other similar projects: multisigna, bitsquare ...)
Usually when someone advertises I expect to see a mention of similar projects and an explanation why this new service is better.

I did browserify 
I run Ubuntu 14.04 with npm 1.3.10
Simply keep running browserify bip38.js &gt; b.js
and npm install all the missing modules that npm cant find

I must admit that I find it very frustrating, having to comb through this thread, trying to glean bits an pieces of how your multisig security is set up.
If you are so excited about the "first exhange that can't steal your coins", why not set up a dedicated web page/PDF where you break it down in detail: what keys get generated, what transactions get signed, point to specific JS pages so they could be examined etc.
I wrote Martin an email, explaining that your FAQ point on security is rather confusing if not incorrect. His response was very terse and left me with even more questions.

If your question is: in a hypothetical situation when there are very few transactions happening, why reward a miner?
This is good question. It makes sense to reward miners only proportionally to how many transactions happen on the blockchain at the time of mining.
The answer is: bitcoin was designed that way and we have to live with it. It doesnt matter if the amount of transactions on the blockchain is high or low, the miner will get their reward regardless.

 , really? why not httpS ?
After such a fiasco, you'd think the company go an extra mile to make you feel extra confident connecting over Tor and having a padlock displayed in your tor browser. 
Is bc.info skimping on a few server's CPU cycles by not giving you HTTPS over Tor? I don't like such the-least-we-can-get-away-with attitude.
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:29:47
The benefits of hosting bc.i on Tor are manifold:
1. You don't run a risk of a rogue CloudFlare employee stealing your coins. (bc.i handed over their secret keys to CloudFlare in order to get protection from internet denial-of-service attacks, so potentially CloudFlare can do that)
2. With Russia blanket-blocking websites like github.com, those who live in such places will be able to still access their bc.i wallet over Tor even if the clearnet websites gets blocked.
3. Sometimes you just don't want to reveal to your Internet Service Provider that you are into bitcoin by accessing bc.i website on the clearnet. ISP employees may target you for traffic injection/phishing etc.
All you need to do to access the website is download Tor Browser from  and paste the address  and make sure that URL padlock is displayed.

In Tor Browser you get "unknown" for any HTTPS website. In other browser's you'll see something like "This website does not supply ownership information." I have yet to see a website which does supply it.

The developers run the gems servers. If they get shut down, they'll take the whole gems economy with them.
My advice: don't do anything in a rush. If someone comes out of the woods and says "we'll have an IPO in a week", that's a red flag to me.
Besides, here'e a quote from their main dev from the bitcointalk thread: 
August 27, 2014, 06:37:10 PM

Which tells me that 3 months ago their gems app did not have such a basic feature and they were already talking about IPO.

Not an expert here, but this describes the well-known limitation of Docker which stems from it being run with root privileges. If you allow a normal user **ON YOUR MACHINE** to give Docker arbitrary commands, he may exploit Docker and gain root privileges. But again, this threat comes from a local user on you r machine.
This does not relate to a maliciously-crafted Docker image being able to break out of the Docker jail and take over the system.

Ive noticed you made this comment in another post a while ago and so I did some research back then and you were right. Now that you've reminded me again about it, let me ask you something.
Is it true that implementing LN with malleability in mind would dramatically complicate the codebase of LN and so most implementations simply decided to bank on SW instead of going the hard way of implementing LN with all the corner cases that malleability has to offer?
What is your take about how much more work would malleable LN require in terms of implementation and code complexity?

For the average user Bcoin can be used in a browser addon. Maybe some of the existing browser wallets can implement this code to move wallets from SPV model to a full node. (Bcoin still needs to implement pruning for that to be realistic).
