Just curious, why you think bitcoin will rise so drastically in the next few years and what do you think has caused the recent rise from sept 2015 at around $225 to now sitting at $425?
@_date: 2016-04-26 05:36:35
Honestly a bit disappointing to me. They make you convert from BTC to USD... this means you are holding USD at all times instead of them pricing everything in BTC. It would be really cool if they actually let you pay for things in BTC. All they are doing is adding a third party to accept your BTCs for a small markup.. Why on earth would you want to take USD you get from a job, convert to BTC at some point, and then pay a small markup to xfer back to USD in preset increments? It's really not a bold move by steam in any way. They took on no risk and are cashing in on the free media hype.

I think their point is that zero conf works just as well as LN instant payment.... plus they have their own hard fork version of malleability fix which is “cleaner.” 
The point is don’t bother arguing with them because they have theoretical fixed that can be implemented.

People who are moving large sums of money around regularly would form their own channels and set whatever upper limit they want. 
Regarding hashgraph that’s what I was was thinking as well but they claim to have solved the security problem and don’t need to settle in another layer like bitcoin. If this is the case bitcoin and other blockchains probably will get replaced (eventually) since it only adds complexity and is less efficient. 
My only doubt about hashgraph is the cost of attacking the network. For now I guess it is permissible and an attacker could be identified but how does that work when it’s not.. I think it’s a trivial amount of money to run a hashgraph node so someone could easily spin up a bunch of nodes and take over the network with majority node or vote count. Someone actually brought this up in a talk and the cto? only said all networks can be attacked with more than 1/3 malicious nodes. Which to me sounds like they are counting on having such a large network that the cost of attacking would be too high for any one entity to achieve. The same could be said for PoS in a way but this is much more unclear at this point and nodes don’t risk losing anything by attacking the network. Correct me if I’m wrong but this is probably why they launched aiming towards big business and moving data around rather than a currency. I don’t think a currency would work right now.

That requires an extra in chain tx which kind of defeats the point. Propels think about LN channel as requiring 2 tx, open and close, but if you only had to perform 1 in essence it would at least the same as performing an on chain tx (no worse) and you could also take advantage of the LN benefits. 
Basically that would leave no reason to not use LN. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:08:52
So you would need private keys to open and close a channel. You can’t open a channel without first knowing the keys right?
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:40:33
I’m struggling to understand if LN becomes a thing why anyone would want to use the mainnet? It should go all the way back to employers paying workers their wages through a channel, workers spending money on various things, stores collecting btc through items sold etc. If it is secure and trust less why would someone care to ever close their LN channel? Is this because LN requires your channel to be running all the time and occasionally it will go offline and close the channel?? Isn’t it 2 weeks until a channel will automatically close? It seems like LN will be the main part of bitcoin and to use get on it off the network will require this secondary thing which is currently the blockchain. 
This brings us back to the original idea behind the bitcoin blockchain. Is this model (security minded) really necessary for only getting on and off the network since btc is mainly now a p2p currency (let’s say 95%+ tx on LN)? Is it required for every node to record / broadcast every transaction or would we be better off with something like a dag or hashgraph? P2p network really does seem like the final solution but when it comes to the settling layer what type of properties would be most desired? It would be interesting to know how these 3 designs stack up when you reach their theoretical limits.

Yep. Bitcoin needs LN to work or something like dags / hashgraph will undoubtedly replace it. I can’t say for sure if LN, if it works, will even stack up against their tech but at the very least we need to try it. Those who don’t get this are getting left behind.

This is great advice and truly a great flaw in humanity as we currently stand IMO. We all strive to achieve wealth but once that is achieved it means nothing. The most happy families and most meaningful relationships I have ever seen even if they were due to work were all poor people. I wish I could put it better into words but the happiest people I have met in life were all poor and dependent on those around them. A sense of purpose and someone needing you is essential. Money in the end means nothing which is ironic because it is what we are all taught to strive for. 
I think as some of us more fortunate go throughout our lives we realize this and try to be the best we can in order to achieve this purpose and meaning that is desired when our peers and ourselves have more disposable income. 
Money can fundamentally change ones perspective on life and I think the only recourse is to stay modest and true to yourself how that money came into being. If you suddenly received a large sum of money you should remain modest and not live life how you imagine a millionaire would. This is a one time thing and if your cash flow is not keeping up with your spending then you are in trouble. Many bitcoin holders have and will become millionaires. Remember a fool and his money will soon be parted. Do not be that fool. Compounding interest will serve you better than a new million dollar house or car.

Do I really need to explain what insurance is??? If your private keys are lost or destroyed etc. you will lose everything. End of story. If you leave keys with bakkt and they get hacked or there is an apocalypse, they will still owe you the coins they were holding for you. Bakkt will use another company to secure their actual coins and make it as humanly safe as possible to prevent any loss or theft. This company will either be backed by another large Corp or have lots of assets which can in theory can pay for a complete loss of coins bakkt is holding. For a small fee they agree to cover any losses for bakkt. 
It doesn't matter to someone holding $1000 or even $1 million or so but it does when there are lots of parties involved, money will be moved daily, and BILLIONS are at stake. These companies are not willing (or are still least hesitant) to risk losing a billion dollars on a whim. Sure, bakkt is not necessarilly needed but it provides a good solution and opens the doors to new investors.

So if the sec can't control it and look into everyone's books they deny it (etf). As long as they can maintain complete control it's ok (derivatives). Lets put aside the fundamental problems with derivatives and disallow actual commodity trading. 
I understand their thought process but they aren't preventing fraud or manipulation because these people will now just use dervitives as a tool to further manipulated the market. It's not like stock derivatives because they also heavily regulate that market but more like gold or silver commodities. The difference is Bitcoin is much easier to manipulate due to a smaller market cap and liquidity. 
Now by NOT allowing a Bitcoin backed etf they are only hurting the crypto market by hampering one part of it.

To overly simplify things btc came into existence and is useful because of certain properties. Xrp at first glance can do the same thing as btc but only if you understand the big picture do you realize xrp is essentially cheating and cannot provide the same utility as btc. It’s more like saying invest in sql because it can do 1m tx/s and is infinitely scalable so it should be worth 10% of btc... with more understanding xrp becomes worth less and the opposite can be said for btc.

That’s a really good question. I think there are definitely some coins which are more apps and others which are more about developing the tech and advancing the blockchain protocol. I think it just depends on the dev team and their overall ambitions.

I suppose merge mining will work. The only thing they will need to do is maintain another blockchain essentially which of course does have a cost. If we look at something which would be useful to btc like rootstock, it will have contacts which a data intensive. I doubt the fee model would pay for the extra storage space in this situation. 
Interesting concept and I hope it get's implemented but I doubt it will gain much traction given we have already gone through the ICO / altcoin / fork phase. Also, are the black box funds only susceptible of being stolen by miners 1 time when the original owner requested to use the drivechain or can any funds in the box be marked to be moved at any time by a miner?

*The Exchange represents that the MVBTCO calculates the intra-day price of bitcoin* ***every 15 seconds*** *and a closing price as of* ***4:00 p.m***\*. E.T., each weekday and that the intra-day levels of the MVBTCO incorporate the real-time price of bitcoin based on executable bids and asks derived from constituent bitcoin over-the-counter (“OTC”) platforms that have entered into an agreement with MV Index Solutions GmbH (“MVIS”) to provide such information.\*
The fuck? That's the most convoluted shit I've ever seen.
*Further, the Exchange asserts that bitcoin is arguably less susceptible to manipulation than other commodities that underlie exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) because there may be inside information relating to the supply of the physical commodity (such as the discovery of new sources of supply or significant disruptions at mining facilities that supply the commodity)  24 See id. at 31025. 25 See id. 9 that simply are inapplicable to bitcoin.*
This is a very good arguement. Well put.
Honestly after reading most of their response I feel they are finalizing the agreement and it is only a matter of properly addressing questions which are fairly obvious but are required to have in writing. Essentially the SEC is covering their asses and getting force fed every bit of info they would need to approve it which is fine but would be annoying for normal people trying to conduct business.

Who told you it utilizes wasted energy? I'd like to see that study. Pretty sure most miners are running their rigs almost every hour of the day to get a return on their hardware costs. Regardless we can't have most miners turning off their machines during peak energy demand (when activity is highest). So unless miners ae really hurting and hunting only for the cheapest electricity prices during the day, I only see them adding to the demand and not helping use otherwise wasted electricity. 
Also, assuming market cap equals total value of mining infrastructure, why would miners work for 1% when they can get a better return on their investment elsewhere? 
I don't see how staking isn't vastly superior given there isn't a middle man, the power company, taking its massive cut. Assuming a valid or good enough POS will most likely be available. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:16:13
Understandable. The problem with that line of thinking is they keep out of trouble by denying all ETFs. There is always a chance of a black swan event or investors losing money..  My point was they are being weary of approving an etf to avoid putting themselves in a bad position but at the expense of the commodity (crypto) as other products (derivatives) come about. They are doing a disservice to the market by denying the etf. The same sentiment that commissioner Peirce shares.

The thing about bitcoin is the upper bound doesn't really exist yet (there are certain limitations due to energy and other macro level limits). With stocks or w/e there is always a rational upper and lower bound. Bitcoin could easily be worth $1 or  $1 million per depending on nothing but adoption. It could literally stay exactly the same in terms of protocol and the price could skyrocket just because of more demand. That is literally all it takes. The same can not be said for other investments such as stocks. The thesis behind bitcoin allows this whereas others do not. This is how bitcoin is able to go from $200 to $12000 (x60) for no apparent reason. If you can realize this then you can assume the price will keep going up until bitcoin no longer has demand or no more users demand it. Therefore as long as bitcoin continues to gain new users the price will go up and it is obvious that there are more and more users or demand every day as price goes up, becomes more legitimate, and risk lessons. Look in the news. Price will go up. Futures a risk due to shorting? No fucking way. Less crazy upswings? Maybe. The only reason we had a 2 year bear market is because people thought bitcoin was essentially going to fade away into nothingness. We are far beyond that point now as bitcoin has gone so far as to be mentioned in a press release by the whitehouse. This next year we are going to blow everyone's minds and bitcoin will become a household name. It truly is the bull run of the century.

@_date: 2018-09-26 17:25:23
I don't get it either. How would block rewards be handled on a drivechain? Mining couldn't be transferable to the main chain because that would create more inflation and miners need an incentive to include any additional transactions... Maybe the whole thing runs on transaction fees alone which doesn't seem like a lucrative venture for miners.
The only advantage is your new chain has the security of the bitcoin network behind it. I don't think funds can be stolen by way of 51% attack on the drivechain or you would at least need to be capable of 51% attacking the BTC chain in order to do this. 
I agree this doesn't sound like an appealing trade off. It only sounds good for bitcoin maximalists who want everything to be denomiated in BTC haha.

We are mainly talking about big investors. For them to be managing Bitcoin keys worth hundreds of millions or more of others money on a daily basis ..what do you think happens when a mistake innevitably occurs? No one will provide insurance to cover this situation and there is no way to recover from this. This is not an acceptable risk for a business or a wall street investor to take. Bakkt is allowing them to trade Bitcoin without having this risk. Bakkt does have an insured custodial service... This is just 1 example. Think about this next time you regurgitate the most overly used quote in Bitcoin behind hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:42:54
This is why I believe btc will continue to go up over time. Price is irrelevant because there is no revenue or p/e ratio... only user adoption. The same shit has been happening for 9 years. Every x10 price people have said btc is overpriced then some time goes by, new buyers enter the market, some old timers sell into the market, and price continues to work towards another x10. 
TLDR this is a psychological thing that only passes with time IMO. Keep holding and chillax to win.

Futures only require cash not bitcoin to be held as collateral. Meaning liquidity is only affected by buyers and sellers. Not supply and demand of the underlying asset. Fair enough, there might not be enough liquidity to support big investors. 
CBOE CME contacts are settled every month using the market price of other exchanges which actually trade bitcoin? 
Bakkt will be determining a new price using the price from CBOE and CME futures exchanges... Bakkt says it will be backing the bitcoin traded with real bitcoin. Meaning a Bakkt customer buys 1 bitcoin from them on paper so they should have 1 bitcoin in their "wallet" to back that customers account. I don't fully understand how using futures prices should make any difference to the SEC other than Bakkt using an average price of sorts instead of real market prices. Not sure how this "supports market integrity" but I'm not a financial expert by any means.

They do have power... ask yourself, does core have influence over people? The answer is a resounding yes and you should now realize they do have power so telling me they don't is an obviously false. 
BU is basically saying, we want increasing block size over time. Core "cough" blockstream "cough, cough" decided they would single-handedly stop this increase and let people decide between paying high fees and slow tx times or use a second layer protocol. 
Yea, that's real honest work right there. Force bitcoin users to chose your solution due to a problem you created. I know you probably won't accept this but it's worth mentioning again and again in hopes that someone will. This is what I'm talking about when I say they can't be trusted. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:40:04
I agree using crap SW is not really on the list of things I like to do but when you think about time invested and people involved, it will take more of each to bring the BU to par with CORE... Yes I know who he is and I had no idea he was involved in BU. I hope you are not implying him and his crew are developer for BU... 
If BU gets more support I don't see why the code couldn't be improved. It's really just old core SW anyway with one line of code being changed amirite? lol. 
If a split hard fork does happen I wouldn't bet on CORE sticking around unless BU really mucks things up / CORE hard forks as well.

Grammar check please. 
-MAX_BLOCK_SIZE has always been planned to increase as needed. That limitation should be ignored. theymos 17:15, 4 March 2011 (GMT)
This is pretty much what most people expect and what has been happening since Bitcoin's inception. Then you tell me because CORE decided they aren't going to raise max blocksize this time around I am the one out of line and I should have known better when I signed up for (CORE)bitcoin??? 
-Calling a majority fork an alt coin. 
-core devs have no power


-Yes, the people who have taken up the role of lead developers for bitcoin can single-handedly change the course of bitcoin... is that really inconceivable? Most people take their word as gospel. 
Need I go on?
Your point about being open source seems misguided. How does the CORE repository being open sourced mean anything in terms of being controlled by a single entity (block-stream interest)? Bitcoin is open source anyway so it's not like they are choosing to be transparent. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:15:51
My point was that core has ulterior motives just as miners have motive to capture as much in mining rewards as possible. They have shown that they are not straight forward with their intentions and will use trickery to get what they want. BU is probably bad code but the fundamentals are what is important. If the code were to be implemented I would hope many more people would help to get it production ready... 
So this is not a choice of picking the better software. This is about fighting for fundamentals now rather than later since this has been boiling up for years without significant resolution.  
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:23:10
I am aware this is not a PoW system. What I'm saying is that big players will find a competitive edge. In this case the edge is being able to connect anyone to anyone with the least amount of relays in between. Another edge is that it costs money to run a node. A large company will probably be able to have cheaper running costs (hardware, connection fees, and electricity) than your average joe and be able to undercut them. It may be cheap to run a node but it probably won't make sense to. Meaning it will be much cheaper putting your btc into a node "bank" and using them instead of running your own. 
I really don't oppose this but let's not say we've this will be more decentralized than mining currently is. 
The solution of course is to create 3rd layer... lol

@_date: 2017-03-20 22:05:46
You are probably right. It would take overwhelming support to get something passed that was in opposition to the CORE dev team. 
So I wouldn't bet on BU actually happening right now but as they gain more support we could see a shift in attitude from the exchanges. The letter in not a legal contract and coinbase is a large player. 
In the end I hope it is a bluff and core decides to reason with 2mb but I seriously doubt they will break their stance at this point.

@_date: 2017-03-20 16:50:31
This is a very good point. The only real issue I have is that core cannot be trusted. I do think they have an ego issue and possibly too much power / influence. We may not need blocksize increase right away or possibly for many years if segwit is implemented but a block-size increase will eventually be needed and some core devs don't seem to think we need anything past 1mb, EVER. To me this is insane and is something that I cannot look past. For this reason I support BU. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:18:34


Okay... Sounds like you are forgetting about miners too. Core does tell people what to do... but they cannot enforce anything. 


It has long been agreed to UP the blocksize when blocks get full. Core decided to not implement this change because they came up with second layer solutions which blockstream, their employer, would profit from... They could have easily implemented 2mb blocks and gotten segwit activated at the same time but that would have taken away the need for second layer solutions due to low tx fees. Saying something like anyone is free to mine a 2mb block at any time is flat out retarded and you know it. I don't know why you continue saying counterproductive and making false claims. You sound like a complete CORE shill.  


Core has changed the rules many times you dullard and if BU gets 70% in the coming weeks it will (most likely) become bitcoin whether you like it or not. I know this is hard for you to comprehend.

@_date: 2017-03-28 10:25:38

Each node connected between point A and point B collect their own fee. The more people in between the more fees. Essentially everyone will have low fees but the more trips it takes to get from point a to point b the higher the fee. Master nodes will start to appear as they have channels open with more and more people. This way the shortest route between bob and molly may only be bob to master node A to master node B to molly if for example bob is connected directly to master node A and molly B. Or they could be connected to the same master node as well. These nodes will probably have a business type cost advantage when it comes to hardware, electricity etc.. and they will also be preferred because the amount of nodes between 2 points will also be less while using them as opposed to regular nodes who do not have as many connections. 
I'm sure there are solutions to centralization issues like this already but I think the details are yet to be ironed out. For example centralization could be mitigated by setting a max number of open channels for a node. 
Full disclosure I support LN. I'm only here to discuss and learn. In the end it is still better than what we have with banks and it provides a decent scaling solution.

There are people like Ver who make large transfers and there are people who would like to use bitcoin to buy coffee or everyday purchases from amazon or Walmart for example. Both scenarios cannot exist. One camp must subsidize the other. Regular users could make less frequent on chain transactions and use LN for everyday purchases but that model would hurt Ver who must routinely make large on chain transactions. 
We must find a balance the balance between on chain fees and blocksize or throughput. How this is currently done seems to be at random and at the will of core devs mostly. There needs to be a mechanism to adjust this or we will continue to fight. For example a dynamic block size or simply a rule stating when blocks become (on average after so many blocks) 90% full, block size is increased and when blocks become less than 50% full blocksize is decreased. Someone smart would need to figure out the specifics but the market needs a way to adjust the blocks and not leave it up to a central authority to adjust periodically. 
Think about what would happen at a grocery store if you consistently waited in line for over an hour. People would stop coming. That's why they open and close lanes at a whim. This is one thing I would like for core to put on their roadmap or at least make people more aware of if it is.

I think the block fees were or are around 5 btc. Meaning they could either collect the mining reward and zero fees = 12.5 btc or mining reward + fees = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5 btc. I'll let you do the usd conversion of it makes you feel better. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:28:17
Not normal. Set the fee much lower and either be patient or use a transaction accelerator.. You can pretty much set a zero fee and they will push it for you but I wouldn't recommend doing this often because its still risky. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:10:03
Cool. So it will only be a matter of switching over to the new release and we should start seeing a bigger blocks if needed. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:16:25
I believe there is a sweet spot that is optimized for normal transactions on the blockchain. Not too big to induce spam but not too small to deny normal use. I believe we are seeing the latter. If segwit doesn't relieve some of this congestion 2mb should be seriously considered... 
Another bonus with accepting x2 is that it would essentially kill BCH. 
I don't want to go through anther hard fork / chain split but we shouldn't flat out reject the possibility of doing a blocksize increase until we have more info.

Does core already have a wallet ready to go?
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:01:58
That's not how it works... they basically passed on at least a couple bitcoin in fees by not including transactions. Apparently they would do this hoping to get an advantage when mining the next block. Pretty shitty thing to do regardless. Just goes to show they are malicious whether it be ASICboost, SPV mining, raising fee price / spamming the network with txs, or creating a bitcoin fork. People will never learn.

Hedge funds are already dying. ETFs are on the rise.
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:34:24
That's pretty interesting to think about.
Here is the setting. World population is 750,000. We have reasoned the world cannot sustain greater than 1 billion people according to what we currently know. At this point humanity would  hit a tipping point and die out. 
The current max population we have decided to allow is 1 million because we have found another solution that doesn't rely on ever increasing human population size and increasing population size has a direct correlation with human suffering. We have found that we can still increase population size but in order to do so, new humans born past the 1 million mark will not live on the Earth per-say. We have found that we can increase population, which is good because more minds and intelligence is better for the civilization... by creating artificial worlds on earth (simulation in a computer program). Both earth and these worlds can communicate with each other and people can move back and forth in physical bodies from one to another.  However, there can only be a max of 1 million humans on earth at any given time. 
It has been proven that this idea can work but has not been fully built yet as it will take vast amounts of engineering and time but nothing about it is physically impossible.
There is conflict given the price of having a child has become expensive seeing that the 1 million human limit is approaching. There is a great debate about which path should be taken. 
Plan A, keep populating and expanding civilization as we have been doing for thousands of years and find a solution when the time comes that we reach the 1 billion point. Humanity would have greatly expanded once it approaches the 1 billion mark and new technologies we haven't even thought of would now be available and could be used to solve the problem. 
Plan B, limit population ensuring humanity does not face certain extinction and start work on layer 2 humanity solutions. This will ultimately achieve the same goal as plan A because population will be able to keep increasing, in a different way, but also keep humanity safe.
Plan B sounds more correct because it will take longer but they will eventually reach the 1 billion mark as plan A did and if a solution becomes available they can easily implement at that point. It's would seem unwise to not use a plan we currently have in hopes that the issue we be solved later on. 
I realize you will not agree 100% with this analogy but it is akin to how I feel about the whole situation currently taking place.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:04:17

That’s a good point about larger market cap. At some point returns slow down as the market becomes saturated.

@_date: 2017-11-27 17:16:28
What I’m trying to say is most people who bought into btc at a low price did so because they believed in it and took great risk. We are at a point now where the price could potentially go way up or down. The only people embarrassed will be those who sold low and bought back in high. Holders are already up on their investment and aren’t afraid of a little correction even if that is to happen because their is also a 50% chance the price will go up. Most of the time you will miss the dip or the rise because it happens to fast so unless you are watching the market 24/7 you probably won’t increase your holdings. 
Kind of ironic you are calling someone who holds an asset as greedy (and embarrassed) as opposed to someone who is constantly trading and trying to x10 their investment by playing the market. Also let’s think about who gets slaughtered, traders or holders ��

All it would take is for some of the miners in China to get together and say they will continue to signal until the fork. This way they can dump their coins with almost full confidence that they are not at risk and also make an extra 10-20%. 
Unfortunately we will never know and therefore it’s too risky to dump x2 coins at this point.

I think the mentality needs to be changed with respect to miners and nodes. Miners are paid to perform a service. Why are they given the power to dictate all rules on the network? They will obviously have a conflict of interest at some point. Also as we are now seeing, companies which produce asics have a monopoly with production and mining which gives them an unfair market advantage. Nodes do not have this unfair production attribute and users are not rewarded for running them hence no conflict of interests. 
With this being said I think UASF or UAHF are the way bitcoin will need to process future upgrades and let mining hash power follow if they wish to get paid. 
@_date: 2019-12-15 07:09:49
POS is almost certainly better than POW now. That alone is a risk to bitcoin. I'm not saying it is but if ethereum with POS becomes more secure, is much more efficient at processing transactions, is able to reduce latency to sub 1s, is capable of thousands of tx/s, includes private transactions, has thousands of developers, etc. IF that all happens if ETH a major risk to BTC?
@_date: 2016-09-28 18:56:26

No. The point is if a major payment node like a store or restaurant wants to use LN they need a node. If this node is getting attacked they need to have a beefy setup or no one can then pay and that just isn't a good solution.

Idk... the guy who responded to me I guess. Btw I'm confused does a person need to fund a channel or fund a node and then connect many channels... for example, I, Carl, open a payment channel with Bob with $10. Then I want to open a channel with alice. Can I open a channel with her for $1 and still transact up to $11 with her if she also had at least $11? 
My guess is no but not sure. However, if you are alice and already had a channel open with Sara for $10 then I, Carl, decide to open a channel with you, alice, you wouldn't be required to have $10 more dollars worth... and would have 2 open channels.

So this is like a gambling market for the price of bitcoin in which no one involved needs to touch bitcoin at all right? For example I make a bet with you that the price of wheat will go up by 10 cents in 1 month. If it doesn't then you win the bet. If the bet was something like 10 shares at $1 a piece then I would owe you the full $10 in cash (not 10 bundles or w/e of wheat). 
What others are saying is that institutions will hedge against an all or nothing type of bet and might do so by buying bitcoin. Couldn't then just open another contract on the other side instead? It should be easier than buying and selling actual bitcoin. They want to hedge as the market sentiment changes etc. 
The only good I can see come of this is the end goal of a real ETF which is backed by BTC which may be more likely after these futures markets are created??

Almost exactly like BCH. They, the devs, premine and then release it the chain to the public. There are other scammy things about this.

I was going to buy $1000 worth back in 2011 as well. I thought it was super interesting and might be a successful project but couldn't tell one way or another if the price would dive / moonshot / stay the same due to the super high inflation at the time. Wouldn't have been worth a million but still at least 500k. Figured I would pay off student loans first. One of my school mates said he was ordering a bunch of GPUs to run in his dorm. Not sure if he did or not as I haven't seen or heard from him since. He could be a millionaire living somewhere in the Bahamas or dead for all I know. He was super erratic so he might have just been crazy enough to go all in on it.
My biggest regret was not being linux smart enough to figure out GPU mining on ethereum when it first started. At the time (launch day) there were only a handful of miners.

So who will list this? Has anyone come forward saying they will offer it on their platform?
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:12:22
That's not how mining difficulty works. If we did switch, ASICs would be worthless... GPUs would be the most efficient way to mine BTC. Everyone who wanted to would switch over the GPU mining BTC... after the 2 weeks or w/e blocks is needed for difficulty adjustment, the adjustment would kick in and even out any initial decreased or increased block reward. As more and more start using GPUs the difficulty gets higher and after a few difficulty adjustments and miners getting settled... the amount of $$ in electricity to mine a block would be the same as it is now (in theory). What you are arguing makes no sense except that it would probably cause  a major rift in bitcoin world and if not as many miners decided to continue mining bitcoin then the price would follow. More miners attracted to mining BTC -&gt; higher to price. 
There is nothing fundamentally different about switching from ASICs to GPUs or the other way around.

Most Americans have their retirement money stuck in 401k because its an automatic thing employers do. They match a certain % you put in and it's tax free until you take it out. It's not better but they don't have a choice unless they want to take the penalty and also pay the income tax on that right away too. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:33:27
You can mine with GPU now but ASICs are more efficient. Probably 100% of miners use ASICs so that one GPU miner would be paying WAY more than them in electricity to do the equivalent amount of hashes per second. So again if everyone was on a level playing field (using GPUs) the difficulty would adjust downwards, money amount in electricity should be about the same after some time to find equilibrium, and mining would continue as normal.

"Ethereum is for beginners." Their attitude pretty much sums up the pace of development. LN will change Bitcoin then in ten years the code will be cleaned up and optimized. Right now there is no real direction until LN is fully ready but it will be epic as they are much further along than all other blockchains.

I would guess a lot less than $84 billion has been invested in bitcoin. You would only get a market cap of $170 billion if bitcoin decided to issue like 20 million more coins allowing the supply to fill the demand completely. The question is how many bitcoins are actually for sale. Maybe half or a quarter? If a quarter then my guess is that bitcoin would reach closer to $20,000 per bitcoin. Add in FOMO and a major hype bubble and it could reach $30,000. My guess is we get there by the end of 2018. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 01:27:18
The good news is as Bitcoin usage and popularity goes up so does price. I don't know exact numbers off hand but the network is overly strong right now. Meaning we have room to lose some security and remain secure enough. Also I believe there is still plenty of profit for miners so they could afford to make less and keep their machines on hence retaining the security of the network.

We'll see if he is or not maybe. There is obviously no way or proving it and he made sure it wasn't probable for good reason. If that is the reason why you think he's not satoshi then you are just being ignorant.

How do you act aggressive when you are on the internet and building your invention... he actually makes a good point about that other part too. He doesn't need to tell anyone. That would only undermine his own creation. Unlike vitalik, he does not want to be king (or be a target etc). If the world knew if would change him. IMO this only strengthens the case that he is. Would satoshi, a person who has this mysterious persona admit his true identity for no reason? No he would hide it or if needed due to circumstances go just to the very edge of proof and leave it at that. Proving something without actually proving it is very satoshi like.

@_date: 2017-07-04 08:57:15
True. I think the main takeaway is that many core proponents are stuck on the idea that nodes should be able to be run on such a low performance device and may be holding back the network to defend cheap nodes. I really gained some valuable insight from listening to the EOS talk with Dan. 3...7... txs / sec is a joke and maybe we shouldn't be limiting our network for the sake of cheap nodes when all you really need is to up the requirement... 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:29:00
Core has nothing to do with it tho. The code is supposed to be written by garzik and miners then run that code... bitmain tweeted they will run the segwitx2 so if they don't end up doing it then we know they are just being malicious once again and trying to pull something. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 09:51:51

@_date: 2017-07-04 06:54:07
If you have not already watched this clip, please do so. I am sure most people here subscribe to both rbitcoin and rbtc but if you don't, I feel it is important to do so as to not miss any important developments. 
I say this because I have only received negative feedback from this sub in regard to the latest Craig Wright video.. I finally took the time to watch the thing in full and I have to say I was surprised by what he had to say. Most here disregard Craig for his outlandish behavior and find it easy to dismiss him but I think there is actually a strong chance he is indeed Satoshi given the circumstantial evidence. No one else I have seen speak about bitcoin in the way that he does. It's hard to explain but he speaks as someone would of their own invention. 
Why is this important? "Even is he is Satoshi he does not have the best ideas to propel bitcoin to it's fullest potential..." he has a true vision and goal for where bitcoin should be and where it will go. Always think bigger picture. One of the reasons I was attracted to bitcoin over btc is because core devs have a vision of bitcoin with LN / sidechains that actually makes sense. Go ask someone from rbtc and 9/10 times it won't even makes sense. Craig actually makes a good case for his vision which IMO is even bigger than rbitcoin/core. 
Anyway, feel free to make your own judgment but I think this is a good enough talk for people here to take seriously enough to actually watch.  
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:56:00
Did you watch the talk? Seriously it's pretty good and I would be very interested to hear why you think this speech he gave is intended to be a scam.
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:03:56
Ok. I guess what I was thinking would happen is more like a hard fork. This only really affects new coins so I would be careful to not keep coins on an exchange where "yours" (old coins) might be mixed in with new mined coins. 
Thanks for explaining. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:59:15
Seems likely but after hearing old folk tales it seems many people may have been involved yet it was still satoshi who was tracking down people with expertise asking for help on a project. I think it's actually unlikely there was a collective that released the genesis block. Satoshi was the one person to mine initially. Others joined in as they heard about it online. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 09:46:24
Scaling seems to be his motivation. Mining partnership only makes sense if he's blocking segwit. Bitmaim can give him a major deal and be his ally. He straight up said he has a mining operation with the pool either reaching or will reach 20%. Hashpower equals voting power. Conspiracy theory not needed. Mostly everything he says checks out and he is pretty upfront about this whole thing 
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:51:27
Hmm so I could buy a bunch of amazon gift cards and liquidate them for bitcoin... interesting. Great idea thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:16:04
I said that because making a statement such as "we need to do a PoW change now" is extremely irrational and reckless given what bitcoin is. If you follow both subs and maintain open mindedness you will see vitriol from both sides but generally has much more of it and given the recent UASF talk people over here are starting to throw around these same dangerous ideas. The whole censorship thing started here because of exactly what you are talking about and thus r/btc was formed. 
There will always be 2 sides to every story just as there is in politics between democrats and republicans. Unfortunately this topic is not simple and will not be easy to form your own opinion on but that is just the way of the world.  
Given how technical this topic being discussed is you would generally want to at least listen to the smartest people in the room first then hear rebuttals. The smartest people in the room are core and it's not hard to find rebuttals in r/btc. 
The last thing I will say is that Jihan controls the biggest mining operation in the world and is the CEO of the dominating ASIC producer. He has shown time and time again to be malicious and should not be trusted. Generally regards him and Roger Ver highly. Both are miners who do not posses a deep understanding of the protocol such as developers do. There is also a conflict of interest given off chain scaling should in theory take part of the mining rewards away from miners and many core developers are involved with blockstream company who is developing 2nd layer solutions. 
In the end for the basic user such as 99% of us, it comes down to "does 2nd layer solutions or onchain solutions better suite me." To me, it makes sense to develop 2nd layer solutions so we don't record every minuet transaction on the main chain if we don't need to. Why pay for all the security of the main chain if you are buying a pack of gum and why does that purchase of gun need to be immortalized on the blockchain? Miners see this as a threat and conflict arises... 
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:03:38
Umm no. Maybe "we" are bitcoin but saying "we" are satoshi is retarded. Also Craig Wright may sound like an idiot to some / most but he does has a better case at being satoshi than 99.9999% of pretty much anyone when you look at the facts. Who is a better Candidate? Most others have a legitimate backstory and only got into bitcoin much later.
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:16:32
Didn't Ver say he would never accept Segwit blocks?
@_date: 2017-07-04 07:06:34
I don't think you understand the context correctly. If we had 20k nodes bitcoin could scale to 500tx/s right now.... would that be such a bad thing? Maybe. The thing is we don't need 500k tx/s right now and in the future due to Moore's Law it will not cost us 20k $. Just be practical for 1 second. If we want to get into the 100k tx/s how do we achieve that? It is physically impossible to do with Raspberry Pis and that is all he is saying. To put this into context go read up on EOS (smart contracts - ethereum killer) it aims to reach scale much more quickly and easier than ethereum because it takes a practical route using expensive server farms. The point is if bitcoin doesn't do it then someone else probably will??? If you look at his chart it goes out to the 2030 and with the type of scaling he think it can achieve the price of bitcoin would be in the hundreds of thousands and if bitcoin is worth that much I think we could all easily afford to run 20k $ nodes to run the network.

@_date: 2017-07-12 16:07:04
Hmm. Not sure since I think it would depend on which wallet was used to send to tx. Can a wallet support both chains at the same time? In that case the tx would be broadcast to both chains as you said. If I used a wallet which does not support UASF 148 it would only broadcast to the one chain. If stored on an exchange which does this they hold the keys and may only broadcast my tx to the one chain then keep the other chain coins for themselves. Does this sound right? If so I think I only need to find a wallet which supports both...

Adding onto what you said, basically there will always be extremists who will never be happy with any direction bitcoin is headed. Segwit2x gives core exactly what they want then calls for a hard fork down the road. All that does is leave it to the miners who want a capacity increase to fork bitcoin. That is literally the same exact position they have been in for 3 years except core gets segwit now... boohoo, lets all cry about getting exactly what we wanted and not having to suffer through UASF / chain split and we don't get to punish Jihan with a PoW change (which is more retarded than anything rbtc could ever come up with).

UASF nodes only pick up certain blocks. When I send a tx it will be verified by both UASF miners and non separately .... that is when the two separate coins will be created? Segwit and non segwit coins... if I sent the coins (after august 1) to an address I held the private keys to I would need a UASF supported wallet to see both the new segwit coins and at the same time I will see the older non segwit coins.
