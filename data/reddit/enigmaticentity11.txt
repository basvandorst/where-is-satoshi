Have not sent ETH recently, but when I have sent it from GDAX/coinbase the response time has been waaay faster than what we are currently experiencing with BTC. I think the longest wait has been 1hr for me.

Okay for sure. To everyone else who commented on this let’s keep updating each other. actually just received my 1st confirmation. I hope all your guys’ confirmations go through as well

Thanks a lot. For future reference, after how many hours should I be “worried”?

Damn sorry to hear that. That’s crazy. What’s going on?! Will you get the funds sent back to your coinbase/gdax account after it’s been 24hrs?

Great that’s good. Not sure if you guys have logged into coinbase/gdax recently. Just did and they had a notification saying that “ETH and BTC transactions may be delayed by several hours.” Wanted to give y’all a heads up.

Oh okay I see. Yeah I’ve still have zero confirmations as of now so now I’m going on almost 10 hours. I’ve sent BTC before and it’s never really taken this long smh.

Thanks a lot I appreciate the response. Do you know if the BTC transaction will be reversed at some point and the BTC credited back into my Gdax account if there ends up being no confirmation? Ive read on other posts that that can happen after 24hrs? Not too sure here.

Do you have any confirmations at all? I’m still at zero 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:07:36
Nice. Okay I see. Really appreciate all of your guys’ comments. New to reddit, but I’ve been checking on posts daily and learning a lot from you all. Thanks.

Wow I hope it doesn’t get that low, but who knows at this point?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:33:59
How low do you guys think the price will go? I’ve been buying little bits here and there since the price was at 6000, but now it looks like it’s heading toward 5500 :(. Still HODLING no matter what.
