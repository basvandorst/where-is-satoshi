Sorry globe, your online subscription model isn't working for me

Maybe because it's literally being traded as a commodity on a futures exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:13
You guys remember when it was 17k?

Say you're a farmer that grows corn. Some years are good, some are bad. You can't stand the bad years (you need to feed the family). So I come in and say, I'll buy your corn for next years crop at a pre determined price. If crop is good, I get cheaper price. If crop is bad, you still make money and I eat the loss. It's basically insurance for the farmer and a set price / stable price for me.
Edit; bitcorn is being treated the same way, ie. as a commodity

That's like saying, "don't worry, it's not just your house burning down, it's your neighbours too"

None of my alerts worked

Key word you used is "job".
This guy has a "career". Some people genuinely like and care for the work they do which helps other people

Now back down

It's all relative- and no moral takeaway whatsoever. If you've ever been at one of these stuffy old boys clubs, they're just pissing contests.

Lichess better
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:18:49
Ok thank you

No problem. Everyone has to learn at some point

It's called arbitrage.
You call Soeul and tell them to send you all the bitcoins

No time to type the USD? Preparing 17k thread I assume
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:16:07
Why can't I look at $xbt charts on Questrade?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:59:05
I have no idea, why?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:37:25
A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing. 
I'd rather be friends with a shepherd than someone with a BA in arts 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:12:34
How much to atms charge?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:16:06
That's not the right analogy. The right analogy in the second scenario would be if Apple is down because the tech sector is down, not all stock.

Also from here
I can't access my old Reddit account- I assume someone already stole all those bitcoins. I was gifted some bitcoins (around $380 today) but oh well
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:18:00
Hey thanks for the tip - unfortunately I can't access my old Reddit account. I suspect it was hacked-
Good to see you're still active here. Take care

There's an exclusive club with only 21,000,000? That's like at least 2 times better than the 1/42 000 000

Best of luck NaabKing.

I read a lot of stupid shit on this sub, but this... this has potential to be the king of them all
