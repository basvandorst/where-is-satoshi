Yea I never use reddit but I looked at the chart and thought people might be talking about it. Everyone cheared when there was a Dif decrease the first time. I point out how it has dropped off way more right now and everyone is mad. Maybe it is due to the price drop also. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:12:28
Of course he could just say it came back with in a few years. How about your coins?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:23:23
There are bad apples in every group. I agree it is very disrespectful but do not blame a whole community. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:50:24
Wow people are hating for me pointing it out? Hashrate down 22PH since 2 days ago. And 28 PH from peak. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:17:08
Maybe I should have said dropping vs tanking. But dropping 20 ph is a lot in a short time. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:57:41
Well said. People need to remember this. It might be painful now. But as long as you have your health you can still fight and rise from the ashes. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:29:07
Are you saying no one should trade coins?
@_date: 2014-09-09 05:44:11
Out of all my friends and family about 3 know of BTC. And 2 of the 3 are because of me. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:31:17
You may want to look again.     
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:33:41
I know it will be back soon. The coins PoW ends Sat. All I am pointing out is that is a pretty big drop off. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:35:08
There are 2 paycoins. The new one is sha and it had at the time 84 ph on mining power. Not sure what it is now. The PoW ends on sat for it so it will be short lived. But still a lot of power taken away. Albiet for a short time. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:22:09
Yep it swings wildly since most is rented. It also ends in about 13 hours I think and then it will be PoS coin. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:56:04
You really have no compassion for other humans do you? Even if people made bad choices we do not need to rub their faces in it. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:06:57
Guess not. I didnt even think it was neg. I figured some miners would be happy because their rigs will last a bit longer. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:53:23
I think people are miising the fact that GAW's Paycoin is pulling a huge amount of hashrate. Nice hash was paying 600% 2 days ago. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:27:16
Now that would be nice if it went that high. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:32:49
And at this moment such pool is reporting the coin has a network hashrate of 74.63 PH. So maybe pull your head out of your ass and your tiny world and look around once. I will even help with this link.  look at XPY aka Paycoin
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:12:41
Yea I think BTC will be fine. I think it will all come back here on sat.
@_date: 2014-12-19 05:58:39
Why do I get a downvote? If dif were to adjust now we would drop 3% thats pretty big. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 05:53:42
I think a lot have shifted to paycoin for the next few days. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:48:14
XPY is taking it.  It has 84 PH network right now. I started a post talking about how fast BTC networked is dropping right now and all I got was hate from people for me pointing it out. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:35:42
Keep Up the great work SYNC foundation!!
@_date: 2014-12-19 08:13:51
Yes I know what it is doing. This is still a pretty good short term drop off. I know this only puts us back to where we were around oct 23rd. I dont mean for this topic to be taken as the sky is falling. Just pointing it out because that is a nice drop off. My guess is by Sun it will be back. But for those mining they can hope for it to come down a bit and proling their miner. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:56:40
I agree in terms of value of coins. I talking more about how people need to try and keep perspective. Being broke is not the end of the world. It will make life harder but you can still make it work.  
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:35:39
I will add another one of the screen shots. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:43:06
This will not help anyone. It makes you look childish that you have to name call. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:09:41
You know you want to join the Darkside. (assumeing thats what you thing paycoin is) ;-)
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:07:34
If you say it enough times you will eventually be right.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:57:57
Well you might not want to smoke so much. That much is bad for your health. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:08:20
My guess is that is just normal trading risk. They are trying to protect their customers which the way I read it is they will allow some sort of buy back for $4 per coin for those. Of course just a guess and even if I am right we will see if it ever happens. I am glad he is saying he will do something but I will not really believe it until I see it happen.
