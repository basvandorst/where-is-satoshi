Why are you calling people names? do you have any manners?

It pops out on the general reddit, and I expressed my opinion.

This is the part I don't like about the whole Bitcoin saga and it is scary.

I am just speaking my mind, no troll. I say it as I see it.

Agreed 100% not sure why the rest can't comprehend it! I am happy to stay away from something risky and don't have time to learn it, sorry. I am using my regular bank's app to make all kind of transactions for years now, smooth sailing.

The money is there in my bank, not raided and lost for ever, I can just go to another bank and get my money. In my whole life, never been to a bank and was told I can't get my money, never. I always have access to my money 24h/24h

Too many variables, good luck keeping up with all the changes, I go to my bank knowing my money is there everyday, not worried every minutes, my $100k will be taken away at every corner. As right now, real banking system guarantees people their money, it is still more safe than Bitcoin, with all the bizarre wallets raids, we read about now and then, why do I need a fortress in my computer? let the bank deal with that and not me!

I have a job and I make money and I deposit it in the bank and it is there whenever I want it, if the bank got robbed, not my business they need to secure it, I still got my money :) in other hand with Bitcoin, if you lose your wallet, does someone pay you back? Honest question, is there any type of money back or insurance?
@_date: 2018-10-25 18:11:09
I simply mentioned my opinion, some do agree with me and some don't, I wish you the best with Bitcoin, and I am not ready yet to make the plunge, until then good luck

There are car insurance and the police to investigate the accident, and eventually you will get your car back etc etc But who will give your coin back?

This is why general public need to stay away from Bitcoin, anything can happen and you will lose your money, too many variables and too complex for any citizen with limited knowledge of this monetary system. If you are average in internet and computers, please stay away OR you will become broke.

Not for me,  thank you anyway. I only go make the money and I let somebody else do the guarding. Ain't got time for that!
@_date: 2018-10-25 23:27:06
Thank you, will definitely follow it the day I start using Bitcoin
