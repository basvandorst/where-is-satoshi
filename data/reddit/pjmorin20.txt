They are a good starting point, but they charge outrageous fees because they know they are the easiest, quickest route.

For others: No sensitive questions/personal info asked....pretty straightforward

Lol 
How DARE anyone sell anything thats up between 50-150% over last month!
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:08:13
I would agree with that.  Certainly good starting point, then moving funds to gdax gives you alot more 'hands on' option in that you are actually able to set limit orders and such
I personally went with binance (as opposed to Gemini) because they have the highest volume totals.... liquidity is always a plus

Any buy or sell on coinbase is automatically 1% above/below market price (1% against your favor)
ACH transfers take well over a week
Other deposits are way more than a dollar

Furthermore....wasnt the wsj that blew a routine discussion out of proportion 
Get a grip

Thank you for sharing.  Very thoughtful post
@_date: 2019-11-09 23:52:51
ok...i cant argue that definition there.  ��
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:09:32
thank you for the reply.
so quick google search of costs per state in the US....i think the cheapest state was at like .09 something.  long story short: next to impossible mining for profits in the US. (let alone eastern seaboard)
also, is that ratio about the same for ETH or mining other coins?  
is it doable with a name other than BTC with electric costs around, say, 0.13 p/kwh?

if i may ask, what sort of $$ investment have you made into said setup?  
has it always lost you 0.50 a day? does that roi change with price?
i know im years late to the whole mining gig... but its still something of interest to me and have been halfheartedly trying to figure out if there is any path to profiting from mining from a small personal setup (as opposed to the huge mining consortiums in China, etc)

um wait.... isnt that the LITERAL definition of what makes someone a 'professional'?
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:21:15
what do you mean that 'would' be
sadly, it already is

Belfort was a pretty smart guy too....

Lets try it...
Whats yours?
@_date: 2018-06-21 05:46:52
Nothing of relevance in that article.  Waste of 60 seconds

Wtf is Gab 
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:06:44
My head hurts now...
@_date: 2019-10-22 18:34:35
oof da! where to even begin!  i suppose in order....
1. i again will use the same example : ask AAPL how monetarily valuable those metals are.  
2. i cant disagree with your next point though... bitcoin infact seems to have about the same practical applications as xmas lights, swimming pools, etc,    kinda cool, but yeah... really anything more beyond a 'bell and whistle'? 
3. here's the one i couldnt wait to get to...
are you comparing pirated music to a government controlled money supply?   even in the madness that is reddit you cannot possibly suggest that a government will respond in a similar fashion to someone listening to free music versus subverting their control over money supply.  
are you serious???
no really... i mean it:  did you seriously just compare a controlled money supply with pirated music????
4.  so your bitcoins cant be seized?  yeah no government entity has EVER gone after someone's bitcoins have they.....
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:06:47
lets be real here...how does bitcoin matter, monetarily?
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:44:18
He spent his time in jail. He paid his debt to society. 
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:15:44
thank you for that explanation.
on a somewhat related question, is it even possible anymore for a 'little guy' to mine bitcoin and see any sort of results?  without being some huge mining operation?  is a 5-10k investment into mining rigs/etc worth it anymore?
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:31:57
And when i send you 1 ETH you send me back 5, right sir? �� 
@_date: 2019-10-22 07:24:18
i didnt ask it.... you did.... doh
yes im confused...are we talking about central banks and currencies? or are we talking along the lines of gold and other commodities?  big difference....
as for the monetary value of other metals:
gold and most other metals have practical applications in things we use in our every day lives.  
what practical application does bitcoin have other than a massive energy hog?
ask AAPL the monetary value of the metals used in EVERY SINGLE LAST ONE of their devices.... 
ask HOV the monetary value of the metals used in EVERY SINGLE LAST ONE of their homes....
ask GM the monetary value of the metals used in EVERY SINGLE LAST ONE of their cars....
etc ad nauseam. 
ask _____ the monetary value of BTC used in ____ ?   i dont even know how to formulate that question.  
and if you think bitcoin or some pseudo-'decentralized' 'currency' will ever be the 'norm' ...ie governments ceding one of their most critical tools of power...controlling the money supply... you are just simply delusional.
and don't get me wrong....im no bitcoin hater. not in the least.  but to suggest it has any more practical value than say, a CDO created..nothing more than a synthetic derivitive.. by some smart bankers/traders at GS, is pretty far reaching.
@_date: 2019-04-26 03:36:52
as you post one about both.....
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:17:49
That seems logical, but it seems to be the other way around here.
And i can appreciate the anti-spam measures... but if i havent 'passed' yet..than its simply more hassle than its worth.  
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:28:09
Just offers a perspective of those %'s using a (relatively current) base price of 9000 for BTC
So, for example, if you were trying to make up for a 50% loss, and you bought BTC at 9k, you would need to see it at 18000 
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:47:42
All depends on what starting and ending points you are using within the bigger journey.....
Easy to make money, much harder to keep it.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:34:05
Depends on what your definition of 'always' is
Also depends on what your definition of 'is' is.
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:43:54
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:23:40
This is true.
However, wouldn't you still want to protect as much of that as possible?
Sure you can ride it back to 90 from 9000 (using your example), and break even...but then what was it all for?   
The principles of risk management still apply.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:36:54
haha...nicely done sirs.
nicely done
