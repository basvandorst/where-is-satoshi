Despite all the naysaying Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond, etc have some value. And people are willing to mine these as long as they can quickly turn around and sell the rewarded coinbases. 
Even if nobody mines your forked coin, it's still a forked bitcoin. It's worth exactly 1 forked bitcoin. But as I said it might not have significant value compare to fiat like USD. Despite all of this, new and new forks for bitcoin and other shitcoins are created almost daily. And thus adding to the number of available cryptos.

Bitcoin isn't scare. Stop trying to scam people. All you need to do is fork Bitcoin and you have 21 million more Bitcoin. Might to have same value in terms of fist. But you can't create infinite bitcoin forks. So far we have many dozens. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, bitcoin sv, Bitcoin gold, btc dark, etc, etc. And all other cryptos are also in a way forks of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin will have have as long as we give it value. And a whole lot of us are waiting for greater fools to unload your Bitcoin. But sure I'm in it for the technology. Anything to raise the price. 
Hodl hard, baby. Hodl hard.

Countries like US, Israel, KSA, Bin Laden, etc are already using trillions of USD to commit war crimes and terror against people. I don't see you bitching about fiat.  Money is a tool. Fiat and BTC can be used for good or it can be used for bad. One isn't inherently more evil than others. Terrorism is a police issue. It needs to be solved by police and global justice for all. Bitcoin or fiat can't solve the problem of terrorism.

When you fork bitcoin, you don't only fork 1m of it. You fork the whole thing. Everyone who has pre-fork bitcoin also has the post-fork bitcoin. When bitcoin was forked into BCH, BTG, etc, I got exact number of those as I had BTC. I ain't complaining. Literally creating money from thin air. Sold BCH when it was around $4500. 
When you fork bitcoin or any crypto, you are not deleting the old chain. You just made a copy and increased the supply of crypto. But as I said your new chain usually won't have same value in terms of fiat as your pre-fork coins. When BCH was created, Roger Ver and Wu didn't delete BTC. They just doubled the supply for bitcoin. Sadly their new chain wasn't worth as much as BTC. 
Anyhow I don't gain any thing from convincing you of this. Actually as a btcoin hodler I lose. People need to think bitcoin is scarce and drive up the price so much that I can sell and let others hold the bag while I drive away in my lambo with bags of USD. That's really the end goal.

If bitcoin is currency, then banks are not going anywhere. We will need banks as long as the concept of money exists. Banks have existed for thousands of years and they will for thousands more.

They don't have to ban crypto-currency.  You can't ban it. What you can ban is people from using it and merchant from accepting it. Just like how they ban drugs, people can't use it legally.  In a roundabout way, US can ban crypto like China, India, Bangladesh, and many other countries have done so. If crypto becomes widely used it will destabilize world economy.  So as bitcoiner, we need to be careful about what we are unleashing or else will have valuable bitcoin but nothing to use it for.

You can get away from doing that by never using your crypto. Isn't that the point...hodl to infinity?
