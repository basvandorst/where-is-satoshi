this is actually pretty scary to me. I was about to open a separate checking account so that if my coinbase account was compromised not all of my savings would be linked. I still have yet to buy my first bitcoin, but stuff like this keeps making me think i'm way over my head.

Most of the banks that have responded to BTC activities said that as long as the transaction s are under $10,000 you should be fine. That number is the maximum you can transport, or pretty much do anything without having to declare a reason why.

Unlikely, our largest bank, bank of America would rather it die in a fire since any kind of mass bitcoin adaptation would halt their money laundering business.

How can you bring your customers to declare flagged transactions when you are suspect of laundering and doing the same.

I'm going to say federal. Since they think you are trying to evade taxes, it wouldn't be easy to control if it varied state to state.

If your financial records are strictly internal to the bank itself, as they should, and it is your money, why the fuck would it cause reputational risk. I looked up wikipedia definition and I guess they don't like it when people circumvent the bank as a middleman
@_date: 2014-09-18 21:00:27
If BTC ever does drop down that far again, you will probably be paying at the top of the curve still.

Volatility is great for investing, not so great for people planning on using it to make day to day transactions.

You can't predict anything in the market. Tomorrow the price could go to a penny and the next day thousands of dollars. You can try to accurately speculate based on what has happened in the past, but good luck.

The car is one of a kind because it was the first purchased with BTC? Why don't you just say it was the first one to go through a drive through at a new McDonalds, because that is about as special as your car gets to the next Tesla.

but guise look at dis line I traced, bitc01n is only going to go up based on its history!!

Ok, and what are you using for that?

Hold on for a longer period of time. Otherwise in the end you will probably spend more in transaction fees than you will make.

Is it still profitable to buy a bfl 5gh/s? It would run in my dorm so the electric is technically free, and it would be a Christmas gift. I looked on the profitability calculator, and it would take about 3 weeks for a substantial return. However, with more as ics being used, how long would I realistically expect the hardware to perform as the difficulty increases?
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:03:40
Ok, what woud you recommend otherwise? have you been turning a profit at all? The price jump kinda scared me because I was looking at buy a lot of bitcoins when the bank of Cyprus collapsed, I really regret it now too, $70 at the time. :(
I was looking on craigslist, but nobody near me, and would you really trust those guys? Could you load up some malware on those things and steal other people's bitcoins?

All I have to do is wait for Bitcoins to get astronomically high in value.

Bitcoin has still been a very volatile market despite its promising growth. I wouldn't be surprised to see one worth less than $300 in a matter of hours. Almost every single current event/retailer/person has an impact on Bitcoin's performance. If someone with a ton of BTC decided to cash out now, the market would drop greatly depending on the yield and amount of time.
 You cannot use past performance as an indicator for what it would be worth in the future. It's kinda like the stock exchange pre black tuesday. Everything was growing ten fold until the brokers realized they couldn't pay back the stocks that were backed with their non-existent credit line.
