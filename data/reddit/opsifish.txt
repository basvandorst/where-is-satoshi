He means he thought btc was rising to high and would crash soon. It will but that will happen in January. (Source: btc price history by month.)

In general, I think BCH should probably wear a helmet because it is at risk of taking a tumble at anytime; however, it does look like BCH may have more than good months in December/January. (Expecially BTC crashes in particular if something of the mt.gox varity happens)

Honestly, computer repair is the gym teacher of computer science. My dad was a computer repairman and taught me how when I was kid. I learned quick enough that, even though he is a great electrician, his computer science knowledge wasn't up to date at all. 
That being said there are teachers that are great computer repair/computer science teachers, but they are usually not their for the paycheck because they made a fortune in the 90s - 00s.

Oh you, that's a depression. A lot of coins coins would be hurt. 
Hypothetically, if  something happened and then the  NasDaq pulls BTC futures program. This would undermine, to put it lightly, consumer confidence in BTC and then even BTC could be thrown to the wolves during this depression. (This would do a lot of things BTC, but I am not trying write a novella and simply. Fell free to point out any errors.) It would become a competition of technology not flashy PR. (which BTC has gotten forcefully or not)
Big money likes ETH too much for it to fall though. ETH has the technology side down too; logically, ETH becomes the post depression leader.
