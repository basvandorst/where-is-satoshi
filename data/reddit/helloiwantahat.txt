Honestly, this is starting to get ridiculous. How can we allow this little clown to have so much control?

Wow, a spam article at the top of r/bitcoin. If youre going to moderate this subreddit, why not include sewage like this?

Craig was never a part of the development of bitcoin - he has no knowledge of how it works. He is a scam artist and professional idiot. Really tiers me to see him mentioned here all the time.
