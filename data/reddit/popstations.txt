When there is a 4x times as many murders between two first world countries, it tells that there is huge underlying problem in the country with the more murders. And we didnt even get to the prison rate, that is over 11x as sweden. These stats are not typical for a first world country, You are competing with second world countries with those stats.
Nope it was average income. 


They are not close to 0, unless if you live in a gated community. 
A city with huge ghetto/gang issues in sweden is still more peaceful than a normal city in the USA.

I mean thanks to Trump, we are now talking about relying less on USA and making moves to phase out our dependence on american businesses and intervention, now here in Europe.

Well.. yeah of course. The income per capita is higher in the US than the Sweden, therefore it will skew that data up. Beside you could also look which types of countries are over the U.S and i could still point fingers.
Doesn't it alarm the bells, when you are about 4 times more likely to be murdered in the U.S than in Sweden.

What’s worse is that people thinks bitcoin somehow defeats the greedy rich people and the corrupt system. The truth is that if the greedy and corrupt people had to choose between bitcoin or the stock market, they would take bitcoin in a heart beat. Because the stock market are heavily regulated. As much as people love the idea of a decentralized currency system the cryptocurrencies still needs to be polished, and it is currently not a threat to fiat.

The best countries are those that are socialdemocratic, though. The living standards in Sweden is a lot better than the U.S.
There is no point comparing death tolls of socialism. When other ideas have millions of skeletons in their backyard aswell

Really though? I would say the opposite. American businesses have thrived because of the influence the U.S have/had.

Liechtenstein doesnt even got 100.000 citizens. Doesnt make sense to create statistic of murders per 100.000 when they dont even got 100.000 living there. Lol

Murder is important especially when the rates are significantly high. Four times as many murders is no joke. That is insane. It is for the whole country, i cant imagine what the stats is for the cities who is the biggest offender.
That is murder though, gun violence etc are not looking good aswell.
I am saying  that the average income is misleading. Because the income gap between the rich and poor is big in the US, it doesnt give the picture of the typical american.
It is better to be from lower class to middle class (majority of the people) in Sweden than the US for instance.

Nah, were the office 365 to be of someone else that is 'foreign' to Europe we would immediately find an alternative. The american culture effect on Europe is easy to see. I don't think if  Facebook/Google or the Office program were to be Chinese or Russian it would ever have been accepted in our educational institutions. You also should notice that our style of clothes is basically of American origin or inspired.
We never questioned the reliabilty and security when the products was american, because we basically are allies(even though allies dont spy on each others) until recent years. 
I mean our government (Denmark) recently bought several american fighter jets and it was one of the biggest defence spending we have made in a long time. It was accused to not be of any practical use and pretty much a waste of money, but many believe it was to make the americans happy (political points)

Sounds like bitcoin. I dont get why people cant see this, its obvious that more people is investing in bitcoin than actually use it.
