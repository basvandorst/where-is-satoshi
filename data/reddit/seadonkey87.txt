Whales still in control. I think they will supress until end of next week, then we will see the next mini bull run

I'm pretty new to btc. Do you mean if the price plumets and hash rates go down, mining difficulty decreases?
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:38:58
I will offer you my legal expertise for a prepayment of 1 btc

But that's over $5mil a coin average price if you inc all coins yet to be mined. I'd definately be selling for $5mil
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:11:03
I'll keep your mind at peace. Send me your coins and I'll hodl them for you

Fiat currency not going away anytime soon. But lets assume it does. Well I would consolidate my wealth in less volatile assets such as property, stocks and for those anti-government types here, I guess you could buy gold to hold value. I mean, if I made it big on btc, I probably reduce my holdings as I prov won't be able to handle the huge swings on such large values

Good news guys. Binance plans to add Euro by end of 2018 and other fiat pairings down the track.
"The venue will allow euro trading later this year from its Malta operations, Zhao said by phone on Monday. He plans to add other fiat currencies, he said, without providing details. Binance said in March it would set up a base in Malta."

B) Apparently according to Tether, every USDT is backed by real US currency and you can redeem each USDT for USD. I have no idea where you're meant to redeem it though

For over $5mil a coin average, people would gladly move coins out of cold storage and sell online. But prices are essentially set but supply and demand. If you offer a high enough price, people will sell to you.
Honestly I don't see the purpose of buying all the coins. The coins are only worth value due to the value of the network. If you hold all 21mil coins and no one else has coins, that's a pretty useless network

Lets hope you're right. Lets stock up
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:36:54
Yep I get that. But why does the other guy say if hash rates drop, then mining will be profitable? Does difficulty decrease, or do you just share the new coins amongst less people?

I think about 245-255bil marketcap has always shown strong support. Like ridiculously strong support so I think we close to a bottom

You're probably true but I'm sure the land slide victims would still appreciate it

Are these widgets for web pages? I would love this on my galaxy s8 home page. Is there anything for that?

Tom Lee from fundstrat says the cost of mining atm is about $7000 with it increasing to about $8000 end of year. Couple other places I read previously quote similar figures. BTC is currently running at break even or minor losses. Some less efficient places are temporarily turning off miners

I'd happily sell my btc for a good premium 
@_date: 2018-07-02 07:27:29
True. They asked him if he honestly thinks it will get to 50k by year ends and he said he pulled that number out of the air and doesn't care and that he only cares for volatility cos that's where he makes money 
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:17:28
Yes. Pass the money over and I'll just buy OTC
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:15:29
Donate your profits to charity then. Otherwise stop talking shit

Prob BTC crash. Most retail and small wall st people are invested in both. If stocks crash they will either get margin calls on the stock market or take some risk off the table (crypto is a risky investment). Either case being bearish for BTC
