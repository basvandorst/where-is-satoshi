I've been waiting for 11hrs and shit you not all of a sudden I get 4 confirmations on my tx. 
It's like the bitcoin angels have smiled upon me. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:52:36
Yes. Sell it to me. 
I offer to buy $1 per BTC.

Roger ver and Jihan Wu playing Crypto-politics mostly. 
People been talking about it all day.

Donate to the poor. Volunteer at the soup kitchen. Do whatever you have to do to repair your Karma debt I suppose lol.

DICKS OUT FOR LOUIS CK!
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:28:17
Then you're either paying next block fee or what cos at the moment, there's like 100,000 transactions waiting. 
The miners are really jumping ship and the users are caught with their dicks hanging out. 
Including mine. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:18:42
Do you donate to the poor?
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:23:53
I don't think I can do that on my end, it's a withdrawal from a fund's wallet. I've already contacted their customer support, still waiting for a response on their end. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:06:50
I tried that earlier too before i made the post. It says "Transaction queued already!" when I try again. What the hell is going on with BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:33:41
There's no good or bad guy in crypto, only self-interest
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:59:29
I've been waiting for 10 hours now, 280sat/B fee. 
Stttill not there yet. Accelerators have been used, rebroadcasted a few times. Still not working.

The network is congested is half the story. 
Roger ver and Jihan Wu are starting a war within Bitcoin , there's currently a miner flight away from BTC to BCH. 
It's currently 103.4% more profitable to mine BCH than BTC.
This congestion is not going to be solved in the next day or two at least.

Lightning Network. 
Roger ver was confronted with this at the Hong Kong fintech conference. His only come back was "if you don't like it, don't use it".

I've been waiting for 11hrs and counting. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:52:08
There are currently 137,000 unconfirmed transactions on the blockchain so far. And the transaction per second has dropped from around 25 ish to 11 since 12 hours ago. 
You're gonna be waiting for a few days. If the transaction isn't confirmed within 72 hours, it gets dropped from the mempool I believe. 
The miners are really jumping ship to BCH. RBF and pay at least $10 for the transaction if you want to see it pass through within the day. Welcome to BTC politics. 
EDIT: I made my transaction 36hrs ago, it took 12 hours for it to confirm. That was when the network still had 11M TH/s, now it only has 8M TH/s. 
You're gonna be waiting for DAYS for the transaction to pass if the hash rate keeps dropping. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:53:16
We might laugh but that's over 2G of hardware resting on some bits of cardboard. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:11:44
That's.... that's not how a transaction gets confirmed. 
You have to mine the block. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:50:24
I waited 11 hrs for my BTC transaction to go through. And that's with average fees. 
You're gonna have to wait for a while on this one. On the upside it seems the transactions speed is really picking up lately. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:51:42
GDAX is spoofy heaven. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:00:35
Holy fark~

The more you say things like this , the more it seems like this whole thing is a political statement by Roger ver. 
Most of the transactions we are seeing are micro 20 bucks transactions. 0.000x. 
Unless you're telling me an entire nation's worth of people suddenly decided to use BTC for daily transaction I am calling this a sabotage on the BTC network. We lost 6M TH/s of hash power overnight to BCH coupled with the sudden influx of microtransaction , this is a coordinated attack, anyone with an ounce of brainpower can see through this. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:33:18
He's just back and forth ,back and forthing 50BTC, sometimes 500BTC. 
What the fuck is he up to? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:38:16
Lack of exchanges trading BCH pairs. If BCH does takeover, it's gonna have to incentivize a lot of exchanges to add BCH along side BTC as trading pairs. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:05:47
I like to use this analogy. 
Treat Crypto-economy as an emerging market nation. 
BTC is the national currency. 
The altcoins are the shares of the companies in that country. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:58:03
Already did hours ago, still waiting. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:26:43
I think most people on the new-posts are just trying to get their BTC between exchanges to trade but now they can't cos BTC network is getting fucked by the miners who are jumping ship. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:29:25
I've been watching the log for a while , a lot of the transactions we are seeing getting confirmed are micro-microtransactions like 0.000x BTC. 
Either we've achieved mass adoption or someone is spamming the network.
