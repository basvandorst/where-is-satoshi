This and Bitcoin can go together to the moon, except BCash and that snake Roger Ver!
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:00:31
No, but if you find one, please tell me.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:57:59
I think he lost is paper wallet!
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:51:22
I paid 50 euros to transfer from my Ellectrum to Ledger, I paid the fee and some security fee.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:19:02
I want you to get that private key and give that wallet to my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:37:00
Wait for the dip, I think that will have one in the nearly future.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:44:56
Where I can write my wallet address to someone make some magic?
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:45:07
Tirando o último parágrafo dizendo que não vale a pena, gostei da notícia, veremos por quanto tempo será assim.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:11:35
Maybe never, maybe tomorrow. I want to buy more BTC, so I need a dip :-D
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:38:05
Not Bitcoin Cash, it's BCash sir.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:23:56
The first thing that I did after wake up was to buy BTC, but I should wait 3 more hours for the really sale time!

In Portugal we have MBWay, it's the same principle but it's associated with your credit or debit card.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:23:55
I want to buy one, but I can just buy with Bitcoin, and that will stop my hodl!
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:52:40
If you want, I can send to you my wallet address and you maybe spare some coins :-D
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:01:47
Have you tried Coinbase, Cex.io, another exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:45:36
Wow, did you read that ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:28:34
I always buy on Coinbase. You can try Coinify
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:45:57
Wow, did you read that ?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:04:58
Not accepting bitcoin, just cash...
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:36:54
Now you know how to send bitcoin; you want to try to send some to my wallet? :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:00:11
On the internet have some news about [that](
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:04:58
Wow, did you read that ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:36:44
Go buy gold!
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:49:43
Wow, did you read that ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:44:08
Wow, did you read that ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:36:40
It's for you @_date: 2017-11-28 02:38:49
The only thing that they can hack now is his car.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:24:12
I invest every month some money on Bitcoin, but I always have the same problem "when I invest?". Invest half of the money, and see if you get a dip, if not, invest the rest of your money, in the future you will not regret.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:34:59
I think that everyone can make a wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:52:10
Buy, it's a sale!
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:01:12
I have 100€ ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:27:59
It's a paper wallet, they never will get him!
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:24:20
But the major part of the Bitcoin miners was Chinese.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:25:06
I'm hodl just for the Tesla!
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:55:56
Like me, my moon will be when reach 100K$
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:11:10
And I think that you are that type of guy that sell low and buy high!
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:38:39
Tenho que experimentar esse tasco!
@_date: 2018-12-09 09:33:47
Too late?
