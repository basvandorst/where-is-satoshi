Do you have any facts or evidence to support this claim?

I don't understand why so many "big players" in the Bitcoin community are so quick to **write off** the communities' 750K BTC loss.  I am weary of those individuals who act so passively as though they are trying to sweep this issue under the rug.
The principles of Bitcoin have inherently attracted people who don't settle for *status quo* We will band together as a community and use our collaborative intelligence and technology to dig deep and find answers.

I have to agree. MtGox is one of the reasons bitcoin was able to gain traction and grow so quickly. They were one of the earliest and largest exchanges who have a track record of billions of successful transactions. I am an early adopter and have more coin frozen than no. users here now, but I remain objective.

**Agreed** if he wanted to bail with a ton of coins, he had ample opportunities. Highly doubt OP's theory.
