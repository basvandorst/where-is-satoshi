How deep in terms of "confirmations" is it possible in real world scenerio with bitcoin/doge?

1. There will be plenty of users that will push balance to legacy address, intentional or by mistake. I am not forcing single address, but anyway I must check out old addresses too.
2. Are you sure that tx id cannot be changed? I header that some very large attack (mtgox?) was related to changing ID of tx in blockchain

Dudes, what's wrong with you?
You are so full of hate. 
 first you talk about competences to build transaction service, then you recommend "expose RPC API", what a hypocracy
 working balance/user transaction system has not a lot things connected to just bitcoin transactions environment. Transactions and balance are operating not on wallet but SQL in enterprise highly declarative and secured enviromnment, with high isolation transactions, monitor system etc. I have created already porducton working finnancial transaction systems without any problems throught the years.
 shitty programmer? Tell me in what way shitty programing is related to bitcoin? oh wait, yes, I have seen bitcoin source code and all this shitty wallet software, unscalable, unresponsive, broking files on power loss, memory leaked and its 5000 lines ofcode Main.cpp etc. Don't even compare it to other system, where most of those are barely-stable PHP &amp; Mongo using shit.
This is a Bitcoin community? maybe you have some more to say thad stupid criticism comments?
Do you even think about that, I have already working system that maybe you are already using, but want to discovery eventual bitcoin related problem, like that wich hit mt gox.
The best thing about that is is, that you all guys not given any valuable advice, but shitstorm. Did you even did something for sure with Bitcoin? I have changed wallet.dat format in source code, customized its encryption, changed JSON RPC protocol communication to differ from original and lot of hidden security.
