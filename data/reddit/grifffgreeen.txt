On and here's a video quickly explaining Giveth 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:35:28
Check out Giveth.io :-D We are very very close to launching our alpha where you can create your own blockchain based "charity" that we call a Decentralized Altruistic Community.
We are a 100% nonprofit decentralized community DAO-ifying charity, Empowering Donors to provide oversight over exactly how their donations get used and connecting the donors directly to the people making the change they want to see in the world (no charity in the middle).
We are on Ethereum right now but are very closely connected to RSK and will deploy our platform on their side chain when once we feel we have a steady DApp working on the Ethereum Blockchain. We presented at the Latin American Bitcoin Conference and I shared the stage with Deigo from RSK (and Peter Todd and Trace Mayer) and one of our founding members, Grace, helped RSK organize the conference. 
We accept ETH donations at `revolution.eth` which resolves to 0x5ADF43DD006c6C36506e2b2DFA352E60002d22Dc If you send us ETH from an address you own, you will receive Giveth Tokens which will be used for Giveth’s governance once we go full on DAO :-D
If you want to donate BTC our address is 3Q3eCqvwk2JPocfMBfC6oS5iA9S9wDXgYA 
Check us out on  and on twitter:  and if you want to start your own DAC so you can pick projects to support, sign up for the Giveth Slack at  and message  we can chat about how we can help you provide oversight over your donations to make sure they are effectively spent :-D

We are talking about 51% attacks, naming the tokens and the DAO, dealing with currency diversity, what place Slock.it GmbH will have in the DAO, what will the token sale look like and many other topics about how to build the world's first for-profit DAO from the ground up!
@_date: 2016-05-17 05:21:09
The main issue is the complexity of the DAO code, it would be very very very difficult to write (likely impossible) If you only had op codes.
Even if Rootstock's project is successful, the blocksize limit would be really hard to deal with when a DAO needs to split or other complex memory intensive actions need to be preformed.
There is no way to do it on the current bitcoin blockchain at the moment, and it is very doubtful that it could be done as easily as it can be done on Ethereum's blockchain because well... Ethereum was made for this.
Bitcoin is made to decentralize trust, and give people financial empowerment and independence. It does a great job at that, and obviously... I am a big fan of Bitcoin. But even with segwit it is the wrong blockchain for this task :-/

I can answer any questions any one has about any part of this project... Reply to this thread, or ping me with a :-)

Slock.it is building the worlds first real DAO and we have a Slack open to anyone interested in shaping how the Slock.it DAO will operate and discuss its implication on the sharing economy.
If you're interested in IoT + Blockchain, join the Slack! To do so, simply go on our website at  and sign up for the mailing list below the video. We'll send you an invite as soon as the next batch becomes available!
Please check your junk mail for the verification email :-)

But then again, i'm from the states where houses are cheaper then college degrees.
@_date: 2016-07-02 13:51:49
It is an online degree so you get what you make out of it.... 
I focused my studies on decentralizing the sharing economy, every hw assignment that came up i tried to bend it in that direction. I even made a white paper for a Bike Sharing project and was talking about using a "DAC" to make it work, [and I made a video for it]( It turns out that Slock.it was working on exactly what I was passionate about, so I was able to send them my white paper and the video I made for it, they liked it and gave me a job :-)... So it worked for me :-)

Nice! The Bitcoin Dr!!! :-) The more people we get studying this innovative technology, the faster we can get it out into the world so that it can start making a real noticeable change :-D 
I had no idea there were so many other programs in this field until I put this out there and got such a great response! 
I can't wait to read up more on your papers, they look fantastic!
@_date: 2016-07-04 12:59:56
It took me a second to find the info myself! But then i found this treasure trove of info :-D
From:  
The minimum admission requirements for the programme are:
Bachelor’s degree from an accredited university (Upper-Second or a GPA of 3.0 or higher).
Work Experience is a significant added qualification.
Proficiency in the English Language: Students satisfy the English requirements if their first degree was taught in English. Otherwise, they would need to present at least a TOEFL score of 550 paper-based or 213 computer-based, or GCSE “O” Level with “C” or IELTS with a score of 6.0 or score placement at the ENGL-100 level of the University of Nicosia Placement Test.
If students are unsure if they meet the admissions requirements, they should complete the inquiry form and discuss their situation with an admissions advisor.

hahaha actually the only reason I jumped into this major is because it was really affordable, and they gave me a 5% discount if I paid in BTC :-)
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:02:31
Hmmmm great point! There are a lot of majors around "social media" and "networks" and stuff like that... but not on the internet in general (that I know of) 
I wonder if Digital Currencies will go the same direction... focusing on the many specific applications of the technology instead of on the technology itself, a degree on DAO's, a degree on Currencies, a degree on blockchain based token-less ledgers, a degree on the culture within decentralized organizations, etc...

I didn't get any scholarships...
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:01:51
well when i signed up (2 years ago) it was ~$14,000 to be paid over the course of 2 years, but you got a 30% discount if you were from a "3rd world" country (not sure what that means) and you got 5% off if you paid in bitcoin :-)
