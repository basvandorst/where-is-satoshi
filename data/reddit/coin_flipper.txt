No Mr, I won't stop using either bitpay or coinbase.

hmmmm no! it means that the users running them restarted with the updated protocol i guess

i once sold 1.3 bitcoins to pay the rent, back 2 years ago. i'd rather had thought a bit more

sorry for my ignorance but doesnt that mean that anyone can run an enormous large amount of Nodes and activate SegWit themselves? how is this not violating consensus?

i am new to all this and probably not the wiser. It seems quite obvious that if BU forks, the value of bitcoin will drop drastically short term and that is something everyone is more or less admitting. Fork and buy lower could work but does it worth the risk?

The right thing??

How can this post reach front page?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:37:58
There are commenting nonsense...

I think that with enough patience you can open more than 4000 channels to other hubs without paying that $4000. If you are to run a hub business you can just choose to pay the minimum safe Satoshi/byte price and maybe wait for a few days, sacrificing time for cash. 10cent tx might be going through eventually.

You are the boss

Hmm no. NYA and miners pushed SW activation and prevented a messy chain split

Can we please stop calling ether and XMR altcoins? It's self embarrassing
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:00:51
Letting market decide is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:48:36
It isn't. There were no arguments whatsoever
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:24:45
The moment you realize that LN is the banks of the left picture.

There is strong demand to have Blockstream out of the equation.

Typical crap post with 100 upvotes. downvoted
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:16:29
I am strongly opposed to audit the fed
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:13:25
Not holding ether is more than questionable.
