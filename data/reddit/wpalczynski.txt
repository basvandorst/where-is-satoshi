Something is up, it would be too much of a coincidence.  Question is:  How many BTC would be required to be sold off in order to move the price as much as it moved shortly prior to the hack.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:24:44
Are there any details at all how the multisig setup was compromised?  Its almost hard to believe how such a hack could be executed by a total outside party.  I'm starting to wonder if some crooked insider(s) arent involved in this.

A well compensated employee still has motive to steal such a huge sum of funds, I mean whats 100k a year compared to what was stolen.  I bet we will learn there was a inside angle to this.

The reputational impact on finex after such a hack would have a drastic negative impact on the valuation of the company from prospective buyers.  They would be better off starting fresh without the financial liability from this hack.

I was just going to speculate, not to defend them, that if its all bitgo users perhaps those withdrawals need to be processed manually and the old automatic configurations of withdrawals no longer works.  Hope you get your funds.  Their wallets still seem to have around 60k btc.
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:29:08
Are all users for who they used BitGo not able to make withdrawals?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:34:14
I think that as an initial comment.  They first though just some accounts compromised.  Now it looks like its probably most of their stash.

20 $500 Euro bills are not hard to hide in your home, it would boil down to how much faith you have in the EURO, it took a bit of a beating on opening but is recovering.  With everyone screaming how bitcoin dropped from 1200 to 250 your average person might be scared to risk it.  
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:00:20
They have to get the EURO into BTC first, thats the tricky part with capital controls.
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:45:42
Why would they not just withdraw and hold EUROs?  As much as I would like it I don't think the Greeks will flock to BTC.
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:59:22
Even if web hits are up 120% as the article states that is nothing.  What reason would make the Greeks hold BTC instead of EURO?

Hopefully by the time Quantum Computing is mature enough to possibly take on Bitcoin or other crypto currencies those same crypto currencies will be able adapt to relying on quantum enhanced algorithms which will stand up to quantum computing much like todays algorithms stand up to conventional computing power.
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:11:08
I hope you are right but before that happens the they would have to loose confidence in EURO, its already dropped 1.8% against dollar today so we will see.
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:01:40
With bitcoin being fairly cheap, I would probably chance it if I could but I doubt this will be easy with capital controls.  Lets wait to hear what the restrictions imposed will be.

They can't possibly know the history of the deposited Monero which makes this whole episode a lot more fishy.  But why make up such a ridiculous bullshit story?

What fix?  By when?
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:53:02
Most people don't give enough though to the repercussions which lack of privacy can bring.  Let bitcoin become a settlement layer, it appears thats what its destined to be after all.  For a replacement to cash look to Monero (XMR) which is private and fungible.  Transactions are anonymous, holdings invisible and coin taint impossible.
@_date: 2016-01-21 02:59:32
Ok, understood.  Thanks.  Every time I turn on the trezor i get a new address or only when the current one received a payment?

remember that this is all about capital flight and not money laundering, illegal money exchange, pyramid schemes, and other illegal activity mentioned in the statement.  The government a while back instructed institutions not to even mention capital flight.
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:47:00
Don't forget the govt wasnt on the ball about all this like there are now with Ross case.  I agree there are shades as you say.  My main point is using the word anonymous is misleading for the majority of people who don't understand technology.  It is in fact a public ledger.  Just think how many "whales" will be kicking themselves for not taking any steps to anonymize their transactions or holdings if bitcoin gains a very large valuation.

Sounds like a usb cable issue.  For some reason these units have a  tonne of problems with the usb cable.  Get a high quality cable and you wont have issues.  I love that little device, no PC will ever get your private key since it doesnt leave the Trezor.

I guess thats breaking news in that case lol
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:16:47
This is dangerous to the average non-techie user, they should be aware it is not anonymous.  Your average Joe will have one wallet and spend from that wallet.  He will purchase something which will be shipped to his home with his name forever linking him to that BTC account.  I don't think many here will dispute that the government has access to all transaction data for all retailers at the click of a few buttons.  If you have any doubts about this watch the Edward Snowden documentary.  At this point telling anyone that BTC is anonymous is doing them a disservice even if there are operational steps that can be taken with BTC to give oneself a very weak level of anonymity.  As mass adoption happens the people who use BTC will have no idea or knowledge of how to deal with bitcoin in this semi-anonymous way.
People who want true anonymity need to use something like Monero based on the cryptonote protocol which has academic confirmation.

By the very fact that they are cryptonote they are as you put it "inbread", sure, they are based on stealth addresses and ring signatures but the people behind Monero forked one flavor and turned into into a true open source project with no pump and dump agenda, quite the contrary.

I think Karpeles is somehow tied into the SR thing.  I wouldnt be surprised if he was under a gag order.  Maybe even some of the originally missing BTC were the result of some seizure part of the SR investigation.  Things should get interesting now, we may finally learn the truth.

They have not been very forthcoming with information.  I understand they need to get legal involved to answer these questions but given the critical nature of the issue I would expect official statements explaining the situation.  Given that has not happened I suspect the issue is much worse than we are led to believe.  Looks like a crackdown by the US govt at the very least on Bitfinex but perhaps a sign of things to come for crypto in general.  I mean now two banking institutions are refusing cooperation, Wells Fargo and Western Union.  If Bitfinex was some shady exchange with bad KYC practices this would all make more sense but they are not.
@_date: 2017-04-09 17:50:14

Yeah I agree its not the most desirable outcome for them but likely much much better than what they might have been expecting and certainly better than what they are entitled to by Japanese law.  In relation to possible lawsuits Im curious how that would work since according to Japanese law the disposition which would leave Mark with all this money is just.
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:13:54
Read the article below.  If they were to try their profits would suffer greatly.  It's cheaper for them to pay penalties and continue to make money hand over fist with laundering.  Its their business model.   I work in the industry and see whats going on.  I see North American banks with no Latin American presence opening their first branch in Bogota, Columbia of all places.  Surely there are more prosperous Latin American cities in need of branches.

He always has the choice of what to do with the funds once he receives them from the courts since he is the main shareholder.  Even though it IS the right thing to do in this situation if he follows through with distributing this wealth to creditors it will speak greatly to his integrity.  I dont imagine there are many people who would do the same in a situation where they could walk away free and clear with that kind of money despite it being the right thing to do.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:10:59
Thats exactly what my first post says.  If courts dont allow them to go back to CR Mark will get the coins, once in posession he will be able to distribute as he seems fit right?
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:01:32

@_date: 2015-10-29 13:46:48
There is likely many new people trading there.  I would argue that many people were sitting on the sidelines waiting for a fully regulated and insured exchange to enter the game.  These people are likely rather wealthy which would also explain the average buy being large as described here earlier.

I don't think you calling BTC-E thieves is justified.  They have been around for a long time and have never scammed anyone in anyway to the best of my knowledge.  In addition personally I've never had the slightest problems with them during the year and half I've been dealing with them.
