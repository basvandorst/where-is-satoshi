Ecuador doesn't trust the US. They closed the Naval Base in Manta we were using for "The War on Drugs". Kicked out several US diplomats. Is kicking out USAID and several DoD employees from the US Embassy, and Correa was close with Hugo Chavez.
My guess is they don't understand Bitcoin other than it's some American financial wizardry and said hell no. Maybe it's unfair to think their politicians don't understand it but most of ours don't either.

Which is more odd? One entity, wanting all the coins overbids the rest of the bidders or **every** bidder underbid so much as to let the tallest underbid win everything.
I'm willing to bet the winning bid was at premium to market even if by just a bit. Winner gets to be proud of his/herself.

I've been able to buy other gift cards using a gift card at both Target and Gamestop. Though you can't buy the Visa gift cards. I've read that you can at Kmart as well but haven't confirmed.

"...the victims, who opposed such laws, have a clear right to any refund of their own money—and they would not advance the cause of freedom if they left their money unclaimed, for the benefit of the welfare-state administration."
She was forced to pay a tax she was opposed to for a program she was opposed to. It was not only a right but a responsibility to get as much of that money back as possible. Those she called moochers were those that lived off of the welfare programs who had never provided into those programs.
Growing up in an authoritarian socialist environment is exactly why she is able to give the warnings she has. The path we are on toward that very same suffering was recognized and so she wrote.

The full title of the book is "Three Felonies a Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent"
and this quote is from the book's [webpage](
"How can the average American commit three arguable felonies in the course of a given day? Consider these hypothetical examples—along with their real-life parallels—in which vague and broad federal laws have made honest citizens into federal felons."

Of course speculation plays into it you angry fellow. But if the Chinese news was so horrible as to cripple future use as a currency or current speculation wouldn't the Chinese understand this better than the rest of us (it's their news) and stop buying it.... it appears not. And you can cut your angry guy tone or EaD.

With all the mining power coming on line ghash would have to add more than 50% of that increase just to creep closer to 51% total and significantly so to get there anytime soon?
