Maybe money doesn't make a person happy?

The price is directly reflective of money coming in v. money going out.  When the price is rising, money doesn't want to flow out.  When the price is falling, money doesn't want to stay in. It's kind of a velocity metric.  When people believe Bitcoin has bottomed completely the money will come in and it will shoot up violently again.  That's how this works.  Problem is, nobody knows how to determine when it bottoms until after the fact.

The market goes down because people sell, taking profits, avoiding losses, or whatever.  It is you, me, the hedge fund managers, everyone!  But if you believe in the Bitcoin, you should leave in as much money as you can risk at this stage.  The more money everyone collectively  leaves in the system, the higher the price will get.  Along the way though, people sell.  So the price goes up and down and up and down.  But more people will have Bitcoin in a year from now, so the price probably will be higher than today.  People will freak out and sell in the short term.  Our goal should be to get as wide a user base as possible, not sell at the highest price.

Exactly.  Buying on margin was the problem at $9mil.  If he had just allocated to only Bitcoin at that point he'd probably be at $4mil.  Bitcoin is the store of value crypto, and I think if I were that wealthy having made the investment in BTC I would certainly keep most in BTC.  I feel far more confident that Bitcoin will be at a higher price in 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, relative to today than the stock market.  Bitcoin is like a virus that can't be killed.  There's never been anything like it in the world.  Very few people own it.  And it will be here forever -- don't sell for a quick profit or because you want to buy stupid shit.

You don't seem like the kind of person who believes in Bitcoin for what it is.  You just want to sell later at a higher price.  That's one way of playing the game, and some will win that way.  But those who participate in the Bitcoin system and continue to will be rewarded long term.

That was a good read, thanks.

Totally all things that Craig Wright would have done.  Am I right?  Of course I'm not.

dude, shut up, it's a free market. Don't jump on the roller coaster if you don't want to ride.
