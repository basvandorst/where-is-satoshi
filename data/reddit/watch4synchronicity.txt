This doesn't make any sense. If a new company comes out and sells bread for cheaper, then that's a price reduction. It doesn't matter that the company you bought from changed.

If you can't understand what its goal is then fine, but there is theoretically nothing stopping it, it's just a matter of time. So why not let people invest in it? If no one paid developers maybe it would come out 3 years later. And it's an inflationary currency anyways so a premine gives less power to those that receive the initial currency as time progresses, unlike Satoshi and his fat stack that keeps increasing in value.

Only Ethereum could unseat bitcoin because it eclipses and encompasses BTC. But ether is inflationary, so it won't overtake it in the long run. But in the short run, it will wipe the floor with BTC.
In the end deflationary currencies will prevail, and BTC has enough escape velocity to be safe.

@_date: 2014-07-25 15:14:41
Ether is an inflationary currency, so a premine loses value over long periods of time, unlike Bitcoin that will always be increasing in value due to less supply. Satoshi has 1/21 of all bitcoins ever, but the ether premine will slowly be less and less of the total number because there is no cap.
Also, any computer, even netbooks will supposedly be able to mine ether, whereas only specialized mining equipment made by a few companies is capable now of mining bitcoin.
They are different for sure.
@_date: 2014-11-15 15:26:45

It's a matter of fact that Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme, by definition, and this is easily shown.
In a Ponzi scheme, earlier investors are paid interest with later investors, while the money in "limbo" is used. Bitcoin is not issued via debt, and all money is held securely with no chance of misuse unless you delegate that power to an exchange or some cloud service.
Interestingly enough, the US bond market literally *is* a Ponzi scheme by definition, because we pay off the interest on the debt by issuing more debt or by foreign aid and rehypothecation.
Look up the definition for yourself.

@_date: 2014-01-10 20:28:28
While I fully agree with most of what you said, how would increased liquidity make bitcoin more useful?
Sure people would like to acquire it for cheaper, but I don't think there is a problem with bitcoin liquidity as it is very easily divisible and $100 worth of BTC is still $100 worth of BTC. One would have no problem aquiring a set dollar amount regardless of BTC price, as the dollar still relatively stable on a day to day basis (it's not stable on a year to year basis, but people don't care about that). I should think your argument would hold for something like a cellphone which is indivisible, but not for a currency which is merely a store of purchasing power.
To finish my initial thought though, once bitcoin is more prominent and Overstock or any other retailer could use their received bitcoin for their own purchases, that would stop the dumping of used bitcoins onto the market. This makes btc more usable as the middle man is cut out, thereby making btc more valuable nominally. The fact that Overstock must convert the BTC to USD seems to, at least temporarily, only strengthen the USD by keeping it in the loop.
Nevertheless I think we would both agree that it's good for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the long run!
I simply find it strange that people don't bring this up. $124,000 worth of bitcoin will be sold on the market soon, and one would assume that the people that used BTC to buy on Overstock won't be replacing the BTC they used because otherwise they would have simply bought the initial product using dollars and not jump through the hoops.
Edit: thinking more, the people using BTC for purchases obviously want things, and would have sold their BTC themselves anyways, and maybe Overstock will keep some BTC as investment. This would then increase the price as the only net difference would be that Overstock "buys" bitcoin. There would be a reduced liquidity on exchanges however due to them not being used. Economics is crazy...

In case you didn't realize, electromagnetic pulses are real. Look it up, it's not scifi. A nuke can make one for a double whammy.
You didn't understand what I meant though in the first place. Say an EMP goes off in NY. Then some in the radius could lose their .wallet files if they weren't backed up outside said radius. Not everyone in the whole world of course, an EMP couldn't do that.
But this means it could be used as an attack. This would give other nations an incentive to use EMP, because their passwords would be unaffected. You can neutralize this threat by backing up passwords in different locations, but then that could jeopardize security.
Doesn't matter if it's open source, all a nefarious group would need would be the leg up on the competition. Just because it's open source doesn't make it non-exploitable and to think so would be dangerous, foolish and illogical.
Imagine cryptocurrencies are the next REALLY big thing. Everyone sells their dollars, gold and silver to get some, making it their main financial asset. An EMP attack takes out a large portion of user's backups and faith is lost, plunging the world's middle class with no alternative currencies into abject poverty as cryptocurrencies are abandoned out of fear of repeat attacks.
These fears are extreme, but I don't have any mundane fears concerning bitcoin. If it continues as intended there should be no problems.

You say people will get used to not using physical money, so when there is none left the government can say "hey, we thought it would be great to tax everyone 10% for a bank bail-in or else the economy gets it."
Why would people use BTC when they can just use this new system run by their ole trusted government? Barely anyone knows what a deflationary currency means, let alone what deflation means itself.

Deflation in traditional assets would cause people to exit stocks and real estate, funneling it into alt currencies like gold/silver/bitcoin. There's enough money out there already, it's just busy hyperinflating a stock market and housing market that should actually be falling through the floor, hiding said inflation. The problem is that inflation has been contained to certain assets and when it spreads out to actually normalize based upon the monetary supply everything besides the inflated markets will skyrocket.

Is Monero a Turing complete decentralized computing platform? If not, then you're comparing apples and oranges.
I get the feeling that people think Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, but it's essentially not, in the normal sense.
Ethereum isn't a currency, it's a platform. To use the platform you need the associated currency ether. That's what people will receive from the premine. Sure it will have value as a currency, but BTC is deflationary and thus a better store of value and won't likely be replaced by ether as a day to day currency. Ether is to use the network, not maintain purchasing power.
The more successful the Ethereum platform, presumably the more valuable ether will be.

I'll explain why I like the logarithmic.
I think bitcoin is going exponential.
Logarithmic scale helps you better visualize exponential growth. Because nothing fundamentally has changed with the dollar or bitcoin, some may expect the price to rise to stay on the logarithmic line. There is enough money out there to push it up, and they want in on the "double your money in a day" action.
When currencies battle, one does not increase over the other and then stop. When one currency is seen as better than another, people use the better one and it starts a snowball effect which builds and builds due to working at many different levels.
This is bitcoin going exponential. Don't think of bitcoin only going up a lot. Think of it going up a fair amount in terms of everything, and the dollar going down a fair amount.
At 1cent per BTC people thought was unsustainable, same with $1, $10, $100, now $1000. The real question to ask is whether BTC is better than the dollar. If it is, then it will keep increasing in value, measured in dollars, forever, unless the dollar seems like the better value in the short-term. This happens due to speculators that do not trade long-term fundamental and also due to compulsive buying and selling.
tl,dr; Nothing has changed, concerning the underlying fundamentals of the dollar or bitcoin (the taper isn't real, they're doing it behind the scenes). Thus I think bitcoin is still the better currency be far, and so I expect it to increase forever until that changes. This increase will most likely be exponential, so I think the logarithmic scale because it allows you to see deviations from the underlying trend in a less bias way.

Sure. I have enough regrets already. Why not throw $10 their way? A Turing complete decentralized computational system doesn't "come out for the first time ever" every day. Then I'll at least be able to use contracts from the start and not wait for an exchange to be setup and get my funding.
I think it's worth the novelty, but maybe I'll pick up some as an investment as well. If next year *everyone* is mining ether for a share of the 26% of initial sales, it could be prescient to bet on some now.

They only solve one math problem over and over, with different inputs. There are no applications of these problems.
You input the new transactions of the blockchain and encrypt it in a way to get a special result. The machines can really only do this one problem well, and there is no use for this function, called hashing, outside of finding the hash.

No, all it does is perform a hashing function. Those protein folding things are not hashed based and therefore it can't be used at all for that. Look up what a hash is and it will be obvious that it couldn't help protein folding. The thing is, you can make a faster and cheaper hashing computer if you make it do *only* that. The detriment though, is that it does that and *only that*.

One currency for each locality. They would all compete in an open market. This keeps confirmation times down, facilitating timely trade. There could potentially be a currency with an extremely long block time engulfing the whole solar system, but that would have special purposes and not be used in day to day transactions. Perhaps it would have no use besides being a store of information, not currency.
Also, keeping the block time low physically prevents cloaked ships with advanced computational technology from mounting a 51% attack unless they got close enough to Earth. Though this is assuming that quantum entanglement also obeys traditional physics, as well as wormholes being impossible in this context.

Unless interest rates can counteract the risk. So, yes.
Interest rates in Cyprus were so high that a 10% "haircut" would have been better for most accounts in the US and other ZIRP economies over a long enough time period of a few years.
That being said, you're letting the bank use the money, knowing about the fractional reserve system, so you ultimately are risking your money. This normally low chance of occurrence is usually offset by interest rates. Similarly, when you loan out money, you ask for interest so that in your portfolio of many loans, some can fail and you still make a profit. Because interest rates are too low, when people or nations default on the loans, they can't break even and instead use government intervention to facilitate their extremely risky behavior of giving out such low interest loans.
Congress doesn't understand loans, they think interest rates are "mean" when in reality they're an essential tool to allow massive lending on the scale that congress actually wants to "create der jobs". Low interest rates hurt the economy, so usually in a functioning economy, loans open up opportunities to make a profit through innovation and production. The fact that there is misallocated capitol in financial instruments and entertainment industries and other subsidies means that there are less opportunities for actually creating wealth. So, yeah, bitcoin and precious metals are a better store of wealth in risky times with low interest rates because there is no counter-party risk because you control those assets instead of delegating pseudo-ownership to another party.

What you should look at is not *market cap* but market cap *over time*. What's the upside? Where is it going? You think they aren't smarter than the average person on If so you're seriously deluded.
A corporation needs to make products, handle changes, compete with competitors. Bitcoin has no real competitors and if one pops up, in the end it's software so it can be patched quickly to remain top dog.
Imagine market cap when people have actually even **heard** of Bitcoin. You're living in the Bitcoin culture and have trouble comprehending its infancy even now because to you it already seems ubiquitous. You need to think objectively and remove yourself from the analysis. Imagine a sultan finding out that he can double his 10 billion in a month.
The only possible way TPTB aren't afraid of Bitcoin is if they are Satoshi and BTC is the new world currency. By my reckoning though, that seems unlikely but still possible. Either way though, it's a good idea to grab a couple sooner rather than later.

But that takes a few days to do, and by then, on average the price has risen and there are fees associated with it anyways.

You can see the big volume buy to start off the run. Then people hop on band wagon and keep price going up. Then the same person dumps their coins when it won't go higher and makes a profit.

You could buy some bitcoins and then sell them right away for more and make a profit. Or sell bitcoins and then rebuy more. To do this quickly though, you sell for *less* than is offered, and buy for *more* than is offered. This closes the gap.
This happens when there is a large fast selloff or buy and people haven't filled in the gap in prices that were taken off the market.
The act of buying and then selling right away for profit, in itself closes this gap, and so in the act of doing this, the trader can be thought of as being "rewarded" for creating a more stable and definite price. There is a 0.6% fee for all trades on Mt.Gox though (0.55% if you trade a lot), so this isn't profitable forever, because eventually the fees are greater than the revenue created and you lose money from doing so.
With a laggy system like Mt.Gox though, traffic increases at times like this due to activity in the market price, and doing this is a risk because the price may have changed before your order goes through,  so the gap may stay for quite a while.

You must be new to economics. For every person that *sells* at $140 there is one person that *buys* at 140. Who buys in at $140? One half of every single transaction. It can't get to $140 unless people are buying. There are no "fake" buys where people fudge the numbers and then cook the books like in housing, which is fueled by speculation anyways due to 0% interest rates. 0% interest rates are pushing people into bitcoins actually anyways, because saving in dollars in a bank yields no return and your money might get "Cyprused" too.
When it gets high enough for people to spend, then the price will go down. Then it will be low enough to buy, so people will buy and it will go up. The price discovery mechanism keeps the price between these two. Then at least it will slowly increase 6% or so with inflation, and be a legitimate currency that doesn't devalue over time, even if the rate of return isn't in the thousands of percent. When the BIG money starts to come in (millions/billions at a time) you will see a lot of buying, but it will be from less people. It's not that *one* coin is expensive, because they are divisible. It's that you can buy *in* bitcoins as a store of purchasing power as other currencies hyper inflate. If there were 10 times more bitcoins in existence and each bitcoin were worth $14, people would still buy them. Purchasing 1/10 of a bitcoin for $14 is still a good investment because of the rate of return and the fact that you avoid other inflating currencies with moderate inflation. It's not about the nominal price, it's about the future *relative* price.
When there will be thousands of bitcoin millionaires running around buying stuff with dollars they got from selling bitcoin to billionaires, that's when USD hyperinflation starts in respect to all assets, like food/energy/anything. There is enough monetary base now to cause hyperinflation, but rich people spend their money on fast cars and yachts, so you see hyperinflation in those sectors but not in sectors the average people are exposed to. The distribution of wealth is so skew that hyperinflation is kept bottled up and marginalized to specific sectors. Rich people still don't spend *much* more money on groceries than most people, so if you give most of the money to one person, it means less is spent on groceries in total, because the rich person will spend the rest on other things. They *do* spend money on fancy restaurants though, so that's how you get $150 filet mignon and $4000 wine bottles.
Bitcoin is essentially a transfer of wealth from the mega rich to everyone else, but when the money is more evenly spread out, the fact that we have a gigantic monetary base will spread much more easily and cause higher inflation, this will in turn attract more mega-rich money and accelerate the process of destroying the dollar. This logically *should* happen though because the Federal Reserve is stealing money from everyone with dollars by devaluing each one when they print money to monetize the debt caused by excess spending.
At $1000 bitcoin, people won't be buying 5 bitcoins anymore, but they can still buy 1/10th of a bitcoin for $100 and make a 10% profit in one week. When enough wealth is transferred downwards, inflation will be allowed to take off (as it should to correct the market and make it more fair to everyone instead of having the Fed funnel money to the already super-rich) and a feedback loop will be created which will keep the pace going until dollars are worth as much as they should be worth, perhaps thousands of times less than they are now if the government wasn't a criminal ponzi scheme. That's why I laugh when people call BTC a bubble, because the real bubble is the USD (and yen and pound and yuan et al) which is popping directly *into* BTC, and that's why we're seeing exponential growth.
Hopefully when hyperinflation starts to affect food, people (including the new bitcoin millionaires) will start to buy gold/silver and raise those prices too out of their grossly manipulated slumps. Then we can have at least 3 good currencies competing and keeping each other in check. Metal currencies can't be stopped by the government shutting down the internet, and that is a plus whether people believe it's likely or not. The government can't do that yet though, they aren't desperate enough. In the end though, currencies are just the means to an end: the preservation of time and energy spent, so that you hard work isn't stolen from you, and you can provide for yourself in a manner proportional to your efforts, in order to encourage people to take initiative in their lives and make the world a better place by providing goods and services that people want in order to make a profit. We as early adopters (still early you see), are providing a valuable good and service of a medium of exchange and purchasing power preservation and so as per the brilliantly clever universe, we will be rewarded for it through increases of our purchasing power, thereby increasing the influence we good and smart people have in the world. It's very poetic as all truth always is.

Whatever currency you use, a good investor will ALWAYS compare it to the more valuable at the time to assess whether it was a good investment.
That's the whole point of currency, it's just something **fungible** you can exchange for something else. To not do so would be laughable and makes absolutely no sense in any context.
You're forgetting the fungibility of money as a *medium* of exchange! What you're saying is all valid, but you're implying that the *method of purchase* matters when it doesn't using fungible currencies. There are still opportunity costs to be compared when determining if it was a good idea, and because the product of BTC miners is BTC, you will always end up comparing it to the price of BTC no matter what circumstance.

Exactly! And with the larger amount of purchases and no need to restock, you can get a wider user-base to increase awareness of your product through word of mouth and merely defer "usage" of the received currency for a couple weeks and allow the USD value to double which is inevitable for the conceivable future to me and my understanding of free market economics.
But it's not as if you're "doing them a favor because you like that they use bitcoin", you could actually get more revenue over time and you need not think of it as charity. You are acting in your own self interests, and people using Bitcoin will be rewarded naturally because it's the "right thing to do", if you are in no position to "give away" your product, then by all means do not do so. There may be some who would choose not to purchase your product at it's USD value, but may want to purchase it at its BTC value, so you're attracting customers that you wouldn't have had in the first place, *and* making profit as the price of BTC rises.
Don't think of it as a "discount". Think of people using USD as "behind the curve" and and charge them a *premium* for their use of a dinosaur currency.

I'm trying to "ride the wave" as it were. When I see the large buys near maximums, it means there might be a "pump and dump". It's standard practice.
In wall street the smart money buys in (AAPL for instance) and sends it up. Then the media plays along and sells it as gold. The general public buys in (sheep) and wallstreet takes their money. Then they sell at the top, crash it and double up at the low price or move on to something else.
I've been working on my strategy, and really messed up a lot in the last go, somewhat due to lag, but on that wave just a half an hour ago I made a solid 0.008BTC :D selling only around $80 worth of BTC and then rebuying them later. (yeah, not really anything, but I didn't LOSE any)
I bought in increments, when I should have bought all at once. And I bought back in at increments. If I had done it all fairly well it would have been closer to $5 or so.
And it all multiplies because BTC is going to skyrocket soon, so it all helps? Maybe I should just work for dollars at the moment though.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:05:18
My guess is that it's Max Keiser fucking with all of us. Rich people can be counter-intuitive because money isn't necessary to them. Or it's some secret government plot to flash crash it occasionally to scare people away. Doing this isn't a good way to make money.
It was overextended though. Too many people were "all in" because they don't want to miss out on losses as the price goes up, so when the price drops they can't buy it for "cheap" because there is no money left liquid and so it falls and then is *under*valued instead. It always follows the forms of waves: up and down, over and under. I'll be honest I had no cash and was all in, which turned out to be a bad idea. Oh well, it should be back up soon.

@_date: 2013-04-10 18:57:51
Dollars are close to worthless, as massive inflation is just around the corner. Bitcoins are cheap at &lt;$1000, so they try to crash the market and then buy up as much as possible so as not to raise the price from their massive buys, not trying to profit in USD, but in BTC.
Who is "they"? I don't know. They took out Iraq when Saddam tried to sell oil in the Euro. They took out Libya when Gaddafi tried to create a gold backed currency for Africa. They want to take out Iran because they don't have a Rothschild debt-based central bank. When Libya fell, the first thing the "rebels" did was start a Rothschild debt-based central bank where the money is not "money" it's debt that is lent out and must be repaid at interest. The problem? There isn't enough money to be paid back at interest ever, because it is ALL lent out. So if you owe $101 and there are only $100 in existence, you're SOL aren't you? Does that make sense? A nation that used debt-based currency can NEVER break even because there isn't physically enough money when the debt MUST be repaid in that currency. Some few break even, and the rest are debt-slaves that don't know why they have it so bad.
The Federal Reserve printed off $19 Trillion in secret bailouts. What happens if a bit of that was put away, only to return to buy up BTC?
Bitcoins aren't debt based. There will be a time when 1 Bitcoin will go up and down by thousands of dollars in one day, so people sell off their entire fortunes, then they come in with worthless paper that can be conjured up and lock down the BTC forever.
You can try and sell to time the market to *make* BTC, but please don't let them get any for cheap by trying to make dollars.

It's definitely a bet, but I am so confident on the market fundamentals that it would be a bet worth taking to me. You can make more profit by taking a risk. Secondarily though, it would increase bitcoin adoption as people realize they can get products for cheaper.

*Sorry for the long response, but I wanted to explain what I meant.*
It's all about *future* value. Bitcoin fits into this because it is a store of value, and must store purchasing power in the mid-to-long-term future.
In case you didn't realize, money printing takes 18+ months or so to affect prices outside of what the money is directly used for, depending on economic activity. The increase in money supply is only spread out after the printed money changes hands enough times and prices are adjusted to maximize profits. Therefore, prices affected by QE talk are essentially future prices, or currency values that will be used *in* the future, because money printing today doesn't affect prices today. That's why the price of bread in the supermarket doesn't change the same week or month Bernanke talks.
Arguably, QE1 has barely even started to affect American prices yet because the velocity of money due to economic slowdown has been very low and money has been kept in savings and offshore, etc. The inflation has mostly been in housing and education and healthcare. When those industries tank, the assets are liquidated and the money flows into different sectors and then non-single-sector inflation actually takes hold. We're on QE5 or so, depending on how you number them, so there's quite a lot of inflation down the road.
There's another housing bubble, so when that starts to pop, people will be selling their homes and then using that cash to buy other things instead, driving up those prices. Some will be buying precious metals and bitcoin, so that's when inflation will really start to affect people, because they will see the increasing value of commodities and compete to drive up prices before they lose too much purchasing power.
The dollar will be affected for decades by all of the quantitative easing that has already occurred, until it settles down and money supply is more evenly distributed. Less efficient sectors now have extra money (housing, education, healthcare), so when the more productive sectors are able to glean some profits from those sectors, capital will redistribute more efficiently and the money supply will be more optimal, but there is just so much of it that it will be devalued in the process. Therefore the dollar will be worth less than it is now even if we stop QE altogether tomorrow. There will be some knee-jerk reactions, but then the housing bubble will collapse shortly after because it isn't being propped up, and people will liquidate their investments and put them into many other different sectors (based on personal preference) and spread the inflation around.
The prices affected by QE are future prices that have already moderately taken into account the previous QE and projected QE, so a decrease in QE hurts those prices. (I say moderately because there are some people in those markets that don't know the impact of QE and keep prices low because they are willing to sell for lower.)
This is why bitcoin and gold/silver are affected by QE talk *today* but food prices aren't. Bitcoin and gold/silver will be used in the future, but food is consumed quickly, therefore people who will be using bitcoin and gold/silver a year from now will use QE talk to affect their usages. That's why I said it would not be *as* worthless. QE12345 has already set the wheels in motion, so any QE talk now is trivialized somewhat because it is merely redundant.

I agree that it is mostly an adoption curve, but, I literally mean that an apple will cost $100 soon. Thusly, apples as a currency will experience hyperdeflation, same with chairs and iron nails and diapers. When bitcoins are worth $1 million, they still won't be worth April 7th, 2013 $1 million in terms of purchasing power. That will send people's BTC profits into gold/silver, as those "currencies" experience a secondary hyperinflationary rise due to being physical commodities. The USD will hyperinflate no matter what, Bitcoin is just helping to speed it up. "Normally" silver/gold would be the outlet, but those markets are being manipulated now due to those exact reasons. When prices start to rise substantially, people will dump USD into gold/silver/platinum/copper/BTC/LTC etc. It will just be a normal transition for a lot of people around the world and they won't make a lot of money, as they get rid of dollars just as bitcoin starts to slow down, with the people getting in early seeing substantial gains and the people getting in late seeing substantial but necessary losses to abate further loss. This is on a global scale though, so people in America and other industrialized nations will have a leg up on the competition due to the spread of internet access. People in areas the culturally use gold/silver, i.e. China and India will see the most profits in thy physical commodities, while smaller gains will be seen in the US. In the end though, markets will probably keep things more or less how they were before in terms of capital distribution, as long as China doesn't figure out bitcoin too quickly.
Right now, hyperinflation only has hit yachts and other toys of the rich. When the rich start getting into the bitcoin game, many people will be "rich" and will be able to purchase "normal" things in larger quantities, and as such, prices will rise, thereby causing hyperinflation of everything with respect to USD. This "wants" to happen, because the monetary base is being bottled up in rich people's bank accounts, and bitcoin is providing it with an outlet.
You can't think of USD as a static item though, they are being constantly devalued and even if the adoption total stopped today, it would raise in respect to USD because the USD is **being devalued**. Maybe I missed your point though, sorry.

The housing bubble was inflated because there were low interest rates and people were speculating with free money. People put their hard earned money into bitcoin, they're not making loans to get their commission and fudging the numbers. The situations are fundamentally different, especially in that the housing market was a government driven bubble and bitcoin is a privately traded decentralized non-loan-based free market.

That's what copper/silver/gold is for. You can't expect everything to be perfect all the time, so prepare.
That being said, it's hard to send silver over the internet and that's what btc is for, transfers not in person. You can use only btc if you so choose, but that seems foolish.

In your case, your competitors are in the same place, so there won't be as much downward pressure on prices. This would only work in places where you aren't replacing your products quickly. Arguably though, you could try to get your supplier to accept bitcoins and then you could beat all your competitor's prices.
It works better for things like selling your stereo or selling software that you don't need to restock, when you don't *need* to use it again immediately.
Edit: Thinking about this more, if you were the "producer", and were "growing" "something", you have a few weeks of "growing" and only periodic harvests. After the harvest, if you have enough "seed money", you could sell the "product" for cheap in BTC, and put that away till the next harvest, then you could potentially see 300% gains like we've seen recently, and use that to expand your "enterprise". This would pass the savings on to your buyers, who could then sell for cheap in BTC. Therefore, cheap "product" for everyone! The problem is this type of person is not willing to save money for later :)
Like I've said, this strategy doesn't work well for "retail" middle-men... unless they can pay in BTC.
I do not condone the use of "".

OK. When you said "Less money printing = More valuable fiat" I thought you implied that the current value of fiat money went up, so I augmented what you said by saying that the *future* value went up, or rather wasn't as low as some might have thought.

Buy low, sell high. When the price is stable, there's no reason to do either if you're trying to make profits on trades. The price moves when the big guys are trading. The big guys just aren't trading.
Just wait till the people who started to learn about the exponential rise in bitcoin last week have their bank accounts verified.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:43:12
Your argument could be used to question why anyone would spend their bitcoins on anything, because it would be better to just "buy it next week". That's where the lower prices come in.
I'm not saying it's guaranteed, but if you had done it a week ago, you could have sold stuff for 3/4th the price in BTC and then made more money due to the doubling of the price in around a week, as well as sold more products because the lower price would increase demand.
The main point is not that you will automatically make more money because the price will rise, you will get more business because of lower prices *and* the price will probably rise. I'm talking about the fundamentals of Bitcoin, and the fundamentals look pretty damn good. When some rich guys sells off his BTC to lock in his profit, some other rich guy that came after comes along and buys them all up at the low price. It's definitely only for people that are hardcore bitcoin believers, but it gives you the potential to take a risk to make more profit.

100 was a record high too, but as you can plainly see it hasn't gone back down there. Almost at every point there is a recent record high and it continues to go back up.
If you think it's going to keep going up, like most people in case you haven't noticed, then why sell now when you can make more money later? The only people selling for good now are those who desperately need the cash. Bitcoin is also an inflation hedge, because the dollar is constantly losing value. The dollar is at &lt;90% the value it was 100 years ago, a record low, so wouldn't everyone be getting out of the dollar?
If you want to get bitcoins, you have to buy them sometime. If you bought in at $90, that was a record high as well, but if you kept off because of your reasoning, you would have missed out on &gt;50% gains in just over one week.
There has been exponential rising for the past few months, and it's simply continuing now. Seriously what you're saying doesn't make sense  if you just look back a few months into the past.
Last week if you sold at 150 and rebought at 115, you would make around 30% profit *on top* of the profit you *already made*. That's what I mean by buy low, sell high. It's just that you can't "sell high" if you don't have anything to sell in the first place. The charts don't show any slowdown in case you cared to look at anything wider than a week long chart.
And in case you didn't actually know how a market works, it's only *at* an all time high because people **still want to buy it**. Or else the price would drop.

@_date: 2013-07-21 16:25:40
In something like Bitcoin, when the value goes up (deflation of prices /btc), a lot of people now have purchasing power that didn't before, and they'll use it to buy the things they've been saving for. What you're talking about is a deflationary spiral which isn't very likely in a free market like Bitcoin, because people aren't mega-wealthy. They actually want to buy things unlike the super-rich that just want to accumulate wealth because they already own property.
If you've never had an iPhone before, you're newly rich from Bitcoin and you want one, you're not going to wait until next year when the price is 10% of what it is now.
This deflationary argument doesn't work in sectors that are actually experiencing deflation and have been for decades: electronics. A computer is maybe 20% cheaper next year, but the computer market is one of the largest growing sectors in recent history.
For every person that is waiting for the price to drop, there is a person who started waiting a while ago and see now as the time to cash in. This balance keeps deflation in check to an appropriate level unless there is outside government intervention fucking things up and sending mixed signals to producers and consumers.
People will still have savings, and perhaps more of it, but they won't refrain from purchasing things, that's what humans do.
If you think of the person that can afford everything, then sure, they might hoard, but when the average person sees prices drop, something they want becomes purchasable when it wasn't before and they buy it.
Just because Inflation is the opposite of deflation doesn't necessarily mean the opposite will result from it because the dynamics are different and not an exact mirror. When the value of something increases, people sell it to realize a profit.
The bad deflation in Japan was probably caused by incompetent central planning and could have been prevented through more Laissez-faire policies. If you let businesses and consumers alone, they redistribute capital in the most efficient and sustainable way to take advantage of opportunities.

The reason you need to solve an algorithm is only because solving the algorithm in any way currently known takes time. The desired result is for new bitcoins to be added, and for the rate of increase to slow asymptotically. This can be accomplished in different ways, but solving the particular algorithm bitcoin uses is easily scalable (made easier or harder) so that the difficulty can be altered and the desired result can be achieved as the total speed of the algorithm solvers changes due to a wide range of reasons.
I'm pretty sure that solving the algorithm also verifies transactions somehow, so it's incentive for random individuals to do the verifying themselves and not require a centralized verifier. Centralization of power generally breeds corruption over time, or so history shows. There could theoretically be a method where people verified transactions and were given bitcoin from some central fund overseen by a small group, but the flaws in that idea are quite obvious. Instead, they're created cryptographically and no one "gives them out" per se, assuming the logic underpinning the algorithms is sound.
The computers essentially just pick a number, check it, and if it doesn't work, pick another one. Computers are *very* good at doing that.
That is Bitcoin's function. It's a currency that isn't centrally controlled.
Think of the US dollar as a counter example. Just recently it was shown that since the 2007 financial collapse, the middle and lower classes have declined or remained stagnant, while the billionaires of the world have practically doubled their net wealth. This is an increase in wealth inequality, the exact opposite of the people who "voted for it". Coincidentally, the stock market has practically doubled. Also coincidentally, the billionaires of the world own lots of stocks. Also also coincidentally, the Federal Reserve (de facto controller of the US dollar) has been purchasing financial assets, bonds and stocks. One could say that when the Fed prints money, it goes straight into the stock and bond markets, and thus transitively straight to the billionaires. This "stimulus" is meant to be specifically helping the lower and middle class citizens, i.e. the people who voted for Obama, who in the end controls the Fed, but it's instead going straight to the megawealthy while everyone else just experiences inflation while their currency is devalued and wages stagnate.
No one can "devalue" bitcoin to obtain cheaply imported goods and then choose the method of devaluation they so wisely think best. This is undesirable because usually the megawealthy control this devaluation process anyways and actually construct a protocol where they see their assets increase in value even accounting for inflation.
People could of course purchase bitcoins and manipulate them in a traditional way like in the gold and silver markets, but taking away the ability to print them out of thin air is no small improvement.
Also, I would think that as new BTC enters the market slowly over time, it limits "unhealthy" growth that occurs too quickly. Increased supply matching increased demand allows BTC to have a reasonably stable value over medium periods of time, allowing it to function as a currency (a store of value). In times like these, by that I mean short periods of time where the price is volatile, it can seem unstable, but come back in a year and then judge if it's as stable as other traditional currencies that are being devalued at unprecedented levels ;)
The stability and decentralized nature of bitcoin gives it value as a currency, on top of being the traditional traits of being fungible and divisible.

The millionaires are starting to get into the game... maybe they'll try to double their money and then cash out, but by then others might be entering. It's hard to say when mega-rich people exit faster than they enter. I think it's more of a matter of time, not dependent on the price per se.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:48:29
It went up too fast, so people are cashing out because they think others will also cash out, then they rebuy and it goes higher, so no problem. Unless you cash out low and then you get fleeced because you succumbed to fear. It's the big money doing this, not you and me or anyone on this sub.

Hey, I'm just analyzing what *actually* happens, not what is most fair. It's not my fault bitcoin favors businesses with large amounts of capital. Arguably though, everyone should have savings, so companies without savings aren't run optimally and hurt the consumer in this case by having high prices. If the small business owner has some savings in BTC (to start a new business you need savings), he will benefit from the increase in value and can use the savings as a buffer to offer cheap products.
For example, take a furniture store that has a week's expenses in savings. They have two prices, a USD price, and a BTC price at 2/3 the USD exchange rate. They advertise their low prices in BTC, and sell 30% more chairs, thereby making up for the 1/3 discount. Then they use the savings to buy new chairs to replace the sold ones over the week, and after 1 week they sell the BTC at hopefully a higher price, increasing their savings, offering cheaper products, and moving more chairs. Now with more savings, they can actually offer a greater discount. Of course, if BTC goes down, they don't have as much savings left and might not be able to keep the offer going. If it were the past two months though, this would be entirely possible, and the current discount would be dictated by the current growth of BTC. I expect this growth in Bitcoin to keep rising for the foreseeable future because the USD has been greatly devalued and bitcoin is attracting new people all the time, accelerating the deflation. This obviously couldn't be done forever.
This strategy really works best for businesses that don't need to restock goods. The most ideal situation, as someone said, is for software developers, who can offer their products for half off, because they do not need to use the revenue immediately to purchase new goods, and they can differ use of the revenue for as long as they can (maybe a week and see the value double). They don't need to use revenue to buy more product, because what they are selling is essentially intellectual property.
