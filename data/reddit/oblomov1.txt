I invested in the recent Shapeshift bridge round through FundersClub.  The round was about to close.   To FundersClub's and Shapeshift's credit, we have been given the option to pull out of the investment.  I'm sticking with my investment.  That no customer funds were compromised is testament to the value of the technology.  It reinforces my conviction in this investment.  
The timing of this hack may have been chosen to cause the funding round to collapse.

In the 90s and early 00s, Miller was respected for his eclectic intellectual tastes and forward thinking.   Yes, his fund had a stretch of bad years, and he didn’t adapt quickly enough to a changing market.  But, he’s still a very smart guy and this is not necessarily a contrary indicator.

This is JMO.  I am not a tax professional, but I have reported BTC transactions on my tax returns.
It depends on whether BTC is money or a bartered good.
The IRS and US courts have not held that BTC is money (not yet at least).  However, it is an item of value.  If you are exchanging it for an item of value, then this is considered a sale.
You would pay taxes on the gain (from the time of purchase of BTC to the time you exchanged it for something).  It is a barter transaction, and the gain is taxable at your ordinary income tax rate.  This is reported on a 1099-B form.
Again, JMO.  I would prefer to be conservative with my tax returns.  If I am audited I can say that I was making a sincere, good faith effort to pay all applicable taxes.  If one has to go to tax court, this is a very important consideration in their ruling.

That is interesting.  The writer touches on the salient features of bitcoin:
- proof of work
- mathematical basis for confirming transactions
- b-money as a payment system and as a store of value
Not convinced that it was Satoshi, but it would have been one of a very small group of people considering these ideas.

You are putting the cart before the horse.  What you state as undesirable preconditions requiring mediation by regulation are ironically the undesirable outcome of too much regulatory power.
- The more powerful the regulatory agency, the greater the incentive for misfeasance due to undue external influence (this phenomenon is known as "regulatory capture").  FDA is not neutral in regulating big pharma companies compared with upstart firms; it's very favorable.  This is not correctable through more legislation, more state power, or more funding.  The more power the agency has, the greater the incentive for external influence. 
- The peaks and valleys of investment bubbles and collapses are largely the unintended consequence of overweened government itself.  If the US Fed, ECB, and BOJ maintained sound money, there would be less need for bitcoin.  In each case, the state is locked into perpetual inflation.  This creates a flood of investment into noninflationary alternatives such as bitcoin.  It preferences greater, rather than less speculation because of the uncertainty of future purchasing power.  Also, the government can be the direct cause of bubbles, such as with investment into internet, broadcast media, and human genome sequencing in the late 90s, housing and credit instruments in the early 00s, or solar power and electric car technology now.
As I said above, I'm not opposed to regulation.  It can help markets to function better.  But like salt in a delicate dish, often less is better than more.  Regulators, as good as their intent may be, are still human, and are no less selfish and greedy than any other person.  We should be cautious about handing regulators too much control over our lives for the simple reason that they are not angels.

It's not as if one must choose between absolute laissez faire or authoritarian control.  A modicum of regulation to prevent outright fraud is sufficient.

Y'know, the US might consider making the currency attractive as a store of value by backing USD with gold (or even wheat), instead of conducting geopolitical intrigues.

I’m not confused on this point.  Wallace did not explicitly speak out against Stalin until 1952:
(Delong is a respected economist, on the center-left in his political writing at least)
The crimes of Stalin were well known in the West by that time.  Nearly every public figure on the left had explicitly rejected Stalin many years before.  
To be entirely fair, I suppose it is easy to cast a harsh historical judgement given the release of documents (e.g. Venona papers) that establish the degree of Soviet paid and unpaid influence on the US intellectual class.  Wallace was probably more dupe than agent.  At best, he was stunningly naive.
BTW, the National Review article is the best written of the three.  Speaking for myself, I enjoy reading polemic writing on the left and have many friends on the left.

In essence, if the intent is to deposit $10K eventually, and it isn't an issue of cashflow (e.g., you get $4K in each of the next three months, and deposit each amount when you receive it) then I suggest just going through the disclosure process and completing the additional paperwork.  It would be much more expensive to fight a legal battle against a structuring charge.  I am not an attorney, BTW, but it's a good idea to consult one if you are moving significant amounts of cash around regularly.
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:25:44
Don't do this.  Attempting to circumvent financial disclosure laws may be construed as a federal crime ("structuring")

An article from Slate (hardly a bastion of flinty anarchocapitalism)  on Wallace:
One from Vox, again not a right-wing journal:
And one from National Review:
The “necessity” of the bank bailouts and egregious actions such as the expropriation of Chrysler and GM was a political feint.  The real error was the forced marriage of JP Morgan and Bear Stearns, which led the market to believe that the Fed or Treasury would backstop future bankruptcy threats.  The world would have been better off had Bear and Goldman been allowed to go under, and the self-dealing and untoward political influence been prosecuted.

To answer your question, I think the Federal Reserve was largely responsible for the bubbles (stock market, real estate) that preceded the Depression, as well as for the collapse.  There were many other factors that contributed, such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, but the Fed inflated the bubble to begin with.
What would have been better?
Letting prices fall.  Let’s consider the previous economic downturn:  there was a sharp deflationary recession in 1920-21, following the end of WWI. 
From May 1920 to July 1921, automobile production declined by 60%, and wholesale prices fell by nearly 37%.  The stock market slid by 47% from November 1919 through August 1921, more severe than the 43% decline in the Panic of 1907.   From 1919 to 1922 the rate of business failures tripled, climbing from 37 failures to 120 failures per every 10,000 businesses.  Unemployment rose to nearly 12%.
This recession contributed to Harding’s winning the Presidency in 1920.  The government response under Harding was limited and targeted.  There was large-scale unemployment relief, which was initiated under Wilson.  But the largest government action was income tax cuts pushed forward by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon.
Sure, the public works and social programs did help individuals and families in the Great Depression (by the way, FDR explicitly rejected the idea of welfare.  E.g., social security was conceived as “social insurance” that workers must pay into).  But the regulatory apparatus that was erected under FDR did much to inhibit the recovery in business conditions.  In my view, this harm far outweighed the benefits of the relief programs.
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:00:15
FDR’s economic policy was ridiculous, and it lengthened the Depression.  
His idea was that “prices are too low”, the problem not being the collapse in demand.  Thus, under the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) the Fedgov destroyed millions of bushels of grain to constrain supply and raise prices!  In 1933 alone, cotton farmers were paid $100M to plow their cotton plants back into the ground.  The federal govt bought 6M hogs from farmers in the same year, and destroyed them.  The AAA was led by Henry Wallace, who was impressed with Soviet farm collectivization, and wanted to bring Stalin’s magic touch to the US.
Similarly, there were wage and price controls under the National Recovery Act.  Business owners were imprisoned for paying their workers “too much”.
Fortunately, the US Supreme Court struck down the AAA and NRA as unconstitutional.  But the anti-gold lunacy was conceived by the same authoritarians, and it continued until 1975.  As Gerald Ford, the President who ended the ban said, “the government that can give you everything you want, can take it all away.”

When did I say anything about “pulling oneself up by ones bootstraps”?  It seems like you would rather play ersatz Rex Tugwell New Deal tough guy and joust against a libertarian straw man than listen.
The fact is that Henry Wallace was a Stalinist right up until 1952, which puts him ahead of Kruschev by a year in rejecting the genocides, purges, and political murders.
Another example of New Deal economic lunacy was the law that prevented bank holding companies from owning banks across state lines, or from selling notes across state lines.  This resulted in banks being tied closely to the economic conditions in particular communities.  If a large factory closed, bank failures were likely to follow.  Something similar happened in the S&amp;L crisis in the late 80s, after oil prices collapsed.
Compare this with the relatively deregulated environment during/after the so-called financial crisis in 2008-9.  Meredith Whitney predicted hundreds of community bank failures in 2011-2013, but this never happened.  In the less authoritarian regulatory environment, these banks had diversified, both geographically and in the types of collateral held.  Most were run well, since the leadership at these banks knew that they couldn’t count on financial “crisis”-style bailouts from their political allies.
