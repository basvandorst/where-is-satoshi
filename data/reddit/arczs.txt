If*. Don't pretend like you have a crystal ball.

Go light all your money on fire then, you pseudointellectual.

Teslas are sick as fuck you bum.

Like? Can you name a few?

Man it's almost at 13k. Don't know if I can hold on for much longer!!

Teach me, master. What shall I invest my coffers into? 2.5M net worth is godmode.

So would it be fair to ask for that 5 minutes of advice? I'm just a working guy who has been saving up about half of my paycheck every other week. So far I have about $2K in my savings, ready to be put to work. I'm new to investing, but I figure if I put my money into things that people will always need (food/water, health care, real estate) I can't go wrong... right? And would it be worth it to dump maybe half of that 2 grand into BTC? I've already got a coinbase pro account.
Really, this comes down to me searching for the financial freedom I've been working my ass off for for 4 years now. I realize that working a dead end job will get me nowhere near that dream, I need a shift and I don't care how long it takes. And I say all this as I get ready for my 9-5 job... Thanks in advance man.

I can tell you bought your fedora with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:00:27
Such a neckbeard thing to say. But do you man.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:15:00
No, they shouldn't.

I seriously appreciate that you took time out of your day to help me out, just came back from an 8 hour shift and was pleasantly surprised. Thank you for that. 
My dad is a programmer and so I do have a little experience with what he tried to teach me when I was younger. I will definitely consider a career towards computer science, seems like a fulfilling albeit tedious line of work. I've never been one to settle for the easy rundown path, there's just no money to be made there. I don't want to spend the rest of my life working for someone else's dream. I just can't, and I won't, no matter how much work I'll need to put in.
As for the BTC investment, I'll be sure to put at least half of my savings towards it. I've been doing a lot of research in my spare time and I am convinced that crypto really is the future. Decentralized, universal digital currency? Count me in. It's only a matter of time until the world settles on a new currency for the global economy. Credits, so to speak.

Shave the neckbeard from time to time.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:53:55
What about coinbase pro users?  I fully own my BTC, right?

Having $3M in your bank account makes you undeniably rich, don't try to pretend like it doesn't.
