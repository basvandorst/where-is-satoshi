How? You just hoping for the best? lol

If I were you, I'd be worried that the leading developer/self-proclaimed 'head scientist' of Bitcoin doesn't know that nodes don't just download transactions, they upload them to other nodes - or what the actual average size of transactions is

Ah yes.. one of the favorite buzzwords of Bitcoiners designed to obscure the true meaning of the term - which is centralized transactions.
Paypal 2.0 LOL


No, nodes require the blockchain. Do you understand the basics of how Bitcoin works? Seriously, someone who understands how Bitcoin works would not say something so stupid as this.

Sidechains.. you mean 'centralization'?
Because if they're not centralized, and you just mean blockchains seperate from Bitcoin - then that would just DOUBLE the necessary bandwidth and amount of data flowing through the submarine pipelines

Hey Brucey, what happened to [$3000 by 2015?](
'There's still time left!' I hear your fluttering Bitcoiner heart say - Wanna have a bet on it? (No Bitcoins thanks, only real money; cash)

Submarine pipelines cost money to build and lay bro
They have limited bandwidth capacity, so you have to pay according to the demand for your slice of the capacity
Ever heard of 'international congestion' when it comes to internet speeds? That's referring to the fact that the international underwater pipelines connecting the internet between countries don't have enough bandwidth for all the shit that's being crammed through it.

Funny, no response - probably because you just used a buzzword without knowing it's actual meaning
Sidechains seriously have nothing to do with the bandwidth nodes require; in fact, if employed, they would only serve to inflate the amount of bandwidth needed
And to think that you're a moderator here.. I guess you are representative of the most distinctive traits of Bitcoiners though

Quote from that page:
"People claiming that "Bitcoin Doesn't Scale" are theoretically correct"
Gavin says the average transaction size is 8000 bits, which is 250 bytes. I read this from him before. That is wrong, as evidenced by the sources I have provided in my post - the actual average size is ~550 bytes per transaction.
He then says


Here he fails to take into account that the bulk of bandwidth and data is NOT used downloading blocks, but uploading them to other nodes - nodes upload typically 10x as much as they download.

I did a calculation, but didn't include it in the original post because I couldn't give a precise figure, that the real base cost (just of the cable) would end up being in the tens of thousands of dollars per year to run a node (if Bitcoin were on the scale of VISA)
You gonna fork out those tens of thousands of dollars? I bet you won't
Nodes have been decreasing rapidly. Now there are what, 6000 left? Gavin Andresen just ignores the problem (shocking to me that he doesn't even know, or deceives others from knowing, that nodes upload data rather than just download).
And that's with a tiny number of transactions! What is it now, 1 or 2 transactions per second, if even that? And nodes are already folding! There'll be none left before Bitcoin even gets anywhere close to the scale of VISA (not that it will ever happen of course)
