Elon Musk has claimed that he doesn't care about Bitcoin. However, he supports us by making products that people use bitcoin to buy. Use and earn back your bitcoin with services, guys, don't let the market get stagnant. That's what happened to the Stock Market in the great depression.

So THAT'S what everyone has been raving about! I was gonna switch to Gemini anyway since Coinbase accounts have reportedly been closed randomly. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:16:54
\&gt;  This will be literally our last chance to own a single Bitcoin for a 4 digit price.
The price of anything, including cryptocurrencies, depends on Supply and Demand. The former is determined by mining - which is controlled and regulated well. The latter depends on us. We need to keep using bitcoin by providing goods and services that use it. Otherwise, the price will fall, and remain under 7k forever. If everyone HODLs, the market becomes stagnant.

How do you think BTC price is determined? Supply and DEMAND. Don't speculate, develop projects that use BTC!
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:57:12
I will never stop replying to these stupid hype posts saying anything else: KEEP USING BITCOIN. Bitcoin was meant to be traded, not hodl'd until you lose it. What do you guys think happened in the Great Depression?

@_date: 2018-05-13 22:04:14


Yeah, in your first world, un-tariffed, country there. People who need Bitcoin accept it, and plenty of people do and always will rely on some crypto just because of the circumstances they are in.

What do you think working for a company is doing? Supporting their cause. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:21:40
It's the same with any investment: you don't give money to the company because it will make you rich, only because it will support a cause you believe in, like regulating banking with computers, which is what Bitcoin is!
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:31:51
Bitcoin isn't a company, and time is money. Welcome to Reddit. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:02:40
Bitcoin is not an investment. It is a currency. Use it and earn it to keep the market alive, or we'll have a cyber-depression. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 20:29:36
We need more applications for Bitcoin, and not just other crypto currencies, scams and heists.

Every miner and mining team. There's so much money in this, that as opposed to worrying about underdevelopment, you need to worry about corruption. After all, I'm sure this subreddit can remind me of exactly how many people have claimed to be Satoshi himself! Suffice it to say that Bitcoin itself can't be corrupted because of how simple it is and how many people mine for them. Goto earn.com, they have a non-random
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:28:53
The, "Bull Runs," or rapid Bitcoin transaction periods, are independent from one another. It depends on when the events that suppport using Bitcoin end, and when others start, e.g. less Fiat currency tariffs, bailouts, and failures. You can't determine the next peak based on the previous ones.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:55:54
Shih poo? Rascal mustache dogs...
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:32:39
It also ironically discourages other people from buying themselves: they say things like, "I can't afford a whole Bitcoin," or, "I'll just wait for it to get lower again..." There should be more posts about buying fractions of BTC and spreading the assets to other crypto currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:05:27

@_date: 2018-11-28 22:11:35
Wrong. Demand is determined by how many people want it. Nobody will want it if all anyone uses it for is to make money. Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme. It is a currency. Demand is determined by how useful it is as a currency. Like I said, earn and use.
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:15:08
How is it bad advice? What determines the price of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:46:08
So what happens when we run out of gold to mine? 
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:33:21
I will keep posting this religiously whenever I see the word, "hodl." Not using a currency makes it lose value. Using it makes it gain value. Earn and use, don't just mine and hodl. The stock market crashed, causing the, "Great Depression," because of the same thing: greed! Money is only as valuable as its uses!
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:03:36
Yeah right. Username checks out.
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:14:47
Holding - or as you call it, "hodling" - your bitcoins is hurting the market. Using and earning them helps the market. Don't start another great depression. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:55:57
Tell that to some Venezuelans
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:26:27
That's only part of the story. It transfers value between people without any trusted intermediary *to regulate it.* A service for selling Bitcoin is helping the market, not hurting it. Otherwise, you would have to mine if you wanted some. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:19:07
Do I really imagine storing value has no use?
