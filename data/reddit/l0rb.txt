It makes no real difference. The software being open source implies that the algorithm is public. And of top of that, it shows that not only does the algorithm exist but it has a working implementation.

That's not true, many coins have fine decentralization. What matters most is adoption. How many coins have any foothold at all in physical stores and are used for anything else than speculation?
Edit: why the downvote? What I'm saying is that BTC is superior to all the other coins because it's the only one with meaningful adoption and applications outside of speculating the markets. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:29:01


In the case of bitcoin it would not be that easy. You still have to produce a valid block that contains your transaction with a difficulty that is at least as high as the last legit block they have seen. That requires some serious amounts of hashpower. And for larger payments they would likely require more than just 1 confirmation.
@_date: 2019-03-07 09:05:42
Depends of course a bit on how we define decentralization but going by how concentrated the hashrate is, BTC is less decentralized than LTC and about equally centralized as ETH. But it seems people are misinterpreting what I wanted to say: Many coins are decentralized enough for that to not be a problem. Only bitcoin has meaningful adoption.

I dunno. People seem to be lazy fucks. They often prefer the comfort and perceived security of a bank, or crypto exchange, over having to deal with keeping your private keys safe on your own. If people allow any organization to hold their coins, without proof that the organization actually controls this many coins on-chain, there is a significant risk of a fractional reserve system forming.

The issue here is mostly that the current government values staying in power short-term more than improving the economy long-term. Any short-term sacrifices that would have to be made to start getting a hold of this runaway hyperinflation will immediately lead to the government being toppled. (Mainly because they would have to cut spending on the military, and the military is the only thing really keeping them in power.)
@_date: 2019-08-16 07:02:23
Exchanges can stop withdrawals just as well. It would be true if people actually owned their private keys but that's not the case. There is only 4 addresses with more than 100k btc and they are all owned by exchanges. Just those 4 addresses is already 3% of the whole btc supply that is owned by the "banks of bitcoin".
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:59:14
It also depends on the governments willingness to massively cut their spending. They need to keep printing money to pay for all the governments expenses. While long-term it would be better for the economy to just stop spending so much, the moment that Maduro stops paying the military the whole government goes down.
@_date: 2019-08-26 16:55:51
Not everyone is creating just a payment system. I don't care at all if the value of ETH goes to 0, just makes my smart contracts cheaper to execute. The scripting language of bitcoin is way too primitive for complex applications. If you want to have a trustless decentralized utility token, that's what you use ETH for. Bitcoin is just money, but there are other things in the world than money.

\`Floor\` and \`momentum\` and all those fancy TA terms mean nothing. There is only one measure that can reliably predict the long-term price direction, and it's adoption. People using bitcoin to buy cars and coffees is what we should look at.

Venezuela is working hard to avoid this. Until 2008 they had bolivar, which than was replaced with "bolivar fuerte" (BF) at a ratio of 1000:1. In 2018 inflation killed that too and they introduced the "bolivar soberano" (BS) with a rate of 100,000:1. The highest denomination of the BS is 50,000
50,000 BS = 5,000,000,000 BF = 5,000,000,000,000 bolivar of 2008. So they would have even more zeros on their bills than Zimbabwe if they didn't keep dropping them.

A single person withdrawing from coinbase also doesn't make a dent. Coinbase isn't exactly like a bank yet, but if people keep entrusting exchanges with their btc there's a real danger of it becoming like one.

@_date: 2019-04-26 11:37:02

If you can. You only can do that if the exchange allows you to. It works as long as they are trustworthy. But what separates bitcoin from usd is that it is trustless. I don't see the difference between trusting a bank and trusting a crypto exchange. Do you?

You don't have to but people do it anyway. The five richest Bitcoin addresses are all owned by exchanges. Having a BTC balance on an exchange is the same thing as having a USD balance at a bank, just with more risk. How do we even know all those exchanges own enough bitcoin for all their customers balances? If you don't own the keys it's just the banking system all over again, this time with btc instead of gold.

Same way it's possible on bitcoin -&gt; if majority of miners agree to do it. Basically it's a hard fork. The difference to bitcoin is that ethereum actually had a successful hardfork when there was a major hack, and they rolled back the chain to return the funds.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:54:20
You are right, they technically didn't roll back the blockchain. They did however have a hardfork to undo something that happened on the blochchain. From an end users point of view it really is not much different to partially rolling back the blockchain. And it's really up to the end user and more of a philosphical debate whether that's good or bad. The majority seems to agree that it was a good thing as most people are using eth over classic.

What you are asking is if the series 100/(x+200* n) ever converges. first let's change that a bit. 100/(x+200*n) = 1/(x/100 + 2n) = 1/2 * 1/(x/50 + n) where x/50 is some constant. This is just half of the harmonic series with the first terms until 1/(x/50) cut off. Since the harmonic series diverges, so does half of it, and so does the harmonic series with some terms in the front removed. So yes, you can reach 10BTC or 100BTC or any number you want like that .... but it may take a very loooooooong time.
