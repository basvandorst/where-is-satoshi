This is our take on a Yelp for cryptocurrencies. The goal is to be able to be out around your city and be able to quickly find a location where you can spend your coins. We believe we should all try to do this as much as we can to bring success to the merchants that opt to take cryptocurrencies and to encourage other merchants to do so.
The site has been optimized for mobile. You can upvote/downvote your favorite/least favorite businesses and filter by the type of business you're looking for. Please let us know if you have any feedback as we would like to continue development on it. Thanks for checking us out.
We would like to keep it ad free but it does cost us time and money to run so we were hoping we could run it off of donations. Please, if it is helpful to you, consider donating here (BTC):

It's pretty important to solidify bitcoin as a currency and not just an asset, so I wrote:  Check it out and see if you can spend bitcoins in wherever you live ;)
