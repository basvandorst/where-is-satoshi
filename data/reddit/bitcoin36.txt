I can really seeing this wallet being useful when you introduce Bitcoin to friends or merchants. Instead of them having to download an app and having to make themselves an account you can tell them to go to rushwallet.com and send them bitcoins right then and there.

Because I trust them yes I have 2FA enabled. Its weird transactions that were there like showing that I received the 18BTC disappeared as well

Yes my account and Idk but the transactions saying I just received 17BTC and 1.37BTC like it should disappeared as well. Are you with Coinbase?
