Im all for a system that uses the technology he is talking about so long as it is voluntary. My problem is with the groups of people (governments) who want to track people using national or international ID systems. He should be focusing his efforts in the private sector, where users and providers of goods and services can benefit together on a mutually consensual basis. The UN, which is composed of governments who are all currently engaged in human rights violations and suppression of freedoms is the organization he decides to help out?!?! Dafuck?!? Has he not read the UN declaration of Human Rights? Its the biggest lump of socialist feel good contradictory fluff shit...One government, one currency, one identification system and one ring to rule them all is exactly what those kind of people in those positions want to do. Why is he helping them with that agenda!?!

There is a difference between a voluntary identification system and a government mandated identification system...if its not voluntary and not consensual, its forced. Usually when governments force citizens to do things against their will, it requires guns and violence. As a voluntarist I am completely against any government mandated identification systems for that reason.

So...what he is saying is that he wants to help a prospective world government organization track human beings? I had much respect for this guy up until now. He has either lost his mind, has been corrupted/blackmailed/bribed, or he is just a huge ignorant idiot. WTF?! Wake up dude! Your not doing anyone a favor except for the very people who want to watch and control the world! Just look at the list opf countries who are a part of it...and ask yourself, are they violating any human rights recently or currently? YES, so why would you help those scumbag thugs out!?!
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:02:07
Identity is important...in the free market, and if I so happen to voluntarily decide that it should be important for me. But when violent governments get involved and want to mandate and track human beings across the globe? This is the exact opposite kind of power you want to give to those kind of people.
Not to mention, a license to travel in a so called "free" country is a joke, it was merely another id scheme to track humans, so its not like we havent seen this before. As a bitcoiner, bank accounts are a joke. College degree? JOKE...passports to cross imaginary borders created by  violent governments? Even a bigger fucking joke...do have anything else that isnt a laughable defense for the scheme he is proposing?

Why do governments spend a ridiculous amount of time and money to be able to track human beings i.e. "their" citizens aka their property??? If you dont think identification and the ability to track humans is profitable for violent governments then you haven't studied history closely enough.
@_date: 2016-04-21 20:02:26
If we can no longer do basic things for survival like work, travel, and banking without a government id, then we are not as free as we like to think we are. Has nothing to do with having balls or not...its being realistic. And while its voluntary for me to try to maneuver through the system without an id, there are laws that are enforced by governments which prevent businesses being able to hire people without an id, or which violently stop people from crossing government borders.

Either pay, or risk his and other venders identities becoming known to the very organization that is at "war" with these free trade drug criminals which would result into what we have today a life sentence. So i dunno, but if i was him i would have done the same thing...its self defense if your not the one initiating violence...and the govt would do the same exact thing to anyone who would try to extort it as well...whats the difference?

Common argument I hear all the time..." but, but...what will we do without government?? Who will feed us, protect us, and wipe our butts???"
People dont need rulers, masters or governments to tell them how to spend their money or live their lives...if anything a decentralized currency will be doing the Greeks a huge favor and decentralize the government bringing power back to the people. Government can not give to one person without first having to take from another. It does not CREATE wealth, it redistributes wealth how it sees fit which is usually in favor of those in power, the wealthy elite corporate class. There is also nothing that government can do that we can not do for each other as a community and voluntarily.

What do you mean "Universal Healthcare"? Are talking about "free" Healthcare because no one is denying everyone health care but the government who doesnt allow private practice for basic things such as check ups and minor issues an intern can practically handle. Government enforced Licensure laws deny Universal Healthcare if anything...But I assume you are speaking of the former "free" kind of Health care....so tell me, who pays for it? Is this a consentual contract where someone has voluntarily decided to opt for such services or is this being paid for by people who are forced to pay for services whether they have mutually consented to or not? You see "FREE" is a funny word people like to throw around very loosely, and a first lesson is that there is nothing that comes from the government that doesnt have a cost. A government must first take by force taxes on income before redistrubting the wealth "evenely" if you know what i mean...they have to take before they give out this free health care you speak of if in fact that is what you are talking about...but i guess if your into nonconsentual things like rape, robbery, homicide and extortion/taxation or w/e you want to call it...then your either extremely confused or just a straight up psychopath

 The share holders i.e. the real owners of the Federal Reserve, who we dont know and probably no way of ever finding out who they are, pull the strings and stand to lose the most if the dollar collapses. But will they let that happen? They have some choices to make with a lot of money, and what they do makes a huge impact on how the rest of the world reacts...they can cling to their dirty money and simply cut back the money supply with "austerity" measures by letting some dumb ass republican in office or even a so called "libertarian" then shift blame for the support of the masses to revolt, in which case the tanks will roll out and FEMA camps get set up to quell the masses who once being dependent on the state for income or entitlements no longer have pensions or food on the table. This will most likely be bloody and ugly. 
OR...they save themselves the headache and ditch the dollar before its too late and give into exchanging their dollars for bitcoin in which case there will be a massive to the moon price surge and every libertarian bitcoin investor/early adopter becomes the wealthiest people on the planet, having more money power and influence in the free market than ever before! Truly my hope for our future, but who knows as this is all just wildly speculative...
The first scenario is probably in the bankers power playbook, however nature likes to throw random curve balls at us in the most unexpected times...bitcoin is that curve ball they didnt see coming and had no way to plan for. Im pretty sure they will be forced to adopt or else face massive losses in their bank accounts.

A couple questions:
Where are the bitcoins coming from (whos address)? 
Where is the cash going to (who's account)? Store owner? Lamassu Kiosk owner? 
Do they have to keep a certain amount of bitcoin available for the kiosk to provide BTC? How much? 
If so, wouldnt that require constant buying into bitcoin through the bank account of the owner to replenish the kiosk with funds? 
And if that is the case, would that raise any red flags of suspicion to the bank and the regulators?

The fact that the majority of people dont understand how important money is in a society/economy, and how important it is to know who has control over the supply, goes to show how government education is a massive failure or success, depending on if your a banker or not, and its not here to educate us but to misinform us. As soon as more consumers become aware of this precarious situation and relationship and are now offered an alternative like bitcoin, the fed will slowly lose its consumers confidence and credibility in the future currency market.

"Mainstream libertarianism" AKA minarchism (a belief in limited government, i.e. courts, police, and military) has its philosophical flaws, and in my opinion is NOT libertarian at all...its not consistent with its view of property rights so long as they maintain the "right" for any group of individuals the authority to tax, or confiscate property w/o consent.
 All forms of taxation, even the most limited, is immoral. If it cannot be funded by voluntary means of mutual consent, it shouldnt be funded at all. But once a group of individuals "legalize" theft on the smallest of scales the inevitable direction is the increase of that theft until there is nothing left to steal.

I am arguing the way you are using the term government/governance. Government is the authority to tax, everything else is free market and voluntary trade i.e. capitalism.


So the people who are not forced into having a government can voluntarily create a government...?A government that taxes i.e. forces other people to pay for government? By its very definition a government is a taxing authority. Which is why saying its okay to have government as long as it is not forced upon someone is an argument which contradicts itself. I think the proper terms you are looking for are defense and arbitration services, not government.  
Edit: Would you call a private security firm funded by voluntary trade, a government? I wouldnt...

I, like you, oppose coercive monopolies of all kinds, but I am curious as to what your definition of government/governance is? I feel as though the "state" is to the church (a physical institution) as the "government" is to religion,(an unfounded/irrational faith based belief system) 


IMO, there is no such thing as a "non-statist government" as you imply. One simply cannot exist without the other. That would be equivelent to a churchless religion which in that case is individual spirituality or in the case of governence, individual sovereignty. 


Couldnt disagree more...that IS the sytem we have today. Nation states and their perspective governments compete...violently. DECENTRALIZATION is however inevitable.

Is it really all that nuts to not want to be forced to pay for NSA surveillance , DEAs drug war, CIA foreign wars and gun smuggling, military bombings of innocent civilians overseas, drone bombings, bailouts of banks and corporations, Social Security which I will not a see a cent of...i mean seriously i could keep going on and on and on...but i think you get the point...if i, or others dont want to pay for that crap we have no other choice but to pay or move? Thats NOT like walking into walmart and being able to walk out... Unless your spatial perception is all jacked up

ALL government employees paychecks are dependent on stolen tax dollars...its only natural for them to do what they know how to do best. Until taxation is deemed immoral this shit will go on...just sitting here waiting for the brainwashed to wake up to that fact.

Voluntary? Like you pay your taxes voluntarily? What happens to people who dont "voluntarily" pay their taxes? I believe if you dont pay what is demanded, the authorities simply put you in a cage...voluntarily of course, right?

I dont think there is anything wrong with retaliating against someone who is trying to extort you and initiated violence...i believe in self defense. It is the fault of the extorter who has come to have a bounty put on his head, and rightfully so.

As long as theft AKA taxation is legal for one group over another there will always be these kind of problems. Every Government to ever exist has always been a criminal organization. They are just really good at manipulating people to think otherwise.

What back water country do you speak of would i be living under but my own backyard and house if there was no one there to steal from me and call it a tax? Taxation provides us with privileges you think? And what if i dont want such handouts? What if i want my own responsibility? What if i dont want to hand over my money to thieves? Should i be put in a cage? Or let me guess...i should be forced off of the land and house i bought and paid for and go to Somalia? 
How much violence are you willing to use against fellow humans who refuse your taxes?????

“The most critical thing here is that this is being driven by the industry,” he said. “This wasn’t LE coming to us and saying ‘Help us’, this was the industry going to law enforcement and saying, ‘Let us help you’.”
This "alliance" being directed by this guy has nothing to do with industry and innovation and everything to do with corruption and regulatory capture.

The whole point is to get away from any one person or group controlling such a powerful tool as currency and go towards a future which is decentralized giving people power to make decisions in transferring or storing their wealth...all else is simply a return to archaic banking manipulation and control. Its absurd and ass backwards. Plus, if people are given the choice between the two which one would people logically go with??? Unless they FORCE people to use their currency there is no need for central banks putting their noses where they dont belong.

Lol...you are about to go down one of the deepest rabbit holes my friend...Human Action is pretty much the bible of Austrian Economics and libertarianism. Once you become comfortable with austrian economics...or you may just skip straight to it, check out the writings of Murray Rothbard who further expanded the ideas of the free markets. The key is to keep challenging your long held beliefs and question everything! Eventually, after studying some Rothbard you should, as I and many others have, come upon the works of Samuel Edward Konkin III, the founder of Agorism, an extension of austrian economic theory and that of the free market and the counter economy. You will come to find that Human Action is the under lying theory, and agorism is theinevitable end goal for free people to remain free. Have fun and good luck along your journey! Its a lot of info they wont ever teach at any govt mandated re education center aka "shcool."
