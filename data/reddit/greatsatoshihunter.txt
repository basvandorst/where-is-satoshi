Hello to all Bitcoiners!
We had the JackPot Spin and we have a winner!
The selection of the winner is provably fair with the following calculation:
Based on the 1000th bet, we get the next 4 bytes and we convert them from hexadecimal to decimal. The take from that number the modulo of 1000 (last 3 digits 0-999) and we add 1 to have a number from 1 to 1000. The winner is the address we made the bet with that number.
The Jackpot transaction is:
So accordingly (fd2b) will be used for the calculation.
The next 
HEX-TO-INT(fd2b) mod 1000 + 1 = 64811 mod 1000 + 1 = 811 + 1 = 812
That bet is 
812   1EjWAFQ7eEe9BSBdZGNjNJjYirHZKp7hWw   Sun, 21 Sep 2014 11:25:34   0.001   0
That player (BTC address) made 176 bets and it had 17.6% probability to win the Jackpot.
More JackPots in the way  Wink
