I wonder how blockstream will feel if they cannot monetize their lightning layer since ICE just spent 14 months building their own central hub for bitcoin. Now you CAN buy your coffee with it. I just hope they don’t attack Microsoft or the NYSE like they did coinbase et al.

Yeah the only currency I see on ethereum is the dai stable coin worth 1 dollar. The only advantage I see with it is that you can swap your coins from myetherwallet to dai to essentially tether up when things drop. Dai never goes up so no chance moon like bitcoin

Yep. And I doubt that will change in the next 10 years. By then bitcoin will be worth while gdps

Yep. Everything you can build on ethereum you can easily build on bitcoin. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage and bigger marketcap. Greg maxwell could code ethereum onto bitcoin in his sleep - AND with the lightning network, the smart contracts will be free.

Yep. So easy to use too. Just read the tutorial and instantly bitcoin is the best crypto. No reason for any other coin.

Fuck miners. They have no place in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:13:48
Yep. Some of the miners flop to Bcash when it’s more profitable. We should boycott them. If a miner switches over - it should be 1 strike and you’re out and stop them from mining for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:05:34
Please don’t talk about altcoins on the bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:16:03
We need to get rid of the miners. Boycott them when they flip to bch when they think it’s more profitable. Don’t allow them to flip back.

They will fall don’t worry. Don’t know why amazon web services would even provide an ethereum and hyperledger block chain template when bitcoin is the king and should have first mover advantage. They’ll definitely release a bitcoin one when bitcoin is back at 80 percent dominance.

I agree. Bitcoin eventually will become so great that even buying cars isn’t worthy of its use. Bitcoin is too precious to give up. If you’re moving less than 100k, you should be using litecoin.

Actually we should boycott Wikipedia because wikimedia (the foundation behind Wikipedia) has partnered with the request network, an ethereum token.

Bitcoin is not a currency. Dai stablecoin is a currency. It’s always 1 dollar and always predictable. Even when a cdp on the makerdao platform was liquidated for 1 million USD, dai remained at 1 usd. 
Bitcoin is digital gold. We hold it because the value increases and is not pegged to useless fiat. Bitcoin has a learning curve which keeps it scarce. If everyone knew how to determine the transaction fee or if every transaction on the lightning network went through, everyone would own bitcoin reducing its scarcity. 
Bitcoin will soon reach the marketcap of real gold. We’re early folks. Get in before we hit 7 trillion.

There is no reason for stablecoins like dai or dgx because they stay the same value. Even when one of the CDPs on the makerdao platform was liquidated for over a million dollars, dai stablecoins was still equal to 1 USD. We hold gold because the price may go up. Bitcoin is digital gold. Get as much as you can at this early stage, bitcoins market cap will be 7 trillion in years.

I googled it and found 3 different block explorers with average fee for 10 min
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:10:13
Current fees is 3.50. That’s a weeks work at minimum wage. If you want to store your value, why not put money in stable coins which remain constant value and have transaction fees ten times smaller
