I apologize. I thought the "alternate reality" in the title would be pretty clear it was a joke. I'll be more clear in the future =/

awesome! thanks for that!

I brought up switching payroll at my company to wagepoint a while back and it went well right up untill the main decision maker went to wagepoints website. I get that they are trying to be "fun".... but it came across as unprofessional. So i'd love to see another canadian payroll provider offer the same service. One with a more serious approach.....
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:05:07
cavirtex did that

It's funny you bring this up. I've recently been at court following a trial that's affects someone I know. I see the trial unfold in person, but when I get home  and go looking for news segments about the trial, I find a slightly different story from every news outlet, none of them accurate.

watch [this video]( then tell me Montreal isn't a "real city". (sorry, couldn't find the youtube link after 3 seconds of looking) Also, [The Bitcoin Embassy]( does your city have one?

This is the first time I've ever actually seen Kim Dotcom. I have no idea why, but I always sorta pictured him looking like PSY. No clue why. I think I prefer the imaginary version in my head.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:42:10
Haha. Sorry... I shoulda been more clear it was a joke... But that was my point. That a little honesty and a genuine effort to make things right would really go a long way.

The app looks nice! From looking at the screen shots on play, here is what it's missing for me to download it and replace what i'm currently using. I'm not trying to be a jerk, or bash your app. I'm just telling you honestly what it would need for me to ditch bitcoinium (which i paid for) to use yours instead. If you offered everything i outline below, i wouldn't hesitate to buy the app for 5-6$
* compact mode of some sort. I'd want to get 2 of them side by side. Like many others i'm sure, i run about 8 widgets like this and want them all on the same screen.
* 24hr high/low, volume
* widget background opacity setting
* text color selector
* change alarm:on/off text to a tiny bell icon with/without a line through it.
* Alarm set points dont need to be on main widget, but instead in the the widget's settings, and you should be able to to set mulitple alarms per widget ( notify me at 600,650,700,...)
* The refresh button doesn't need to occupy 10% of the widget, Tap to refresh would suffice
* Add CaVirtex, Vault of Satoshi, Huobi
* Add alt coin support when selected exchanges supports them

You don't have it listed, but quadrigacx has said they will split the coins and make tokens on both chains available to customers. As for trading bcc, they haven't made a decision yet on if they will list bcc trading pairs.

i suppose that was a pretty obvious one to start with ;) thanks!

They are still around. New address as was pointed out, but still going... They don't seem to have the same number of players as they used to, but you can usually find a game... As far as trustworthy, I've had funds on their site for a couple years, and they haven't stolen them yet.....

can you provide high res image of the front and back of the bill?  something at least 1600px wide and preferably without a watermark on the images.
EDIT: i found some decent images to work from... i'll try and whip something up later tonight. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:08:13
Actually, I spend them quite regularly. I've bought quite a few humble bundles since they started accepting btc. And anytime I need to pay a friend a few bucks for whatever reason, I will always push bitcoin first. The point I was trying to make with my story was forget about trying to make money buying and selling with every drop and rise, but instead just always buy more. I guess I should have also pointed out that you shouldn't be afraid to spend them as well cause that's the best way for bitcoin to prosper. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:57:53
exactly. like i said, not for everyone, but for A LOT of people.... you dont really have to worry about paypal just closing up shop overnight. Also, i'm wiling to bet paypal spends more on security each year than most other bitcoin related business' make.

Id say come to Montreal. Perhaps the Bitcoin Embassy would help him get set up. 
Only downside would be if he didn't speak any french. Wouldn't be impossible by any means... but know french will most certainly help.

dont get me wrong... quickbt is awesome, and i use them often enough... but for big transactions, their fees add up quick...

and it just comes out so naturally.......

I bought BitErotic.com a few months ago from the original owners, but never bothered getting it going again. It's for sale for the right price...

@_date: 2013-11-05 17:39:48
correct me if i'm wrong, but if someone had my private key, they wouldn't need bitcoin-qt's wallet file or the password to unlock the file.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:44:07
Good job guys! Looks like you've nicely filled a gap on the road to making micro transactions commonplace. App is clean and simple. I'll be keeping my eye on this one!
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:12:06
So i'm seriously considering putting up 100$ on kickstarter to support your effort (and cause i REALLY want the autographed B&amp;T scripts). 2 questions first.
1) I'd really rather pay with bitcoin. If i make the contribution through coinbase, will i still get the scipts?
2) As much as i'd love to have the autographed scripts, it would be so much better if they were autographed by Bill AND Ted! Any chance of convincing Keanu to sign a couple and add a new contribution level that would give scripts autographed by both of you?

@_date: 2013-11-29 20:05:35
The thing that I don't really see being mentioned anywhere, is aside from being a trustworthy escrow if they incorporated btc into paypal, is simply having a hosted wallet service with paypals name behind it would put A LOT of people at ease. I'm not saying I would care that much, but I think a huge number of people who are worried about storing their own coins would trust paypal to do it for them. Thus would be huge in bringing btc more mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:11:55
well, the original i worked with wasnt the greatest quality, and i wont pretend to be a pro.... but here's what i came up with:
@_date: 2013-09-14 05:43:53
Is it a standalone wallet? I just assumed it was just an interface to their website. But if that's the best option, ill tell him to get that. 
Thanks for the reply! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:40:42
No.. I mean a full out bitcoin wallet. Like blockchain.info, but hosted by paypal.

the "private key" in the image is just my public key again. It was just to show what it looked like.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:37:26
Ok, i changed the public key side slightly, and made the private key side. (it`s not actually the private key, just a repeat of the public key)
[public key](
[private key](
so... should i upload them with QR and key areas blank?

once you've open the US account through rbc, you just have to call them and ask for the routing number... takes 5 minutes
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:16:44
you should just use the search query "bitcoin" and then sort by date. it will return a few unrelated pieces, but not all the segments carried the full title.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:17:57
I got bored and decided to design a paper wallet. It's kinda cheesy, but that's sorta the point. I haven't done the reverse side yet.
If anyone cares, i'll design the back and upload it without the QR and such
(when printed, its the size of a cdn/us bill)
Edit: working on the back side. I'll post it when it's done.

Not sure about outside canada, but quickbt.com allows you to buy small amounts (currently up to 0.3btc) with online interac. I've used them a few times, and every time have gone from fiat to btc in under 5 minutes.
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:15:58
Jeez... Such anger. It's a joke coin, not meant to be taken seriously. Lighten up and stop taking yourself so seriously....

I just wanted to check back in to say I tested out the site, and everything went perfectly. I emailed them with a question after the sale and I had a reply literally in under 90 seconds.
A+ guys, keep up the good work!

Another vote for cavirtex. They've been great. I use direct withdraw from my bank account for no fees. Also one of the cheapest places to buy BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:12:10
Theoretically speaking, if i started wallet on my desktop using bitcoin-qt, could it's private key be accidentally guessed during a brainwallet brute force session even though i didn't set it up as a brainwallet? for example, my randomly generated private key just so happened to equal to "luv da mon3y cuz ima gang5ta" and all those words happen to be close enough bastardizations of actual words to be included in a brute force dictionary
(i realize the odds are astronomically against this passphrase being randomly equal to my private key, just trying to better illustrate my question)
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:13:41
Good question... I haven't looked at that specifically. I only have the money in the account that I put in when I opened it. I'll make a transfer and get back with the amount out and in. My assumption is it'll will be just whatever current exchange rates are... 
@_date: 2013-10-07 21:30:43
+1 for quickbt... i've used them a few times for small amounts and have always had a great experience.
