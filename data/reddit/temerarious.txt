To have both, you’d have to spend hundreds on different computers. It makes you choose one. 
Crypto doesn’t have that same barrier. I can easily transfer to an exchange (and it’s only going to get easier as time passes) and buy a little of a lot of different currencies. That means if one starts implementing better projects, people can easily switch. 
Computers are a bad comparison.

I do believe bitcoin will eventually lose out because other coins have much better tech. But not anytime soon. It’s hard to guess which altcoins will emerge. Bitcoin is the name the public knows and is the gateway for new users.

Think about the future of this technology. There are going to be wallets where you can just have an app and switch between currencies no problem. Developers, knowing how easy it is for people to do that, are not going to be as worried about developing a product on a less popular coin because they know if it takes off people can easily access their product. 
With computers, developers aren’t going to waste their time with Linux because they know people aren’t going to switch to a different operating system. The learning curve is too steep. There is no such barrier with coins.

Sure, governments can force people to pay taxes with their currency. That doesn’t mean they have to use it for anything else. When tax season comes, they can convert a little, then not use it again for the rest of the year.

You sound like someone defending Pacific Bell and saying the internet will never work.
