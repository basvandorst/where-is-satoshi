There is an absurdly small chance of two addresses colliding. Like winning the mega millions lottery 5 consecutive times.
It is true that there is a non zero chance though. There is also a non zero chance that your bank will have some glitch that deletes all of your money along with any record of you ever having it. Probably a much greater chance of that happening really.

This analogy makes no sense. Only one person can win an election. The last I heard, we are not holding an election for which currency we use so we can simply use them all. Therefore a fan of cryptos should want the total market cap of all legitimate cryptos to be as high as possible regardless of which coins they are. In fact, it hedges against risk to not rely on a single implementation of the protocol.
It is so transparent that btc exclusionists are just early adopters who want to watch their investment keep going up. They are not looking at it objectively.

Another major problem with a deflationary currency is the reality of debt. We live in a debt based economy. Basic human necessities for normal functioning within society are well out of the reach of the average person to save up for in advance (house, car, college tuition.)
As a result, the average person has a negative net worth due to debt. We are almost all in debt assuming we are under 40, do not come from a wealthy family, or have not managed to acquire a high paying job early in life.
So if we all have *negative* net worth, then inflation is *improving* our worth by *devaluing* our debt all else being equal. Deflation is only helpful for those with a positive net worth, which is a minority of people.
One response I expect to this is "Well, those people should be more frugal and pull themselves up by their bootstraps, I got my engineering degree and bought a shack in the woods, I'm only 27 and debt free, etc." 
Be this as it may, this is not going to happen for the majority of people overall. It's just not. You have to take the average person into consideration when determining the direction of the entire economy, not just a vocal minority of people who happen to have been fortunate and made good financial decisions.
@_date: 2014-11-14 23:56:16
Except I said all else being equal.
Deflation vs inflation is the discussion of the worth of your assets going up and down. 
If you think the fact that you pay interest completely nullifies whether the worth of your debts (or assets) is increasing or decreasing then you have not really thought this through.

Bitcoin cannot be crushed by governments in a technical sense, but in a practical sense it totally can. Bitcoin is dependent on a benevolent state to function well. Bitcoin value is backed only by user confidence and consensus. Confidence would be destroyed if bitcoin were viciously attacked by powerful world governments. If bitcoin were made illegal, and bank accounts dealing in bitcoin were terminated, and exchanges were shut down, then see how many people would still use it as the value plummets.
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:25:43


Those at the bottom don't just have little, they have negative net worth. They have more debt than assets. So yes, the value of their debt going down through inflation would be better for them.
Obviously rampant debt is it's own problem, but inflation is not doing those people any harm.

I am not an expert, but this person who supposedly is says that most ordinary people should not be running a full node and are actually part of the problem unless running one under certain circumstances: 
Besides that, even if it doesn't require RAM it still requires bandwidth. If you have a slow connection and don't run it constantly it can take days to just catch up. Considering it is not even helping the network to run it that way, it makes no sense. 
As far as "more secure" are you implying that lite clients are masterminding some blockchain fork once they get enough users or something? Get real. There are so many more likely points of failure. How can you trust a computer with parts that you didn't hand craft yourself with that mentality?

Well, in fairness this is what the combination of btc+bitpay amounts to from a vendor standpoint as well. They are still dealing in USD and only converting to bitcoin momentarily.

At auction time, they will have to make some sort of definite policy statement if they hope to sell them successfully.
This is exactly wrong. I feel the complete opposite.

Sure it would look bad. When has looking bad been a concern for legislation coming out of US govt?

@_date: 2014-01-12 15:08:17
Well, it's debatable on both counts. Biggest litecoin group is "unknown" which could be mostly individual miners. Largest known pool is 20% which is still too much but way less than ghash.
As far as litecoin not using enough ram to be a "good" implementation of scrypt, could argue that it's good enough. The actual cryptography part is kind of overkill. There are other vulnerabilities of cryptos more pressing than brute force of hash function even if it's not optimal strength.
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:26:11
Of course but that would require consensus. There is also possible scenario that bitcoin specifically becomes compromised in some way (51% attack e.g) which sparks a migration to a different coin. 
No telling what the future will hold. I just think it's naive to think that cryptos being the way of the future automatically means bitcoin will be at the forefront for all time just because it has a head start in the early days.

Not just law; philosophy/literature types love them some obscure Latin phrases. 
In either case, I don't think the literal translation is meant to be helpful. Rather by borrowing a dead language it is a way to use shorthand to condense complex (yet common) concepts down to a short phrase. It is true that it requires *a priori* knowledge of the relationship between the complex meaning and the short hand though. It is not always evident *prima facie.*

The utility of bitcoin is remittance, medium of exhange, and store of value. These things are dependent on liquidity, fungibility, and the ability to exchange between different mediums of value. Government intervention is capable of fundamentally damaging the utility of bitcoin, which is not true of guns and drugs which have different utility (getting you fucked up and shooting things, respectively.)
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:42:14
Well, you could use the same logic for Ghash. There are scenarios where a huge pool acting out of self interest would still attack the network.
They could gear up for a huge 51% attack, sell whatever coins they have, short bitcoin, attack, watch the value go way down, make a ton of money, then go back to mining as before and help bitcoin value build back over time with no loss of investment. As long as they don't utterly destroy bitcoin, their investment in ASICs would still be useful afterwards.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:47:31
Yes, but I don't want it to be a coin toss whether this will happen. I want it to be *every fucking time* or very nearly so.

"It's still early days! It will all be fixed at some point!!"

The bitcoin protocol is not dependent on the bitcoin currency. I really wish they had different names. 
When you buy the currency, you are not buying the protocol. The currency could fail while the protocol lives on in a different form. Even if the bitcoin protocol really is the future tcp/ip of money, it doesn't preclude a scenario where bitcoin currency goes to zero. Just look at all the drama with bloated mining pools.
It could be that a new coin emerges which is the google to bitcoin's prodigy.

Not all altcoins are get rich quick schemes or clones. Some developers are experimenting with new things, such as Nxt being entirely Proof of Stake. Even doge is a great social experiment to see how much impact can be made simply by marketing and branding a clone. You consider any developer time spent away from btc "wasted" which is completely unfounded. Someday btc may end up forking over to some change in the protocol based on successful experiments in the alts. Sure there are schemes as well, but that comes with the territory of free market competition.
You are thinking only as an investor, and discrediting the efforts of those who are experimenting. It is true that as an investor, the best way to go is btc. But alts are a part of btc. They are an inevitability of open source protocol. If they bother you that much, then at least realize their existence is an inherent flaw of btc.

The appeal of bitcoin is that it is decentralized and unregulated. Any third party services that make bitcoin more user friendly will negate these properties.

What I'm pointing out is that anyone can start their own new coin based off the bitcoin protocol. There are already a dozen altcoins. Bitcoin is the first and the most popular, but there is no guarantee this is permanent. 
Right now every bitcoin added up equals about 11 billon dollars. For a global currency, this is minuscule. Cryptos could some day have a market cap of 100 trillion dollars or more. There is no particular reason it must be bitcoin except for this 11 billion dollar head start. It could crash and another coin gains popularity. Or dozens of coins coexist. We just can't know yet.

Because it seems archaic by today's standards. That would be like sharing photos by uploading them to a thumb drive and plugging them into a different computer. These days that seems cumbersome and difficult. 
It is weird to explain to someone how bitcoin is this futuristic thing that requires you to revert to older methods of transferring data. We are just used to cloud and online transfer methods. Explaining how it's not safe to do that makes people think bitcoins are inherently unsafe.
It just seems like widespread adoption would be based on trusting a third party online service. Which is somewhat ironic since it nullifies a lot of the original appeal of bitcoin in the first place.

I am pretty new to this, and I'm a bit nervous. I bought some coins at a good price last month, then put them in a multibit wallet on my normal computer.
 I got scared about security, so I attempted cold storage. I clean installed Ubuntu on an offline computer, installed armory from a thumb drive, made a wallet, copied a receiving address for the wallet and from my online computer sent my coins to that address.
This is correct, yes? I am nervous because I have no way to check the balance until I download the full block chain so armory can make a watch only wallet. It is taking days! It is not even half way done. It is agony. I just want to know if I've just thrown my magic internet numbers in the garbage accidentally. I wish armory had a lightweight option so I can just check the fucking balance!
Can anyone reassure that I've done this correctly?
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:08:48
Just to play devil's advocate a bit:
What about security for the buyer? If the guy offered to accept bitcoin payments, there is no way he could get ripped off, but then the buyer would be assuming all of the risk by sending an irreversible payment directly to a merchant (assuming they didn't go through a third party). 
If they do go through a third party, they are back to where they started as far as risk goes (since that third party could rip them off).
It seems like the problem here was going through a shitty third party service rather than the choice of currency.
I am a proponent of bitcoin, but in this scenario I don't see how it could inherently add security over fiat. It could only transfer the risk from seller to buyer.
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:24:10
Cold storage puts your money out of your own reach. If you want to spend it, you would have to be near your offline computer to sign a tx. Setting up an offline only Linux computer is a pain in the ass for most people. 
Online wallets place trust in a third party just like the current banking system. There are possible delays of an hour or so broadcasting your tx depending on the wallet, which means you give up and just pay with your bank card instead and try to get a refund later when the tx actually goes through. Also a huge pain in the ass.
The real utility of bitcoin currently is darknet and remittance, not currency.

Suppose I bought 10 BTC at $100 each. Now suppose the value goes to $1000, and at that moment I use $100 worth of BTC to buy something. Now suppose that the value drops back down to $500 the following day.
Am I on the hook for tax liability on all 10 BTC at the $1000 price since that is when I spent a small amount (even after the value has dropped)? Or am I only on the hook for the money I actually spent at that price?
I heard a story of a guy getting screwed this way with stocks where he had to pay capital gains tax on the whole amount even though the value dropped later. Not sure if something similar could apply to BTC.

I don't know what your point is. It seems you are having trouble understanding something quite basic.
If the value if your money is going up (deflation) you are incentivized to hold it and spend as little as possible and not borrow (since the value of your debt would rise)
If the value of your money is going down (inflation) you are incentivized to spend as well borrow.

I understand what you are saying, but my point is that imitation gems and metal would work just as well. If a craftsman applies his skill to setting a fake diamond, the end result should cost the same as a real diamond by your argument. The fact that real jewelry costs many orders of magnitude more than fake jewelry is accounted for only by store of value.
In the case of real industrial use, the physical property of the gold serves a purpose. For jewelry, the purpose is to look pretty, which can be achieved with imitations. The fact that people knowingly buy gold jewelry when imitations are available are a testament to store of value mentality.
Jewelry is just a nice setting for store of value.

@_date: 2013-12-25 01:18:11
It's because most people are in debt. If you have a negative net worth, you would rather the value of your debt to be going down (inflation) rather than up (deflation). If you have savings rather than debt, you would want it the other way around. So inflation encourages spending and borrowing but punishes saving.
To illustrate, imagine if you borrowed 10 btc for 600 each. A month later you pay back the 10 btc but they now cost 650 each. That is an example of how deflation discourages lending. In our society, many people must borrow for a house, car, or education.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:20:31
Well, it depends why a population's buying power has increased actually.
If the reason a population's buying power has increased is the rising value of their currency (deflation) as is the case with bitcoin then they are encouraged to hoard, not spend.
If the value of a currency remains relatively stable (in the short term at least) and a population's buying power increases because they have made more money somehow (tax rebate, for example) then they are encouraged to spend more.

@_date: 2013-12-31 12:36:21
Yes but this is not the discussion. Bitcoin the currency has no intrinsic value, because it has no unique utility. This is what op has meant to start a discussion on. 
Your response is basically to say "but bitcoins have non-intrinsic value, so it doesn't matter." This may well be true, but it doesn't mean bitcoin has intrinsic monetary value. Usd doesn't have intrinsic value either. Gold does however, since it is scarce, yet useful for industrial purposes aside from its store of value.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:59:42
Well, cryptocurrencies are in their infancy, so time will tell whether the ten minute target that bitcoin has chosen or the 2.5 minute target that litecoin has chosen is a better trade off in practice as they scale up.
I wouldn't call the mining difficulty arbitrary, it's just that the different protocols are targeting different balances between high security and fast transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:06:34
You would hope that pool operators would cull an oversized pool, but there is no guarantee in place. There is no central authority to stop them. 
Maybe they plan to launch one big attack and then cash out before it all falls apart. Maybe they will put everything into litecoin and try to destroy bitcoin to raise its value. Maybe there is some other scenario no one has thought of that would be beneficial to them to destroy bitcoin.
The point is that just trusting random strangers to do the right thing is not what bitcoin is about. There needs to be other solutions.

@_date: 2013-11-20 17:03:06
There is a bottleneck of demand right now fueled by speculation and a sudden increase in volume.
As for signing up and getting verified, that is a bit of a process but it is necessary because you are asking someone to send you an irreversible payment over the internet. Once you are verified, it is fast and easy to buy and sell coins. A market will emerge which makes the verification process quick and easy, but for now there are growing pains as small companies scramble to meet a huge increase in demand.

As a newcomer I have to say it is nice to get reassurances from actual people in a community you trust. 
It seems daunting to send lots of money through international wire transfer to Slovenia and just sort of trust that they will give you some magic numbers after a few days in return. They could just never get back to you and you'd be fucked. 
Also, I keep reading about crazy security problems. Apparently I have to sacrifice a virgin computer to the gods and learn how to generate my own encrypted paper wallet key, since hackers are apparently key logging my every move.
I wish that I could just buy the goddamn coins already without having to meet up with some random dude in public and hope he's not giving me fake numbers or something. 
I want to get in on this now but it is very overwhelming for newcomers when it is riddled with scams and security breaches.

Were you working remotely? Was it not possible for them to just pay cash?
I think many people are blinded to the fact that bitcoin essentially requires a third party like bitpay to cover risk between two parties. This functions very much the same way as paypal. Perhaps it was not necessary to escrow in your particular situation if you trusted your clients explicitly, but for e commerce, there is no such trust.
What if a year from now bitpay becomes evil and starts freezing transactions and refusing to release payments for "violation of terms" the same as paypal?
I wish there were a true peer to peer solution that did not require unreasonable level of trust in the seller.

Saying jewelry is a thriving market because people are buying it is exactly the same as saying bitcoin is a thriving market because people are buying it.
You are attempting a little three card monte here, possibly unintentionally by claiming precious metal has some utility simply based on buyer confidence that it is worth something. Bitcoin has that same "utility!"
My point stands: the *utility* of precious metal for jewelry over non precious imitations is based on nothing other than store of value. You do not get to file it under industrial uses. It us not the same as true industrial use, which is 12%.

There should definitely be some information that helps people stay safe from themselves, i.e., not locking themselves out of their newly encrypted files.
A lot of tutorials I have seen take for granted that people are already familiar with password managers, truecrypt containers, generating strong passwords and so forth.

I understand this argument, but I have become disillusioned with it lately. I just don't think this is something that can be forced in this way. It's not the way things go viral. Bitcoin as an exchange medium needs to get its own momentum based on its own utility. 
Going out of your way to use bitcoin regardless of fees to encourage adoption is like asking friends and family to watch your YouTube video over and over hoping it gets to ten million views. You cannot force millions of people to take interest in something if it's just not happening naturally.
So far, bitcoin has gone viral as a speculative asset. The crazy volatility has made a lot of people money and attracted a lot of attention. Adoption by speculators has gone through the roof. As a medium of exchange, it is just not that exciting currently except under very specific circumstances (sending money to family overseas, e.g.).
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:33:05


I'm not sure I understand. Escrow is inherently third party. Why would the seller send you something you have not paid for? Besides, it sounds like a sort of pyrrhic victory to end up with the money lost forever. If that is possible, no one would buy expensive items with it.


If the systems were equal, then the advantage the current system would have is incumbency. There needs to be a better reason for people to switch to bitcoin than the fact that it's not better or worse than their current system. 
Where is the advantage? I would very much invite having my argument demolished. I would love to see how I'm looking at it all wrong, but no one seems to have anything to say about it the four of five times I've brought it up.

Since you had "guessed" that I had an axe to grind, it seemed like a pretty safe "guess" what your world view is.
So you think bitcoin long term success can be fueled by the unbanked and marginalized with little participation by the ego centric privileged class such as myself? This is an interesting idea, and one I have not really considered. It may very well be that billions of poor people can wield more financial influence than hundreds of millions of well off people. I do wonder how they have smartphones though.
@_date: 2013-12-31 12:45:07
To say bitcoin has first mover advantage and better infrastructure is an entirely different argument than the one op presented. 
To say bitcoin protocol has inherent value is to admit that altcoins do too, since they are copies of that protocol. To call altcoins worthless is to admit that bitcoin has no intrinsic value either, once all the user base is taken away.
So we conclude that bitcoin (and altcoins) do not have intrinsic value, but rather value that is dependent on user confidence. This is not the end of the world, but it makes no sense for people to continue to press on that bitcoin has inherent value when it does not.
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:44:23


Basically your solution is for deflation to absorb the increased fees. But the deflation will theoretically even out as the user base increases making the price more stable short term. Meaning the increase of the fees will be real, and we could potentially be back to paying what cc companies or paypal charge currently.
People constantly brush over the increased fee issue when discussing bitcoin because the price has been rapidly increasing. "Charge me whatever you want! Who gives a shit? My bitcoins increased 300% in a few months!" What about when this cools off and the price moves sideways (as it needs to for long term stability)? Suddenly the fees will seem quite high.

Exactly. The problem was solved when inflation was built into currency. We cannot borrow deflationary assets, our economy is based largely on lending, therefore a deflationary currency like bitcoin can never become dominant.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:51:01
Well, it could still function as a store of value. It cannot be forged, hacked, or seized by anyone, even the government, despite having a transparent public record. That seems like pretty valuable utility. It could be the savings account of the future, if not the currency. 
Isn't the primary problem of deflation the rising value of debt? If it's not used for debt but rather savings, what's the matter with "deflation?"
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:03:58
The other side of that is going to be higher btc fees. The fees seem negligible now, but the fees need to come up to encourage miners once actual mining becomes too unprofitable. 
Also, the fees do not scale to the purchase so micropayment will actually have pretty substantial fees relatively. Then you have to consider the third party fees of whatever escrow company rises to the top of that industry.
Once those fees raise and the cc ones come down, there may be no real advantage to btc on that particular front.
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:11:48
The truth is you demonstrably can separate the protocol from the currency, as all the altcoins have done. Whether you can convince people to mine is a separate issue.

Getting involved with bitcoin currently requires you to take steps that we have been trained to see as red flags.
Wire money to a stranger in Slovenia? Give a site I've never heard of my online banking login info? Upload photo of my passport, cc numbers, and my address? I might as well send money to a Nigerian price! What an obvious scam!
The thing is, there is no other way currently because bitcoin is an irreversible form of payment. So any person sending them to you needs what is generally considered an unreasonable amount of personal info from you.
Meeting a stranger with cash is actually the least invasive method by far.

The miners. 
Part of the process of mining new coins involves confirming transactions in new blocks. This is part of the brilliance of the system. This way, accountability is spread out across an entire network rather than entrusted to a central authority (sort of similar to wiki in that way).
Supposedly, over time as coins become more scarce and mining becomes less and less lucrative (in terms of actually mining new coins) fees will need to increase to incentivize miners to continue operating.

Well, how exactly would they have made money by now if they had had a way to invest in TCP/IP? To me, that analogy teaches a different lesson; don't look to the protocol itself as an investment opportunity, but to the private corporations who build on it. 
Someone looking at it from an investment standpoint would have done better to buy apple stock than TCP/IP (if that were even possible.)
So your analogy really begs the question, who's that going to be for bitcoin?

Here is the thing though. Expanding on the bitcoin ethos of "being your own bank," would it not make sense for users to deliberately spend incrementally over time in a way that sort of mimics planned inflation of traditional currency, thus reducing the chance of entering a deflationary spiral?

That is why cc companies have consumer protection. If someone tries to steal your cc number, you get the money back. It works pretty well because if it didn't, people would never use their companies and they couldn't make tons of money in interest and fees.
If you pay with bitcoin and the merchant decides to rip you off, then there is nothing you can do. It is essentially the same as sending cash in the mail.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:36:04
2% is reasonable for the service. I don't mean to say that it's an overcharge. I get that it is basically replacing the fee the merchant would otherwise pay and reducing it some.
I just wonder if that will impede adoption of bitcoin when people hear they basically have to pay the fee now instead of the merchant.

Well, as you say, what you are really paying a cc company for is risk management. With bitcoin, you do not pay for that and instead the risk gets transferred entirely to the consumer (at no risk to the merchant).
You may say "well, you are only able to be ripped off the amount that you send a merchant." But what if you are buying a laptop or some other expensive item? Are you willing to assume the risk of losing $1000+ in order to avoid those fees?
To simplify the argument for those not versed in bitcoin: If you had a way to magically pay in cash over the internet, would you prefer to do it in hopes that A: merchant prices would fall since they no longer have to pay exorbitant fees and B: you can only be ripped off the amount you are sending, and no more?
I suspect most people's answer would be "meh, probably not." 
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:27:06
Currently the liquidity crisis is pointed the other direction. There are too many buyers and not enough sellers.
Some theorize that this creates artificial scarcity (since more people would sell if the price leveled out) which creates a positive feedback loop where the false scarcity drives prices up more and the rising prices cause less people to sell, causing more scarcity, etc.
If this is true, and we are in a deflationary spiral of sorts, then we're most likely in for a big fall back to around $350 or so once it becomes apparent that we're all sort of bluffing and raising each other and everyone rushes to sell.
However, it's yet to be seen if that's true, or if there has just been a huge genuine increase in real value over three weeks. That's the fun of it, no one knows.

How is sending someone an irreversible payment with no conflict resolution a safer alternative than a cc for a merchant you do not trust?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:51:39
The reason not to do that is if you wait too long and it goes into free fall, you will not be able to get rid of it. There will be a bottleneck of sellers and no buyers (sort of the opposite of what happened today with coinbase running out of coins) and you will get stuck riding it all the way to the bottom.
Also, you gotta sleep sometime. Bitcoin doesn't close like the stock exchange and a big sell off could happen while you're not looking.

What I see happening now is lots of bitcoin investors/advocates who are aware that the price is fueled by a speculative bubble are trying to sort of bootstrap an actual movement of bitcoin utility as an exchange medium, hoping that is enough to cover the spread. It is hopeless. You cannot will it into happening (clueless.jpg).
Regular people will use bitcoin as a medium of exchange organically if it becomes appealing to them for that purpose on its own merit. Not because speculators really, really want them to.
I hope it does by the way, but let's all stay realistic about it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:35:40
I hope you are right. 
Say someone bought two hundred coins at $10, then sees the price go to $1000. If I were one of those lucky ones, I would probably sell half at this point just to keep myself from descending into obsessive paranoia over a possible crash or security breach. Then I would rest easy and hope the other half keeps going up.
I think it is good for bitcoin overall if a healthy amount of FUD should act as a sort of pressure release for huge bubbles to make them more stable and increase liquidity.
Just look at a 2 year chart. It is terrifying. There needs to be some more time at this level than a few weeks to validate this huge shift in confidence.
I would not be super surprised to see in the news any day now some market manipulation tactic revealed at a major exchange or something of that sort.

Burning electricity is a byproduct of proof of work which contributes to the security of bitcoin. This security is necessary for bitcoin to function as a store of value, since it is the foundation of consumer confidence.

Speculation. 
Most people first heard about bitcoin a year or so ago and wrote it off as some sort of scam without further investigation. 
In recent months, there have been a ton of blog/news stories about people who bought $30 worth of bitcoin who are now millionaires. The takeaway message from these stories is that bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme that actually works. It's like an actual Nigerian prince contacting you. It's a dream come true!
Everyone wants a piece now, but is worried they are too late. But the price keeps going up, so they think "Maybe it's not too late yet!"
You always see posts like this from recent converts: "How can I get some btc in my country?? I can't get verified quickly enough! Please, the price is going up as we speak!"
This is what is fueling it. Anyone who tells you it's the senate hearings or normal adoption based on utility as an exchange medium has got their head in the sand.
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:52:38
You are correct in your argument, but we are getting mixed up about the term "value."

There is no point I am trying to make. I am trying to ascertain bitcoin's true level of utility as a currency.
If bitcoin does not provide any significant utility over fiat for ordinary people, then that is a real problem because it strongly suggests we are in a purely speculative bubble as many suspect.
Imagine if the way you are using bitcoin were translated to fiat: 
It basically amounts to is an irreversible, instant, pseudonymous wire transfer that costs around 10 cents per transaction. Third party services can be built on it with less overhead (and therefore less fees) than cc companies. People have the option of trusting the vendor and dealing directly if they choose, but they have no recourse for conflict resolution.
Is this a service people would sign up for? Would the interest generated by it warrant a 10 fold increase in value over a short time?
These are important questions to me because I am trying to decide whether to invest more or brace for a crash. I don't want to be blinded by the hype. I have made good money at this point, but this does not mean it goes on forever.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:22:47
This is great for people who already have bitcoin and know all about how to store it securely, but for newcomers, your post could double as a list of things they are likely to encounter on the exchanges:
Waiting 3-5 days for payment to go through...having to provide tons of personal info...account getting frozen for no reason... Sound familiar to anyone?
Once they've actually got the coins, there is the malware/hacker issue. It is a total pain in the ass to deal with cold storage and signing transactions offline.
Honestly, if this shit wasn't doubling in price every month or so, I can see no reason why any of this would be worth it unless there are big changes to the infrastructure. Which reminds me, what about when the price cuts in half in a day or so? Who would want to expose themselves to that risk?
Even with a 4000% yearly gain you can hardly convince anyone to jump through these hurdles. If the price actually stagnates or drops, I imagine consumer adoption will go way down.

I don't know if you are being willfully ignorant, or just not getting it still.
Let's try an analogy:
The statement I have made is like saying "The wind is blowing from the East." It is an irrefutable fact.
The counter argument you've made is to make assumptions about what it means for the wind to blow from the East, and then counter those assumptions you have made. 
For example, your reply is like saying "People can still walk to the East. It is absurd to say that people cannot walk against the wind!"
I have never said people cannot walk against the wind. This is called a strawman argument, when you take something the other person never even said and then argue against that.
I am simply pointing out what the market forces are! How people respond to those forces are a separate argument, and I have taken no position on that.

I think a single person in good health in their 40s with no debt and no kids who is used to living off about $40K/year (after taxes, not accounting for savings) could reasonably retire comfortably and securely off about 2m USD, so by current price, right around 2000 BTC. Less than that if the price keeps going up, of course.

What if I want to mix and match armory and electrum?
I am new at this and I am trying to get set up with a dedicated offline computer. I did a clean install of ubuntu on an old pc with networking/wireless disabled, and installed offline armory on it. (I am not messing with system encryption for now, because I am scared I will fuck it up and I'm not worried about someone gaining physical possession of my computer).
I could not figure out how to get electrum to install on my offline ubuntu machine because I know nothing about linux and all I see is gibberish when I try to get any info on it. Armory works just fine though.
The problem is, on my online machine (mac running mavericks) it is just the opposite. I can use electrum fine, but I simply cannot download the blockchain through bitcoin qt to get online armory working. I know it is supposed to be slow to download, but after a day the little blue progress bar has sat in exactly the same place.
So, does anyone have suggestions on how to do cold storage with offline armory and online electrum?
Thanks for any info. This is a frustrating process for those of us with limited computer literacy, but I'm willing to go through it to reap the rewards of relatively early adoption. Once there are gadgets and programs that streamline this process for the masses, I believe the price will be triple what it is now.

I am new to bitcoin and at this point, I still find it terrifying to move money around. 
What if I do it wrong? What if the QR code scanned incorrectly? What if some setting I am unaware of messes things up? 
It is so nerve wracking to hit that button sending a considerable percentage of my current net worth from one place to another knowing that there will be no phone number to call and no recourse if I make a mistake. It will just simply vanish.
I know that over time I will gain confidence, the same way I have confidence in my online fiat banking now. I just need time to be comfortable with it. It is scary! At least with gold you can hold it in your hand. With bitcoin, I keep thinking some hacker will come along and drain it out of my wallet when I'm not looking. It is a psychological hurdle people will need to overcome before wanting to put their life savings into it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:23:16
Right, but this doesn't address the issue. 
Every sale has a buyer and a seller. If transactions are inherently risky for buyers, with zero risk for sellers, then every transaction not made in person requires a third party service.
It is not enough to say "use an escrow service for transactions that require trust (buyer) and don't bother for transactions that require no trust (seller)" because someone is always the buyer.
This would limit the utility of bitcoin as a currency to transactions made in person (which provides no advantage over cash) or using a third party service (which potentially has same problems as existing systems, e.g. PayPal).
Bitcoin would still have utility as a store of value, or non sale based transactions (sending money to a relative overseas, e.g.)
But as a currency, I see this issue brushed over with no meaningful counter argument.

Ok, but let's say I don't have a friend in France. Let's say I need to buy some goddamn groceries down the street. In that situation, which is more convenient and useful? BTC or fiat?
Aside from quick international transfers, what is the real objective value of bitcoin as currency currently? This is what concerns me. Its value is speculative. 
The cost is going through the roof and everyone is happy about that. But people are buying it to make money off it, not to spend it. It is actually a pain in the ass aside from its speculative value. It took me days to figure out how to really work it and I had to place an enormous amount of trust in coinbase by giving them my bank log in details to validate quickly. The exchanges are full of scams and security breaches. 
I am worried it will not really catch on and the bubble will pop. I hope not though. I hope it goes mainstream but there needs to be changes to make it easier for ordinary people to use.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:38:32
Conversely, imagine if the barrier to entry keeps it from breaking through to the mainstream at all.
What concerns me for the long run is that bitcoin is cumbersome for small, everyday purchases. You have to wait 5-10 minutes for confirmation, and transaction fees are relatively high the smaller the purchase is.
If the bitcoin economy becomes practical only for overseas and large purchases, how will it really become the currency of the future? Under those circumstances, it would rather seem to become the savings account of the future. Which is still good I guess.

I think that online/cloud services have become so ingrained in our psyche that hardware wallets seem like some clunky weird technology from the past to most people. I think that the future of bitcoin will eventually just be a better, safer online wallet service. Cold storage methods will only be useful for the minority of people left over from early days who have a lot of coin to sit on.

2% Jesus that's a lot. You paid them *$60 to process this transaction? 
This is an obstacle to mainstream adoption. Early adopters will pay any fee because they've made so much already. But for any newcomer who already has to pay coinbase 1% to get the coins, then another 2% to just turn it back into fiat, it just makes no sense.

I don't know, it's almost like I was in a discussion about the price of bitcoin. Maybe you should ask this guy why he is so focused on the price:


what better way to save before you need to spend?
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:42:34
I agree with you in general, but to play devil's advocate gas stations offer substantially lower rates to pay in cash. I've also had small businesses such as mechanics agree to a cash discount. When making a large purchase, such as a car, you can often haggle a much better cash price.
Edit: I just realized all three examples were car based for some reason. This was not intentional.

This is not sustainable indefinitely. This is you cashing in on a liquidity crisis, which is caused by massive short term price increases. It is great for now but not an indication of a long term functional system.
People come out ahead even after paying fees because of the massively spiking price. If the price were to stabilize, then the fees would suddenly seem quite high.

But then we are back where we started! Trusting a third party. What if your escrow service decides arbitrarily that you have "violated their terms" and unilaterally decide to hold on to your money for months on end a la paypal?
I see this circular argument over and over:
"Bitcoin doesn't require a third party the way traditional currency does! It's totally risk free for merchants!"
"What about the risk for the buyer?"
"Oh, just use a third party."

If bitcoin were to achieve its "full potential" it would likely not be very linear. I don't think it will be like the Clampetts striking oil and one day all these internet nerds who bought 3 bitcoin are hundred millionaires living in mansions. 
I think it is more likely to be a long hard road with major sell offs and crashes based on unforeseen policies and developments which will tend to redistribute much of the wealth back into the hands of the usual suspects (bankers, governments, etc.)
Already the US government has a great head start with their Silk Road bust, and that's before even pursuing bitcoin aggressively.

@_date: 2013-12-16 04:17:43
This is not how it works, or how it is supposed to work. The price is supposed to stabilize as the volume goes up, not only after all coins are issued. Not to say it would remain completely constant, as no currency does, but much more so than today. If the price were to stay as volatile as it is now for a hundred years, it would be laughably ineffective as a currency and we should all give up now.
Relying on short term price fluctuations to cover the costs of high fees is absurd to suggest as an acceptable long term solution.

"It doesn’t matter if Bitcoin crashes, it doesn’t matter if Bitcoin 'fails.'"

Thank you for the condescending assumption that I find the metric system "difficult."
I am merely pointing out that too many syllables leads to widespread adoption of a slang alternative.
Also, the fact that a thousandth of a bitcoin is roughly equal to a unit of currency that many people are already accustomed to characterizes it as extremely deflationary: "Check it out! Look what I got for .0000001!"

Even if you have a small amount to save and you are not willing to invest in something high risk (which bitcoin admittedly is for now) then you could at least look into a ROTH IRA. Compound interest can be your friend.

I keep almost everything in cold storage, and moving offline signatures around is a pain in the ass. There have been so many threads about how dangerous it is to leave money on exchanges and in live wallets, you can hardly blame those of us who don't want to randomly lose money to hackers or exchange errors.
Besides that, I think it is silly to try to force the use of bitcoin as a currency if it's just not working organically. There need to be big changes to entice people.
It reminds me of the huge expectations some investors had for Sirius, and the disappointment that it never really caught on because people just don't really want it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:09:02
That sucks because it seems to exacerbate the problem of panic. If the price starts to drop dramatically, many people's first thought will be "sell now before coinbase runs out of buyers and I get stuck with them!"

It's called tragedy of the commons. The individual miners, acting rationally in self interest (they get better returns from mining there than elsewhere) act in detriment to the whole group.

Hyper inflation is bad. Any form of deflation is bad. If it were possible to keep the price exactly even, that would be ideal. Since it is not, the next best thing is to keep slight inflation in order to prevent deflation. This is reality.
I am amazed that I have to explain it, but the value of money does not just fall from the sky in deflation. In an exchange economy, there will be a loser for every winner with the changing value of currency. The net result is to decrease liquidity by discouraging spending/borrowing, not to just give free money from heaven to everyone.

I guess disagreeing with your world view equals "having an axe to grind." 
The point is that bitcoin has no real utility for ordinary people under most circumstances, so the prospect of mainstream adoption is slim unless there are changes made.
Since the future success of bitcoin largely depends on mainstream adoption happening, I am surprised that bitcoin proponents don't give the shortcomings more thought.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:39:52
True, I'm still using my coinbase app with no problems.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:07:55
This is exactly the kind of response that worries me. 
People want to see bitcoin succeed, so they are willing to pay a fee. Whether an early investor is willing to pay a fee is not the point. The point is that transferring a fee from merchant to consumer disincentives consumer adoption. It is a sort of three card monte game of moving money around to pretend we are creating a bitcoin economy that will jump start to the mainstream somehow if only no one notices it's a worse deal for the consumer.
You counter "well, maybe the merchants will offer a discount." If they do, they are essentially just taking the liability of the fee back that they had in the first place.
It is just religious fanaticism. There is no utility to this. I would love to see bitcoin succeed by simply being better than fiat. Not through these sort of forced attempts to bootstrap it.

You are grasping at straws. Bitcoin is an open source protocol that can be copied quite easily. Basically your only argument is to say that bitcoin is more popular than any other coin, which is not a refutation of anything I've said or relevant to the discussion of intrinsic value.

I am pretty new myself, so I've just gone through this process.
If you are US based, coinbase is the best way to get coins online currently. Alternatively, you could try to meet with someone in person, but I had no interest in that.
Coinbase supports 2 step authentication (meaning you have to enter a password as well as enter some numbers that are sent to your phone) which makes them more secure than an online wallet without that, but still far less secure than offline cold storage methods.
You will need to give coinbase pretty much everything there is to know about you if you want quick verification (online banking log in info, cc number, real identity, etc) which feels very invasive but they have a lot on the line on their end and they are not a scam site.
I'm pretty sure coinbase only accepts cc as a backup payment method, so you will need to link a bank account with them which they will draw out of directly.
After your first purchase on coinbase, they will not let you buy more until it clears on their end, which takes up to a week. So don't start with .01 as a test unless you are ok being unable to buy more for a week.
So buy with coinbase, then move it offline to more secure wallets as it accumulates.

I'm aware of multi sig transactions, and I think it is intriguing. I think it is not super well suited to currency transactions though. The problem is that if there is an unresolved dispute for a two party multi sig transaction, the coins are lost and stay in limbo forever. There is no guarantee they would be returned to you. It requires a third party for true conflict resolution, and then we are back where we started with the current system of relying on third parties.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:41:15

You keep trying to equate the deflationary aspect of bitcoin to its volatility. This is simply not true, they are two different things. If someone sneezes on mt gox it can add or subtract 5% to the price. The market is tightly would up by speculators with their finger on the button all watching each other. This is not normal expansion following the "asymptotic issuance curve." This is a volcanic eruption that needs time to cool off to become solid rock.
The idea is that it will in a year or two. Not a hundred. It's not following the issuance. It's following every little bit of new information about the markets, and it could still go either way.
As far as the cabal fed, etc, it's actually true that deflation is bad for an economy and anyone who says different is ignoring the reality of lending. Bitcoin can still exist alongside fiat economies though. Either way, that is a totally different discussion.

Exactly. The value of bitcoin is that it is popular. Altcoins languish because they are not popular. This supports my argument. If everyone were to migrate to an altcoin instead for some reason, then that would be valuable and bitcoin would not. 
This all supports the claim that there is no intrinsic value, only value based on consensus. This is the original point.

Right, but production of jewelry is sort of a store of value as well. The only reason people use precious metals and gems vs imitation is the confidence that it will hold its value. If you simply wanted a shiny yellow metal ring and care nothing for its store of value, you would be a fool to choose real gold over a nearly identical imitation.
So that leaves us with the industrial use as it's only real utility. Which you say is 12 percent. 
If bitcoin's only real utility besides store of value is currency, then 6 percent actually ain't bad at this point. Could easily get to 12 as more people adopt it.
