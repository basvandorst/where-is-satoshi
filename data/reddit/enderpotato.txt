Thank you so much for the praise. At Hodlbot, we take our analytical pieces very seriously and would never release an article we dont completely stand by.

Pretty much as expected but damn, a lot of analysis was put into it. Well done.

This graph plots the distribution of correlation coefficients between each individual coin the entire cryptocurrency market across 2018-2019.
**Why I made this?**
The cryptocurrency market is known to be extremely inter-correlated. In 2018, correlations between cryptocurrencies and the total cryptocurrency market were especially high. 75% of the top 200 coins by market cap had a correlation of 0.87 or higher.
Super high correlation is bad. It makes it harder to mitigate risk by diversifying and it implies that market cannot differentiate between good &amp; bad projects.
2018 was considered a bear market and it was not surprising to see that correlations so were high since the prices of all cryptocurrencies tumbled altogether.
But since then, the market has changed. So far 2019 has primarily been a sideways market.
**So what's changed?**
In 2019, correlations between individual coins and the market dropped when compared to the previous year. A one-tailed Welch's t-test confirms that in 2019, cryptocurrencies have a lower mean correlation.
