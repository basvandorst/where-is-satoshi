How dare you group drug dealers with terrorists an paedophiles. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:45:56
Hah! As if they have a PR team!
Edit: That would also mean I had a job. Now I has a sad. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:46:46
good job!
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:52:57
Yeah, there are a few, but i was wondering if Mt.Gox was the best in your opinion?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:15:56
Interesting, a glitch perhaps?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:25:04
You know what, fuck all the haters, I think you guys are doing a top job. 
Just wired $1000 AUD to you today in fact :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:27:42
Can you imagine the crazy pressure their verification team is under? 
I think Gox is doing a swell job with what they had to work with.
Yes they have terrible PR, but they have experienced such sudden growth that they hadn't the resources to keep on top of it all. I think they'll grow and develop much now, and in the near future. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:02:26
Hmmm, hopfully things cool down a bit, but I'm in it for the long haul, so I'm not terribly fussed :)
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:40:41
Oh my god
This is either very close to the end, or only just the beginning. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:50:45
I think it might crash, then increase steadily as it becomes more accepted and taken seriously.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:41:58
how much money did YOU lose in the crash? haha!
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:51:24
Yeah! Good to have someone on my side!
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:42:46
Could anyone have anticipated what has happened? Also it's a 1 month process to upgrade servers
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:10:19
Aw! Thanks :D
You've made my night! 
Best of luck to you in your endeavours with BTC and life in general. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:46:37
You're right, we don't have many options, but at least we have SOME, and at least Mt Gox accepts AUD. Most currencies don't have tradability on exchanges
 
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:55:18
So I should buy 10K of bitcoin now... or...?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:21:35
That's not very nice.
What makes them so incompetent? And in a volatile market such as this, of course people lost fortunes, and other gained. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:09:41
They're in japan. Not that cheap and not that easy. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:05:02
Yeah, take your business elswhere if you don't like it. Vote with your feet,
because that's the only way for action to occur. 
Just like EA games and all the derps who complain about them over at ahah
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:28:51
Yeah, I've only been looking at it for fun, but it looks like BTC has a promising future.
Any suggestions for a newbie?
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:37:27
Cheers, broseph.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:24:44
I hope it goes from this bubble stage and climb steadily and strongly
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:11:04
Awesome :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:25:48
Yes, what app?
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:01:28
Shit's gon be cray
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:30:53
How do you feel about it hitting $140?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:06:39
No, seriously. It's in the public eye now. More and more will start to accept it as payments, and the market will stabilise.
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:44:45
Thanks! How should I go about trading my money (AUD) for BTC, most conveniently? Stick to Mt.Gox and do a bank transfer/money order? Or are there better ways?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:23:59
indeed
