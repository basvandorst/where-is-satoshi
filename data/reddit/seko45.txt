It's far better to do random (very rare) "pop quizzes" in the middle of sessions, for suspected accounts only, otherwise the botter knows exactly what to expect and can easily test against it. Even with pop quizzes though, if you can decompile and see exactly how they work, deathbycaptcha.com solves that problem.

Affecting the market would be a good thing for someone paying the extortion (see my other posts in this thread).

You would not actually spend $1m USD though, because you only need $1m USD in BTC. Your purchase would increase the value of coins you obtained at lower prices.

I'm not sure you get it? No matter how random and unique the captcha is, that service (and many others) have "professional" captcha solving humans 24/7 that are just an api call away.

To be pedantic, a payer of the "$1m USD in BTC" extortion would want to increase the BTC/USD exchange rate as much as they possibly could. 
The more the price increases, the less USD they pay.

A poker client in flash is never fine

You can "like the idea of bots", but hate the idea of the microstakes section of a site overrun by shortstacking push/fold ratholers. That ai consists of nothing but if/thens and can easily win vs. soft fields. When the micros are decimated, there's no one moving up, which is bad for you.

Flash is pretty much completely unable to detect bots.
Combined with the anonymous nature of the funding and signup process, it would be a botter's dream come true if they ever got popular.

This doesn't work. See my above answer and deathbycaptcha.com.

IIRC MagicalTux of Mtgox provides/donates hosting to bitcointalk.org, probably in the same datacenter, not the same server.
@_date: 2012-08-25 15:47:37
Good point, you got me there. You could alert on the eval at least, but you'd need to have a human on hand to click and solve whatever randomness appears.

With a trusted mtgox account the max withdraw is 500k usd/month. Assuming he can't make a special cashout arrangement with mtgox it would be really sloppy to dump all at once.

LOL at the downvotes. Ask any poker pro if they want a poker site infested with bots, the answer will be NO. Ask any fish if they want to be playing against 8 nitfest bots, NO. Bots can crush HU HE and play profitably at ring HE, shortstack NLHE and some forms of SNG. They can also be made to gain huge advantages by colluding. Even if YOU can beat a bot, they are able to win against the field, 24 hours a day, which kills the games.
"win &gt; bet:win ratio." oh, lol, you have no idea what you're talking about.

Of course the server sends the request. The client still needs to have an "On Captcha Request" event somewhere in the code that displays the captcha image, textbox, and button.

All the coins you acquired would be for equal or less than your final purchase price, but the rate if you immediately paid the ransom would be your final purchase price.
It's just a technicality, but you would need less than $1m, probably even after fees, to pay the ransom. Waiting for a shallow ask depth where your "last" price is as high as possible would (counter-intuitively) be the goal.
@_date: 2012-08-25 15:10:55
Like I said earlier, if you have easy access to the source code (as you do with flash), then you can potentially see exactly what to expect and hook. In the end, the client is going to display something on the screen with a button and textbox.

He posted that the website was back online for USD withdraws and trading could resume later this week.

Earlier today mtgox was down for me (comcast), but reachable through vpn (france), and bitcointalk was up on either connection. 
During that time someone posted on BCT that mtgox was down for them as well, and there were a few replies of "it's not down for me".
Now, neither site is reachable via either connection.
I'm not really sure what that means, just adding the info.

The only techniques I can think of would be mouse movement analysis and captchas. Luckily you can easily decompile flash, so you can potentially see exactly which of those two methods you'd need to worry about.
Compared to the detection methods available to an executable, flash is pretty much an api.
