Its not a premium. Its the price...
@_date: 2014-04-01 10:05:33
psh just 1.337 btc? Someone offered me 720,000 btc. Im rich now right? ...right guys?
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:39:43
Yea let me know when they get to you're wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:58:36
Thats an awesome Christmas tree stand. How much was it?
@_date: 2014-04-01 10:03:25
Uhhh...yea you probably shouldn't have clicked that cuz its not associated with coinbase at all.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:35:32
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:50:04
Just remember....whatever it does, its still going to go up some more.  Just hold on and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:01:35


Yea that was some collapse wasn't it.  I mean bitcoins are like worthless now right? oh wait..
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:54:21
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:56:17
I think its 300 btc for a dollar. I may be wrong though.  Can someone make a post to clarify please?
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:39:52
You're one lucky dude.
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:28:46
  Boom.
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:40:54
Because very soon, if not already, bitcoin will be the most convenient way to purchase anything your heart desires.  Personally I don't think it will replace any currencies, however it will be the easiest way to pay for anything you want online regardless of differing international currencies and 3rd party companies like paypal complicating today's process. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:13:22
This is amazing. I'm in a tech capital in California and I've yet to meet many people who know about it. Cool story!
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:38:24
Why on earth did you buy them when you have no idea what they are? Let alone the fact that you obviously don't know about investing either. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:02:32
If you plan on staying for the long term, now is the time to buy.  I think theres still growth on the way. Ughhhh this makes me miss my .1 btc that I bought for 9 bucks that were just stolen. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:23:07
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:12:36
Whatever you're investing in Bitcoin will be used to fix your car when it falls apart in a few thousand miles.  It baffles me the crazy shit people start doing when the price goes up. Jesus. I hope for your sake you did your homework...
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:26:56
Yea it looks like thats what I'm gonna have to do anyways.  I got a virus on it somewhere in the last few days.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:30:16
I'd say start with the bitcoin-qt client.  It takes up a bit of space but its the most simple and a good place to start.  Not to mention I'm paranoid about any type of online wallet, especially in the wake of the inputs.io fiasco.  You could always change to something else if you don't like bitcoin-qt as well.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:20:15
Did you post anything in the "trollbox"?
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:09:45
They're sitting in cyberspace waiting to be synced to your wallet.  They aren't going anywhere, just wait.
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:29:53
Theres a paypal fee of a couple bucks and they charge i think .01 btc to withdraw your bitcoins to your wallet. Of course i bought with them when it was still 120 bucks so everything worked out.  I don't think it would be too smart to do right now.  You would probably be paying the equivalent of 380-400 bucks per bitcoin.  But Ive never had problems with money disappearing or anything.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:54:44
This might be better suited in @_date: 2013-11-06 10:56:54
If you're still looking, [freebitcoin]( is a nice faucet. I just found it a few days ago. You get 0.00001 every hour, but sometimes more. It pays out once a week..
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:42:24
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:12:54
This question is asked every 5 min on this sub.  If people knew do you think they would be announcing it?
@_date: 2013-11-08 11:13:58
Everything about this seems so so risky...
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:18:26
I copied a link to bitcoincharts.com like a week or two ago...it didn't seem fishy.
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:32:57
I think the days of 50% drops are done for bitcoin.  There will continue to be 40-50 dollar pullbacks every once in a while though. But with the way its going it recovers within a few hours every time.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:03:42
Good God...$2500 bitcoins??? And those are bids? People really have gone full retard.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:15:15
Nope. It doesn't get any better. You can just send those bitcoins my way now that you're done with them. :P
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:24:17
Oh hey look its the 666 joke for like the 4th time today on another exchange.
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:27:11
You sound like the "never going below 200" people of April.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:40:07
I got double dogecoin last night and my btc are now negative as well.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:27:37
Just keep waiting. It may take a while.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:21:40
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:39:24
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:21:41
Played the drop last night and cashed out at 190 this morning. Holding on to my money until I see some signs of movement.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:52:01
I can't take this shit. I'm not gonna sleep
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:06:29
Yea that was a long 6 minute crash though
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:29:35
How? They have both tripled in value in the last month...
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:21:28
Well good on you for making an informed decision. Better than the others on here selling their cars to buy into bitcoin at 900 bucks. Not sure how to close BTC-e accounts though
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:13:10
Its stored in the blockchain until you download it, so it would just show up when your download finished.  I read that theres something like 120 trillion(?) btc addresses. So guessing one is pretty unlikely.
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:37:00
I use btc-e, they're pretty good with fast micro trades, they've got a nice platform they just came out with as well.  Just make sure you're using 2 FA.

Doesn't matter...at 41 Mhash/s its going to take you almost a year to reach slush's minimum payout of 0.01. And thats assuming difficulty remains the same...which it won't.  So really you're looking at over a year.
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:39:15
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:32:10
I read this as persian hoes...I was expecting something different 
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:30:55
$300...but I don't think it will be very dramatic. Fall maybe 50 or 60 bucks.
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:14:09
I got started with bitcoin by using faucets like [these](  Should give u a lil bit of starting funds.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:21:36
With the amount of re tweets that has already....Thats a lot of bitcoin. I'll believe it when I see it
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:10:30
You should probably learn about something before you throw money at it.  I thought that was common sense...
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:03:03
Gold? What about some bitcoins? ...Its worth a shot right? ;)
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:32:47
Yup gut feelings always work for me. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:35:49
I'm running windows. I didn't do 2FA, although probably should have.  I didn't reuse my btc-e password, it was randomly generated with 20 characters from keepass.
