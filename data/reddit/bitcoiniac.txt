It should have a hotwallet, and if we controlled the software it would, but we don't, so Robocoin needs to code it. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:46:42
Right now Vault of Satoshi's lowest price is 717.8975 CAD, which you then need to add their 1% trade fee to. This brings it up to 725.076475 CAD. The Waves ATM is using Cointrader.net's price of 657.90 USD, which our 1% buy fee is added to, and then it is converted to CAD at spot rate, so it comes in at 726.370 CAD! Pretty damn good for being able to get coins instantly, and anonymously (we have KYC disabled on our machine).
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:37:13
With multiple exchanges you would need to have multiple floats, and these floats are large... our float for one ATM and one exchange is about $300,000.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:38:40
We shut down BUYS because our customers are buying coins from the ATM and not getting any coins. We're not going to continue selling a product that isn't getting delivered.
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:23:22
Yes, currently we're USD only, but we'll be adding a CAD and GBP order book shortly. Just finishing up some higher priority projects first.
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:22:23
We haven't been advertising because we're fine tuning the trading platform and awaiting the completed site design. We should be ready to do a big launch with the new design in about two weeks though.
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:19:43
You've hit the nail on the head. Operators shouldn't be at the mercy of the exchange. Hot wallet's are a must.
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:22:09
Palm scanner.
@_date: 2014-01-27 09:02:56
We are just a "Robocoin Operator", we don't control the code, and therefor can only offer the choices that Robocoin has available, which as of right now doesn't even include a hot wallet...
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:09:05
Tell me about it!
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:17:24
Just talked to Robocoin, and we are apparently whitelisted, so one of us is getting lied to.
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:01:32
Integration with existing terminals like these is a way better idea than building stand alone bitcoin ATM units. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:18:32
We will allow more than 1 API call a second; better transaction records; instant withdrawals (no "processing"); we'll also offer a .2% fee right away to any operators and we answer emails and phone calls!
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:14:42
The price you paid is locked in. You're not exposed to the market. You're just waiting for the withdrawal to "process".
@_date: 2014-02-20 01:13:42
Absolutely not. It just means that things got a bit harder. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:25:55
Interesting! Did they ever get back to you? How many times had this happened to you in the past?
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:27:39
If Bitstamp was shut down the ATM would not allow customers to use it, so that isn't the problem. This isn't a new Bitstamp problem either.. it's happened many times before for shorter periods (hours), but it has now been days and we've heard nothing from them.
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:51:30
In Singapore we have our KYC disabled too, but it looks like they're going to start forcing KYC within the next year.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:33:45
You do not need ID to use the ATM, and we turned off the hand scanner after the first week. All you need is cash. You don't even need a QR code because it will print you a paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-08 12:10:45
Hey John, please message me on Skype at jacksonwarren86 
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:06:44
So much. Like a ridiculous amount.
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:02:55
It's fine, don't worry. It's a 30 day notice, so you will not lose any money, and they may have a back up account. :-) 
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:09:59
We ordered a custom Bitcoiniac miner-guy for our office in Vancouver and it turned out much better than we expected! You can see him on our cover photo: 
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:15:14
Yup, and then they don't answer emails or phone calls. Absolutely terrible service.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:34:41
Yes, just the withdrawals are not "processing". This typically only lasts a few minutes, or rarely, a few hours, but it's been days now and with no response to repeated contact requests from us at Bitcoiniacs and the Robocoin team. VERY frustrating.
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:07:53
You're forgetting about property rights.
@_date: 2014-01-27 08:44:54
It doesn't solve the transaction-taking-days problem, but it would at least give you a buffer.
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:30:20
Definitely, the problem is the logistics of managing large floats and moving money around.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:39:00
Bitstamp sucks. This has nothing to do with BitPay.

Bitcoiniacs and  are proud to be major sponsors of this event!
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:47:53
The ATM does not have a hot wallet. It is simply a broker: it holds a cash float on Bitstamp and when someone buys coins it creates a buy order and then withdraws the coins to the customers wallet. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:03:34
You'd think so.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:46:33
Yes, we love that idea, and if we had control over the software we would absolutely code that in, but we don't have control over the software, so Robocoin's team would need to implement that.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:18:35
Switching exchanges is not that easy, Robocoin's tech guys need to do a lot of testing before they can get it set up. We have built our own exchange, and we built it to be ATM friendly, but it doesn't have the volume yet to handle an ATM.
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:21:11
 
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:19:04
We don't use Virtex because we gave them 2 months of notice before launching the ATM to get us an API and sandbox to test on, but they never did so Robocoin's techs weren't able to test and code it in.
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:26:43
What xPatryn said. This is VERY frustrating for us because we want our customers to get their bitcoins right away so that they can trade and purchase items. Normally this is the case, but this time (and a few times in the past) withdrawals have been seriously delayed. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:16:51
We've got banking sorted out for Cointrader, and we'll be adding a bunch of new funding and withdrawal options in the coming weeks, as well as an awesome new trading feature, but banking for the Bitcoiniacs brokerage and ATM has been a nightmare.
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:15:45
Awesome! :)
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:02:50
We spoke to their AML department at head office earlier. They said they called a meeting after the budget speech and made the decision to begin closing all Bitcoin accounts until Fintrac regulates Bitcoin. This is a direct result of Jim Flaherty's comments during the budget speech. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:52:34
We get a lot of people that just don't want to meet random people in public places, or book appointments; they prefer to simply goto a machine that they know is there and available between certain hours.
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:13:58
No idea why. Nothing on our end has changed, everything else is working fine. It's just the withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:34:02
They closed everyone's accounts shortly after they closed ours, including VoS.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:21:26
Yes, it's really unfortunate. They make a lot of money, and they have the worst customer service I've ever experienced. They take days to respond to emails, and there is no way to get ahold of them by phone, even when we do millions of dollars in volume through them via the ATM and our physical locations.
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:59:06
You won't lose anything. It's a 30 day notice, and they may have another account. :-) 
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:37:38
It's really too bad. I don't think they closed our accounts to screw Bitcoin, I just think they're afraid of the grey and they want there to be regulations in place -- the problem is that regulation could take years! 
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:50:17
Thanks for sharing! Sounds exactly like what's happening to us. They may be considering the Robocoin fee to be spam because it comes off of every transaction and is quite small.
@_date: 2014-01-27 08:43:10
It only exposes a small portion of coins to volatility, or if we used a bitcoin loan of some sort from us personally to be repaid in full at a later point in time, it wouldn't expose us at all. Either way it's just the cost of providing a more reliable service.
@_date: 2014-01-27 09:04:16
Thanks for the support. :) 
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:44:13
You're forgetting about property rights.
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:37:03
You should switch to Cointrader.net for instant withdrawals and excellent customer support ;-) 
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:07:36
Any luck getting ahold of the guys at Bitstamp?
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:15:48
Yup, and that's exactly what's going to happen! 
@_date: 2014-02-20 01:09:15
Yeah, they just said that until Fintrac regulates Bitcoin Bitcoin related businesses push the boundaries of their risk tolerance. The problem is that while Bitcoin businesses might say that they're being proactive with AML and compliance there isn't actually any regulatory framework for the bank or government to enforce procedures or audit them to make sure that they really are.
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:05:55
The Vancouver ATM charges 5% :-) 
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:19:10
We sell a lot of coins, but the large float is necessary because the wire transfers take up to 5 business days to go through, so if you're selling $50,000 worth of BTC a day you need about $250,000 just to cover yourself (and there's weekends). We often sell much more than that at the ATM and through our office location.
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:54:02
There are free markets and fair competition, and then there are property rights. We rent the space at the coffee shop (Waves), and we invested everything we had into the ATM and our store front so that we could make it easy for people to buy and sell bitcoin from a trusted reliable source. It would be like someone setting up a coffee machine at a table in the corner and selling coffee in your new coffee shop after you just remortgaged your house to pay for it.
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:42:14
For online transactions anything under $2000 per day, up to $10,000 a month requires no verification.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:57:56
I'll secretly be defending Doge too.
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:23:13
For example: on Bitstamp's withdrawal page, you can only see the last 20 withdrawals. Not very useful when you're doing hundreds of transactions a day.
@_date: 2014-01-27 08:38:56
That's what we would do if we controlled the code. Robocoin is working on a hot wallet solution for us now.
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:18:02
No ID for in-store purchases, and we don't have set limits -- if we can accommodate it we will.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:35:44
Yes we do, and we pay a lot to rent the space!
@_date: 2014-04-23 21:46:51
FYI, this was brought to you by Bitcoiniacs and Cointrader.net out of Vancouver. This installation follows our partnership in London, and our next unit goes live in Tokyo very soon (it's already on the ground there). All of our units have KYC disabled.
Onward and upward!
@_date: 2014-02-18 07:33:19
We've got a solution for our Vancouver ATM, but we are pumping the brakes on Calgary and Toronto. We actually got the news this morning when we got off the plane in Calgary. We came here to install our next ATM, and set up our next office. :-( 
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:21:30
The machine has a limit of $3000 per transaction, and our attendant makes sure that anyone that wants to do larger transactions walks 30 ft across the coffee shop to our office so we can manually process the transactions and go through the KYC process. But besides that, there is no limit to the amount of BTC you can trade in Canada; KYC and AML are not required, so even if we didn't have AML an and KYC policy we wouldn't be breaking any laws.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:54:32
Our exchange is in beta (going to publish our redesign and do a marketing push in about two weeks) and we coded it specifically to be ATM operator friendly. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 22:37:49
I own and operate the ATM in Vancouver. My name is Jackson Warren, I'm the co-founder of Bitcoiniacs -  The Bitcoin Store and our new online exchange  :-) 
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:40:12
We realized early on that we were going to need someone there to help people use the machine and answer questions. The attendant isn't there to scare competitors away, he/she is there to help people use the ATM, to set up wallets, to deal with errors, and to educate them. Cameron isn't the only attendant either, we have 4 more and they're all awesome and do an amazing job!
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:35:20
Ridiculously alpha but awesome -- keep up the good work and keep us posted!!! 
@_date: 2014-01-27 08:49:41
You could top up with every transaction. So the customer gets their coins from the float, and the Bitstamp withdrawals get sent to the float to top it back up.
@_date: 2015-09-11 18:47:47
We've got a Monetas sub going on that's starting to get some action. Check it out here:

Dear Wikimedia Foundation,
Last year I emailed you asking if, or when, you be would accepting donations in bitcoin. You replied (thank you), and said that you weren't currently, but were watching it "with interest". Well, things have been pretty "interesting" over the past year, so it's unfortunate to see that you are still not accepting donations in bitcoin. There are many intelligent people in the Bitcoin community, all who value Wikipedia tremendously, but do not have credit cards or use PayPal -- myself included -- who would love to support your efforts to make the world a better place.
The people at  opened up to bitcoin, and have received over 118 bitcoin to date, currently worth over $20,000. This can be verified on the blockchain at  -- I can only imagine how much more you guys would receive! Please begin accepting bitcoin. I've got .5btc here with your name on it.
All the best!
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:18:51
Thanks Noel20!
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:00:37
FYI Fintrac doesn't require AML and KYC measures to be in place (currently); HOWEVER, the banks in Canada DO require them. This is why the we use the palm scanner.

Hi SilentSam69.  After talking to the guys at Bitstamp, we discovered that the withdrawal delay was caused by a bug in their system. They fixed it this morning, and the withdraws have been taking just minutes to come through now. We're very pleased that they were able to resolve the issue! We want people to be able to buy bitcoins at the ATM and then walk right over and buy a coffee.
@_date: 2013-06-27 02:38:02
We can handle any size of order.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:12:55

Woah woah, relax. I care only about money? My focus from the beginning has been to make bitcoin easy to buy and sell for everyone, and to build the infrastructure for mass-adoption of Bitcoin. Money is just a tool to build that infrastructure.
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:26:40
Hi, the problem is on Bistamp's end. They take time to "process" the withdrawal, and unfortunately some withdrawals are taking WAY too long. Mt.Gox, and CaVirtex don't have these same problems, but we can't use Mt.Gox as our exchange, for obvious reasons, and CaVirtex took too long giving us a sandbox to test their API on before launching. If the transaction still hasn't cleared please contact us through Bitcoiniacs.com 
@_date: 2013-08-28 05:48:47
Hi jen1980, we're going to start accepting USD soon. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:37:17

@_date: 2013-06-27 06:54:30
To prevent this error, we analyze the market depth and average it, based on the size of the order, before trading.

This guy is a fuckin nutjob. He called our 1-800 number about 20 times talking nonsense about trademarking, then one night he came down to the Bitcoin ATM and started hitting it and mumbling weird shit.

We have not said that - Fintrac has said that. However, the banks here in Canada do not just consider Fintrac's recommendations, they also consider what Fincen recommends, and therefor they require us to have AML and KYC measure in place to prevent "money laundering".
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:38:32
We're working on it! :)
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:32:13

pelle, I run a physical bitcoin exchange out of Vancouver, Canada,  If you're interested, we could work together to set up a system for people to come in with cash and transfer bitcoins back to wherever your system is operating. This could help people who just want to send money, and aren't interested in dealing with software, wallets, security, etc, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:45:08
I can tell you that our ATM in Vancouver requires a float of over $300,000 in order to keep it running, and even that wasn't enough on Monday - we ran out of money. The problem is the time that it takes to process the money, get it to the bank, and then the time it takes to wire it back to the exchange.

I'm down at Waves almost everyday, and judging by the people I've seen, I couldn't say that any of them were drug dealers. It's all different types of people: teenagers, nerds, old people, very old people, hippies, anarchists, kids with their parents, etc etc. It's actually amazing how people are helping each other, and showing each other how to use the machine. You seen them coming back with friends too. This is a really good thing for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-02 09:50:25
Canadian banks are very hostile towards bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:31:30
Our fee is 7% right now at the ATM. The thing is very expensive to operate. We had to hire two employees to help people use it, and to answer questions. Wiring money to and from the exchange is very expensive, plus we have to pay exchange fees, and Robocoin fees. Managing the cash that goes into and comes out of the ATM is also very expensive. If you want to do larger purchases outside of the ATM we can facilitate them for a lower rate, just shoot an email to contact
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:30:19
I'm here and they don't know what bitcoin is...
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:47:41

The news outlets have been reporting that AML and KYC measures do not need to be in place here in Canada, but this is absolutely not true if you intend to run a legitimate business that deals with the banks here. The banks force us to implement AML and KYC measures, and the palm scan is the most anonymous way to do this, so that is why we use it.
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:10:17
This might be one of the best Bitcoin articles I have ever read in major newspaper!
@_date: 2013-06-27 02:59:53
We buy and sell bitcoins for 7% below or above the cavirtex.com market rate. However, if you are referred to us by a friend who signed up for our affiliate program at  then we will buy or sell at 6% below or above the Cavirtex market rate. Keep in mind that the standard 3% transaction fee at Cavirtex is included in our fee, so with a referral you are paying just 3% more, with the added bonus of not having set up bank accounts, get verified, wait for bank deposits, pay banking fees, etc, etc.
I hope that clears things up. If you have any more questions, you can email us at contact
@_date: 2013-10-31 08:24:00
That's a good idea. I'll talk to John from Robocoin tomorrow to see if we can find a way to implement something like this as quickly as possible!
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:55:49
Use Multibit
@_date: 2013-11-10 11:15:01
We use Bitstamp because the Cavirtex market doesn't have enough liquidity.
