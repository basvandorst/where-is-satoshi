Yes, 100% yes.  BUT... like everyone else posted, predicting when that bubble pops is like reading tea leaves or playing the lottery.  This is part of why u/kalovian stated "when it hits 100k".  I'm pretty sure in the run up to 1000, the price was increasing 10-20% per day or something insane.  We are now getting close to that metric, but are still short of absolute insanity.  If this were any other asset class, I would probably exit partially right now, but I am still somewhat waiting for full insanity to bow out.

Only when the price remains constant is this true.

As a non-BTC user, this is my largest fear.  I have been following it with some concern as the major "dealers" seem to suffer from a wide array of technical problems, even to straight up losing peoples' BTCs.  This, coupled with a lack of a real way to "short" BTC value means there's no counter-pressure to it rising way too high way too fast and crashing repeatedly.  


I don't follow.  Gold will still have much value after molecular manufacturing.

No it is not.  Bitcoins do not exist in a vacuum.  Not only are more being made every day, but the BTC value is relative to other currency types.  One could reasonably suggest that the fall of value of BTC per USD could be due to the relative increase of value perception of the USD with the recent value depreciation of gold and the slowdown of China's economy.  BTC will gain massive value if the USD becomes destabilized (look at the impact the Cyprus debacle made).  As long as BTC holds value greater than the amount of electricity used to produce it, it will have been a positive sum game.

Illegally hearing the sound of the ocean, of course.

BTC has needed a legitimate way to short it for a while now.  This isn't quite that but it's closer than any other option out there.

One could probably argue that BTC has good "fundamentals".  It is open source, provides very low transaction fees for converting currencies or purchasing between political borders, merchants are slowly picking up on it, etc... I'm sure some of the diehard BTC fans would love to extol its virtues.  
The risk to buy in is worth it to many, considering the potential for more widespread adoption (most major world currencies are not going to gain adoption at the rate BTC is), or at the very least to introduce a more competitive option as compared to paypal, Visa, etc...
Meh my 2cents.  I see people get bent out of shape on reddit all the time about small disagreements; in general I agree with your position.  It's a gamble and the majority of my investments are in much lower-risk holdings.

It's like a lottery that pays out, like, 1000% per year or something crazy like that. It's still a lottery for sure, but a pretty damn lucrative one.

Dollar strengthened quite a bit with the bearish prospects on China and gold.

It might be worthwhile, I'm sure it's been done somewhere... I know an easier way is to go through the gox wallet site.  I honestly don't see why I can't buy BTC with my PayPal though.  I guess my point is that for people like me, every online retailer I use who accepts BTC also accepts PayPal.  There's no inherent advantage *for my needs* and so putting in even the couple of hours doesn't gain me anything except speculation possibilities (no thanks).

You could make the argument that sometimes BTC value is way easier to anaylze than the NASDAQ but with no reliable way to short sell bitcoins there is no money to be made when you see a period of explosive growth such as happened last week.  It is much easier to look at current trends and say "it is vastly overvalued, it is likely to drop" than it is to say anything about the current value of ~100USD.  A big problem with BTC, and the lack of short sales of it, is that it promotes the logic of "I could lose 100USD or gain an untold amount!!"
It is not unreasonable to suggest that there will probably be several more bubbles similar to what happened last week - it is also fairly clear that last weeks bubble didn't really burst, just deflated a bit.  My personal opinion (and I do not own more than 0.01BTC and I am NOT offering advice) is that right now speculators are the only people keeping the price up and I would not buy until the major exchanges fix a lot of their problems unless you are going to actually use the BTCs to buy goods/services.

There is a surprisingly large barrier of entry to using bitcoins.  Not trying to hate and not saying it's impossible, but as someone who would probably buy bitcoins if it were easier to buy... it is NOT made easy to purchase them.

I would suggest even that BTC is the best possible thing to day trade in.  It's volatile as hell, has always rebounded higher than ever, and is pretty easy to see when a "bubble" is getting really inflated.  Plus, it's not (as far as we know) more or less dominated by automated bots.  The hardest part of day trading BTC is just buying them or selling them when you want to without getting locked out of an exchange.
