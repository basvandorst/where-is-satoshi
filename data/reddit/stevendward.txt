Wow, thanks for posting about this. Best of luck to you. I've also had my book for sale via bitcoin but have had trouble finding good services to sell it with. yumcoin looks great and I got my book online in just a few minutes.
Have you had any luck with marketing specifically for bitcoin? Truth be told, while I've had some modest success on Amazon, I've had all of one bitcoin sale. :-P
Edit: Here's the yumcoin link, just in case anyone's curious:

Thanks for the support!

Well, I just have one book, so you're ahead of me there. :-)
Did you get your book listed on the Wiki trade page? I haven't been able to figure out how to do it.

I hit a glitch I couldn't seem to get around with BitPay, so I've spent the last 24 hours obsessively trying to figure out how to basically do the same thing you guys are doing on my own site (author.stevendward.com), not using bitpay. It seems to be working now, but I seem to hit a glitch with removing the shipping and billing fields for checkout. I'm using WP multi-site, as it seems you are too, and the usual method of disabling those fields in wordpress doesn't seem to work in multisite, so I'm just wondering if you have any experience with that and could point me in the right direction?

No problem. Thanks!

great, thanks!

Ah... problem is woocommerce doesn't work with my wordpress theme. Does WP-ecommerce plug in not work? If not, does it mean I can't use your service?

Things seem to be going alright now with the minor hiccup that my auto-verification of payment isn't working so I have to go in and manually tell the system payment has been received. I leave it be for the time being and if I run into problems over the next several hours I'll switch it over to test net.

Replied to your pm. That would be great! The site is looking good, and it's an awesome idea too, by the way. The more I think about it, the more I think there's a huge potential market here, and the more frustrated I get with the online shop I've been trying to setup on my website.

Very cool idea. Are you exclusive to No Starch Press titles, or is there a way I could get my book ( on your service? I've been banging my head against the wall for a while now trying to figure out how to do it myself, ugh...
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:24:25
I will look into this. Thank you.

The IRC chat isn't working for me. I finally got the signup for bitpay done, but I've been waiting for days for my account to be approved...
One problem I'm having running it from my own website (  ) is that wordpress/woocommerce seems to impose an upload limit of 1meg for the files that are, in my case, the products I want to sell. The pdf alone is 10megs, with the epub and mobi versions being much lower, but still over 1meg.
Can I expect to run into the same limitation on openbitcoinstore when I finally get bitpay set up?
@_date: 2013-05-08 14:28:27
Yes. Most definitely, yes. I will check it out. I came to this subreddit tonight hoping to find exactly this kind of thing! Thanks!

Do I need to do anything special to reconfigure my shopping cart to accept the test net btc, or do I just swap out the recieving account info?
@_date: 2013-05-10 10:42:48
Hmm... guess I should learn how to get on IRC, LOL Thanks for the direction!

Okay, I kinda figured out how to setup my own store. Problem is there's a glitch with the BitPay part. It won't let me submit (as in, I keep clicking the button and nothing happens. Maybe a problem with Chrome).
Anyhow, will this work for downloadable products (specifically, ebooks)?
