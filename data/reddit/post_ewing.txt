which exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:07:33
Usually megamillions is 150m to 450m, from what I've seen.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:43
I'm just upset I got logged out when GDAX said it was under 13k..
 Idk how much I can put much into that since other charts indicate it didnt even go below 13.7k
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:09:18
This is going to be a crazy week.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:20:42
Yea looking at the transactions , its pretty baffling
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:31:11
Ahh like papa johns "pizza"
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:11:18
It is Monday somewhere
Edit: This is what makes me wonder how an actual bubble burst will happen? 
        Like a major one from 2014 ? Even if it crashes to 2k..wouldnt more people just buy in?
       
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:41:23
It was 15 yesterday, this happens literally every day in a half.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:01:27
Um depends how much you bought?
Very risky move since its not your money, but hmm right now you have to wait and see what happens this week.
Best advice is dont stare at the market and focus on something else until Monday
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:04:21
Anyone thats nervous about the CME is selling  &amp; probably people who are scared by it going down follow suit.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:43:46
What dip..its still at 11k , no?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:33:06
Yea definitely take a bit longer on this decision. 
Maybe put in a fraction of it in ..but probably just put in a extra wallet or something..unless your mom is savvy at apps &amp; programs like wallets.
She should definitely read [this]( (the "dont invest recklessly" on the front page
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:39:47
I bought way to early at 15.8 :p 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:37:54
It depends when you actually put money in. 
If you put money in pre 7k, you're prob sitting pretty.
If you sell now and you bought at 15-17k would it be worth the loss in perspective value depends on how much you spent.
You can completely cash out if you want but it also depends how much you spent. 
If you want out sure, but if you're day trading you'll probably wont make a profit cashing out then buying back in.
Disclaimer: Crypto is very volatile no one truly knows what can happen &amp; you should 
only put in what you dont need. Also knowing what the technology is &amp; does, helps.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:18:45
What type of pie? Pecan?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:29:22
I thought they were checking for 14-15 , but good luck though!
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:53:30
Ahh.. A dip to me is like 2k drop haha
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:43:54
You literally do nothing but sleep this off.
Alternate would be to sell off what you have or buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:43:34
Haha as is tradition.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:07:30
Wouldnt..they just hold on to the bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:30:32
Why is he so mad at Bitcoin, did it not help change his life for the better?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:01:38
Yea 5-6k is a dip in my eyes , well i guess now that would be 9k?
When it reaches an all time high and goes down back to the previous all time high in a hour..
That's just business as usual.
But yea the adage of just buy in when you can works too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:10:13
Eh sorta seems like everyones a bit up their own backsides.
I like other alt coins that have capabilities BTC doesnt do but some people and even here are a bit full of themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:29:10
Yea if you dont need the money, for anything serious buy some bitcoin.
Make sure you read about the how to's and why people believe in Bitcoin and other cryptos!
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:06:43
Mondays have been interesting the last 4 weeks haha why not this week.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:09:29
You could try a different exchange, but CB/GD aren't the only ones that faced problems this morning.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:05:39
The CME starts at 4PM right? 
Idk why but Im more excited than scared to be honest.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:38:44
Yea..this..seems like a bad idea.
Who else would want a ..MaduroCoin.. I guess foreigners that have to buy things..wouldnt it just be better if the continue mining Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:04:39
We would hope it got that low, idek when its getting back to 5k again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:32:30
I just looked up Glidera through reddit just now &amp; found out about Airbitz which sounds like an interesting alternative
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:41:10
Haha its funny seeing some people are panicking ..like it was 9k..just 2 days ago.. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:21:57
I thought about that but realistically , I wouldn't have went and bought $400 worth back in 2014.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:49:14
Well at least they're not in debt (I'm assuming)
Hope they get out of their depression.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:13:24
Ah yes thats true, thats a better call
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:51:39
You would hope whoever has Twitter stock has some Square stock as well.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:28:43
*Mr.Krab plays smallest violin*
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:38:54
Ah ok I see, yeah nothing cowardly about the hodl haha
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:08:52
Then it wouldnt be NY pizza haha .
I've heard theres a pizza renaissance in Japan &amp; they imported
water from NY to make their pizzas.
I might be mixing up pizza stories buut pizza is great 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:06:23
Man if you're 17 with 10BTC stressing haha dont I would love to be in your position.
Probably put what you have in a paper wallet or are you just retiring from trading/gambling?
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:53:22
Yea I hope once, if people actually get into this they  take some time to understand the basics  and comprehend its not really a get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:34:35
Feels like that user watched the wrong youtube personality.
Wouldn't someone to even understand BCH, has to grasp what BTC is and do research on Twitter/Reddit/YouTube/ect? 
But hey I guess people can go other routes.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:15:47
Well time was the ultimate pay back.
Did you hodl or trade during those years?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:08:13
I think you might need to change your username, congrats!
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:28:13
Ahh yes I remember way, way, way back on November the 10th of ol' 2000 &amp; 17 , those were trying times they were.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:29:44
I hope all of your stuff is protected, though
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:12:15
..but it will go up haha you know that from all your time having BTC.
If youre worried about another 2015 crash can just cash out 40% and reinvest?
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:37:01


Theres an Instagram stock?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:01:01
Did..they start uploading low quality images... that show steps and houses that are in triangular form ... how did they not realize?
