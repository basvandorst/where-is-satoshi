Gold total market value is close to $10T and not $6T.  
Not sure if other numbers are accurate.

Isnt this $200-400m "a week" just Xapo clients moving to Coinbase Custody?

Fake volume.  
 - far more realistic data. 
Another website where you can check legitimate volume is openmarketcap but seems its down for the moment.

"it's because almost all of the daily selling pressure comes from miners."  
There's about $595M in spot market past 24 hrs (according to bitcointradevolume.com).  
144 blocks x 6.25 btc = 900 btc per day less that miners can sell after halving (At current prices, about $7.2m), so its incorrect to say that almost all of the daily selling pressure comes from the miners.

Seems to be a very reasonable article.  
While the S2F Model has greatly improved the narrative, a 50% decrease in new supply most likely wont be the catalyst to a major bull run.  
For most people in the world, the concept of digital scarcity is still something not easily comprehensible.

That is what they might do after the next cycle, although first they'd need the president to sign EO 6102 equivalent for Bitcoin.

Yep, thanks :)

If you have to ask the answer is no.
