So how the hell do publishers get paid???
Could not find any of this info on the site nor on google.
As a site owner, i dont see any good in this "brave" if they cant even easly disclose how sites get paid.
Brave browser blocks adds regardles on what site you are, even the small one's that dont have a bitcoin adre's or even a subscription mode.

Ugh, why still use Faucetbox?
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:14:37
I'd like to see how this stacks up against xapo and CoinsBank* nameless card's.
The whole point of bitcoin(in my eye's) is that the gov has no insight in it. With service's like this, you are narrowing that gap.

If you go Linux, you need amd. Amd has been supportive  of linux for years.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:54:31
Nah, more like "buy buy buy"
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:13:46
Buy buy buy!!, sadly no funds on exchange... You know what.. i'll deposit so the value will be higher again once my deposit is trough(like always) lol.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:15:55
Bought at 15, sold at 11,7 and bought at 12. Yha that was a bad day and im stil waiting for my deposit.. was supposed to buy at atl... This was low risk/day trade money. Main funds were hodl.

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:20:40
I cant.. fucking coinbase isnt processing sepa...
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:12:45
Why not just use an anti-anti adblocker-blocker??
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:40:47
It happens in fiat stock trading too. Money in general can really mess people up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:46:55
Im new, but im more angry on not getting my deposit on my account on gdax then losing on what i bought already.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:26:13
What is the difference between the 2? Is there any financial loss to one of the 2? Or is it the principal of decentralised?
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:17:39
The first sentence in the title is wrong tough. They could. But I doubt they did. There are more Windows pc's in the world then the cia can handle.

If we fork we lose value. Everybody that doesn't see that, is blind. People argue that both walllets would make up for it together.. but it doesn't. If we fork, we will gradually use the new fork over the older. And the older gets less worth while the newer was half the value of btc to begin with.
I dont see the new fork gaining in value.
And cashing out 2 different wallets for 1 item will be a hassle.(not everybody has 1btc worth of a wallet).
If forking would have doubled the value, i think we would have done it already.
@_date: 2017-01-21 00:35:10
As long as we dong get a full on fork, i'm fine with every "improvement".
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:26:28
But i didn't have 100 to invest T_T. Hell i never have the $$$ to invest. Could have invested 100$ in AMD stock but minimum was 900 T_T.

Dont join any ico's if you are not willing to risk the dough.
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:50:45
Ugh, still have high fees on shitty xapo and breadwallet.
Xapo takes 99%of my satoshi(15,xx usd from 16) and bread takes about 50% (€5,13 from 10,20). Just want to "merge" both wallets...
@_date: 2016-11-05 11:07:00
Well?? How?? Video doesn't show how to... Its not even english..

4???!! Every thing above 5 is ok. But 4 is just insane.
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:08:39
And what does segtwit do?
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:36:49
I lost some coins that way T_T Didnt get any notice the pool was shutting down. When i got back to it, the pool was goner.

IT go's to 2021 if i click on the link?
@_date: 2019-06-06 20:54:36
Lets hope so. Its already below 7k€ (i dont follow usd).  Cant wait for the 20k or w/e.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:56:35
In price difference i hope. Not actual trade price cuz that will never happen...
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:18:30
Ughh. Gdax doesnt do weekend money transfers. Was to late..
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:19:44
To use gdax, one must use coinbase for sepa transfer
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:01:24
I'm already pissed i didn't have cash on gdax. Now wire transfer in weekend...  Hope the drop is still there.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:30:33
Hodl. Dont be scared now its dropping loads. Itl get back up.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:34:14
Any tips to prevent degradation/corrosion of paper? Or any other good materials to "print" on?
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:11:03
Its in the Netherlands tough...
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:28:54
Ah, that explains the drop. Lol jk.
@_date: 2017-04-22 01:47:28
So this is currently only for chatting? Would this be better implementation to handle client - server information instead of the stock secure php stuf? Or Wil chatting be the only use?
@_date: 2019-04-15 22:55:54
Isnt this fucking obvious tough?
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:16:39
I only care if the let me earn in the EU, unlike brave....

Blockchain and "patented" dont seem to fit together in my eye's...
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:55:10
Yha, i figured that much...
@_date: 2016-09-23 10:35:48
And this is what?
@_date: 2016-09-21 01:41:26
You can do this with any bitcoin card. I'd rather have an easy way the other way around.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:10:43
You are right. Something having value doesn't make it monetary. It like the cort said that he needs to pay in cars.. stupid example but still.
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:50:49
Then it dropped to 0,30 cents, so I can buy the dip
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:58:25
All energy/ electricity in my country is green, focusing on that, what energy problem does btc have in my country?
@_date: 2016-09-02 14:46:45
This does not really tel how the site owner get
s paid. It only explains the workings of the payment and who gets what.
No actual "This is how site owner/publisher gets the money"

I'm looking forward to this, I'm a customer my self.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:48:05
Im at 0.7. dunno if ill get to 0.1 because racecar..( will be planing to buy a 350z bevore end 2018 with all my funds , including fiat).

Eh, to bad i dont have the cash
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:22:24
Who says he can afford to lose it?
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:13:58
These dip are hard for me. Trying to keep my sanity... And not pour 500€+ in it every damn dip.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:22:28
Why not cheap payments??? Any economy needs cheap payments.. even btc.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:30:32
There is enough opportunity to invest now. So w/e
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:31:50
Why is btc tanking so hard ? Haven't been following it lately.
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:21:48
But did he get something for the money? Or did he just lit up the money straight away?  Get where i'm going?
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:41:07
Nasa is in this position because the gov rather spend money on war machine (and i do aplaud that as we got many benefits out of that) instead of cutting that budget down and giving nasa a bit more. Commercial rocketeers have way more $$$ to spend and develop. Commercial space is the doom of nasa.
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:23:40
Buy for $10 :p. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 08:40:55
That was pretty well done. Good use of a meme
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:25:15
Finally something i can show those fools that say" bitcoin doesn't have miners" that they are wrong, with an image.
@_date: 2016-10-29 11:25:47
Not only the US. Many country's in the EU are also making it complicated.
And the big fail of one of the swiss banks isnt helping.
Many lost their money due to that swiss bank going kapoet.
@_date: 2016-10-06 19:46:36
Soo, seeing the comments. Buying with paypal is OK but selling is risky. Good to know.
@_date: 2016-10-30 01:01:50
No, another swiss bank, cant remember but it concerned allot of dutch account holders.
@_date: 2016-10-08 10:49:59
Way to ruin a pretty good coin.. €10 for 696 cant be right...
A subway of 2,50 costs me way more coin then you can buy for € 10.

How many prints do you think that exist out there?
These prints never go out of circulation.
So the 500 wont go anywhere.
@_date: 2016-10-14 10:39:47


But thats useless in practice. An "seller" needs to accept 2 different coins for 1 product. Aint nobody got time for that.
My BTC,LTC and Doge have a higher combined vale, but combining them brings me no where.
Just saying yha know.
@_date: 2016-10-29 11:21:08


@_date: 2016-10-14 10:35:32
Oh and remember when he said "Good artists copy; great artists steal" and later on scolded android for "stealing" ?
@_date: 2016-10-27 05:36:57
I like how you mentioned the totally useless swiss bank account. It aint what it used to be.
@_date: 2016-10-27 05:41:52
But you can't take all nodes down. Bitcoin is just like piracy. You can make it harder, take down sites, but it will never disappear. I can run 3 nodes at home if i want, your naighboring country does not know download and upload limits.
@_date: 2016-10-29 11:19:49


If uncle Sam doesn't like bitcoin chances are European globalist hate it as well.
We dont have states. We have country's. And not all country's like what EU parliament wants, not all country's will cooperate.
So even if sam doesnt like it and the EU parlement doesnt, that does not rule over all eu country's.
And sins when does the EU issue attacks trough US??? Thats a new one..
@_date: 2016-10-14 10:29:42
You are quoting some one that said stealing is okey and then scolded android for "stealing" from him.
Yha.... 
@_date: 2016-10-19 15:31:44
Never heard of circle. What is is exactly?
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:33:57
Bitcoins aren't even fully recognised as currency in the EU and i doubt in germany too. So how can they say you even transferred any value at all? I would look up the legals about bitcoin and the law in germany.
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:39:25
Never heard more BS then this. Nato isnt responsible for is nor 90% of the other refugees. Because 90% isnt even from Syria...
@_date: 2016-10-27 05:32:47
Europe is big. Where i am, the 500 wont go anywhere and you dont have a deposit/withdrawal limit. The only limit you have is the safety limit for withdrawal(incase some one stole your debit and knows your pin.). You can increase or decrease that limit by you will. Or just withdrawal at the counter.
