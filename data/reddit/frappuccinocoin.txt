I have a question regarding the ideology behind Gemini. I got the impression that your exchange is geard towards institutional investors. Doesn't that contradict with the vision of Bitcoin in that it wishes to create a new financial reality.
In other words, shouldn't Gemini be looking towards the future rather than the past?

I am not interested about Karpeles' schedule. If he cares that much about what we think, why doesn't he tell us what happened to our bitcoins? Stolen? Lost Keys? How about the fiat? where did it go? For how long was he operating a fractional reserve?

Buffett says it's just a "value transfer system, I can do that with a check" (paraphrasing).
What is missing from that statement is that this system, Bitcoin, does not have an entry point for any authority.
This means that the government cannot invisibly tax the middle-class by deciding to issue more dollars.
To say it is a superior store of value would be an understatement. Entire countries would collapse and the word "bailout" wouldn't be an option. Thus preserving the fortune of people who spent a lifetime working hard &amp; making sound decisions.

u/Team-Blacksheep (TBS) are the MtGox of drone companies.
I don't recommend anyone buy anything from them. It's not that thier products are bad, it's thier treatment of customers.
I bought thier flagship drone on thier site where it was listed as available. It didn't ship, waited days, weeks, and eventually months for them to ship it. It wasn't cheap, so I couldn't just buy another drone from somewhere else.
In the true spirit of MtGox, TBS didn't acknowledge the issue or respond to any customers who already paid. The customers started to congreggarte in a 3rd-party forum to put pressure on TBS to respond.
On that thread the TBS guy's responses looked like Mark Krapeles' usual bullshit exuses, blaming suppliers and impatient customers.
I did finally get my drone, many months later after I lost interest in drones and moved on to crypto.
That drone's parts are still sitting unopened in a box, most other drone companies have caught up and passed them by the time I received the TBS drone.
Don't reward a company that exploited the trust of early drone enthusiasts.
I'll post the link to that infamous thread when I find it...
