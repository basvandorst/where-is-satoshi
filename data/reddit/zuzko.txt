Well done and absolutely the right thing to do when it comes to buying first home.
Owning a property (especially the land it is built on) will always have a value. The population on the planet is going up while the amount of land is not.
Not matter of whether digital or fiat currency gets on top in the future, that property will have a good value in whatever the currency is at that moment.
On top of that owning a property probably means saving from rent, and you can always invest back into crypto :)

This is without a doubt the biggest crypto news until now.
Exchange, ETF, custody/warehousing solution, payment platform and two iconic companies in their respective fields ready to use it :)
And this even have a target date (November), which probably means that this is serious.
Honestly, this is so much bigger than the current ETF decision that everyone is hoping for.
People will need some time to realize the potential of this (if they are serious and get all necessary approvals by the US regulators).

Depends on the personal circumstances of course.
For small business/investor, it is much better in UK.
UK has relatively generous allowances (basically tax free)
- £11,500 income tax allowance
- £11,300 capital gains allowance
- 5k dividends allowance (was getting nearly 30k free until last year)
The capital gains tax (currently applicable for the crypto) is only 10% for basic tax payer going to max of 20%.
This is way better than pretty much any other of the big economies.
Using the numbers above, a person could legally take out £27.8k yearly ( about $35k to $40k at current rat ) without paying almost zero.
That for myself and my wife could on theory mean nearly $80k tax free between us. The CGT and dividend tax are very low for the basic rate taxpayer (equivalent of about $60k per person). You pay less then 10% on that.
To summarize with 2 possible examples for a family with the above numbers:
Example  ~$80k between the two of us -completely tax free
Example  ~$120k between the two of us - only 10% on the difference (120-80) = $4k
Very rough numbers but you get the point.
So we are effectively cashing out $120k by paying only $4k (less than 4%!!!). And any capital gains profit above that is taxed at absolute max of 20%. Much better than US (or virtually any other big economy) when it comes to self-employed or small business. But it could very depending on what you have/do of course. 
And you also have free NHS and other social services as well.
And the tax authorities here don't generally care about profits/asset outside of UK. US on the other hand seem to be monitoring everywhere.
Disclaimer: I was not born in UK, but live here now.

Why would you want US citizenship?
Once you get that, they will tax the life out of you.
Get British one instead, it is much more tax friendly here. Btw, I am EU as well :)
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:21:31
Why open short positions?
This is actually rather positive.
Most people expect this ETF to be rejected this year again (for SEC to continue monitoring for another year). With that in mind, there was real chance of it being rejected quickly.
The fact that this is extension and not quick rejection is only positive given where we are. Nobody in their right mind expected quick approval anyway.

I have a kid.
Bitcoin is much easier to deal with. You can just buy it and forget about it until you find some time to deal with it. Kids on the other hand need you "right now" :) 
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:38:14
Is there any big bank or stock exchange left that haven't announced "positive news" for the crypto market (whether it is custody solution, ETF, exchange, adoption ....etc)
All those great news are being completely ignored by the market so far. I can only imaging the next bullrun/fomo when suddenly people decide to take that into consideration. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:22:37
Very good question, I ask myself that very often.
The technology is promising and much superior than many current solutions. So I would like to be part of this (ex IT/developer myself, so interested in this beyond just price gains).
On the other hand, I really dislike the current state of this market (not talking about the price, but the mentality of most people in it).
So I guess I have to just hibernate for the next 2-3 years until the market matures and the hype/manipulation stop being the main driver.
Where are the fking regulations when we desperately need them.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:47:33
This market (and the technology behind it) has the potential to grow to trillions market cap.
Not going to happen right away, but we need to remove the bad actors in order to see the organic growth in time.
I couldn't care less about the price in the short/mid term. But we absolutely need to get rid of the scam as soon as possible.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:12:38
I was talking about regulations to reduce most of the manipulation, not the price.
Once the obvious manipulation is gone, the price will reflect the news (and incoming adoption) accordingly. 
Edit: The regulations will also prevent most of those easy exit scams that are the main reason for the current crash anyway.
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:08:41
It is perfectly clear that the scam is too much in this market and we need to get rid of it. Not sure why you are trying to argue with the main point.
And I can guarantee you that no other market comes even close to the scam in crypto.
Where else would you get someone to get $2bn (cough EOS cough) donation to do something and just say "my job is done you do whatever you want with it".
Or bitconnect, or the constant wash trading ......etc
Not sure what your comment about bitcoin has to do with this discussion either. BTC price is manipulated more than anything else.

I still remember those "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" charts showing each milestone reached (with predictions on when to reach the million).
How the mood  changed in a few months :)

Completely misleading title. Absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-04 22:05:21
I wouldn't want to become US citizen even if it for free. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 13:23:32
The title should start with IF, not WHEN.
@_date: 2018-11-05 12:20:06
Yes, fully agree that it is a dream for some.
Really depends on where you are from. For EU citizens like myself, it is not as appealing as for some others.
If you are curious why most of the Europeans don't want US citizenship, the main reasons probably are "extremely expensive healthcare (they may leave you to die if you don't pay)", "everyone can buy/carry gun" and the "tax authorities target you even outside US". Other than that, I would happily move there to live.
@_date: 2018-11-04 22:03:46
This option will probably be gone for the time being. But just go there and you will find a way to get it.

And this is now officially the start of the Bitcoin religion :)

Bank deposits (up to certain amount) are well insured in the EU countries.
And that deposit is "per bank", so you could always open account in 4-5 banks if you have higher savings :)

According to the CFTC chairman, the ledger technologies are actually better than what is currently used. He is even hinting of possibility that ledger could have prevented the 2008 crash (or at least helped get more clarify and avoided some of the panic).


These two are amongst the most bullish crypto papers I have ever seen :) 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:44:36
You can keep the lambos.
What I want is a nice beachfront flat/house somewhere in the Carribeans white sands with some nice diving spots nearby. 
A boat would be a bonus.
Hmmmmmm... for that I actually need much more than the price of lambo :(

Can you please start checking some facts before posting dates.
August 10th is completely irrelevant date.
SEC notice: 
As you can see, the SEC notice is dated on 26th. 20th  is the date the application was filed.
According to the same document (page 51):


Within 45 days of the date of publication of this notice.. 
If anything, the date those 45 days expire is August 16th, not August 10th
On top of that, according to the same paragraph of text, the SEC reserves the right to extend the period to 90 days. To make it even more interesting, they reserve additional right to not make decision within those 90 days and "institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should
be disapproved".
Long story short, a decision can be made at any time between today and the next 2-3 years.
Edit: 85% upvotes and not a single one checked facts. The state of crypto market.........
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:41:43
Oh dear!!!
Those idiots will do more harm than good. If it was me on the SEC side, I would reject it based on those comments alone.

We are either where you suggested, or we are at the Desperation with another 12+ months of bear market for everyone to capitulate.
Only time will tell which one it is.
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:50:57
Those that have never been in any other market prior to crypto (and that is actually probably 80/90%+ of the people) clearly believe that it is "that easy". 
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:52:31
That is actually very good for the market. The switch between bear and bull market is almost never instant. It included "long" consolidation periods and I am actually very happy with each week passing by within that 6 - 6.7k range.
Of course, there is still chance to drop further but the longer we stay in that range, the higher the chance of reversal. And the stronger that reversal would be.

You are correct. I am EU citizen myself.
Planning to move to tax friendly location (maybe Caribbean area) and continue with my investments from there.
UK is one to keep an eye at, they could change polices after leaving the EU.

Only tripple?
It was almost that level 6 months ago purely on speculation. If this become digital gold for the average Jane/Joe and institutions, we are talking about trilllions in USD valuation.
