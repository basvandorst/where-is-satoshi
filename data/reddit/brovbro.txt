You can't grade coins. You can only grade addresses. Distinguishing individual coins is impossible. What you are describing is *address reputation*. It is a real problem, but calling it fungibility is inaccurate. If Bitcoin were fungible governments could blacklist the coins themselves, which would be a lot more powerful than address reputation. 
Consider a hacker who steals 1000 coins. They could split them up into a thousand transactions. Some would go to addresses they controlled, some not. Some to addresses with money in them, some not. Some would keep moving on to new addresses, some not. You can't taint those coins, so you would have to decide how much regulatory burden to place on owners of those addresses, because they can't prevent themselves from receiving tainted coins and they can't separate the tainted coins from the others once they receive them. Innocent actors will be mixed with guilty and the coins themselves are totally fungible. Your only option as a government is address reputation - which is strictly less powerful. 
I'm not saying address privacy isn't important I am saying it is not interchangeable with fungibility. Bitcoin is already fungible.

@_date: 2016-04-25 15:20:09
You can't taint coins in Bitcoin, only addresses. That's my point. Once a coin has entered an address there is no way to distinguish it from the other coins at that address. That's fungibility. What you are describing is address reputation and it is bad, but it is less bad than losing true fungibility would be. The distinct matters because it limits the strength of regulatory efforts. Fungibility with address reputation is essentially analogous to the constraints that can be placed on physical cash.
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:22:09
It's the 1/8th tainted aspect I'm trying to point out above. The fact that you can blend tainted and untainted coins indistinguishably makes regulatory power much less effective. It is a valuable property and it makes me sad when people assume address reputation means Bitcoin isn't fungible. Privacy is good! But the system is already more robust to regulatory attack than its usually given credit for. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:33:25
It's not. That's my point. Coins aren't distinguishable once they've been put together. You can't know which block your coins came from because they are indistinguishable from coins that came from different blocks but at one point were combined into the same utxo. Which block your coin was mined in is literally unknowable. It's not well defined. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:33:39
OK, if you don't consider physical cash fungible than I agree that Bitcoin fails that same standard. Until the very recent invention of certain altcoins nothing has been fungible by that standard, though. I tend to favor an older definition of fungibility, and consider what you are describing to be privacy. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 22:34:30
Are you selling these, Max?
@_date: 2016-04-25 15:46:57
If that were true, you could tell what blocks your coins were mined from. The reason you can't is because the coins themselves are fungible. As soon as they arrive in the same address as coins from another block is is fundamentally unknowable which coins are which. Source address is not a property of individual coins. Consider the following:
Alice and Satoshi each send Bob 1 btc. Later Bob sends one btc to Charlie and one to Diane. Who has Satoshi's bitcoin? It is unknowable. You could decide that Satoshi's reputation is so bad that it taints any coins his coins ever share an address and that Charlie and Diane are both tainted now (Address reputation). But you can't taint Satoshi's coin. It has no individual identity or history. The distinction matters. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:05:15
Which blocks were your coins mined in?
@_date: 2016-04-25 18:54:12

@_date: 2016-04-15 07:37:51
The most anonymous way to buy Bitcoin is to mine it. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 18:53:09
That's a fair point. It's easy to destroy that history, but this is closer to a true fungibility issue than the rest of this thread. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 05:52:17
Bitcoin is fungible. People abuse the term. Address reputation and fungibility are not interchangeable concepts. Not to imply that those efforts to remove address reputation as a vector of regulatory attack aren't important. But Bitcoin is fungible *today* and that's not negligible. It is impossible to distinguish individual Bitcoin already. That matters because true lack of fungibility would make regulatory efforts more powerful than they can actually be with only address reputation. We do ourselves a disservice by collapsing the two together.

What does that even mean? The pool is an irrelevant abstraction. There is only the block reward divided by total hashpower times a particular device's hashpower. For an unchanging device, an increase in total network hashpower is a decrease in mining revenue. A pool doesn't change that math. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 04:39:56
Perhaps there may be other ways to monetize data - that wasn't my point. My point was that Google is an advertising company.

Google wasn't the first search engine or the first ad network, and neither of those industries were as small as Bitcoin when Google entered them. If we draw from those examples we would expect Google to wait for other companies to establish the market and then take it from them with superior execution and scale. Google doesn't usually concern itself with trying to be the first to market. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:57:32


Google regularly invests billions of dollars in unrelated technology.
With respect, Google has not invested billions of dollars in anything that wasn't a pointer to ads in some regard. Google X is a good counterexample to my general description of Google, but it's more like stuff that Sergey is excited about than an exhaustive list of the technologies Google thinks is important. Bitcoin is a totally plausible project for X to pick up but it's like a lightning strike - can't be predicted. 


I don't really agree that Google is in a bad position with regards to Bitcoin. They're a fast moving company, and they already have all the requisite talent and expertise. If Bitcoin is hyperadopted overnight Bank of America would be screwed, but Google would still be in a better position than 99% of all companies. 
Moreover, Google doesn't particularly bother with first-mover advantage. We weren't the first big player in search, ads, maps, email, word processing, streaming video, etc etc. Google has more of a habit of letting other companies prove the size of the market and then once it's large enough taking it from them with superior scale and execution. As I see it they are positioned totally fine to take that strategy with Bitcoin as well. 


Larry has definitely been pitched on Bitcoin, I promise you. Eric Schmidt is a big fan, remember?

In my opinion there is a very simple answer to why Google isn't involved in Bitcoin: its tiny and even if it grows is doesn't look particularly poised to disrupt any of their main businesses (search and ads). This is a company that canceled iGoogle when it had &gt;50M active users. Bitcoin is too tiny for them to be ready to bother with.
 There are lots of individuals at Google who really like and are interested in Bitcoin, so as a company it stays pretty well informed but it really doesn't have nearly as much reason to be excited about adding Bitcoin features to its products as we [existing Bitcoin holders] do. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:25:29
Then later in the article he goes on to point out that people with bank accounts are "25% more likely to save - and that's a good thing."

@_date: 2015-12-05 21:31:55
That makes no sense. If the hashpower of the network grows, the value of my miner's contribution will shrink and I will make less money. It doesn't matter if the new hashpower is 21 devices or not, and it doesn't matter if my device is part of a pool or not - they're all competing for the same fixed block reward. More mining power, less mined Bitcoin for existing devices. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:41:27
No idea what the implications are, but getting in a tug of war with PayPal doesn't sound like a very even fight to me. I'd be worried about it escalating.

Don't take legal advice from the internet, but in most places the answer is yes. The laws aren't just about the risk of abuse by the owner - they are mostly about anti money laundering and know your customer laws. Your ATM could potentially enable people to move their wealth around without government oversight.  Avoiding that is the main purpose of the money transmitter licensing.

The simplest way to think about it is the Bitcoin network allows me to exchange value with you directly, without either of us trusting each other at all. The ripple network strives to make it possible to exchange value by finding a chain of trust relationships that connect us. So Bitcoin I send you value and the miners prevent me from cheating. On Ripple I send you value by sending value to someone I trust who sends value to someone they trust who sends value to you (and you trust them). 
The complaints about scamming and premining relate to the currency of the ripple network, XRP, which the confounders hold a crazy large amount of. One of them recently announced an intention to sell, which crashed the market pretty badly. There is still a lot of existing held XRP in places that could potentially really damage value.

OK, here goes. I want a way for anyone to define a community. A community is a list of members (BTC addresses with 1-N votes and a bit indicating whether they can trigger polls). Polling members can present multiple choice polls with an end time to the community, who provably (optionally anonymously) vote their N votes (or abstain) before the poll closing window. Results are recorded provably in the block chain somehow, no central trust authority needed, including trust in founding members. New member addresses are added (or vote counts changed) via polls. All UI can be proof of concept wireframes or command line tools. I can has decentralized voting now? :)

How can you have any meaningful voting system if the number of voters isn't limited? Isn't that sort of the definition of meaningful voting? 
Of those properties I'd be fine with abandoning anonymity. Provable and decentralized you can get by tying votes into microtransactions and some meaningful way to know how many votes a particular bitcoin address has been granted. 
Anyway, I certainly grant you such a system would be complicated. I've only been volunteering to *describe* it. I'm sure other braver souls can tackle *building* it.

Prior to double entry accounting a business couldn't prevent fraud from anyone who managed the ledger. Effectively that meant family business only and no scalable way to manage b2b relationships.

Before double entry accounting fraud looked identical to mistakes. After double entry accounting fraud required two simultaneous and identical mistakes (one in assets and one in liabilities) so it was obvious. With Bitcoin you can create cryptographic receipts that prove my ledger matches yours, which means fraud will require manipulation by both parties in some way. It essentially unlocks a level of transparency and accountability that's never been possible before.

I certainly wouldn't argue with the idea that most of the talking heads who spout those lines are idiots, but it is actually possible to separate blockchain technology and bitcoin. Imagine the US Fed forked Bitcoin to USCoin, premined however much they cared to and then offered an open trade 1:1 USCoins to $. Miner incentives would work the same way as with bitcoin. Bitcoin is probably the only blockchain that will ever bootstrap on pure scarcity the way it did, but if you had some sizable amoint of any desirable, fungible commodity it would be possible to use it to bootstrap a blockchain that wouldn't necessarily be bitcoin related. 
Obviously nobody is being that nuanced when they say those things about 'Blockchain good Bitcoin bad' on TV spots though.

ITT: a bunch of folks not understanding your point. 
I think the incentives for DISH are clear:
a) publicity and techy credit
b) a very few transactions have lower fees
c) a very small number of new users adopt DISH because of bitcoin acceptance
d) in the event that bitcoin becomes huge, they will have a headstart accepting it
To be honest, I agree with you. I'm surprised that's worth it for DISH. For Bitcoin generally I think it's good news because companies are often herd animals. Each additional company that adopts is likely to encourage others to adopt before they get left behind. And each new brand that accepts it normalizes Bitcoin for mainstream America.  But it's hard to see why DISH feels the urge to be this far ahead of the curve.

The point you are making is clear, it's just mistaken. Sha-256 being compromised and disagreeing with the behaviour of the majority hash rate are not the same for Bitcoin's purpose, or for anything else's. If you think of them as being extensions of the same problem, you are missing the point of Bitcoin. 
Swapping out Sha-256 for another encryption method doesn't make miners trustworthy, it just replaces one set of miners for another. Replacing the PoW only makes sense if the PoW itself is compromised (as OP referred to). It is pointless as a means of combatting corruption. The new miners will just become corrupt in the same way for the same reasons. 
Hence, they are not interchangeable and whether you consider the behaviour of the majority hash power an attack or not it is not the same as a Sha-256 compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:17:56
I am not personally a miner and I agree with the claim that if it is easy for &gt;51% of the hash power to form a stable cartel it breaks the guarantees of Bitcoin. I disagree with your conflating that issue and Sha-256. What PoW could we switch to that would negate the economies of scale that drove mining centralization in the first place?
If you believe the current mining distribution proves Bitcoin is broken then Bitcoin is broken. That's not an incoherent belief but the flaw in question has nothing to do with Sha-256.

To compare security subsidies over the last eight years you would need to account for the price of electricity in BTC, since security is priced in electricity to create hashpower. The changes in the price of Bitcoin dwarf the relative changes of both subsidy and fees.
I was speaking over the shorter term, in the era when blocks started to be mostly full and price has stayed in broadly comparable ranges. During that window fees are rising faster than subsidy is falling. You are correct that over the longer term we haven't seen that pattern - but over the longer term blocks weren't full.

Not your fault. It's confusing. Imagine an actual physical wallet. How 'full' the wallet is isn't a function of how much money is in it - it's a function of how many bills are in it. A hundred $1 bills take up more space than a single $100.
In Bitcoin transactions, the size of the transaction determines the size of the fee required. That size is dependent on the number of different times you received payments to that address. So spending from an address with a small amount of Bitcoin that came from many sources will take a larger transaction size (and fee) than spending from an address with more coins but fewer places those coins came from. 
Hope that maybe helps a little? Bitcoin will never go mainstream while end users still have to reason about this kind of issue, though. :-/

"cleaning up" these transactions amounts to merging them by spending them from the many dust utxos into a single consolidated tx. That can be done by anyone with the relevant private keys. If they are known or easy to guess (as the recent waves of transactions have been) then they can be spent by parties other than the party that initiated the transaction. 
In a practical sense, whoever has been initiating this "spam" (or other non-pejorative term, if one prefers) seems to have deliberately chosen places to spend the outputs of their transactiosn that legitimately cause annoying bloat but also are fundamentally resolvable, which is interesting. The first wave was to brainwallets and F2Pool was able to clean them up and evidently this wave is to Voat and Wikileaks addresses (presumably controlled by Voat and Wikileaks, respectively, who can later at some inconvenience consolidate these transactions into one utxo if they care to). The goal seems to be to create large short term impact while minimizing long term impact, as far as I can tell. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 06:13:38
I don't think you understand the term 'capital controls' - they aren't relevant here. In any case, a better question would be why *do* they deserve attention? My point wasn't how important I am but how unimportant that subreddit is. Should I get a sticky thread or a mention in the sidebar?
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:18:03
Think so? My immediate intuition was that whoever was running the recent spate of transactions is hoping to create short term strain but leave all the effects in places where others could be counted on to clean them up if need be, such as guessable brainwallets and popular donations addresses.

The negative interest rate that Yellen is talking about would affect banks themselves not your account directly. They would make it expensive instead of profitable for banks to hold on to your money as cash. They would pass that cost back to you somehow so they stay profitable. That most likely means increased fees for accounts, but it could potentially show up in a number of ways. 
Bottom line: you won't be able to put your money in a bank account and ignore it without it slowly diminishing over time. Which is the goal - negative interest rates encourage spending rather than saving.

Absolutely true - if you've created loyalty in your market for whatever reason, you've made it harder for new competitors to enter because they aren't offering _quite_ the same thing. 


Yeah, I think a lot of the time "good enough" solutions will maintain dominance even if another system has a better interface - Craigslist is a great example of this kind of pattern. To survive as a "good enough" system though I do think you need to be cheap, which in turn means I think it's hard to turn a significant profit for investors.

The 'event' is you owning more bitcoin than 99% of people ever will: if you own 0.02598 Ƀ already then you are already part of the Bitcoin 1%.

@_date: 2017-09-18 22:13:50
Nope, it is an explanation of how much bitcoin you would need to own in order to be in the Top X% of a world where everyone wanted to own Bitcoin. So if you wanted to own more bitcoin than 99% of people in a world that had roughly the inequality of America, you need to buy at least 0.02598 Ƀ, which today would cost you somewhere in the neighborhood of ~$105 or so. 
tl;dr If you believe in Bitcoin you don't need to buy as much as you might think to eventually be "bitrich".

Even if you assume users prefer a revenue stream to a lump sum (which I don't really see a case for) you could *still* skip mining entirely, create that same trickle of btc with regular payments to the address and pocket the difference in cost. Mining doesn't provide anything.

It doesn't need to be a miner to be a full node. And while I agree there is lots of wasted energy around, it still makes less sense to me than preloading. If running out is a concern you could have a service with a regular top off schedule. My paying BTC to your address at the same rate that you would have mined it would be cheaper for both of us. I still don't see any value to the mining aspect of it.

@_date: 2015-09-22 06:19:24
In what way does mining beat preloading?
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:35:34
The first issue is only a problem if you sell the device for less than the value of the preloaded Bitcoin, which would obviously never happen. 
The second doesn't provide a business advantage, it would be altruism (and I doubt it would have that effect.)
The third would make sense except that historically mining equipment has rapidly degraded in value over time as hash rate rises. So the resale market would likely suffer from very similar problems whether it was a depleted preload or an outdated mining ASIC.

It seems artificial to separate policy and technology here. What is the Bitcoin protocol if not a policy written in a programming language?

To me Ethereum isn't interesting because it is much more plausible that incremental functionality will be layered on the system with the existing network effect than that someone will launch an entirely new and independent system that achieves its own network effect and simultaneously solves a very complicated suite of technical problems. Ethereum is trying to swallow the sun - to my mind overambitious systems are way more likely to flop than succeed. 
I'm also skeptical of the claim that Bitcoin is somehow fundamentally illsuited to smart contracts and so we need to clear it away and start from scratch. It reminds me of a junior engineer joining a project and immediately declaring we need to refactor everything because they would have done it differently.

Because you aren't tainting coins. One tainted satoshi can be mixed in with untainted coins and then it is indistinguishable from the clean satoshis. You can blacklist an address, but not a satoshi. Hence the problem is privacy, not fungibility.

Immediately buying back isn't free. I'm not sure what the winklevii acquisition strategy would look like, but spending btc and immediately buying back from Coinbase is essentially just adding an additional ~1% to the bill. It might make sense to do it in some cases (such as to avoid giving cc info to a site) but as a method of jumpstarting Bitcoin itself it doesn't make sense. If Bitcoin needs people to be willing to accept a price hike 'for the good of the system' its hosed. Fortunately I'm of the opinion that store of value is compelling enough on its own.

To give a more lay explanation of why is right about the difference between fungibility and privacy, consider a transaction where you consolidate one tainted satoshi into an address along with 10 untainted Bitcoin. Once those inputs are combined in a single address, there is no way to distinguish the tainted satoshi from the others. If you spent each of those millions of satoshis to different addresses, there would be no way to determine which address had the tainted satoshi. 
The only way you could enforce any kind of tainting logic would be to taint the address, not the satoshi. That would effectively mean that you 'tainted' 10 Bitcoin in order to track the single satoshi.  If you did do that, it's likely that tainted coins would rapidly outnumber untainted coins because any tainted  coins effectively infect all the clean coins they interact with. Untainted coins might command a premium, but they would almost certainly become impractically rare to treat as the only valid currency.

You are under the misconception that we were discussing fiat currency in general. We were discussing how holding actual physical paper currency yourself could still be vulnerable. Bail ins are not an example off that. You are conflating the idea of currency generally (vulnerable to bail ins because most of it is stored in banks) and paper currency (vulnerable to inflation but not to bail ins). A bail in can stop you from getting cash, but it doesn't affect cash you already have. See paleh0rse's reply to my original comment.

Sure! It just means buying in small increments over time so that you "average out" your entry price. That will reduce the extent to which you are vulnerable to unpredictable price movements. You won't be screwed if you happen to buy on a day that was unusually expensive, because other cheaper days will even it out. (This also means you won't get lucky by choosing a cheap day either - it just reduces volatility. )

The point isn't assuming benevolent miners, the point is that miners are paid in bitcoin, so they would only be willing to do things that increase their (# of Bitcoin received) x (value per bitcoin). A strategy that damages value per bitcoin, which changing the maximum number of bitcoin surely would, would be very difficult to make profitable for a miner precisely because they *have* to take their payment in Bitcoin - so other users of Bitcoin can effectively exit the market faster. The scenario you are positing only works for the miners if they can increase the reward multiplier faster than the perceived damage to value by the market. Given how much of Bitcoin's value premise is predicated on the exact finite supply, it seems tough to imagine that anyone could pull that off.

Maybe this is naive, but why is mempool growth a problem that needs to be solved by centralizing anything? Suppose everyone has moved to the new Bitcoin-Ultra node implementation but there are a few holdouts who still are accepting and relaying transactions that most users agree are never likely to be mined. So what? All the nodes running Bitcoin-Ultra just drop those transactions according to their preferred logic. Folks who want the filtered view can subscribe to Bitcoin-Ultra nodes which will be reasonably predictive of things likely to be mined. Folks who want the unfiltered view can subscribe to a Bitcoin-Classic node which will be more resource consumptive and more complete (perhaps even to a fault). 
What is the issue that needs solving? It seems like something akin to this conversation is already going on as nodes decide between -XT and -Core (possibly factoring the differences in mempool logic into their decision).

It doesn't need to (and likely won't) solve wealth inequality. The reason that a factory owner might be willing to out their wealth production into the bitcoin economy even though it benefits Roger Ver is because the alternative choice isn't flawless value units - its traditional fiat currencies. 
So as a factory owner I weigh the potential damage that Roger Ver et al liquidating can do to my wealth (finite, known) to the potential damage fiat printing can do to my wealth (unknown and unbounded). Depending on how I assess those risks I might choose Bitcoin and not give a damn that others benefit from that choice. 
In fact, if 99% of the world was already on Bitcoin the last 1% would have a much larger incentive to adopt Bitcoin, even late in the game, than they do today. The fact that early adopters benefit is largely not important to those incentives.

I don't *think* you're trolling, so I'll try and answer. The worth of a stock is the net present value of the future earnings of the company and the price is the amount that any person is willing to pay for that stock.  Both the worth of a bitcoin and the price of a bitcoin is the amount that any person is willing to pay for it. So when there is frenzied demand for a stock, you've affected the price but not the underlying value. But when there is demand for Bitcoin, you haven't just impacted the price - you've also impacted the underlying value. The network effect of Bitcoin is such that more users actually makes it worth more - which is different from a stock, where the worth has nothing to do with how many people are hoping to buy it. Does that help clarify?

Sure, but that's totally different from self interested miners deciding to sabotage the protocol on their own. The point of the mining isn't to make it *impossible* to steal control of the system, it's to make it *super expensive*. When we're talking  someone who is paying money to fund a hostile attack on bitcoin the detail about buying your hashing power directly from existing miners is interesting but doesn't really change the nature of the attack. If miners could be motivated to damage the protocol without anyone paying them (as OP suggests) that would be a different and drastically worse problem.

Right, in the mid-80s. Duran Duran first popularized it.

You have a surprisingly harsh opinion of taxi drivers of the late 1920s.

Anecdotes are bearish. Quips are bullish. Bon mots indicate sideways chop.

I think we can all agree that this isn't exactly the peak of a bull market right now.

I doubt its zero-confirmation fraud that motivates the price difference. More likely they value new account creation / activity at ~0.002 BTC.

Cool card! FYI blurring is non-random and can be reversed. You want to black out private keys completely in photographs.

I guess I feel like the segment of the market that is sophisticated enough to understand the trust implicit in private key sharing but not sophisticated enough to manage their own private key(s) is fairly small.

What you are asking is something pretty close to the question of how bitcoin works. :) A bitcoin isn't a specific file on your computer, it is a line on a publicly accessible record that says 'the holder of this private key can spend up to X coins'. When theives steal your bitcoin, they actually steal your private key. Then they use it to write 'the holder of this key spends X coins on Y address' on the public record. Once that line is written your private key is no longer useful because the public record shows it now controls 0 coin. The thing they stole wasn't the coin, it was the password that let them spend your coin. You still have the password, but it doesn't do you any good anymore.

Fascinating thought. Read quite a bit. Thanks for sharing!

It's a bit of a dramatic leap from 'segwit2x achieves it's intended blocksize increase' to 'miners can arbitrarily inflate the currency and we will all be helpless'. If we can deploy a UASF now to prevent a blocksize increase and force segwit, why couldn't we do the same thing later when threatened with a change in supply schedule? Either we always have the power to fire the miners or we never did.

For some reason on certain mobile browsers Twitter has been shitting the bed lately. It seems to work better in Chrome, and signing into a Twitter account also seems to help.

Cool and all, but Montana is using a grant to create jobs, not an investment to buy bitcoin or hashing power. This doesn't really mean MT cares about Bitcoin at all.

A lot of people here gleefully linking to negative but uninformative sources. Honestly I don't know of a great 'intelligent but doubtful' essay. Jorge Stolfi is a good person to look up. My take on the risks / downsides would be:
 - the only reason we know Bitcoin is secure is because it hasn't been hacked yet. Someone could figure out something unexpectedly clever (as Bitcoin once was) that bypasses Bitcoin's protections
 - similarly there are lots of game theory / social dynamics that Bitcoin depends on that are untested. Can Bitcoin upgrade when needed? Can it survive on fees alone when the block subsidy runs out? We won't know for sure until we try.
 - might we all wake up one day and suddenly lose the shared illusion that Bitcoin is valuable? If everyone stops believing at once the whole system fails. No way to know if that's possible without waiting to see if it happens. Remember there might be very powerful active forces who might want to disrupt that shared belief, so it doesn't have to be spontaneous to be a legitimate risk. 
 - is there a better Bitcoin? Maybe the next big thing hasn't happened yet. Maybe it has and it's ethereum. No way to be certain in advance.

Touche! I guess that means it's actually more likely to be loaded than not.

I am bullish on bitcoin, but its a volatile investment. Rather than dropping in a large lump sum all at once, I would recommend dollar cost averaging in overtime. Maybe buy ~€200 per week for the next few months for example.
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:40:38
Yeah its pretty far fetched that a mother would buy a bitcoin. I don't know why I thought you would fall for it. Plus how do we know I even *have* a mother? It just doesn't add up.

There is literally [only one]( loaded 1000btc Casascius coin in the world. I suspect this isn't it.  
Edit: As pointed out by u/bitgo_ben above, I erred in my reading of the site I linked to, which actually says there are more unopened (3) coins than opened (2), fully negating my original argument. :P
