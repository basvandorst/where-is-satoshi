You'll like this documentary from 2010: [The Corporation Nation](
Edit: it explains how the United States were incorporated. So you're not actually a citizen of the USA, but the US. The president is the president of a corporation, which is located in Washington DC, thus foreign to the USA. Making everyone as a legal person essentially a slave of United States, making all State laws irrelevant.
Yes, it works the same in Europe. For example the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Netherlands as a corporation. Too much to explain, watch it!

That's the point. The military and police (order followers) make all government violence possible. They are ultimately the ones perpetrating evil, not politicians (sure, they carry responsibility too). Soldier in Iraq killed innocent people, not politicians. Soldiers conquered half of Europe in WW2, not Hitler. "Support the troops, not the war" probably sounds familiar, just think about how ridiculous this is considering the troops CAUSE the wars.


The rest of the world is absolutely fucked in this regard, as Americans have more than enough weapons to defend themselves. And I'm pretty sure you're still toast when 150 armed guys invade your home, if they're not police in the first place. Nobody can EVER guarantee your safety.
There is no excuse for government violence. It is always based in violence against the innocent. It is always slavery.

Meanwhile, the masses still think their fiat currency has a store of value.

Smart contracts. There's always going to be rich people, or organisations who'd loan their BTC or other crypto for a small profit. The difference being they can't create 'money' out of thin air.

As long as people still want to exchange BTC to fiat currency, there's only weak men creating hard times.

The idea is to make the banks go out of business... They're just baiting the useful idiots (average joe with his undying trust). Apparently, commenters here don't really get it.

Not trying to sound like some defeatist here, but realistically the ignorant masses will buy into this with their undying trust in mainstream... Everything.

As long as people keep measuring its value with fiat currency, using BTC won't be any different from the fiat empire system.

Democracy = giving everyone the right to take your rights away, rather than no one.
@_date: 2019-04-28 17:25:48
That's a good start. The only problem is that they're converting it to USD (which is inflated/printable)... What about taxes?
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:30:10
"Oh no, now the government's gone nobody can build the roads anymore!!!"
- You in a future anarchist society.
I'll explain this real simple. Tax is a form of slavery. It's a claim of ownership over your body. You don't have a choice to pay it or not; it's not voluntary but by force. Not even force, violence. You pay tax under the threat of violence, i.e. extortion.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:02:01
Anarchy is not an end, it's a beginning for something new. Anarchy does not mean chaos, which is what you're implying. It simply means 'no rulers'.
Your petty excuse for slavery does not justify slavery. What you describe as society may as well be a people farm under the racketeering scheme we call government.
Why are you even into cryptocurrency? So you can help to build a digital prison so more people can be extorted but now they can't escape from it? As long as you advocate violence, there will never be a society without slavery. Period.
Do I imply that all of a sudden government should go away? Maybe not, society would crumble down if it were to happen right now because people are desperately dependent on daddy and mommy government. They're dumbed down.
It'll be a long process and hard work (including me), but certainly not impossible if you're willing to educate yourself and change yourself, then others.
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:33:47
The idea is that corporations like MasterCard go out of business lol.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:07:07
So you're implying you can't collaborate with other people without government and/or taxes? What about just doing something simply because it's the right thing to do for your fellow men and women?
It doesn't matter what your excuse is, violence and extortion can not be justified. Not even by people who claim they have because they've written something they call the 'law' on paper.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:56:16
And such a thing could totally happen. Just not with violence, but voluntarism.
@_date: 2019-04-14 14:56:15
You can help by giving up statism for a first. All the possibilities will come after that!

I think the masses ain't gonna be interested as long as bitcoin stays under $20k. They're still 'scared' from the last drop.
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:30:09
Probably because that's the essence of democracy
In most (western) countries, we visit the poll booth once in 4 years to choose our master(s). So a select few people can take away your rights.
Don't like it? Too bad, you chose to give away your power.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:32:25


Private corporations or small governmental units, just like any tribe-like society would do. Let's call them small villages for convenience' sake. You have a small unit of governance who can make such decisions, only they don't have the ability to send their dogs (police and military) and they're fully transparent in what they're doing.
What about food? Permaculture.
I highly recommend you look up a short series called 'Paradise stolen' by Stefan Verstappen on YouTube. The part in which he explains the myth of efficiency to be precise. For insight on true anarchy and how it works: Larken Rose and Mark Passio.
And again, you can only change the world by changing yourself first.
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:41:47
...except a thing like Bitcoin Futures exists, where people can "trade" Bitcoin without sending actual Bitcoin. Since the masses usually choose the oh-so convenient and safe banks over freedom... Well we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:24:50
Yep, the masses are gonna fall for this.
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:26:37
Because they want to confiscate your property.
