It's always the right time to buy really. Bitcoin is going up.

Die? Why? It's still the best, the most tested, the most reliable and respected cryptocurrency.

Many people here take themselves too seriously. There is literally no real world consequence of writing correct or incorrect stuff on reddit. 
Thats why all the strong emotions here are a tragicomic waste.

It's not "malicious" malicious. It's mostly just kids playing.

There is a lot of talk of decentralised exchanges. They would make the exchanges we have now obsolete.

Still, it could be done. I see no reason why it couldnt. I mean im not IT-crypto-banking expert.
A completely decentralized exchange, with fiat, with btc and all the rest. You could send fiat by small wire transfers to various private accounts and get crypto you buy from another source. Its possible to package this into simple enough software for regular people to use. 
The problem is that people would be far less interested in crypto if it was de-facto forbidden.

True. There is no easy way.

Nobody wants to know what it is and how it works. We want it to work and be reliable.

I'm not speaking for myself. I'm actually extremely curious and constantly read about related technology, trading and trends. But unless cryptocurrencies become ubiquitous without expecting users to be bothered to know how they work, they are set to fail. 
Also: Sometimes sheep think they are the wolf lol.

True, nothing that hasn't happened in the last 4 years can ever happen ever. Good one.
