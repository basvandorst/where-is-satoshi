If it were possible to lock these coins, how long do you think such a decision would take?  Because unless every transaction is approved by them in real time (bitcoin becomes centralized), it will be a slow process.  And within that time, they probably would have done several rounds of coinjoin mixing - and at that point, there is no clear cut method of determining which coins belong to whom.  and with confidential transactions coming combined with coinjoin mixing, it will be pretty much impossible to trace since amounts of bitcoin are hidden.  


That is probably mostly true *today*, but with the development of side-chains, lightening network, and atomic cross chain transactions, quick and trust-less on chain methods of exchanging between assets and other blockchains will be possible (no ID needed).  The ecosystem seems very determined to make all these things a reality.  They are actively developing tools to prevent any possible emergence of any institutions that can effectively implement any blacklisting in order to protect bitcoin.

But it would absolutely affect normal everyday use.  If, as you say, every transaction does not need to be blessed by them, then the hacker, immediately after he steals the 20,000 coins, can spend them immediately.  (keep in mind, a theif could take the 20,000 coins and VERY EASILY make them look like 1000 20btc transactions - making them not "look suspicious").  By the time a "wise decision" is made, the hacker could have already withdrew tons of cash from many bitcoin ATMs and traded a ton of bitcoin for monero or dashcoin. So by the time a wise decision is made, all the bitcoins would be gone (and the hacker would absolutely do this if such an organization existed that can reverse his transactions).  Therefore, such a foundation would need to have every single transaction be approved by them in real time (very centralized) to catch thieves, which will affect normal everyday use since now you have to do KYC/AML on every single bitcoin transaction.  If anyone wanted such a system, why not just use paypal?

Actually, cash is still fungible even if it was used illegally. Here's a good example illustrating this: 
What you are proposing would require fundamental changes to the bitcoin protocol, since right now, transactions can't be reversed by miners, especially after they have been confirmed by the miners. If transactions can be reversed, it does away with bitcoins immutability (another very important key characteristic of bitcoin).  If such a change was implemented, it would wipe out peoples faith in bitcoin and we would see it quickly collapse.
And again, what makes a particular bitcoin "suspicious"? And how can you "verify" owners of bitcoin addresses? Because if a thief is involved, he can easily produce the same private key to "prove" he is the legitimate owner as well.  Where would these hearings take place?
If you survey the people who heavily influence bitcoin, you'll find that they overwhelmingly believe that blacklisting is a bad idea since it ruins bitcoin's fungibility (a key feature required of cash systems).  Which is why bitcoin developers are very actively developing bitcoin transaction types that are much more private (
Your idea just wouldn't fly in bitcoin land.  I would say that the overwhelming majority became seriously interested in bitcoin because it does away with financial institutions and governments being involved in money.  Trying to implement such a system that involves a foundation blessing every transaction and having "public hearing rooms" is very antithetical to the ethos of bitcoin.

I hope the miners realize this... they'll be hurting the goose that lays their golden eggs.
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:15:51
Everything you suggested goes against what bitcoin is supposed to be: a globally decentralized cash system that has no reliance on any institution or foundation.  Read the first sentence of the bitcoin whitepaper:   
To have such a foundation playing a large role would centralize bitcoin into a small group of people that can impose their will on others.  If they don't like wikileaks, they could intervene with my bitcoin donation to them.  If you tried to by marijuana with bitcoin, they might block it - even though maybe it was legal.  basically, this foundation will act as a middleman to every transaction.   And a cash system inherently does not have identity tied in.  
I don't think it would even be feasible to pull off.  First, what exactly makes an address "suspicious"? to many people, ALL bitcoin transaction are suspicious.  also, if you start blacklisting certain coins and not others, it ruins fungibility, which is key to how money is supposed to work (

What is more likely to happen in practice is that the bitcoin ecosystem immediately rejects any notion of anything resembling a "BCI".  After all, it already exists: it's called paypal.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:42:45
Even if it is like gold, it isn't the job of the entire gold industry to get involved with securing every single person's gold against theft.  It is the owner's job to secure their own gold/bitcoin or get insurance if desired. If BCI starts playing such a large central role in bitcoin and can effectively reverse transactions, Bitcoin ends up becoming a system custodial accounts - it immediately starts becoming more like paypal and less like gold.  It would be much more feasible to have a BCI that is opt in only - by people giving them keys to their multisig bitcoin wallets so that they have to sign off on every transaction.

I appreciate Erik's efforts to try and keep the community together.  but I am not sure if doing both together is what's prudent, afterall, what is a safe blocksize *for now*?  I've read estimates from testing suggest 4mb is most likely safe.  With segwit ALONE, we are probably going to be dealing with blocks 2-3mb in size, possibly up to 4mb.  Since we are already going to be pushing it with just Segwit, it doesn't make sense to tie it to another change that can push it above 4mb.  The smart thing to do is to first see how well the network operates with a 2-3 fold increase in work load from segwit alone.  If the network is doing well with that kind of increased load, then a further increase in blocksize should be planned.

@_date: 2016-03-03 01:05:08
looks really cool and i gave it a go, but I think the way it is set up could be improved.  It looks like single bitcoin transaction = one move. 20 cents per move is alot (plus transaction fee).  instead, if a simple payment channel was opened per person wanting to play, it would be more efficient, and each move could be worth 50 satoshi's or something.  And the transaction fee would only have to be paid when opening and closing the channel.  instead of 20 cents for 1 move, 20 cents can power 1000 moves.
@_date: 2017-02-14 17:34:47
sure, technically softforks or hardforks only need 51% mining hashpower.  But for security reasons, it should be closer to 100%.  Doublespending is a concern:

Softfork changes are not forced on users - they are backwards compatible changes that allow old nodes to keep following the rules they are familiar with.  Because of this, I don't see how network decentralization is negatively affected.  But with hardforks, the miners are forcing the users to upgrade to follow new rules (which to me seems like a much more real threat to decentralization).

Segwit is a softfork.  A softfork means that old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid. A softfork is backward-compatible, and that is what Segwit is.

I really like the concept of maidsafe, that is for sure.  I just have trouble swallowing the idea of a coin that is not using a blockchain.  The blockchain shows how we can have decentralized consensus that is immune to so many attack vectors.  To me, if you go blockchain-less, then you have opened yourself to so many ways of being attacked.  The explanation i'm seeing is that everything related to the security of SAFEcoin depends on a majority close nodes/groups.  But without a blockchain, then there isn't much to stop someone or a small group from starting up 100 million nodes to gain a majority and then double spend as much as they like.  Bitcoin is immune to this, because you don't have to rely on a majority of nodes, you only have to trust the math in the longest proof of work blockchain, even if it comes from a minority of nodes.
Hopefully I'm wrong about SAFEcoin, because i do like like the concept of MAIDSAFE.

If by broken you mean totally unusable, then I doubt anyone would stay.  But if it is still usable, then some people might not consider it broken.

No way, too risky. Hardforking always runs the risk of splitting the blockchain into 2, such as eth and ethclassic for example.  But this would be a much bigger problem for bitcoin than ethereum because bitcoin gets its value from people holding it as a store of value (people having faith in the 21 million coin limit).  if the bitcoin blockchain splits into 2, then the number of total bitcoin doubles, and this will forever ruin bitcoin's status as digital gold.

I believe it is simpler than that.  RSK tokens only come into existence when bitcoin is locked in a 2 way peg.  Therefore, the supply of RSK at any given time = the number of bitcoins in the RSK 2 way peg.  People mining RSK only earn fees (they don't make new tokens).

If we assume 8mb blocks, then we can potentially see a bitcoin blockchain grow to over 1TB in just 2 years, and then 2TB in 4 years. A new user wanting to start up a new full node would very easily start hitting the data caps imposed by ISPs. Blockchain size growing too quickly (and ability to start a new node) becomes an much bigger issue with larger block sizes.
For example, a very common monthly data cap imposed by ISPs is 1TB per month. And since the user also has to use that for all home internet traffic (not just Bitcoin), then it can likely take 3 MONTHS just for initially downloading the entire blockchain (since it may be 2 TB in size at this point).
So by drastically increasing the blocksize now, you are making a decision to make it much harder for future new users to start up new nodes.  This is why the bcash roadmap isn't decentralization friendly.  It is challenging enough just to handle the bigger blocks from segwit alone.

If we are trying to fit all real world transactions directly on the bitcoin blockchain, we would need to increase it by a whole lot - most likely measured in GB, not MB
But it is theoretically possible to have bitcoin transactions that happen on a different system, such as Lightning network.  You can open a channel on lightning (1 transaction on the bitcoin blockchain), then use that to make 100s or thousands of bitcoin transactions.
So for scaling, I don't think relying ONLY on increasing the blocksize is the best idea.

You are correct, it is hard to do sub $1 payments on the blockchain directly.
Today's solution - use a centralized services (changetip, coinbase) for payments under $1 so that these transactions happen off the blockchain (avoids miner fees).  It isn't the best solution, but it doesn't have much risk assuming you only trust them to hold a small amount of bitcoin.
Future solution - Lightening network will act as a layer of bitcoin that can facilitate extremely tiny transactions in a trustless manner without paying a miner fee every time.

A blockchain is a series of blocks.  each block is a bundle of many transactions.  in bitcoin, each block is found in approx 10 mins on average and has a current max size of 1mb.  The 2.7 tps comes from the max number of transactions that can fit in a 1mb space.  So the tps is really a measure of throughput, not how long a transactions takes.  transactions happen pretty much instantly, but confirmation usually takes 10 mins.
100 people buying stuff a the same time with bitcoin will have their transactions go through at the same time and then will be bundled in the next block.

all good points.  I think the feasibility of my half baked ideas come down to what their micro payments network offers that the regular bitcoin network doesn't.  if it allows 100% free, instant transfer and instant confirmation of bits and colored satoshis, it would be doing something that the bitcoin network can't do today.  But unfortunately, there isn't much info about 21's micropayment network.
The 21 computer might make it easier to rent out a small farm of hard drives.  The 21 computer can be the computer that manages the farm and coordinates resources and monitors payments.
there might be some merit to having such a device embedded in a drone.  When the drone is out doing stuff, it might lose access to the server - maybe the data plan it is using has bad coverage or loses signal for some other reason.  If that proves to be a problem, it is better to have the device locally on the drone so that it can locally negotiate and pay for nearby wifi spots to regain access to the server.

storing it such that only you hold the private key - there are plenty of options.  Going from least secure to most secure:
1. using a wallet on your computer.  electrum is a solid choice.
2. Using an app on your phone.  Airbitz and mycelium are very good choices.
3. storing it on a hardware wallet.  these wallets cost extra.
4. paper wallet.  it gets a little technical, but there are good guides that i can link if you wish.
If you are just starting out, i would recommend starting with an app like airbitz or mycelium for holding your coins.  You can move them later to a more secure option later.
If you are in the US, the easiest way to buy bitcoin is coinbase or circle.  These services can also hold your coins, but you don't have absolute control over them.  these companies basically act as banks for your coins if you choose to use them to hold your coins.

There are a few.  Whenever they update their system, you lose access to your coins when the system is down for maintenance.  if they are hacked, the could lose YOUR coins (they claim to be insured incase this happens).  You might accidentally set the currency setting to dollars, and which point, your bitcoins will be converted to dollars.  If they suspect any suspicious activity, they might block access to your account.
But don't get me wrong, if you are new and are not comfortable holding coins yourself, keeping them in circle is a good way to start (especially if we are dealing with a few hundred dollars of bitcoin).  You can practice sending small amounts of bitcoin between circle and mycelium(where you have control of the coins).

I am not sure how this would factor in, but many internet ISPs limit monthly usage to 1 TB per month for home connections.  So I think before even discussing "cost" we should address "ability" to even run a node.

changetip might be worth looking into, though it might be for debit card only.

That guy didn't elaborate as to why it is not good for the long term, but I would say SegWit is very good for the long term because we know the ultimate solution to scaling bitcoin will need to involve secure decentralized off-chain transactions (lightning network).  SegWit enables lightning faster and more securely than anything else out there.

Brilliant talk! thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:49:50
I would suggest looking into a buying a trezor to securely store your coins. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:45:59


I am not an expert, but I am pretty sure this statement is false.  Anyone using bitcoins on a segwit address can send to ANY address.

Planning a hardfork would require a much longer activation period to ensure it is done safely. So SegWit is faster because we can have it activated within a few weeks.

less than that even:

don't risk any significant amount of money - it is a pure gamble.

I believe that is the machine you used.  There is a support number and email you might want to try.

I believe Raoul Pal has been bullish on bitcoin for a while now.

the victims of the onecoin scam are paying for it.

I guess hodl and receive dividends? I'm not sure when that will start happening. I'm waiting to see when an exchange will start trading them.

Not sure if that website has the ability to do that many transactions so quick.  But if it did work and you paid the necessary fees for each transaction, then it should appear immediately and then get confirmed in the next block in about 10 mins.
If you are trying to send bitcoin to 250 addresses, it is possible to do it in a single transaction.
@_date: 2016-07-08 23:52:10
i still see it happen.  mostly when a miner finds a block quickly they will push it out without including any transactions.
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:37:39
Seems like you only imported an address into electrum rather than the private key.  So if you have the private key, your funds should be safe and you can recover them.  Unfortunately, I don't have much experience with armory.  but I am sure others here do.

for me, to withdraw btc from poloniex, the fee always seems to be 0.0001btc, which is about 7 cents.
@_date: 2019-05-28 11:40:15
If that were the case, I don't think it would really matter. Whatever new features get developed on a new coin can just be ported back to bitcoin (through sidechains or other second layer tech).
@_date: 2016-07-16 23:15:41
maybe try colu.com - the mycelium wallet company has used them to issue shares recently.  seems to work well.
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:20:22
circle or coinbase. she can receive bitcoin payment to instantly show up as dollars.  she can then link either to her bank account.
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:56:04
@_date: 2016-07-28 20:10:13
no problem! let me know if you have any questions!
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:43:29
Doesn't seem to be an option unfortunately.  The point of a trezor is keeping a large amount of bitcoin in a secure manner.  I would say go ahead and buy $100-$150 worth of bitcoin and use that to buy the trezor.  For that amount, you can use a wallet app such as mycelium.
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:26:00
I've used coinbase to buy a VPN directly before.  didn't have any problems.
@_date: 2019-05-25 18:54:50
actually, it costs 20 ripple xrps before you can even start doing any transactions - so it is actually cheaper to set up a bitcoin lightning wallet. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 20:11:44
did the atm give you a receipt? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:51:30
I use trezor and I love it!  I recommend ordering one directly from them: 
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:06:20
I really hope we can hold off on this particular hardfork.  I think it would be much smarter to wait a little bit to be able to include other things from the hardfork [wishlist](
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:32:58
depends on how many transactions (inputs) it took to create your transaction.  if your balance of 4 bitcoins was obtained by getting many transactions, say, one thousand 0.004btc transactions, then it will be a very large transactions size when those inputs get put together for a 4btc transaction.  hopefully this made some sense.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:55:37


Your transaction is very large in size, so it would make sense that the fee is 4-6x larger than average sized transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:42:49
initially, yes.  but that could change if/when a hardfork happens (the 2x portion).
