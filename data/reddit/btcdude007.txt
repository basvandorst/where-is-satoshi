You could wait till Overstock comes out with their Bitcoin policy. They'll also have to deal with refunds...

why don't you guys buy bitcoin on an exchange and sell it to the buyers, acting as agent...? Then the issue of finding sellers is gone.

What I am most impressed with is, how they managed to get the "gemini.com" domain? I wouldn't be surprised if the resale value of a domain name like this is in the multi-millions...

Same here. No email or any other communication/warning. I happened to login to Coinbase and saw this...
"Unfortunately we have had to close your Coinbase account. Before your account can be closed, you will need to withdraw your bitcoin to an external wallet and any other funds to an attached bank account. Please be sure to delete any references to bitcoin addresses generated by Coinbase, as bitcoin sent to those addresses will not be retrievable once the account is closed. If you have any questions you may contact us at support

I don't think it is just an issue of double spend. A more frequent problem would be a transaction that never confirms because it has insufficient or no transaction fee.

I have a Chase checking account linked to Coinbase and have had a couple of sells on coinbase deposited into chase without problem.
