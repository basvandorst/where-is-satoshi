I remember I had a wiffle bat and ball as a kid.

No, even if everyone uses perfect random number generation it IS possible to get a duplicate private key.  It's just extremely unlikely.

You can look at any address and tell how many bitcoins are in it.
But anyone can have as many addresses as they want and names are not tied to addresses.
So while you may know that 0.01145 bitcoins are in address 166MYmqUZWYRX4w77EyZ6XtFzM4KDdrzjP, you don't know who owns that address.

Some wrong answers in this thread.
Yes, it is possible to generate a private key/address that someone else previously generated.
No, assuming someone generated a random number between 1 and 2^160 it has never happened.  The odds are so astronomically stacked against it that it will likely never happen during the lifetime of the universe.  That's the power of huge numbers.
Now if someone didn't choose a good random number for their private key (for example, just typed "hunter2" or "I love bitcoin!" into a brain wallet app), someone else has likely created the same address and is monitoring the blockchain at this very moment just waiting for bitcoins to show up in that address.

PETA, basically you have just revealed yourself as untrustworthy.  In other words, I have no reason to believe anything you say in the future or that my vote will be honored.
Investors beware.  After this I fully expect PETA to disappear in the night taking all your future dividends with them.

We really need to start calling wallets "keychains" or something similarly less confusing than "wallets."  All new users think their bitcoins are stored in their wallets - as anyone would - and not in the blockchain.

Well, I can tell the thisApp people are not sexist.  No, not at all.

Just playing devil's advocate but I know some people are annoyed that they have to sign up to get their tip... in that regard the changetip process feels kinda "spammy."  Especially if the amount is low (50 satoshi or similar) but I know that wasn't the case here.
I know I was changetipped a tiny amount a while back, too low to withdrawal, and after going through the process of trying to collect it and learning it was too low, I figured what was even the point?

Were I not interested in the blockchain breakthrough and how Bitcoin works, this is the kind of tinfoil hat magnet-bracelet poppycock that would turn me away from Bitcoin.

Bitcoin.  Cut out the middlemen.

He did try, repeatedly.  He was getting nowhere, so decided to go public.  It seems going public worked, as usual in these situations where someone privately reports a bug and is ignored.

People often say he can't be that incompetent.
But if it quacks like a duck...

The word "wallet" is a huge misnomer and causes a lot of confusion.  A better name would be "keychain."
Wallets store the private keys to any bitcoin addresses that you control.  Having the private keys to an address is all that's needed to spend those bitcoins.
The bitcoins themselves are stored not in the wallet, but in the blockchain, a public ledger that is distributed on tens of thousands of computers all over the world.  Some wallets will have a local copy of the blockchain, some won't.
Wallets allow you to create transactions using private keys to spend bitcoins.  But they don't actually store any bitcoins.

It's simple.  Just downvote every Coindesk link posted to Reddit.

Money orders are generally pretty cheap, about $1 or less for up to $600 or whatever the limit is.  I used to use them all the time to pay bills.
At low amounts, however, the percentage can be pretty high, as in this case.

People and bot networks already have.  There are huge private rainbow tables scanning every bitcoin transaction for known addresses.
