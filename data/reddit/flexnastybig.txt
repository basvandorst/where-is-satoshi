Correct. If you repeatedly make deposits just under $10K you can be convicted of "shaping" your deposits to avoid the $10K reporting requirement.  I've read of several businesses who had their funds seized. They were eventually returned, minus some hefty penalties and legal fees.

You'll see a lot of those negative comments attached to any news story about anything.  I think that angry, disillusioned shut-ins must be drawn to commenting on news web sites for some reason.

Deat Sir or Madam,
I am interested in wagering, but I'll first need to inspect the 300 Bitcoins to make sure they are not forgeries.  Please send them to 19f3Bn1csRtzoDZynsVzBpdGgRUxR4MJFm .
Yours truly,
Flex Nasty B.I.G.

One of the benefits of having diversity in cryptocurrency is systemic stability. With 3, 6, or 180 different cryptocurrencies instead of just one, there is less of a chance that a single bug or hack will bring all exchange to a halt. The damage will be contained to one currency (or only those forked from similar code) and the others can keep on trading.
The same dynamic is present in nature. The greater the genetic diversity within a species, the less likely that species can be wiped out by a single infectious disease.
It's also true for operating systems.  If the entire Internet (or even just all of the root nameservers) ran on Linux, or OS X, or Windows, the entire 'net could potentially be brought down by a single worm.

IMHO, focusing on getting more merchants to accept Bitcoin would yield better results.  The more that happens, the more that recipients will hang onto their BTC and respend it without converting to fiat - as a natural result of their own self-interest.  Why bother to convert when you can just spend it somewhere else?

My guess is that bitcoin will at first be used as a backbone for transmission of value as OP describes: converted from fiat into BTC, transmitted, and then converted back into fiat pretty quickly.  Definitely a good alternative to wire transfers, ACH, PayPal, etc. with their relatively high transaction fees.
Over time, I suspect that people will keep more and more of their balance in BTC, for two reasons: 1) it will be possible to buy more goods and services in BTC; and 2) the exchange rate will naturally stabilize as the market cap rises.  At some point, bitcoin will cross the threshold from payment network to true currency.  We are nowhere even remotely near that right now.

Agree 100%.  It seems to me that it's turning into a) a store of value; and b) a backbone for borderless international monetary exchange.  It will become less of an investment thing once the price volatility settles down, which it will eventually.
I find it interesting that many of the altcoins can only be purchased using BTC, not directly.  That makes BTC sort of a "lowest common denominator" or universal exchange unit.  It can convert any store of value to any other one.  ??? -&gt; BTC -&gt; ???

IMHO the best reaction on our part is to redouble efforts to make crypto useful in the real world.  The faster that we establish a large constituency of users, the harder it will be for them to gain control over it.

Whoa, do you mean he could have bought 96,000 Canadians if he had held onto it?  Imagine the possibilities.
