Right now I feel like about 50 percent of the money in crypto is wealthy individuals, funds and institutions. The best thing we can do is get more people involved as individuals to decentralize the power structure. The more long term holders we get vs day traders and institutions using bots, the better off we’ll be. 
Futures are a threat the more centralized the power is. We need new blood, and lots of it. Buy it, hold it, don’t sell it.

If you have such a negative view of the technology why are you here? Not trolling, honest question.

It’s not I’m pretty sure. Think this might be fake news.

Maybe you should spend less time debating technology on the internet and more time in anger management / working on your reading comprehension. 
I’m here because I believe in the technology, which gives me a pretty obvious justification for being here.
I didn’t assume why you were here, I just asked a question, and then you responded like a smug cocksucker. 
I didn’t assign qualifying criteria to participating in the subreddit. I asked you why you were here. 
It’s a pretty legitimate question too, because if I was so sure the tech was worthless, I’d be spending every waking hour working to make more money to throw on shorting bitcoin - not picking fights on the internet. 
Tldr? Go fuck yourself, nerd. Nobody gives a shit about debating you.
