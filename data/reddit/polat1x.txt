According to the mtgox dump you had around 0.20 usd and no btc in there when it collapsed.
... Just some more pieces of the puzzle

Wtf. 3 hrs... I quit listening as he starts to advertise goldmoney in his monologue. That's just a gold storage service with an app that allows payments - digitally in gold.
Yeah. Changing some values in a centralized ledger is a real breakthrough.

1) "even more scarce" not true.
"More scarcity" would be a reduction of the total available amount.
In contrast bitcoin: just the addition of new coins released per timeframe is shrinking.
In other words: more coins / less scarcity as time runs, but less more coins compared to now

Bitcoin doesn't work like a bank account.
There are no accounts.
In short: Your wallet derives private keys from a mnemonic seed (+passphrase).
From the private keys public keys are calculated.
The public keys then get double hashed and shortened for human readability. Thats the address.
It's practically not possible to calculate the private key back from the public key, and of course not from the address.
But you need the private key to sign a transaction to send somebody coins.
So never tell anybody your private key.
But it's safe to tell somebody your address.
Bitcoin is a push system, not a pull system.

A private key is not a password to "a wallet".
A wallet is a software that in the early days holds private keys.
But thats not true either anymore.
Now the wallet just holds the mnemonic phrase / the master private key and derives the private key(s) from it when it needs them (when you sign a transaction)
