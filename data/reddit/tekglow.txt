over here in canada, when i went to my bank to wire transfer 20k to kraken , i needed a representative and she helped me do it and was super mesmerized about 20k and bitcoins , asked a bunch of questions and was super nice and wanted to know more. i told her a year ago buy bitcoin now and ull be rich , hope she did cause she was cute ,  she was about 25 y old and thats prolly why.  old ppl dont like change. new generation is open to these things.

each country has their rules i guess.
up here in canada ,  they will call you, call you, call you, send you letters please pay.  then sell your debt to collectors that will call you, call you, call you . then give up. and fuck off.
few years after your good to go all new . no debt.
nothing happens , i know from experience.

Lasting dent? like mtgox? were at all time high. any new blood has no idea of btc's past .  this bip148 bs might fuck it up for a month or 2 ,   " might " but no one will remember any of it after a while. everyone will be gawking at the moon
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:11:58
same ,  i asked the guy working at the gas station yesterday if he knew what bitcoin was , he said  " never heard of it "  , 22~y old  in canada.
