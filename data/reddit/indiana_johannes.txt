do you have any numbers on this? on how bankers control the economy? or any research at all? I'm curious to read about it because not all the richest folks are bankers.

appreciate the insight. I agree with you.


but this isn't true. It will not really be usable underground when banned like I explained in my OP. It's impossible to have a self sufficient closed economy of illegal stuff.

so banning bitcoin will work to the intended effect that some countries want.
I've heard people argue that banning bitcoins is useless because people will use it anyway, but I'm just arguing that it will indeed come down.
I hope I understood you correctly. Why did you say this "Remember this, the whole world will never ban bitcoin at the same time." ? :)

now why are you accusing me of someone who likes to organize terror? where did you get that from? Your deduction skills intrigue me.


Why is it hard to hide bitcoins? Most politicians where I live hide money in cash. Bitcoins are a haven to them.

you're right, I haven't. do you know of any notorious famous cases?

hmm, I didn't know about this. can you explain how this works? do bankers pay politicians and initiate war to their favor?

sorry sir

you clearly didn't read my post. Ease of transaction is important. Paying someone with a truckload of bananas is conspicuous which is certainly not the way for terrorists. Not sure what your argument is. I argued about cash and you're bringing in bananas. Tell me something realistic, then I'll agree.

true, but even if it's illegal in just one country, using it there will be exponentially harder because sending it to countries outside only will limit the potential for usage for a bad dude.
