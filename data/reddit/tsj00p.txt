Yes. Christmas is coming and people need money to buy christmas presents and all the hoopla. Combined with the fundamentals means there is bound to be some cashing out soon.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:30:19
Estimating the top is always the hardest. But yeah, if bitcoin crashes below 2k they still won.

But I don't want fractions, I want a full one. Human psychology and etc.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:39:34
It's to accommodate all the people cashing out their BTC profits in USD. They are actually helping inflation and hence helping the BTC price to go up through devaluation of the USD. It's funny.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:02:20
They just watch football for the nicely shaped guys they will see. Their husband looks like a bag of potatoes sitting at home watching the BTC price all the time.

A chain store with multiple floors... That would make it a block-chain store. Funny guys those Japaneseys.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:32:45
But why would Christmas bring Bitcoin more exposure? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:59:02
Common sense would say its not particularly bright to buy at all-time highs like these due to mass media exposure. Also, christmas is around the corner and common sense would also say people are going to take some money off the bitcoin table to buy their christmas stuff. I would wait a few weeks to see what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:47:35
Stay delusional folks. Don't come knocking on my door when all goes to shit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:06:38
Agreed. We are in a bubble leading up to Futures.

I killed all my pets when pets.com crashed.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:12:14
Exactly! It is what has inspired people to be greedy for ages. More, more, more. They won't settle for 0.00000372 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:57:31
But what happens to bitcoin if the power grid powers down due to a crashed economy? ... 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:57:55
Yeah, that's nothing. It has seen worse than that. Just look at the historic charts.
Look, I've been in this market since 2012. I've seen the agony, the bloodshed, the pain and the tears over the 2013 dip. People were screaming in the streets. It was horrible, a defeated battlefield if you will, but it had to happen. Without it, we wouldn't be where we are now. Bitcoin had an immense rally back in 2013 just before all this happened, kind of similar to our current situation. 
It is not sustainable, things have to correct. I don't want to crush your bubble, but that's just the way this cookie crumbles.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:14:40
And you people dont think thats a bit weird? I bet it's institutional investors buying in so they can crash the price later.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:42:34
I wouldn't say it "won't happen anymore", that's delusional. Growth always takes place in wave patterns and we actually need the dips to return stronger. You can see it has a hard time to get to 12K at the current moment, its kind of topping off. It has to go down first to gather more momentum.
We have seen immense growth over the last 16-17 days. Only 16-17 days ago BTC was still trading in the $6000 range. You think almost a 2x at this price-range in such short time is sustainable over the longer term?
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:59:24
Oh yeah, it might work both ways. Or even both might happen; a dip leading up to christmas due to people cashing out, and a surge in price right after christmas due to new people coming in. But indeed, all speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:55:36
Let's break 11k folks, we can do it! We all sell together! :)
EDIT: Woops, it's already broken! 10k next. :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:05:43
Kind of. Just like with fiat money actually. If the trust in a currency is gone, theres a problem. With bitcoin this problem might be more apparent though, because it is based on technology and technology gets outdated fast.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:29:48
That's how it all went wrong in the first place with the traditional financial system, right?
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:26:48
A few hundreds up or down can hardly be called a dip. That's just normal volatility. I'm talking about the 40%+ pullback kind of dips. We haven't had these since a long time. I would say we are due for one when a whale starts playing around soon and all the newly joined peeps start panic selling over a sudden $1000 drop. ;)

Lower highs than before though, its just preparing for the next leg down.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:37:29
Been in the game since 2013 (remember the previous bubble pop?). You would say I would know it when a bubble pops. I pulled my investments. ;) We are gonna go deeeeeppp.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:03:53
Short-term; it's time for a dip.
Long-term; yes, and more than that.
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:46:23
Not necessarily. I never succeeded in school and failed right away. Now I still got rich with bitcoin. Don't want to scare anyone but I'm a janitor by the way.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:29:08
Well, my girl is gone since I spend all my time on watching Bitcoin price action... Is that what you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:14:06
$1000 is nothing in BTC nowadays. Let's bring on the $7K. :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:08:52
Chaincoin actually exists. The name is tainted though because it has been one of the most elaborate pump and dumps in crypto history.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:41:05
Nothing. It is a free market and that's where the risks come into play.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:29:50
Look at that sell volume, wow :) Seems monday is gonna be bloody.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:07:38
Brace yourselves, crash is coming.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:23:07
I smell a dump from a few thousands away. Let me tell y'all this; it doesn't smell pretty at the current moment.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:21:28
Exactly this ^^
I saved my ass and took my profits. I would advise any sane person to do the same.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:33:38
Yup, the bubble is popping as we speak. The game is over peoples.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:48:09
I just use the green paper nowadays. Thanks to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:18:24
I heard holding it on an old harddrive and hiding it at the bottom of a garbage dump works well for some people. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:23:13
She just wants you to sell so she can buy lower. These grandma's nowadays have an investor's mindset, I tell you!
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:35:04
Seems even cryptowat.ch is stuck. Wow.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:33:41
Not even a store of value when the price can swing into the thousands on a daily basis. That's no store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:16:51
Me :) I have been predicting this.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:44:56
congrats on the 1 cent!

Sceptics help keeping delusion at a normal healthy level ;) It's for the benefit of you all.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:22:37
Its crashing as we speak :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:29:14
Unless a majority cashes out and it causes such a price drop that most people lose confidence in cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:15:38
I'm hilarious too. I once mistyped Bitcoin, ended up with Buttcoin, and thats how I have been calling it ever since.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:11:24
Lisk will make it too. Good team, good ideas, blockchain dapps based on javascript and sidechains.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:25:58
Yes, technically you are right. However, the demand will be lesser the more people have to pay for any reasonable amount of bitcoin. At $1000 I was like "Okay lets buy it". At $10000 I'm like "screw that". I know you can divide it to smaller parts but human psychology always strives to at least have a full unit of the original thing.

The running joke is that BTC crashes after the Bitcoin Uranium fork (nuclear blowup) and are left being a BUM.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:56:45
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you become a Lisk millionaire. This is how it must have went in the early days of bitcoin too. I'm hodling.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:20:46
Not just when selling. You're even supposed to pay taxes when simply changing coins, like LTC-&gt;BTC or vice versa.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:12:11
Why is that troubling? Lack of fear means a more stable market, which should be good for hodlers. Not for buyers though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:32:25
Don't be silly. Everyone is here because they dislike fiat with a passion and want a way out of the corrupt and oppressive traditional banking system. Next to that, everyone is interested in this marvellous piece of technology. Right, guys?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:21:13
To be fair; one day they will probably be right. Might be upon the apocalypse of human civilization, but they will be right. Nothing lasts forever after all. Not even Fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:57:05
It is backed by freedom. And what is freedom priced at?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:21:28
You may be right. It isn't really significantly dropping right now though. It is quite stable in the 9000s. I would say we are indeed accumulating for the next run up.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:15:34
Let me get my crystal ball... Yes, yes... you are right!
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:24:10
Would be funny if he actually received bitcoin for the clicks.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:54:26
So that's why I saw it spiking!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:38:51
Well, every user I talked to planned to pay their taxes already. Hence this should have little impact. Right guys?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:21:05
Why is that so hard to believe? The early adopters who held for a long time are laughing all the way to the bank of course.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:43:04
So who will trigger the smart contract to release the bitcoin when the person dies? Or will the person be chipped?
I wonder how this works out in practice.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:24:21
Or they just dont know any better anymore. I have talked to a lot of people who retire and dont have the faintest idea what to do (actually they get bored) because working is all they know. Its quite sad really.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:41:00
And how do you plan on cashing out 1 million unscathed? I guess that will be a tedious process with lots of vultures along the road.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:48:05
Yeah, its kinda suspicious this always seems to happen during key moments.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:30:08
I'm buying bitches with it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:17:57
I'm still waiting for a pullback to $5200.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:13:59
To hunt you down when it's time to pay taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:26:00
No. The volatility is what makes Bitcoin interesting for me. You want to turn it into a dull stockmarket?
There should be a minimum entry fee to keep out the amateurs.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:56:15
They can tax the shit out of it though or simply close and ban exchanges, meaning no one can cash out for fiat. It's in fact not easy to outright ban it, but it's very easy to make no one interested in buying it (which has pretty much the same effect when it comes to the value of bitcoin). After all, at the end of the day everyone is here for the gains. Whether you believe in the tech or not.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:59:22
 I would certainly buy bitcoin if people gave me money for it. I can't wait. There will be a massive bullrun on -$5k bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:46:11
Sell your GPU's!!
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:44:56
No, 10-11k will be a stretch soon.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:56:13
Its bullcrap. You cannot predict anything when it comes to bitcoin. Tomorrow news can come out totally smashing your TA. Theres too many influences to make TA remotely reliable.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:51:52
This would indeed work that way if governments were truly independent, but they are not. If the US or any other influential government applies a 90% tax on BTC (this will have great effect on BTC demand already), other countries will follow suit. What will be left is a worthless currency nobody wants to buy because of the tax implications.
Everyone is looking at the big players when forming opinions about bitcoin and acting accordingly. Why is China so important? We saw how important China was during their ICO banning fud. The price went through the floor. This mindset would have to change if BTC were to be a success.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:16:02
But at some point the merchants you buy these goods from need to convert to fiat because they need to pay their rent or taxes. Also you as a person need to pay your rent and taxes and the accepted currency to pay that is fiat. So... there you go. Thats the moment you will bleed if they tax the shit out of this conversion or if its simply not possible because theres no crypto to fiat gateway.
It is only going to work if we can pay our rent and tax in crypto, and thats not going to happen if the government doesnt want it as most of these (tax, rent) organizations are controlled by them. Some people fail to understand this.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:57:01
Probably, they will be back later. They are now enjoying  their gains if they did it right.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:32:51
Problem is, when you're high you forget about the limitations of everything. It's because of this reason trippers jump from the balcony thinking they can fly and finding out rather quickly they cannot.
The only thing bitcoin showed is that it has great scalability issues and great difficulty in reaching consensus about how to tackle that (or any) problem. And scalability is just one of the problems to tackle. There's great hurdles to take if you're looking at things with a clear mind.
It's not all singing butterflies and purple waterfalls in bitcoinland, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:01:37
True this, i know people with 8 bitcoins who dont even know how to send it to another address. Let alone secure it.
