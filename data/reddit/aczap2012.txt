Redditor for 3 days... Really should be doing something else with your life rather than trolling to get those Lambos.

Seriously why is this such an ordeal 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:58:37
It’s all relative - raw number fluctuations don’t matter, non-dimensional fluctuation percentages are what matter. Bigger fluctuations with this bigger value of BTC are relative to smaller fluctuations with a smaller value of BTC.

Probably better to look at % of GDP adjusted for inflation

Bitcoiner here. GTFO of here with the Deep State lol. As a defense contractor, this is way overplayed by the MAGAts. Simply not true. Disappointing to see that on this subreddit.

I hope this isn't a dumb question but... Where do you look at sales on the exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:34:05
My point still stands lol

I've literally been waiting for it to go back to $1k since May... I bought 1.27BTC in April for around $1.1k and got scared and sold during a dip in May at around $2.3k... I kept saying "I'm just waiting for the bubble to burst to get back in" - well it hit $11k today so

I was trying to get in at $9.3k, but it kept freezing on Coinbase. At least I got another $100 in at $9.8k.

It won't go that low.

I used to think the same - just think of Bitcoin as virtual gold. Gold probably has a market cap of around ~$7.7T, where if I recall, Bitcoin is in the $30B's total (someone can challenge me since I read this earlier and don't feel like finding the link again). Seems realistic to me that Bitcoin can reach 5% of the gold market (probably more but I'm just being conservative), which would put it at a market cap of ~$385B, and with about 16.5M Bitcoins in circulation, that would put Bitcoin at a potential price of $23333.33/BTC - IF it reached 5% of the gold market share. Not predicting this, just explaining my logic for why I feel this price isn't unreasonable YET.

Same - tried to get my parents to buy me some for Christmas in 2014 when I was a broke college student and my Dad basically gave me the middle finger lol.
