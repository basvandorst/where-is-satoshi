you don't get it.  You're looking at bitcoin itself, not future companies that provide services based on bitcoin.  There will be non-US dollar companies built on bitcoin that will offer anything a bank can (loans, interest, mortgages, savings accounts, etc).  People hate banks and want out, the options are coming (next 10yrs imo) and they'll be bitcoin based.

I obtained $50 BTC today so it's my fault.  They call me "The BTC Cooler".  In fact, if anyone here wishes the price to plummet then send bitcoin to me: 1MUamV1DB1Sfpn8Ak2gBnmpBgxiJf7R63Q  I estimate $10 price drop for every $50 BTC I receive.

from apple support chat just now:  
  
Alright well in relation to purchasing with Bitcoin; here in Technical Support we do not have a timeframe for if/when that would be possible on Apple.com.
However, I do suggest contacting our Sales Team directly as they may be able to shed more light on such a subject.
They can be reached during business hours at 0800-MY-APPLE (0800 692 7753).

This is an old spam, I have seen it before word for word.  They are just using a bitcoin slant.

If they did this Bitcoin would explode.  Within months Bitcoin would be the new world reserve currency.  All Americans would switch to Bitcoin, likely riot in the streets and burn down any financial institution they could find.  Bring it on.

It sounds to me bitcoin could be tailored to offer everything a bank does.  Could coinbase, bitpay, circle and others not eventually offer banking services?

Superb pre-emptive move by GPN!  They just beat Visa &amp; Paypal to the punch.  Sure Visa &amp; Paypal will integrate but now GPN is first to market with integration and that is always a plus imo.

This is why I so want Bitcoin to prevail.  My biz relies on Paypal, there really is no other option for me.  I HATE using them.  It will be a good day for all when something takes them down and provides us all a better solution.

Can someone eli5 the point to this?  Why would I accept Bitcoin via Paypal when Paypal charges ridiculous fees?  Are Paypal going to waive the Bitcoin fees?

These limitations will be completely wiped out due to exponential growth in technology.  For example optical exabyte storage systems that can access data near instantaneously.  What about processing power?  Try 100's of millions of 32 core smartphones with exabyte storage running full nodes.  This is not science fiction and not far off.

They're "not thinking about it today".  LMAO, I've worked at companies like this.  I can assure you they have an entire team devoted to this.  I would even suspect they are having "war room" meetings.  These guys know what is coming and are scared shitless.  They sell horse carriages and bitcoin is the hover car.  There is no escape for them, I call it violent obsolescence.

10yrs is my target for this as well.  I'm really scraping hard to buy as much bitcoin as I can in the next 12 months.  Every time I obtain another coin I feel like my future self in 2025 just made another $500k :)  I can even hear him "thanks dude! don't stop!!"

Why do these MSM bitcoin articles/videos always make bitcoin look the same as cheap phone card services that you buy at the 7-11?  They always make bitcoin appear almost cartoonish. Then again, I selfishly need bitcoin to remain at $600 for at least one more year so, yeah ok.. make it look like silly money.  Shhhh... Bitcoin mysterious and scary! do not buy! (((yet)))

US dollar isn't even backed by gold any more.  Ft. Knox is empty and Senators wanting to visit have been blocked.  No one has examined the gold reserve for decades.  Best advice, liquidate all your US assets, put it in bitcoin and get the hell out of there.  The house of cards is coming down.
@_date: 2014-08-16 01:13:22
Don't feel bad, they call me the "BTC Cooler", you want it to dip then send me BTC.  I can guarantee for every $50 in BTC I get price will drop 2-3%

That's a bit conservative.  As of now Bitcoin is about to go vertical for the first time.  That puts us at 10k by Sept., so xmas will be around 70-75k min.

I love how people always harp on about "don't invest what you can't afford to lose".  Where would half the world's successful people be if they followed this mantra?

@_date: 2014-08-16 01:26:22
My view is that Bitcoin WILL without doubt, I mean zero doubt imo hit 1% of total global transactions within 10yrs.  Therefore I will buy whether it's $300 or $3,000.  It just doesn't matter to me what current price is.  Even if it were $10,000 a coin, so what.. It's be $500k a coin in 10-15 years.  In 30yrs time it will be rare for any single person to own an entire Bitcoin.  You'll hear talk like, "I heard John has a Bitcoin." "Bullshit, no one has a Bitcoin" "Seriously the dude has a Bitcoin, his father gave it to him when he turned 30" "Holy shit!  Lucky son of a bitch!" "Yeah, he just bought a place in the Hamptons for like 50mBTC and I hear he gets like 10mBTC a month from BTCjam"

I'm in NZ and regularly use localbitcoins.com with good success.  I grabbed $100 in bitcoin a couple days ago and it literally took about 15mins all up.  The guy was online, I bank transferred direct to him, he validated and released the btc.  In the earlier days NZ sellers on localbitcoins were gouging the price big time, but now there are a few sellers genuinely trading fair prices in an effort to support the btc movement in NZ.

I believe you are then considered a "US Person" by all financial institutions (globally as well).  Once back in Canada you will need file and pay US taxes on your Canadian income.  If you are married to a canadian they too could have all of their personal data handed over to the IRS.  Failure to file FBARS and taxes perfectly can result in $100,000 of dollars in fines.  I would research things heavily..
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:50:32
You're funny..  
Bitcoin is currently able (with a couple of simple optimizations that are prototyped but not merged yet) to perform around 8000 signature verifications per second on an quad core Intel Core i7-2670QM 2.2Ghz processor. The average number of inputs per transaction is around 2, so we must halve the rate. This means 4000 tps is easily achievable CPU-wise with a single fairly mainstream CPU.
As we can see, this means as long as Bitcoin nodes are allowed to max out at least 4 cores of the machines they run on, we will not run out of CPU capacity for signature checking unless Bitcoin is handling 100 times as much traffic as PayPal. As of late 2012 the network is handling 0.5 transactions/second, so even assuming enormous growth in popularity we will not reach this level for a long time.
Of course Bitcoin does other things beyond signature checking, most obviously, managing the database. We use LevelDB which does the bulk of the heavy lifting on a separate thread, and is capable of very high read/write loads. Overall Bitcoin's CPU usage is dominated by ECDSA.
