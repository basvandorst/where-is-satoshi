Fully invested?
The price isn't going to go up if more and more BTC are released meanwhile there aren't enough people using BTC. People need to make a bit of a sacrifice instead of being so greedy and expecting others to stimulate the growth of this currency.

There are several Amazon affiliates that take BTC as payment-- that alone opens up a huuuuuge market. People need to stop focusing so much on making money watching Bitcoin grow as they hoard all their BTC.

Again, I can't imagine the CIA would see a currency that isn't being taxed by the US government and just be like "ahh, let's NOT tell them about a group of people we know aren't paying taxes!".
Policies and sectors are one thing, but illegality is another and I'm sure they see this as illegal in some way.

I own a computer business. You're saying if I had bought all my startup equipment at a physical store I should pay taxes, but because I ordered it all online I shouldn't have to pay the several thousand dollars in taxes I would have paid if I had bought it from a physical store?
There are SO many things that can be bought on both the internet and in person-- you're creating a double standard to support your argument.
@_date: 2011-06-18 14:23:23
No, I mean spending BTC on products and services directly without a middleman like Amazon affiliates. I've done this several times already with no problems whatsoever. Currently I'm having a website built for my small business and I have an agreement with the web designer that I will pay him in BTC to the equivalent of an agreed USD amount.

Sure, I get that argument but at the same time I wouldn't consider it risky. I've made 285% profit in almost two weeks-- if I see it drop 50%, I can still pull out with a cool 235% profit. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that this is a bubble but I keep track of hourly (sometimes 15 minute) rates to makes sure I know when to sell and how much to sell.

Sorry, didn't mean to sound like a dick in my past post.
Anyways, I understand what you're saying however the point I'm trying to make is that although it isn't necessarily the responsibility of the CIA to deal with tax dodgers, I do believe they would most certainly rely any information to the US gov't about tax dodgers.
As for people discussing the fact that we don't pay taxes for currency exchange-- you do pay taxes on ROI during stocks, so I'm just saying there would seem to be some relation between that and BTC.
Again, sorry for sounding like a dick earlier.

Don't get me wrong-- this method is geared towards tech savvy people who either have a spare computer they can use for this, have a dedicated mining rig like myself, or the $$$ to buy a seperate machine.
As for the general public... We **need** to make a more user friendly method of security for them because we can bitch and whine about how lazy they are, but the reality is that they won't change in that sense, and we do have to work with that.

@_date: 2011-04-21 07:22:30
That's the thing-- if someone legitimately doesn't have the time to fully understand it, then it's risky for them to put money into it. If someone has a superficial understanding of it, again it's too risky to invest money in.
So unless one is willing to take the time to properly understand (well worth it IMO) the concept of BTC, it simply is a risk to show them such a potentially lucrative and understandably tempting venture that could potentially bankrupt them if they are neglectful. To me it's the same reason why I would choose not to teach kids poker with real money.

VMs are still arguable less secure than an isolated physical machine.
@_date: 2011-06-06 01:01:02
**No**. 
Here's why:
Over time, more and more illegal anonymous drug markets will inevitably pop up. There is no need to "test" the stability of these markets by purposely poisoning them with the unnecessary involvement of law enforcement because your own personal ideology suggests this is a good thing in the long run. You are
1) Scaring off *trusted* people of that marketplace, because they're taking the biggest risk
2) Disrupting a marketplace with many customers
3) Assuming that creating another drug market as unbelievably complex, well established and well trusted as Silk Road would be easy. 
If you knew the true level of depth Silk Road has in terms of secrecy between it's trusted vendors and distributors, you would be appalled at what's going on right now.
**It is wrong** for you to use Silk Road as a test project to gauge the longevity of illegal anonymous drug markets for the future and think it's okay. 
**You are not** a Silk Road customer. Silk Road customers quietly go about their business, and know not to rock the boat to prevent fiascos like this.
**You are being *very* inconsiderate** by assuming it's okay to essentially expose an operation that will likely lead to chains of people being jailed, in the name of your own "testing".
I'm sorry if I came across as rude-- I truly didn't mean it. This issue just really rubs me the wrong way because normally I'm very anti-government, but in this case they're merely doing their job while people act surprised and outraged despite the fact that they're the same people who are responsible for getting the governments attention on the issue by exposing it so much to the public. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 00:17:44
Bitcoin isn't an operating system, it's an rapidly growing e-currency that can be used on all three of the main operating sytems (Windows, OSX &amp; Linux).
Also, there are trojan viruses meant for OSX.
Simplification isn't always a good thing.

I've traded locally using BTC-- if explained in a short but effective manner even the most non tech-savvy person can get interested. I've bought computer parts, food (fruits, vegetables &amp; wild meat), and web design services with BTC.
I understand this isn't what people were expecting when I said I was trading BTC for products and services, but it's a start and I don't mean to put myself on an ivory tower but I'm certain the majority of BTC users are just hoarders and use the lack of internet BTC accepting vendors as a superficial excuse not to sell. Buying locally is great.
@_date: 2011-05-16 15:16:29

Not many to be honest. My method has been working for me greatly later. Why do you seem angry because I have confidence that I won't lose money? Relax, it's my money-- not yours. If I lose, I lose. I just don't think I'm going to lose.
In any case, you just seem hell bent on proving that "nobody's gonna buy once the bubble bursts so we're gonna lose". Seems pointless IMO. In the end, we'll see who sinks and who floats. Until then it's all speculation.

Not sure, but at Mt. Gox I had gotten in a conversation with one of the people that run the site in regards to donating BTC to Japan relief funds... I ended up donating some Bitcoin, he converted it to Japanese yen and donated it to reputable charity. I was weary at first, but he was very professional and didn't hesitate to provide documentation of proof for each transaction and process.
I know a lot of people don't like Mt Gox for many reasons, but this was pretty cool of that guy to do this.

Taxes on goods and services is something I think is justified. If say you were to buy some things from Amazon with BTC without taxes, I do think that should be considered tax evasion. Whether or not I think doing that anonymously is wrong... is totally another topic ;) 
Also, reddit's comment system seems to be a tad glitchy at the moment and you've been double posting quite a bit. I'd suggest opening your profile in another tab to see if your comment went through. That, or the ol' "502, it went through-- 504, submit once more!" trick.

When I went into BitCoin I was prepared to love everything I had invested, so I'm willing to tough it out. My original Bitcoin purchase felt more like buying a new videogame &amp; console than anything-- it's a great learning experience and since the stakes are high it keeps me very attentive. Excellent way to learn about 2.0 economics IMO.
@_date: 2011-06-17 15:20:58
This kind argument bothers me. We live in a such an "instant" point in time where learning how implement a *slightly* difficult but extremely important security measure on a financial account is considered "too hard".
As a complete newbie to cryptography not too long ago, I decided to take the plunge and try TrueCrypt. You know how I did it? The exact same way I learned how to do about 99% of anything I'm unsure of-- I Googled it. There are tutorials, pictures, videos, all kinds of resources.
However, I'm not saying we shouldn't make it easier because the reality is that there's nothing we can do to make people realize it's a relatively simple process-- it's far too late now.
@_date: 2011-06-18 19:04:11
Are you joking? Really? The communist argument?
Communism implies these regulations are forcibly implemented. I merely **suggested** that people should be willing to trade BTC for products/services so that the mainstream audience will pick up on it. Right now the mining difficulty is going up way too fast, there isn't enough demand so far too many BTC are being released into a market of hoarders.
@_date: 2011-06-20 16:33:36
It seems to me a lot of new people in the Bitcoin community are a bunch of people incessantly whining, who are outraged that BTC didn't rise to $10,000+ and make them overnight millionaires "like it said in the forums".
As soon as a problem occurs with ONE marketplace, you all can't handle the reality and just jump ship. OP has worded this so well I can't even really add much else.
I'd just like to address a few of the so-called "issues".
No place to spend BTC, you say? I beg to differ-- **be resourceful**. Use one week averages to buy/sell products/services with BTC. I'm paying using BTC for the following:
1. Web designer (creating my company's website)
2. Local fruit/vegetables/meat (talked to sellers about BTC, convinced them to sell for agreed BTC amount)
3. Computer parts (quite easy convincing local IT shop to use BTC)
4. Garage sales
Sure it's small, **but it's a start** and the fact is most of you can't say that you've even attempted to convince a vendor to use BTC. Downvote me all you want-- at least I'm trying instead of just bitching and whining. In one month I've spent over $2000 in BTC buying goods/services. So don't tell me for a damned second that "wahhhh there's no place to spend Bitcoin" because there is-- you're just not willing to put in any effort to find vendors that will accept it, or convince vendors to use it. You all expect everyone else to do the work for you.
You call can continue pointing the finger and playing the blame game. Me? I'm going to continue mining coins, and using them to buy/sell goods &amp; services.
@_date: 2011-06-20 13:31:36
Just always keep in mind that if it were another marketplace, it is **very** unlikely they would be competent enough to handle it as well as the MtGox team has. One thing users should be aware of is that MtGox doesn't exactly have a corporate level amount of support workers, so naturally there will be a small amount of downtime.
Anyways, enough talk! Let's get that market back up WITH Canadian deposit support puh-lease! Keep up the good work, and for the sake of everyone please use the absolute highest level of security. I'll donate 5 BTC if you need the money, seriously. I want a secure Canadian supported marketplace more than anything.
@_date: 2011-09-03 05:35:52
I know I'll be downvoted to the depths of hell for this, but I'd take the BTC and run. If the whole concept of anonymity in Bitcoin is true, it should be relatively easy to funnel the funds. In terms of being tracked down (assuming I didn't go around blabbing like that idiot), I'd try to keep the lowest possible profile. 
As for a market losing $5000/500BTC (approximation)... if they're considering taking legal action over this, I really thing they should try to find some sort of insurance to protect them in these unlikely events. They'll spend more than $5000 in court over this I'm sure because BTC is so relatively unknown to the general public, most people in the courtroom wouldn't even take it seriously.
tl;dr A business lost $5000 because of a very foolish error that has happened in the past several times (as they admit)-- they need to make sure that error doesn't ever occur again, take a loss, and realize it's incredibly naive of a business to expect any kind of morals/ethics from a customer in this kind of situation, with this kind of specifically anonymous market.
@_date: 2011-06-17 02:41:16
True, but it certainly is a start. Bear in mind BTC is relatively new to the mainstream audience and patience is necessary. You're definitely right though-- the affiliates are middlemen. My mistake.

For fuck's sake, you're only making the problem worse by doing this. Bitcoin has NOTHING to do with religion, so instead of making such a big deal out of this why not just switch to any other pool like MtRed or BTC Guild?
I honestly don't care if the person running my pool is a Christian, Muslim or whatever. I'm an Atheist and believe it or not, I get along quite well with religious people because I don't make a big deal out of trivial things like this.

"Until the website beta is complete, VirtEx does not require any more users to deposit CAD. This applies to all users. Existing users will still have all the same abilities to trade their current CAD for BTC with other users and users always have access to withdraw their BTC and CAD balances. New users are still welcome to sign up and look around, get familiar with the website and once the site is ready for full production, deposits will be welcome! Any payments sent before June 14th 2010 6:00 PM MST will be processed. If deposits do arrive after this time, we will e-mail you and ask your preference on how you would like them returned (e-transfer or direct deposit). These deposits will not be placed into your account. Our time estimate to be out of beta is in the area of days to weeks but there is no firm date yet, rest-assured we are working very hard to launch live and start accepting deposits again."

Part of the reason I use BTC is that it's environmentally friendly (electric usage aside, but that's a very minor issue). I'd rather not use something like this, especially because it's meant to be thrown out after withdrawing funds.
@_date: 2011-08-23 20:19:19
Why? Because they're not willing to accept a currency that fluctuates in value and can't keep a stable rate for longer than a few weeks?
Get real. The only businesses that will accept Bitcoin are the ones that have enough time to sell it immediately after receiving, so as to make sure they don't lose profit. I accept Bitcoin but my rule of thumb is to sell half and keep the other half as is, only because I have the time to do so.
If they don't accept Bitcoin, you can't really say they're going in the wrong direction because businesses must be **cautious**. Put yourself in the position of a business owner and you'll find many reasons not to accept Bitcoin for the time being. 
@_date: 2011-05-10 16:31:58
In comparison to any existing currency of today, it is FAR more environmentally friendly and that cannot be debated.

Of course, not even a week after everyone got all "HEY EVERYBODY, THERE'S AN ILLEGAL DRUG MARKET CALLED SILK ROAD-- C'MON!!!".
What the fuck did you think was going to happen? My god people, has it not occurred to you that perhaps government officials don't care nearly as much as you think about some issues like Silk Road, but now that you've put those issues in the spotlight, you're putting a lot more pressure on these politicians to do something about it instead of turning a blind eye?
Seriously, you may not like the government but learn how to play the game sometimes instead of taking the "we'll start shit because we CAN" approach, followed by the "WHAT?! The government's fighting back against our illegal drug market?! OUTRAGEOUS!!!".
I can't even begin to express how moronic this whole situation is. Here's an illegal drug market that's been running fine for well over a year because a) it's "hidden" in Tor and b) customers know how to keep their fucking mouths shut
but now that won't work, because c) a bunch of spectators thought this was SO badass and just had to tell everyone about it. Then when people like me try to express the importance of keeping things like this quiet, you all say "pshh, it's already out there-- it's not like governments don't know it exists"-- completely missing the point that until the general public take notice and bring these issues *to* the government, the government essentially doesn't give a shit.
Downvote me all you want, I don't care. I knew about Silk Road for months and months, but decided it was best for me not to tell anyone about it because believe it or not, there are some things better left alone rather then paraded around the public. Why? Because 9 times out of 10, the general public can't comprehend the idea of something like Silk Road without misunderstanding it and spreading that polluted information to even stupider people. I don't even use Silk Road but this really ticks me off.
EDIT: To quote Thurgood Jenkins... "I'm sorry for yelling."
It's like smoking a joint in front of a police officer, getting busted and then saying "YEAH- well you can't stop us all, man!". What's the point? Why not smoke that joint in private, and not start some "ethically correct, fight the power" venture that you know will end up being counterproductive?

Why not support both USD and BTC?
I don't really know the details of becoming a BTC accepting merchant, but from what I've seen so far it can't be that difficult. You've got a good idea, so run with it! I'll be honest though-- you're gonna a shitstorm of users grilling you for making profit from rage faces... Personally, I don't think it's a big deal-- you're not making millions off of it and if the "original" creators of those faces wants their cut they can ask you for royalties. Not likely they will though.
Best of luck :)

My Bitcoin boner is soft now. I've stopped mining for the most part and have just been using my rig as a gaming/media machine.

(I tend to come across as an asshole, so just letting you know I don't mean it)
You shouldn't treat people whose intelligence level you're unaware of as intelligent-- instead, try to take the most neutral approach and over time you'll become very good at noticing the most subtle cues. Sounds ridiculous at first, but I'm sure you have an inkling of what I'm talking about. 
As for being optimistic about a person's ability to understand, again I would say that can lead to very undesirable results because believe it or not, your judgement about a person can be dead wrong and you're better off realizing that right away than later down the road because you were a nice guy. Again, I don't mean to sound like an asshole lol. Optimism is just another word for faith, and I make damn sure faith and my money stay the hell away from each other. Faith has no room in the financial world.
If someone comes across as a happy-go-lucky person who claims they've dabbled in the stock market, **do not** assume this person can grasp the potential of BTC. Instead, mention the vague concept of "this new internet currency" and give them a general description of the concept of BTC **without** mentioning the specific (and easily Googleable) word "Bitcoin". This is the approach I've taken with the handful of people I've recently decided to explain this concept to, and fortunately they both realized I knew exactly what I was talking about and that this "internet currency" is something I've secretly been investing in for a while.
Bottom line: Assume nothing about an individual until you have a fairly deep understanding of their ideologies, because that inadvertently is a huge factor when it comes to how they'll react to the concept of BTC.

Look through all the "withdraw" section on the site-- there should be a place where you can enter your Bitcoin client's address and send your BTC to it from there.

I bought a pile of BTC when the price was at $1.15 USD using a portion of my income tax return, sold half of that at $30USD and used that money to buy as much as I could at $13.
I've been very, very fortunate with my BTC trading but I've decided to stop trading BTC for USD back and fourth for more BTC. I have decided to mine after buying 10 Sapphire 5830's during the recent NewEgg restocking and instead of hoarding my coins I've decided to spend half the coins I mine regardless what the price is. **People need to start spending and not hoarding BTC.**
Anyways, I'd prefer not to go into details as to exactly how much I've made but I'm in my early 20's and I've made enough money just from the BTC I've sold for good to pay for my tuition &amp; books for the next year so I'm quite happy about that.

What antivirus program are you running?
Seriously, I don't mean to be rude but if you've got a wallet.dat on your computer then you shouldn't a) browse sketchy sites b) have old antivirus/malware software c) have a poor understanding of computer security.
Getting a virus that specifically targets Bitcoin users is pretty damn rare, and it was likely because you clicked on a sketchy as hell link that had something to do with Bitcoin.
In any case, I suggest getting Nod32 and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. I'll help you out if you need it.

This is a great idea. If there is a team of professionals willing to do this, I have no problem making a small donation of 5 BTC towards it. 
Bitcoin trading in Canada is unbelievably inconvenient and even with the introduction of Virtex there has been an influx of problems related to depositing money into accounts (if you're a member, see the "Announcement" section). I can't even imagine how annoying at best it is for people in other countries with even worse payment options. An open source exchange client for currency *and* BTC that could accept a multitude of **approved** payment methods, meaning e-wallet companies like Pecunix, INTERAC or Paypay would have to legally agree that BTC trading is okay. Until then, we're just going to see marketplaces like MtGox come up, crash, and repeat.
Anyways like I said, a modest 5 BTC donation if a team is wiling to get the wheels in motion.

Though I like the sound of your approach, my personal philosophy of Bitcoin is that people should figure out/discover Bitcoin on their own, or only tell people you know will take the time to fully understand it instead of small-minded idiots that would shoot it down with blind skepticism and only spread the word that "herp derp Bitcoin's a scam man". 
Any mass way of telling people I think is too sloppy of a method and will inevitably have a certain amount of bad results like the mentioned HerpDerp mouth-breathers.
I wasn't told about Bitcoin by anyone-- I found it myself and I've only told two other people about it, and they already are starting to build mining machines so it's clear they are serious about it.
Anyways, thoughts/comments? I'm surprised to see this post getting so many upvotes but hardly any input.
**EDIT:** *tl;dr* By carefully but slowly raising awareness of Bitcoin, we create a more stable market as opposed to telling a large audience who *mostly* (optimistically assuming for the sake of being hypothetical) are intelligent enough to understand the concept sufficiently enough so as to not idiotically label the concept of Bitcoin as a "scam", which would result in credibility issues, leading to a more unstable/volatile market that I think we can all agree would be undesirable. Moral of the story: patience pays off in the end, impatient greed doesn't.

Major credit card companies offer better fraud insurance for high-usage customers. It costs them more to provide such security implementations, and as the MtGox people have said, the SMS system is susceptible to spam so a small fee is a way to prevent spam.

... It's a username, based off of one of my favorite webcomics.
Seriously, what's with Redditors? I seriously get angry messages from some people because I "don't live up to my username".
And who said I can't make an observation about something irrational in the first place?
@_date: 2011-06-22 05:06:41
Really? That's odd, considering you seem to post quite a bit in the bitcoin subreddits.
Anyways, you certainly live up to your username.

I'll bet people I have a computer that ***can*** run Crysis!
@_date: 2011-06-05 23:22:47
What are your reasons?
@_date: 2011-06-22 05:40:57
I've seen you posting in the mining subreddits-- if you're mining I'd say you're at least somewhat serious about BTC.
In any case, I honestly don't know why you're being so rude and condescending. Have a great night. Try smoking some pot, it might help you relax and find other (actually hilarious) things to do.

So you genuinely believe that medium and large sized corporations would risk being shut down by the government in exchange for evading taxes?
Real estate and vehicles are the most expensive assets a business has, and governments already seize them both to cripple those engaging in criminal behaviours. Apart from those two, there really isn't much left.
Your point about lower tax revenue relating to lower resources for future tax collection... That's a *huge* (even by your standards of hypothetical situations) assumption that relies on an insane amount of governmental collapses and corporate rebellion. There won't be a vicious circle-- no multi million, or billion dollar corporation would be foolish enough to dance with the devil. 
These people have spent their entire lives building up their companies-- do you seriously think they are foolish enough to risk ***everything*** because they're upset about a handful of things the government has mismanaged? Ask anyone with a few million dollars if they'd be willing to risk losing it all in exchange for not paying taxes. They'll laugh in your face and say when it comes to taxes, it's all in the game.
@_date: 2013-04-29 22:13:41
Okay, let's let this hypothetical play out...
Consumer: I'm sick of paying taxes-- here's a way for me to buy/sell products/services without paying taxes!
Business owner: I too am sick and tired of paying taxes! Let's do business together-- the government will never know.
CRA auditor: We've noticed you have $650,000 in your business account that has no legal transactions associated with it. How did you obtain this money legally?
Business owner: I can't explain how I have $650,000 in my account with no legal transactions associated with it. Perhaps I should continue to tax my customers.
Consumer: Well forget your business, I'll move to another business!
Business owner 2: [repeat process of business owner 1]
The point I'm making is that the CRA can and will find ways to nail large, medium and even small businesses for tax evasion. My father was a government CEO and my mother was a government auditor-- I've had similar discussions with them about tax evasion and they both agree that no legitimate business would risk losing their entire operation over what they pay in taxes, especially when you consider how many ways the government could nail them.
Google, for example, would never risk selling their services under the table and then having the audacity to tell the government "you can't prove anything", despite all that money being in a bank account. The same goes with any large corporation, and medium corporation, and and small business. It's not worth the risk, because the government will relentlessly pursue tax evaders.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:06:38
Pretty much, yes. It's childish and unrealistic to pay taxes and expect every portion of that money to be spent justifiably. I don't agree with a lot of things our government does, but that doesn't mean I'd choose not to pay taxes.
Furthermore, it's a pretty cheap cop-out to use a handful of problems like that as an excuse to not pay taxes at all. I mean hell, the roads we drive on wouldn't be there if it weren't for taxes.
And you can pull that condescending "nobody's perfect, right" nonsensical commentary if you'd like, but I urge you to name one government that has never used taxpayers money to fund unjust activities. If your answer to that is "abolish the government, man", then there really is nothing else I'll add to this discussion because you're living in a dream world.
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:54:45
How so? I support the majority of federal spending, and I am more than willing to give up a portion of my money to taxation, legalities aside. Healthcare, infrastructure, social service are some of the services I'm glad our taxes go towards.
It seems hard to call something theft if the so-called victims are supporting the expenses of the thief, wouldn't you say?

Mom and pop stores simply cannot afford to sell goods at a competitive price against massive corporations like Amazon or Walmart, even if they are able to sell the products at a tax-free rate. In addition to cost, they'll be outdone in nearly every other aspect in terms of convenience and advertising. Already there are tons of failed mom and pop shops that have tried going tax-free and they still fail, because they can't operate legitimately which prevents them from being able to advertise.
People like you have been saying governments will be gone for centuries, and it's never worked out. Your reasoning against taxation is based off of a handful of bad things that governments do with tax dollars, and magically assumes that the companies citizens would manually buy into wouldn't mismanage those funds.
Bitcoin isn't opposed to taxation-- it's the exact same as cash in that regard. People can make cash transactions that are tax free, but it's a huge inconvenience and in many cases it's not worth the risk of getting caught.
I really must ask, what is your background in terms of education or business? I'm not trying to belittle you, I'm just genuinely curious as to what profession would compel one to think like this.
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:15:04
Glad to hear this. I don't mind paying taxes on my BTC-- taxes serve a legitimate purpose and we all benefit from them.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:54:48
Already offline-- 3 copies, 3 fireproof safes in different buildings (not specifically bought for his BTC, haha).
Anyway, I've got a ton of studying to do so if I don't respond to anyone that's why!
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:52:10
I hate to quit a discussion like this, but I'm going to have to. You just keep throwing these hypothetical situations, and I can't bring myself to recognize them as being legitimate in any sense. People have tried to implement libertarian and anarchistic beliefs, and they've always failed. You conveniently ignore that, and continue to push the idea that it could work. 
The tax system promotes stability. Your system on the other hand demotes stability, and instead treats society as a lab rat. Companies and entire industries being bankrupted and people losing their jobs isn't some sort of game-- it's real life. The blanket approach of taxes is far from perfect, but it's survived the test of time all across the globe. I'm done-- feel free to reply, but I'll tell you right now that common courtesy won't oblige me to reply any further. Cheers.
Oh and by the way-- drone killings and imprisonment without trial... You do know we're talking about Canada, right? If you're referring to the infamous drone killings in Pakistan, you've got the wrong country. If you're talking about imprisonment without trial... well, nearly every country is guilty of that and it really has nothing to do with taxes.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:51:34
Sounds good-- I've got an accountant so I'll arrange a meeting for him.
As for taxes, neither of us have ever had problems with the idea of paying taxes on BTC profit. It's an investment, and any other ROI would involve paying taxes. Plus, taxes do serve a legitimate purpose even if we disagree with some of the ways the government spends money.
As for vendors, he'd definitely be willing to do that. I bought quite a few items with Bitcoin since 2010 and he was really intrigued with that, so I'm sure he'll be up for it. Thanks!

a) Libertarians and anarchists have never successfully instilled their systems (or lack thereof, in the case of anarchists) in any country. Please, explain why this is so.
b) Your assumption that people aren't lazy and ignorant to be trusted with such complicated things is based off of what? Again, no country has ever had such a system, because it would never work. Those who don't vote out of cynicism would be the first to cry if their right to vote was taken away.
c) Tax reports. You're seriously trying to tell me that the basic task of filing one's taxes is comparable to managing finances of an entire country? To me this is the equivalent of me telling an F-1 driver I could do his job because I drive 100km/h on the highway everyday. You're in way over your head, and I think I'm going to stop wasting my time with this pointless discussion.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:54:56
a) I agree that road building would be done cheaper and faster if people paid companies directly
b) Taxation is just one way of doing things, sure. The reason why nearly every country in the world relies on the tax system is because it would be incredibly complicated to have citizens manually pick and choose the thousands, if not millions of expenses involved in the building and maintenance of a country's infrastructure, among other things.
c) I merely used roads as one example. Our health care system, building standards, transportation standards, national security, the military-- I could go on all day about the various reasons why the tax system is a superior system to manually choosing what to support and what not to support.
Nearly 40% of eligible Canadians can't even be bothered to vote. What on earth makes you think these people would be able to handle the enormous responsibility of manually handling expense prioritization of an entire country?
And for the last time, can you provide *any* realistic alternative? All the resources in your link were from a bunch of short-sighted Libertarian or Anarchistic groups who delude themselves into thinking they're far smarter than the rest of us, only because all their ideas sound good in theory but have never panned out in reality.
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:24:46
Until you can offer a better method of running a country without taxes, and provide examples, I really don't see a point in criticizing a system that, when implemented correctly, can have effective results.
Also, I must have missed a memo or something-- when did the punishment for tax evasion change from fines/imprisonment to corporal punishment? At this point you're just making up things to support what seems to be a very poorly thought out hypothetical solution.

I've talked to him about CaVirtex (I used to use it too), but he's just not to keen on the idea of having to provide government ID photos to them. Are there any alternatives, or is he stuck with this sort of verification? 
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:26:49
Private companies are paid by the government to build roads. If the government wasn't paying for the roads using taxpayers' money, who would pay the companies?
In any case, if you're going to rant and rave about this... at least provide your own alternatives. Right now you're just saying "well that's stupid! but... I can't think of anything smarter and just as realistic!".
