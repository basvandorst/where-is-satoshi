One main reason people tout bitcoin is because they want to make money (i.e. cash) by speculating.  They simply want the price to go up (or fluctuate as the case may be).  Unfortunately for those in the know, a lot of the purported attributes of bitcoin are really no longer valid.  The sooner people understand this, the better.  
Thus, when more people understand this, less people may use it.  Thus, the price may continue to stagnate or even go down long term.
Combine this will all the scams, mining scams, gold for btc scams, bitcoin security, etc...it ends up being a rather poor economy.

Just so you are aware, I am going to go buy a new laptop today for the express purpose of running Armory offline.  Now, you can use a used computer for this as well.  Offline Armory is not resource intensive, i.e. it just needs 256 megs of RAM.  A used laptop would work. (provided you wipe the hard drive and install the OS from scratch.)

Large retailers aren't going to go 100% into btc.  That would be a bad business move.  Instead, with BitPay for example, they can allocate a certain percentage to stay in btc.  This is what Overstock.com does.
@_date: 2014-08-14 08:39:32
The only thing that will ever drive bitcoin's price up, versus other currencies, is acceptance of bitcoin, i.e. people trading their fiat for bitcoin.  By now people should realize that all these businesses accepting bitcoin won't do much.  Most "bitcoin" businesses just immediately convert to fiat anyway via BitPay, etc.
I would like to say something though, bitcoin is better than fiat in every way, EXCEPT for privacy in transaction.  That is where bitcoin utterly fails, and you would be better off using cash.

Bitcoin is a peer to peer, decentralized financial machine.  Legacy banking has had plenty of time to understand what bitcoin means to them.  What it means, is the eventual castration of banking as we know it today.
Its interesting how naive people are, thinking that legacy banking can co-exist with the powerful idea of finance in which people themselves become a sort of futuristic banking entity.
Peer to peer solutions such as localbitcoins.com are the best way to exchange worthless fiat for bitcoin.  Everybody who takes a chance and uses their bank to make bitcoin purchases is taking a risk of account termination.  
Embrace banking via a peer to peer format.
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

Suffice it to say, a lot of purported positive attributes of bitcoin aren't really true any more.  It is still a payment system, but not really for the end user regarding privacy in financial transactions, and central points of failure.

Sure.  Just a few minutes ago I was part of a conversation in which somebody found a bug in the coinbase system.  Coinbase stated they would pay $1000.00 per bug.  These bugs are very serious, as they involve financial transactions.  Well, this person found a bug, and was only awarded $100.00.  To me, that is straight up dishonesty.
On a more personal level, I have had issues and questions with their service.  So I contact customer support.  Yeah...what a mess.  They never resolved my problem.  So I just stopped using their service.
Many people have had problems with coinbase.  You can make the excuse that they weren't ready for the problems...but that is lame.  THEY, need to make sure their system is rock solid from the top leadership of the company all the way down to customer support reps.

The best known practice is to have an offline version of Armory running on a computer that never connects to the internet, and an online version running on your main computer.  The offline version controls most of your funds, while the online version has minimal funds. Its all about security.

It also helps to understand the environment or setting here.

I would venture that most (majority), DO NOT understand these concepts at all.  Therefore their opinions mean much less to me versus the opinions of people like Dr. Adam Back or Greg Maxwell.

Its a fair comparison because we are talking about limited assets.  I wouldn't put fiat in the same category as gold or bitcoin.  That appears to be what you did, and I think it is incorrect.  Suffice it to say that bitcoin and other mathematically limited cryptocurrencies are probably the best store of value ever invented, as long as people continue to embrace it.

Not sure.  If you try to buy $500.00 of bitcoin, you immediately get flagged to KYC before you can get your hands on your bitcoin/fiat.  I know this by reading other people's posts on reddit about the abra service.
@_date: 2017-04-14 03:01:32
Everybody who uses Abra will have to go through AML/KYC procedures depending on the amount.  (In the U.S.)  And yes, no instant buys like Circle had. Unfortunately I have a sneaking suspicion that once the transaction is initiated, and they have several days to process the transaction, they can actually make money off the transaction itself depending on bitcoin volatility.  I believe Coinbase does this as well.  Circle was the best, by a long shot.

This is old content, but my take on it is that centralized banks are fairly evil.  Countries/nations have used banks for centuries to fund their own petty wars.  If banking is transferred to the individual, where the individual has sovereign control of their own money, I don't think this would happen.  On the other hand, if enough cryptocurrency is owned amongst a group of people or a person, I suppose the same thing can happen.  But it would take years for that to even become a glimmer in somebody's eye.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:32:25
Yeah, maybe.  Not much anybody can do about that though.
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:33:54
Tether is likely a type of scam.  Exchanges who use Tether are very shady in my opinion.  Why would investors give up millions of dollars just to back a token 1:1?  Makes zero sense.  I'm actually surprised the SEC isn't investigating Tether to be honest and if a crime can be reported in conjunction with any employee of Tether, I would hope somebody would do that to perhaps get the FBI involved as well.  The more I research Tether, the more I want to stay away from exchanges who have anything to do with Tether.

Business Guide to the FTC's Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule
What Does the Rule Cover?
It applies to most goods a customer orders from the seller by mail, telephone, fax, or on the Internet.
It does not matter how the merchandise is advertised, how the customer pays, or who initiates the contact.
"Merchants who violate the Rule can be sued by the Federal Trade Commission for injunctive relief, monetary civil penalties of up to $16,000 per violation (any time during the five years preceding the filing of the complaint), and consumer redress (any time during the three years preceding the filing of the complaint). When the mails are involved, the Postal Service also has authority to take action for problems such as non-delivery. State law enforcement agencies can take action for violating state consumer protection laws."
"The FTC works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices in the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop, and avoid them. To file a complaint or to get free information on consumer issues, visit ftc.gov or call toll-free, 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.

Coinabul is having serious legacy banking problems (from comments made in the  channel on freenode).  There is a thread on bitcointalk in the scammers section with pictures of silver coins that were received via an order placed with Coinabul.  The coins are beaten ALL TO HELL.  (And he received his order ONE YEAR later.) (As if, somebody did it on purpose).  Gregory Maxwell (a bitcoin developer), gmaxwell on  on freenode, also seems to support this clown (Coinabul).  I'm not exactly sure why Greg would support Coinabul, as it seems he is fairly intelligent.  There are three different scammer threads on bitcointalk that concern Coinabul at the moment.  Also, Coinabul aka coingenuity, aka Jay Shore, is receiving negative ratings on freenode in the  channel.  (including yours truly giving him a -5).
Now, I applaud Jay Shore for starting his bitcoin/precious metals business and being the first of its kind.  However, that is no excuse to treat consumers poorly.  Honestly, I'm not sure what this guy is thinking.  Take your business to Agora Commodities, Amagi metals....and there is another one...but I can't think of at the moment.  I'm inclined to go with Agora Commodities.

Purchased the Hickory Habanero.  Unfortunately it arrived with a broken cap.  They promptly sent a new bottle!  Super tasty hot sauce.  Highly recommended.

Insist the buyer pay first and pay in cash, or maybe precious metals.  No exceptions.  Also do the trade near surveillance cameras, maybe a bank.  If its a significant amount, I would do it at a bank, and have the bank test the bills for authenticity. Or, I guess, you can buy one of those chemical pens and test the bills yourself.

I am using the voice call option.  That is, they call your phone via voice and give you the code that way.

It was Wells Fargo.  They finally sent the btc.  I think a big problem with these businesses that sell btc is that they dont have the employees to properly service the customers.  Very frustrating.

So, the massdrop has ended for these yubikeys, how do you pay with bitcoin?  I have received no address to send bitcoin to?

Unable to log into my account either. Whenever I try to use the 2FA to get a code, it doesnt work. Been like this for days. I also had recurring buys and sells set up. Basically I had to instruct my bank to shut down any payments to coinbase because I had zero control over my coinbase account. Their support blows...that is putting it mildly. I have tried to contact Olaf on reddit, and several people through their web support form on coinbase.com. Super lame.

OP, you apologized to the seller...but did it occur to you that the seller and an accomplice ripped you off?  Be careful with the seller.

Bitcoin is an informational commodity.  It has properties that are valuable to people.

If this crypto coin is EFFICIENT, this will cause a mass exodus from bitcoin into zerocoin.  Interesting times.  The wise move would be to hard fork bitcoin with the additions of zerocoin.

OP, bitcoin is about paying your bills.  Bitcoin is a "back to basics" movement that is digital.  i.e. You pay somebody for a good or service the traditional way, a non-debt money system.  If you think bitcoin is about not paying what you owe, you are seriously mistaken.  I'm not even sure why you would associate bitcoin and not adhering to a contract that you signed.  Bitcoin is all about contracts, responsibility in transactions--a new paradigm in finance.  Be a part of it by acting responsibly.

Wish I could say the same.  I deposted $2500.00 today, (13 hours ago) and have yet to see any bitcoins.  They claim a target of filling orders in 15 minutes to 4 hours...but that is bullshit. My order yesterday took 12 hours, and I have yet to see any bitcoins deposited into my wallet for this last order.

Install Armory, and use M of N backup option.  Give these different backups to members of your family, friends, etc.  So, if you have a 3 of 5 backup, then 3 people would have to come together to recreate the wallet.

Is it possible to implement coinjoin in this?  Or am I way out in left field?
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:01:47
+1 on this.  Also realize, as a business owner, you should prepare to accept bitcoin for the "long haul" as it were.  You may not get many people who even know what the hell a bitcoin is. There will be many trials and tribulations as bitcoin gets more 'fleshed' out.

Theft of bitcoin is a really big deal.  You need to know how to completely secure your bitcoin.  If you are unable to learn how, then I wouldn't bother with bitcoin.  Fortunately, there are people like me, who can offer suggestions.
1.  Never store your bitcoin in an online webwallet.  Store the main bulk of your btc via a paper wallet.  Store a small amount on your computer for transactions, etc.  Decide on a percentage.  90% in paper backup, 10% "online". But avoid web based wallets.  Bitcoin was designed so that the person using bitcoin has 100% control of their bitcoin.
2.  Never use a brainwallet, EVER.  If you wish to experiment--dont, waste of your time.
3.  Make backups of your wallet.  This includes paper wallet backups, and **encrypted** digital backups.  Paperwallets can be left with people you trust, bank safe deposit box, etc.  Digital backups can exist in the cloud, on a USB drive, DVD, CD, etc.
4.  Keep track of where you store these files and paper wallets.
5.  DO NOT forget your passwords.  Use a password manager.  If you forget your passwords..you              are               fucked.
There are more nuances for the suggestions I have listed.  Either people can elaborate on them here, or you can contact me via reddit if you wish.

Jon Holmquist has nothing to do with coinabul any longer.  I imagine he thinks Jay Shore is a criminal.

Is your wallet synced?
