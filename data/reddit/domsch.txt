Best argument on in a long time.

Exactly. The Blockchain's unique property is that you have a receipt (i.e. tx hash), and therefore a Blockchain is not coercion-resistant. Ring Signatures or ZKP (zerocash) may help solve the problem though.

You clearly have not followed his blog post and neither understand the overall situation. Please read his blog  and tell me again how a) he's a salesman and b) "he only writes about bankchains".
The Bitcoin Maximalists that perceive Bitcoin as this omnipotent force (which it clearly is not right now), are the reason why the community is fragmenting and falling apart. As I have said previously, there is no community as hostile as People here want to live in a safespace, where competing protocols/organizations that solve problems which Bitcoin in its current form cannot solve get attacked. 
People here need to start waking up and reason with the motivation behind the creation of Blockchain without Bitcoin, of Ethereum and other protocols that are not Bitcoin. Until people here start waking up (who knows when that will be?), we need people like Tim that call out on the bullshit that is being advertised.

Tim is probably one of the most important people in the space. He calls out the bullshit and illusory believes that Bitcoiners have. I suggest you to respect his work more and get rid off your "Bitcoin Maximalism" believes. Because that is not going to happen.

We're a company based in Switzerland with a Team of around 9 people that is currently solving some of the bigger problems. Would be interesting to get in touch with the P2Pool core Team.
Do you have any contact info to share? I have something to offer and have a few ideas on how to be able to compete with the current offering of CEX/GHash.
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:20:07
Very interesting idea, considering we could collaborate with you and include this in our POS Terminals ( which we will start shipping soon.
I will contact you now, I think we can collaborate greatly here!

So you sold your company even before establishing it?

Making a small test with 0.01 Bitcoin @_date: 2015-11-09 15:17:51
Hey everyone, creator here. I know that this is not directly related to Bitcoin, but this research is relevant to the entire crypto-ecosystem. 
We all want to move forward from this notion of just utilizing the Blockchain as a store of value. The applications to use the Blockchain for are many, but in order to really create useful applications that help people we need to start working together.
So I hope that everyone reading this realizes that.

This is actually very much relevant to Bitcoin. The entire Bitcoin community would benefit so much more by opening up and start embracing (or at least taking serious) other implementations, concepts and improvements of what made Bitcoin so great. We need to start creating interoperable applications and technologies. There is not one chain to rule them all.
Right now, is a perfect example of a **safe space** where any kind of criticism about Bitcoin is avoided at all costs (even free speech). Only through criticism a technology, an ecosystem and a community can improve and achieve its (ambitious) goals. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 17:17:10
Right. Because a new governance model for large scale communities has **nothing** to do with Bitcoin at all. I am actually working on a usecase for utilizing Liquid Democracy for governing large github repos, and Bitcoin is certainly one that fits this criteria. 
Therefore, read and understand before you criticize.

To ask, why are you charging attendees a 25€ fee? Also, an FAQ would be good (unless I'm missing it?).

Had a grin while reading the article!
Parenting done right, kudos to you!
