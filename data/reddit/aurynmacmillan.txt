I'd guess that it's probably Polyester Books, pretty cool store up in Fitzroy.

[Here's mine]( not much to look at really. Just a Raspberry Pi 2 hooked directly to my router.
@_date: 2015-06-10 09:42:36
Yep, that's the one I used. Easily the best tutorial I've seen. A word of warning, download the blockchain on another device and copy it over to the Raspberry Pi, this will save you weeks of hassle.
@_date: 2015-06-11 04:25:22
As far as I know you can do it on the B+ and the 2, the earlier models don't have enough ram. Although the ram might only be an issue for initially downloading the blockchain. So the original Pi might work if you copied the blockchain from another device.
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:57:19
Definitely not a fail on your part, it really is a shame when people are so close minded.
Assuming you can get a read on these type of people prior to mentioning bitcoin, I've found it productive to start directly with the underlying tech. For instance, you could suggest a lecture on decentralised consensus protocols, of which bitcoin is just one of many examples and possible applications.

Just got my Rasperry Pi 2 setup as a full node a couple of days ago!
@_date: 2015-06-15 02:39:31
Love these guys!
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:03:29
What's the difference?
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:01:56
Yeah no sign of damage to the seal, guess there's some perks to receiving one from the last batch.
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:38:25
Yeah I've tried to be upfront that it's a small but growing community
@_date: 2014-04-23 03:42:21
oh yeah, great point. I'll find her some articles on there as well.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:30:48
Hey just wondering if you guys have an ipad pos solution? I was unable to find your product on the app store.
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:05:08
Yeah no worries, no harm in asking.
So I first got discovered Bitcoin about a year ago while I was messing around with the Tor network, started googling it, read the white paper, and have been following the subreddit closely ever since.
I find the technology behind it fascinating, and I truly believe that it will be world changing. I am not looking for anything in particular out of bitcoin, essentially I just want to be involved in the movement. Selfishly, I would love more places to spend my bitcoins, but on top of that, I figure that I offer a bit of a different perspective and a different outreach/network to most bitcoiners. So if I can use that to help grow and support the bitcoin ecosystem, then great!
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:35:42
yeah it is a great real world example. I'll definitely use it when pitching the idea of bitcoin to people.
@_date: 2014-04-23 02:55:59
Cheers, I'll check that out
@_date: 2014-08-16 14:18:36
Fair enough point. I definitely plan on putting together a video for the campaign, but that will probably be a week or so away.
But in order to get the campaign ready, I would really love some input from the community.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:56:33
Does anyone know of, or is anyone working on, a native blackberry 10 Bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2014-04-06 09:04:57
Fair point. Hadn't really thought about it, will edit the OP.
@_date: 2014-08-16 04:12:39
Yeah I think that is a great idea. At $1000 per game, it makes for easy increments in stretch goals.
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:35:48
I will definitely make contact with them soon
@_date: 2014-04-07 05:27:06
I really like this idea, although I'm not sure I command that kind of celebrity. However, I am potentially running some events later in the year, and I like the idea of making registration fees payable only in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-08 08:25:45
I'd love to see a free web-based point of sale application, similar to the coinbox android app.
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:07:58


--sorry for the double post, just didn't want to answer the same question twice.
To answer your second question. I'm not aware of anything secretly going on with basketball and bitcoin. I do love the fact that Sacramento started accepting bitcoins though, that's huge! I've started talking with my club and hopefully can convince them by next season.
@_date: 2014-04-07 05:43:36
Hey do you guys have an ipad POS solution available?
@_date: 2014-05-06 10:03:59
This is huge, will definitely use it for my next bill!
@_date: 2014-04-07 05:44:42
Professional Basketball Player - NBL Australia
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:29:55
Thanks for the suggestions! Yeah I went to the most recent Bitcoin meetup here in Melbourne. Was a great event. I'm going to keep pushing for the club to start accepting bitcoin. I would say there is a reasonable chance, I guess the best argument for would be if people started sending them emails/calling/tweeting at them asking to buy tickets in bitcoin. Ultimately the owners are business people and will respond to demand.
@_date: 2014-04-07 05:24:55
This is something I've been considering heavily. However, like a lot of bitcoiners, I'm having a hard time convincing the Mrs that it's a good idea. But contract negotiations are coming up, so I will definitely flesh this idea out.
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:36:43
Thanks for that! I will definitely use and recommend this site. Great resource.
@_date: 2014-04-06 09:04:11
I actually went down to the most recent one at the York Butter Factory. Really enjoyed it, and met some interesting people. Will definitely check out the next one that I'm available for. Cheers.
@_date: 2014-11-15 13:26:59
Started a blog about a week back, I'm trying to post about all my hobbies and interests. Since bitcoin is one of my biggest interests, there will be a lot of bitcoin related posts. Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2014-04-09 22:21:54
Hey thanks for that! Nice great to see bitcoin working in real life. I'll definitely show that to some people. So I noticed they were using BitPOS on an android tablet, good to see that in action too.
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:52:14
Thanks for the great advice. I've been really careful so far with explaining the volatility and ways to minimise your exposure to it. Eg. With coinjar you can clear your account into AUD daily. Obviously I'm no financial advisor, so I make it plainly obvious that they should do their own research before making any decisions.
What startup are you involved with?
@_date: 2014-04-06 10:14:11
lol, yeah we're a pretty diverse bunch. I guess I get a lot of free time in the afternoons, so I try to spend it learning something. Bitcoin has been my one of my focuses for a while now, but I also started learning a bit of programming last month (c++ and python) and I'm going to start some uni math courses next semester.
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:27:27
Lol, yeah! Since the release of the Blackberry 10 operating system, and a range of current generation phones, there's a growing population of people returning to blackberry. It's a great platform
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:41:00
Got a question regarding fees. You are charging a 0.5% fee on all transactions and working with a third party service for remittance into fiat correct? If so, what would the total fee be for transactions remitted to AUD through coinjar? Including your fees, coinjar's fees, and any other applicable fees?
Also, what bank would you recommend using for bitcoin related transactions? Given that some banks have begun distancing themselves from bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-06 06:17:47
Also, does anyone know of a bitcoin POS, similar to Coinbox, built for ipad?
@_date: 2014-04-06 08:03:32
awesome! Well will be the first to know if/when the Tigers start accepting bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:19:42
Thanks I'll have a look into bitpay.
I guess with the way apple is treating bitcoin at the moment, a web-based app with similar functionality to coinbox would be ideal.
Look forward to seeing what you're working on.
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:56:38
Cheers for getting back to me mike. I'm actually out of the country until July, but I'd love to come by and catch up with you guys when I return. I live down in Prahran and am really wanting to help spearhead an effort to get chapel street and the surrounding area onto Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-06 06:39:16
@_date: 2014-08-16 12:26:55
What do you mean by a proof video?
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:26:10
I saw the demo, but couldn't find it in the app store.
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:33:53
awesome, cheers for that.
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:10:44
I dig it
@_date: 2014-04-06 06:28:36
what proof would you like?
@_date: 2014-04-06 06:38:51
that work?
@_date: 2014-05-06 10:25:18
This is a fantastic idea, I think sponsoring athletes and teams is fantastic way to generate interest (although I might be a bit biased on this), and doing it in emerging markets is huge.
@_date: 2014-04-06 10:47:40
Awesome! I have had a bit of a look at Tomcar, found them on coinmap.org, but didn't realize the extent of their savings through bitcoin. That's massive!
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:28:21
Yeah I've shown them what the Kings are doing. Really hopeful that we can work out a similar situation.
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:54:51
Just went and checked out your startup. It's a neat idea, looking forward to trying it out.
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:36:59
Seriously lol at "person-to-thug payments"
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:39:15
Thanks heaps for making this tutorial, I've been messing around for days trying to get Bitcoin setup on my Raspberry Pi 2. Will start again from scratch today using your tutorial.
@_date: 2015-05-10 02:34:57
Surely an algorithmic solution would be better than an arbitrary exponential increase?
@_date: 2015-05-09 00:05:17
I've been trying to set one up on a rasperry pi 2 and a MIPS ci20 creator for the last few days, much more challenging than I would have expected. Hopefully I'll sort it out at some point soon.
@_date: 2014-08-16 14:25:30
I don't have a video made up as of yet, but here is a link to my [verified twitter page]( which should serve as proof enough for now.
Let me know if you have any suggestions for stretch goals or perks.
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:12:34
second that. I'd love to know more.
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:32:19
They need to release this over here in Australia. These terminals, or some variant, are literally everywhere. Card payments by far exceed cash payments here.
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:46:43
[imagine a turtle on a skateboard](
@_date: 2014-08-16 06:53:48
Yeah, maybe we can gear some of the perks more towards businesses.
@_date: 2016-01-03 07:03:06
I guess it should be zero indexed, so we just started year 5 A*.
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:21:03
^ this!
@_date: 2016-01-03 21:45:36
I wouldn't necessarily say it's a religious word. It's a Latin/greek word to which cultures influenced by Abrahamic religions commonly ascribe religious connotations. Although the word was in use long before those religions.
@_date: 2016-01-03 21:36:10
Post Genesis would also work.
@_date: 2016-01-03 21:32:00
Thanks for introducing me to Unix time! I would also approve of using this epoch over AD.
@_date: 2016-01-03 06:56:50
Totally down. I'm pretty over having my epoc defined by a church/religion. Suggestions: Year 6 AG (After genesis), AS(After Satoshi), AB(After Bitcoin), or something else?
@_date: 2015-08-01 23:53:51
Haven't checkout out streamium.io yet, but if it's anything like every other streaming website, you'll be able to use dedicated streaming software to set up you're scenes. My favourite software is [obs](
@_date: 2015-07-20 07:17:06
My plan was to just sweep wallets to a hot wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-20 02:37:08
Cheers for the links!
I'm aware that I can plug it straight into a printer, only issue is I don't own one. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 07:16:24
ah cool, will look into adding salt to mycelium entropy.
Looking into electrum right now.
@_date: 2015-07-20 02:37:34
Thanks, so paper backups as well.
@_date: 2015-07-20 02:41:20
Yeah my only real concern with my process is having to trust the mycelium device. But as you mentioned, it seems like an acceptable risk.
I'll look into electrum as well, that sounds like it would probably be the more useful solution.
@_date: 2015-07-20 03:48:01
Just because I already own all the hardware that I mentioned in the post. I've considered buying a Trezor, but I'm not sure I have enough bitcoin to warrant the investment.
@_date: 2016-02-28 08:00:50
Sounds like an elaborate setup for an even more elaborate April fools joke
@_date: 2015-07-20 03:50:12
Yes definitely. Adding a printer would be the simplest solution, however like you mentioned it would mean a couple hundred dollars sunk into a single purpose printer (I literally have no use for it otherwise). I'd probably buy a Trezor if I were to put any more money into a cold storage solution. My current solution is a bit of a hack based on the hardware I have available.
@_date: 2016-02-29 01:20:47
I know, just having a laugh since it's on April fools day. Good luck with the competition.
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:59:33
That's exactly the excuse an April fools prankster would use! =P
@_date: 2016-02-24 06:32:38
Not particularly a fan of reward point programs, but you guys seriously rock, so I'll let it slide =P
Seriously though, love seeing LRoS rolling out new features.
@_date: 2015-04-26 00:15:32
Any chance of getting a full node running on a MIPS creator ci20?
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:13:40
Planck time blocks beats the he'll out of ~10 minute blocks huh.
@_date: 2015-10-16 21:33:25
Very odd, no clue why, particularly Iceland? 
@_date: 2015-10-18 21:48:45
Simple explanation: big fish eats little fish.
@_date: 2015-02-19 23:59:36
Nice! I brought a couple of these a while back, awesome was to generate true random private keys.
