Haha, your complaining about it being to busy.  From a customers perspective I get it, but from an investors view it fucking great. This will iron its way out and loose money will fall during this time

Ok, so now shill me on your coin, hahq.

22 trillion in debt is what backs the U.S. dollar and confidence in governments is falling.  Given a choice, most would step out of the system that promotes quantatative easing because each day everyone is a little poorer.
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:26:37
Ok, Ill take 1 second and tell you that the amount of cellphone users in the world is roughly 4.8 billion.  The number of people roughly between the ages of 15 and 65 is 5 billion so my number of 90% internet coverage was even conservative.  So most of those people have no access to banking, let alone a sliver of gold.  The cellphone is their bank!  
Now for Western widespread use.  Give it some time bubba, its only been 9 years and its already the 6th Largest Currency In The World By Circulation.  You might not want or need to use bitcoin, but I do.  The american dollar is in a freefall and it wont end well.  I was here in 99 and I was here in 08 and I will tell you that the next crash wont be so kind.  First they came for your pensions and 401ks, next they came for your houses and the next one will take your communities.  Bitcoin is my hedge against the Immoral, Unethical, imperialistic attitude of the american people and its unwillingness to open its eyes to the corruption that will lead us and our dollar into the pits of hell! haha

Gold isn't a miracle metal.  Find me one place that puts the true real world use of gold at even 10% of today's value and do not say we can make bracelets with it.  What you will find is this description of why gold is valuable.
"Silver tarnishes - it reacts with minute amounts of sulphur in the air. That's why we place particular value on gold. It turns out then, that the reason gold is precious is precisely that it is so chemically uninteresting. ... A currency only has value because we, as a society, decide that it does."
It is a currency, not a replacement, I do not understand why you do not get that.
 Your dense and Im sure you are going to now shill me your alt coin!

You have to admit there is no possible way to track who and what in most cases.  Most people who were purchasing bitcoin knew enough about the Bank Secrecy Act, ill leave that there.  
So you dont think coinbase gets audited?  I can guarantee you that coinbase has exactly the right number of bitcoins.  They are being scrutinized everyday by the IRS, SEC, FBI,CIA and anyone you want to throw at them.  I do not like their services, but I trust their books.

Bitcoin was created by the nsa, but not for the reasons most think.  The world is 221 trillion in debt, U.S. is 22 trillion itself.  Drive the dollar down while inflating Bitcoin.  In 10 years, 22 trillion will be worth the equivalent of 5 trillion and Bitcoin will help pay off the world debts.

Quantitative easing of currencies around the world driving the value into the ground.  The American dollar has lost 97% of its value and its not getting any better.

I'm buying and I know most legitimate investors are also  that have been apart of this community.  
A year ago, hardly anyone was talking about bitcoin, now it's a daily discussion.  Let's see, make a 1000% in 1 year with bitcoin or buy into the real bubble, the stock market.  Ok, I have money in both, but bitcoin is exciting and the stocks are downright scary.  I owned Facebook stock until I realized that half of their users are made up, ads arent producing shit and they basically are the cia in disguise, ha!

Abandon fiat?  I don't think you get this.  There are a lot of currencies in the world, none are set to replace the others.  Bitcoin is the world's digital currency and will stand beside the others.
Also, there is 200 trillion in investments around the world, if Bitcoin grabs just 2%, that puts it's price at 200k to 300k.  Then there is offshore  banking, that is 21trillion.  We might only get 2% of mainstream investments, but I suspect in years to come, it will grab at least 10% of that.  
Sorry to burst your bubble, Bitcoin is here to stay! Ha
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:09:44
Sure but what Im saying is that you might think about getting out at 100k.  When bitcoin runs there in lets say 1 year, I suppose most will say "shit, it got here so soon, im not selling yet, lets see where this thing goes!" 
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:05:36
He means 1000% increase in 1 year is not enough for people to want to buy bitcoin.  I understand because my rate of return on the stock market  has been 100% over 10 years and I get a negative interest rate on my money in the bank.  Also bread cost 300% from where it was 5 years ago, so I understand why 2018 will be rough on bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:08:33
I agree and I'm waiting for a political figure to start telling people that maybe Americans should buy bitcoin.  If it's a new asset class, Americans need to own before the rest of the world claims it.

Well the average person with little wealth and savings like you say   rarely has access to a way to invest for one.  Purchasing bitcoin is easy,getting easier and  gains have been unbelievable. If they want to get ahead, bitcoin might be their only chance.
People who have never thought about buying a stock, buy bitcoin.  Plus, dont miss the point that its worldwide and growing everyday.
Bitcoin as it stands works a lot like gold with benefits.  It doesnt have to do more than be a hedge against the dollar for now and most find that the deflationary part is it strength.  I see no problems with Bitcoin, I just see a rapid expansion and growing pains for something that went from a piece a paper 9 years ago to one of the top 20 currencies of world in use. Maybe its not for you, good luck.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:35:47
You think he would take into account the masses of people that flooded in so fast that they had to shut the gates to Bitcoin.  Could not get money in and when you did, a lot of the exchanges quit taking on new customers.

I think you need to do some more research because I can afford to have very smart people who study the market daily give me advise and you know what they say?  They say "either bitcoin is going to a million or its going to zero".  Is it a risk? sure  But what you have in front of you is an opportunity of a lifetime and you spend your time here talking and dissing instead of learning, to bad, I will think of you in the future and what you missed.

You are experiencing cognitive bias.  Addresses have nothing to do with amount of people.  Many of those address are exchanges you talk about.  Do you think coinbase has 4 million wallets for their customers, nope.  They have hundreds of wallets that contain 1000's of bitcoins.  Now take the other 8500 exchanges and tell me how only a few  control it.
Early adopters didn't needs a ton to get started.  I wasn't totally early, but early enough to have heard most of the arguments.
also, think about the kid that threw away hundreds of millions.  thats an address that will never be touched.

I still think bitcoin wins to whatever degree that is.  Wall Street talks about diluting the value of Bitcoin by all these other coins, which happens to a small degree I think, but I in the end all the other coins get diluted because there's too many to discern and Bitcoin only has 21 million. There's a reason why gold has more value than currency because there's a lot of different currencies but it's only one gold.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:20:10
Golds true value is at most $80 an ounce.  Steel has more functional use than gold.  Its an old paradigm that is on its way out.
Bitcoin wasn't created to replace, just like the yen wasn't created to replace the dollar.  Bitcoin is the worlds digital currency.They can exist in the same realm of course.
Haha, I see the flaws. Just like I saw the flaws with my 28k modem and my $5000 100mb harddrive, but I also saw that these issues were being addressed and corrected as I used them.  Early adopters of the web didn't harass the shit out of the developers at that time because we were grateful for the tech,we saw the future and how it was being addressed, just like now.  
Bitcoin is a pool being filled.  Instead of using a garden hose and slowly climbing over time, its being filled with a geyser and its splashing around like a motha fucker right now.  When it peaks it will be calm, so give it some time.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:56:47
Uh oh, not  Element  Now I see its true value. Oh shit, but there is  which is 10 times as rare as gold.  It must be fucking 10 times as expensive.  Shit its not?  Now Im fucking confused.

I agree if you are talking about the network effect.  I smoked for 20 years, saw a cnn story on ecigs and decided to buy one.  I had to order from China and sneak it through customs.

@_date: 2018-01-27 19:06:01
Very possible and almost guaranteed if it doesn't go to zero.  People like Ronnie Moas, one of the most successful stock analysis in the world for the last 10 years thinks so. He likes to say "in 2 years 100s of millions of people are going to want to get their hands on bitcoin and there will only be 21 million available", so I'm with Ronnie.

@_date: 2018-01-23 18:42:20
Golds real value is about $60 an ounce by usage then and Facebook trades at 18x times over value, I suspect it's more like 50x.  Speculation of value is the American way.  
There is about 21 trillion in offshore banking. Let's see, I want to move and hide money.  It will take me 3 companies to move it through,then a few banks and it will end up in a place that I probably don't trust, so I will need a few of these around the world, let's say decentralized from each other, or I can use bitcoin from my office.
  If you can't find true value in bitcoin, there's not much to say.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:14:51
This would be a great time for bitcoin enthusiasts that work there to start  sabatoging their systems from the inside.  I think they would appreciate the nature of decentralization if a hack helped leviate some of their capital.  I'm not endorsing this, just saying it would be fun to watch, just in case some cia/nsa/fbi dudes are listening.  Of course they are, haha!

@_date: 2018-01-16 16:19:36
Bitcoin is a shelf to hold my wealth from the falling prey of  qauntative easing.  I will wait for the currency part to get resolved.  
We need to remember 1 thing.  Your money is going to zero, your governments are going to collapse and your tomorrow is 10 times worse for you than your parents!  Those are the gaurantees, maybe Bitcoin is not %100 for sure, but it's still a better bet.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:10:18
It isn't hard now, with funny money entering it almost daily, but just wait.  I went through 2 big downturns and lost enough to take 3 years to break even. People say don't buy at the all time high here all the time, we'll that is so true with the market now. Most companies are trading at 18x overvalue. Facebook being an example, I'm sure the true number here is 40x.

I think it depends on who gets elected the next president.  Not a fan of Trumps, but Wallstreet loves him.  So if he got reelected, I think it would be a short slump and if it's a Dem, who knows.  Dems are usually better for the people and Republicans for the money.
Either way, I think it would be like a sunami.  A bunch of money pulls out, then woosh, a whole bunch of money runs in.

Ether has no history and the history it has is of a centralized nature.  Look at this "Buterin decided to turn back the clock through a software update and reset the entire system to its previous state"  because of a hack.
From nov. 2017
"In what may be the biggest hack in digital currency’s short history, an ethereum-based company has suffered an attack that resulted in more than $156 million in digital currency being frozen and inaccessible"

"I don't know how much gold there is in the ground, but I know how much bitcoin there is, and in two years there will be 300 million people in the world trying to get their hands on a few million bitcoin. This mind-boggling supply and demand imbalance is what is going to drive the price higher,"
Ronnie has a # 1 ranking versus more than 3,500 analysts for his 2008-2017 performance.

Ha, cmon.  Up 1000% since last year.  Find a dip in the trajectory and pretend that's now, then zoom out
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:26:36
Its ok, I'll see you when you get out.  Love you too precious 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:59:11
There's only a few Bitcoin available out there for sale right now. People keep buying them selling them to each other because nothing else is going on right now
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:45:21
Sell them once and experience that feeling of greif, it's worse than watching it go down. Now walk away and enjoy life
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:14:32
Haha, why is it that I can always pick out the american?
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:28:16
Haha, it's been a month since 19k.  All of sudden it needs a year to come back, funny.  "Yeah, nobody wants it now.  It only made a 1000% last year.  I'll stick with bonds instead" 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:22:04
If people haven't figured out by now, they pile FUD on when the market sees any low points.  It goes in cycles and no news during these down times surprises me.  
So what's next do you think?
1.Terrorist caught using bitcoin
2. China reveales possible banning of all crypto
3.North Korea/iran mining bitcoin to help ease sanctions
4. Trumps administration looking to stop etfs
5. All of the above
Haha, same bullshit, different day 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:44:14
It will spur green technology and again, bitcoin saves the world! Ha 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:32:32
Let's see, what are my choices.  One coin has been here for 8 years, safe and a great store of value.  The other, a couple months old and seems to be ran by a spoiled child with some centralized system of support. If you are a  day trader I get why fees bother you, I'm in for the long haul and do not mind spending $20 to send a $100k for now.  I'll worry about coffee later, I have visa for that and they give 5% cash back.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:51:38
Promptly?   Last one took 3 days to my bank account, not terrible.

I think the crash of mt.gox and silk road was the goverment trying slow  it down because it was set to go hyperbolic then. So probably where we will be next year, about 100k
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:29:20
The conspiracy goes something like  a $5k run to $25k on New Years Eve.  That way we go into a new year with the world watching!

I sent one from gdax a little while ago and it 10 minutes.  I have yet to have any problems anywhere and I have moved 100s of thousands around.  I don't get why there are so many stated problems? Is it the bcash guys that got stuck holding the bag at $2400 and we all know it will take a long time to get there again.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:33:26
Fees have been cheap for me, I don't get it.  You might be doing it wrong
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:50:38
You clearly have no understand if bitcoin,  I find that you are another shill to spread bullshit. I don't get it, I'm an antheist, but I don't spend all day in religious subs, why are you here?

Transfer your 401k to a checkbook ira, cost about 1200.  Then trade all you want and avoid capital gains. Don't overextend, but I see no problem with what your doing.

Bitcoin prices can stay stagnant in comparison to the falling dollar which is worth about half of what it was 20 years ago in the usa and I Would be happy.  I pay 20 to 30 percent more for food today than I did 5 years ago, 200% more for health care and it will take a small fortune to send my daughter to school.  I just invested or gambled, however you want to look it, a 100k in bitcoin.  I had to initially deposit it into an account at my local bank.  When opening the account they preceded to tell me that there was a $12 a month fee for my account.  I could not believe i just gave them a 100k and they are going to charge me to keep it.  ha Fuck the banks! The banks are not the people and when they start telling us that we are not real, remind them of 2008 and the 21 trillion dollar deficit we in the USA have, so sit the fuck down and get out of our way.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:47:17
Haha, you know that thing I thought was real, now I don't think is.  Perspective helps! It's up 1400%, , go back to the bank and get CD at 1% if you are lucky.  Fool

@_date: 2017-12-19 08:10:55
i just sent from gdax to my trezor and it took literally 2 seconds to show up and its free, so I do not get any of the bullshit i see.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:17:27
Not a bearish market because of desire, mostly due to events.  Events not unlike experienced in September, but we grew by then and the popping was just a breathe so it could run more. 
Bitcoin is on the news every night and the numbers don't lie when laid out in front of you.  It is a wonderful investment that produces outstanding returns for anyone who holds it.  The gates are full, people are screaming to get in, big money is mad because there is not enough of it around to buy in  large swaths and countries are thinking they need a stake in Bitcoin also, so I'm not real afraid of the bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:56:53
I'm not  sure how to find your writings, mainly because of this word "meteoric"!
  Why am I seeing this in every article and also in every TV peice?  I find it quite weird that a word that is rarely used is being said everywhere.  So either this Is another disagenous hit peice or you have been  subject to media manipulation. Ha When I here "meteoric" I think "mediocre". 
 I don't know, but if we are going to use that word to describe bitcoin, then to the moon makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:30:45
$18 to send $100k  seems reasonable.  I think for big money, bitcoin is its gold, for coffee drinkers I'm sure  ether or iota are fine for now, but nobody takes that.  Lightning solves most of the issues I see.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:31:13
Haha, yes I did
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:09:45
I've had no problems, maybe you aren't doing this right.  Con back later
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:19:42
I think your off.  If I am sending 10k, 100k, 1million I don't care if it takes 30 minutes and cost $20 to send.  I care this thing has been stable and unhackable for 8 years, not something that popped up 2 months ago and sees no traffic.  Age makes it the king.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:18
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:28:20
I sent 1 bit coin last night for free and it was very quick, almost scary quick, so I don't get the bullshit
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:57:58
Sent 65k for like 5$ not to mention, from coin base it's free.  My largest was last night where it cost $27 to send 20k.  So all good deals to me
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:23:19
I need security, not one that popped up 2 months ago
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:18:00
Just wait til everyone at coinbase gets their hands on it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:01:45
Haha, they don't care about your alt coins, if bitcoin fails or plunges, they all die.  Grandma don't give 2 ships about these new coins, she wants the one 8 years old and secure.  Futures market..bitcoin..water cooler talk...bitcoin. ....etf's....bitcoin.  sorry but I get tired of the idea that if bitcoin falls there is hope for other coins and there isnt.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:40:14
Haha, 95% have no fucking idea what dash is.  Grandma isn't saying get me some dash.  Wallstreet is not opening up a dash etf.  You have no idea what you are talking about.  Another Newby with .001 telling us how it is.  Bitcoin dies, they all die.  Very simple

The Genius of Bitcoin.  Early adopters and true believers earn their castles or whatever, they sell and its get adopted by the next round.  This happens over and over until the pools fill up and big money is able to move their assets across this now calm sea. 
 Use of it as a currency will outdo speculation and people will be able to reliably believe that their future cant be taken from them.  In 20 years all of us today will hold far less bitcoin than we do right now, because we spent it, but that contractor that builds our house saves his wealth in bitcoin also, so the ocean grows.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:51:58
It's just tough to argue with a moron 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:02:09
Haha.  I cannot believe you have been in the market with that statement, maybe just cryptotrading
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:58:11
You have no idea like most, I'm sorry.  There is no reason to believe it goes bear for any amount of time.  
I feel like I'm doing this every couple of weeks, but here we go.  Bitcoins growth is an emerging market.  There are people lined up at the gates to buy, worldwide.  You might think Bitcoins value is based on popularity, but it's not.  It's value is based on utility,  just maybe not here in USA yet.  Yes fees are high for small transactions but for moving large amounts it's awesome and quick compared to banking.  I put my money in bitcoin and hoped I could see 10x gains in 10 years, better than most investments.  I saw 5x within months, seems high right? Wrong, there is less than 1% of the people in the world involved, but they are coming.  Why?  Because a whole bunch of people played the lottery this year and they all won.  No insider trading needed, no stock tips, no guessing at the right investments, just buy and hold! Also their dollars are collapsing.  
You can say this is all make belief, but at the end of the day when people are unemployed /underemployed,  no healthcare, rapidly rising educational cost and no where to earn 1% interest, they will just keep coming.  Bitcoin is the black hole that sucks up all this loose shit around us and hopefully a politician and banker too.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:03:33
Early adopter!  You should have seen when networking became a thing.  It took me days to get my computers talking, or the first Internet was bulliten  boards, way harder than today.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:24:57
8 years without failing or being hacked is what makes bitcoin  king
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:33:32
I don't get it! I sent from gdax to trezor.  It took like 30 seconds last night, for real and it's free.  So what is the bit chi g about?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:05:16
Sounds like bitcoin is not for you.  Go home and cuddle up with your blanky, it will be ok!  For us that is, ha
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:43:17
He means since alt coins have little traffic in comparison and that they are good to use like a small side road next to The highway.  
B...e...e.....C...a..s..h looks good because the roads are empty

Only 2/3rd 's of their customers owned it, if that.  I think it's horrible that they manipulated the market like that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:39:17
People also need to realize this is an emotional thing to many people because it's their life.  They don't see this as a get rich scheme, or a lottery.  For many this is the thing that comes along once in a lifetime, this is their last hope.  In america, the people that are getting at retirement age and the ones following behind have been left  holding bags of debt, declining dollars and wages, paying for college that cost %1000 percent more and a lack of affordable housing/ healthcare. For many, working at McDonald's at 70 might be a luxury.  People are looking at bitcoin as hope for the future even though it does move like a freight train up that mountain, which is fun to watch.
I know people will find this goofy to lay so much hope in a tulip,gamble,ponzi..... but I think this is the real deal and I can vision a near future where I will be 100% bitcoin.   
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:24:49

If I had 50k 30 years ago I could buy a house and a truck.  If I saved that 50k, today I can maybe buy a car and rent on a trailer for a year.  Tell me what's real.  The one people are running from or the one the people are running to? To many bankers own islands and to many people live in the streets.  I'll take my chances with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:15:38
Same with ether
4 hours last night from gdax
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:12:07
Because traffic is leaving for now, not as many daytraders, which might be good
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:49:18
If you think you need tier 3 then it's really teir 4.  I know it makes no sense, but you are probably not qualified enough with tier3.

The world moves a little faster in the digital age compared to 1973.  The dips are bigger, the gains taller and the payout sweeter.  Humans are evolving to try to keep pace with robots and A.I., also money is in the hands of people with bitcoin, not finacial institutions.  Little more organic and free wheeling, but fun
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:11:04
Im with you, but im a fan of conspiracies!  haha  I think bitcoin is a designed plan and if that is true, whats more dramatic for adoption than 25k on new years.  It will make everybody talk at those parties and it will lead us into 2018 with a bang..  World Adoption! haha  I love a good story
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:14:10
Sure it does

It's expensive to move gold
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:44:31
bitcoinira.com  is way to expensive.  irafinacial was $1250 to set up and transfer my ira.  Its a checkbook ira.  I run it in my own account and have a debit card so I can buy bitcoin, houses, cars or other investments.  I hold my own bitcoin keys
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:38:58
No fud, in fact just like Jim Cramer and leeman brothers, they were the ones trying to prop it up. They got me in that bubble in 99 or so, also in 2008 with the GM Bankruptsy.  GM never would have gone bankrupt and took their stock to 0 if it was up to the people, it was Wallstreet and bankers.  Not this time fuckers, haha!  Hodl
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:49:26
Yeah, you don't get it
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:05:53
This might be the first time the general public got to an investment before the banks and big business.  Something like bitcoin is a utility in a digital age and not unlike cell phones, everybody will want and need to use it. We are probably at less than 1% of involvement. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:26:52
Cellphones sucked at first, but people wanted them because they had a need or want.  Same thing here, it's just money.  Why does bitcoin have to be so expensive?  Because there is a lot of money to move and the well has to be deep eneogh
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:07:19
My transactions have had no problems and fees are really managable, so I don't get it.  Maybe try sending more than a few $s , or just holding right now because bitcoin  is very popular.  It's like gold to me because I can send 20k in like 10 minutes for a few bucks right to someone in their house and nobody can take it away from them.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:28:21
On the money!  Bitcoin's foundation is built on people.  Banks and big business love the idea of Bitcoin more than you do, but they can't say that.  For them to keep control of their ever  changing environment they need a lot of Bitcoin.  This takes time because most people don't sell.  Don't get rattled and don't sell your Bitcoin yet, it's way undervalued.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:29:36
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:24:45

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:25:00

American Government and the federal reserve failed the nation and its people.  One time we revolted with guns and militia, this time we revolt with money.   Given a real choice for the first time, we decided to vote with our money and leave.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:36:08
I feel the same when I see to many cellphones in people's hands.  I'm like this is for sure a bubble.  To many people using them and they have no idea how any of it works.  They want to speak/text everyone in the world?  What's wrong with wire transfers, snail mail and good ole MA bell.  Businesses will never allow this to happen.  
Jump off the bubble train.  They want you scared so you sell. 
Stop looking at bitcoin as currency/commodity,  think of it more as a utility.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:14:16
If you buy and hold it seems cheap to me

You missed the whole point, but I understand why.  You are not alone, yet
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:38:21
None of these hold my money either. 
 Sure, ill send cat picts with facebook, but tbey cant have my retirement. Bitcoin is a vault that everyone in the world has been trying to crack and cant.  8 years of security is way more valuable than speed or tiny transaction costs!  Yeah it might suck right now for people who own $50 of Bitcoin to move it, but move 100k for $7 to the other side of the world, tottally worth it.  
Bcash and lite coin are fun toys, but solve nothing other than the fact they have no users, so less fees and decent  speed gauranteed on a vacant highway.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:26:47
My blackberry didn't have to hold my money securely though.  8 years and bitcoin has been tottaly safe.  That's worth more than all the other alts combined.   I understand your complaints if I had a few hundred in bitcoin and I wanted to buy video games, but I have 100's of thousands and I need a system that is proven and not just 2 months old.  That's what is worth gold 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:28:41
I never thought I could use it.  I have visa for that and it pays me 5% back.  No alts beat that.  Bitcoin is a shelf right now to store my wealth and it has worked quite well. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:10:40
I know just like corn futures, that's why corn collapsed and there is no money in it.  Wait, your wrong.  Are they sharks yes, but they know that this is here to stay and that alone is a giant victory for bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-18 05:47:15
I've wondered the same.  Definitely would affect the price of bitcoin, but I think companies like this need to go away for bitcoin to be taken seriously by everyday people.

They responded now and said they sent it off to their banking partner to be reviewed and maybe will be available in a few days.  Wtf. I cannot believe how bad of a company this is.  I had trading issues where they fucked me the other day and now I just want my cash and I can't get that resolved. I asked for them to send me money order back, but I know they won't get to that email until friday. Sorry just venting, but if you look around the net you will see a lot of shady stuff with this place.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:47:38
Yeah I don't need your advice on how to invest you shill.  I am talking about an American company with very shady business dealings.  By any measure they should be shut down and possibly criminally charged for how their platform works.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:23:09
It's been 7 days and nothing, it's really unbelievable and most people are OK with this by the sounds of it.  I would not trust my money with this company if any newbies are listening.

If I complain about the electric company I don't need people telling me I shouldn't use electricity because it destroys the earth. Let's fucking complain about the electric company, and not change the subject to bullshit.  It's something they do to wash over a problem.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:03:07
Blah blah blah tether bullshit.

Wtf, there is no way anybody just watched that whole thing. Fuck, just as I start to like America again after the hearings, then boom, some dumb ass redneck comes out of the woods
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:41:35
These guys are starting it.  Opening soon with big names behind it.
30000 retailers set up

Yes it is. Money is searching for a place to hide.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:54:37
There's no reason to think a tea cup circles the sun and that tether isn't back by the money they say. They live in New York and make ten million dollars a day, why would they risk going to jail for it.  It's all fud, move on
I bet tether is more solvent than any American bank.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:27:18
How about it was made by the NSA, that's why satoshi was mad because it was presented to the CIA. Interagency fighting and all

You can buy lottery tickets in the US with a credit card, or cigarettes, alcohol, lap dances, Bongs, crack pipes, ammo, guns, Oxycontin, full service massages, veal, lamb, tannerite, fertilizer, ammonia and the list goes on.  
Now why should they stop you

No Its not. It will take days before it will be worth going back there. Traffic went poof

These guys from the prison, where they pay .30 cents an hour to fud us.  Have to feel sorry for them
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:53:36
I like req, but I feel they need to move it along faster.  Even if they get to the market first with a larger array of coins to use, I think the exchanges still might beat them in the end.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:31:00
Your right, that's why I put all my money in XIV! glad I listened to you

So, you think there were RNC leaks that he didn't publish?  I see no proof.  The only thing I saw was a very corupt Hillary Clinton and I'm glad those leaks came out.  I'm was all Bernie, so I was happy to see Julian expose the shit happening.

Haha, I don't think you get it
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:22:02
We've been here many times and if you go back and read old reddits, they all repeat the same bullcrap.  When it goes up, trolls disappear, when it goes down the wretches come out. My tinfoil hat tells me that they are paying prisoners .30 cents an hour to spread fud, but more than likely it's just the same old fucking idiots you see around reddit daily.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:47:36

If you came for the idea that the world is fucked and a shelf was needed to hold your valuables until the little boys and their toys stopped screwing shit up, this day wont effect you.

How about if you choose not to pay your TV tax they come to your house with 3 cops and want to come in and see if you have a tv, or the travel around in a van picking up tv transmissions in your home and fine you.  Not just BBC I'm sure, but still fucked.  God rest the queen or something like that haha
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:53:13
They have no money to flee with, I agree
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:36:27
Haha, how about the government listens to and records every interaction you take.  How do you avoid ever being tracked if you use the internet, doesn't matter if its blockchain or a database at that point
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:32:31
They hate bitcoin, but want the benefits of the taxes so they make laws adopting it, while sounding brutish and threatning! 2 years ago, they would have laughed at the idea.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:52:42
For who? Things cost 10 times more, people make the same as they did 20 years ago and the average person has no retirement.  How is this going well?

Biggest one, Fudding
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:13:59
I don't see anything wrong with your statement.
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:07:40
Actually I think the news will be that they talked tough, but underneath I think we are headed to some sort of adoption
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:37:46
They are feeling the heat from their people.  The market ended during one of their last fud attempts and people went broke harder than anywhere because of their exchanges being land locked  Now every story out of S. Korea is crypto positive, haha.
You would have to verify this, but i think bitcoin hit 28k on the exchange in Korea before tanking.  Government officials arrested for market manipulation.  I would not want to be in that government right now.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:42:41
So I use credit cards to buy everything like most people.  If they are going to limit credit card purchases then they should  stop people from using it on the most poplular things.  Like restaurants, groceries, bars, casinos, lottery tickets and so on because these people are the ones in debt the most.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:00:26
He won't make it to next year, so I wonder what the guy behind him thinks? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:21:57
What's funny is that I am a fairly rational person, but if bitcoin goes that low I am mortgaging my house and racking up my credit cards, ha. No seriously
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:38:39
Yep. Do it all through gdax.  coinbase is really shitty
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:54:48
Everyone will down vote me, but nobody has lost money in bitcoin ever if they hold for a year.  I've lost lots of money in the market. When something has 9 years of growth, you're not stupid for considering it a better choice.   
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:33:12
I can not believe how terrible of an article that was.  I do not get it.  I understand people hate bitcoin, but WTF is up with all this poor reporting.  These people cant be this dumb.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:31:08
Blah blah blah tether, give it a break
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:27:46
How about they round up multiple ideas from multiple sources and serve them to you with commentary and punditry.  How about hearing both sides and choosing your own stance.  I don't blame them for doing this, I think it's ok.  I've seen them be very critical of bitcoin and very open to the idea.  It's ok.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:57:01
I didn't see it, so I'll post it!  Bitcoins crash

Bitcoin moves faster in both directions but there have been plenty of 30% drops in gold.  Hope you didn't buy gold in January 13 because you have never made your money back.  I've always made my money back with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:30:13
The IMF held up a gold coin years ago and said that this was the first world currency, or European, I cant remember.  I think they will work towards some sort of currency in the future but I think they know they will have to adopt some openness to things like Bitcoin.
I think one brings the adoption of the other
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:35:39
Blah blah blah more tether crap
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:02:36
Tether is more solvent than the US banks, prove me wrong
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:20:21
Down vote me if you must, but I call bitcoin an investment.  This means something that will take time to grow and adjust, not something your just in for a month.  So either I don't believe you or you didn't belong here anyways!

The gains to bitcoin belong to the adopters, the ones who stay vigilant and ride out the ride, day trade alts, hold bitcoin

Haha, wife! I don't think so
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:50:53
There is only a couple hundred thousand coins available to buy so they can only do this so long. Your senario sounds like there is nobody else to buy and thats not true. People/institutions will pick at it til its gone
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:48:33
Because it will flyby, like a jet,on its way to 50k.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:34:13
They will exist side by side
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:26:21
Only a couple hundred thousand coins for sale at a given time, so instatutions mass buy until it gets to high, then go away and wait for the bleeding to end and spread large amounts of FUD, then come back for more.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:42:54
Then you will learn a good lesson, it's a win win for you
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:43:34
Haha, so do think this was true last year or the year before then? Nope, you guys have no sense, just talking hands.  Next year it will be, bitcoin atms are more than double and you will blather the same.

@_date: 2018-02-06 17:39:23
Well talk in a month or two and then you can tell me how it's not digital gold and nobody wants to hold it.  I understand the people who fomo on the way up and guys like you on the way down.  In a world that is collapsing and the dollars that are added to spreadsheets are worth less than the ink that writes it, there is a need for bitcoin.  Decentralized, proof of work and scarce, only one of a kind.
Ronnie Moas says " I don't know how much gold there is in the ground, but I do know how many bitcoin there is and in a few years millions of people are going to try to get their hands on it"  I agree

@_date: 2018-02-13 10:14:57
Take 10 minutes and go through the history of bitcoin through reddit posts.  Go back 1 year, 2 years and so on and read the same exact posts, just like yours, there are a lot.  
If you dont think that everyone of those people who posted that question doesnt kick themselves in the ass for not buying or buying more, people are fooling themselves.

Crypto is a lot like investing in the tech boom.  I bought priceline, Netflix and ebay when there was little info available to the general public.  I bought them because I liked the idea and I could see a future.  I think most people do that here.  It still investing, just easier in an emerging market and it does seem like easy money.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:40:41
Ronnie Moas says there is 200 trillion in investments throughout the world, bitcoin will grab 2% to 4%.  That put bitcoin at a min of 80k.  I think this is when it starts to stabilize

I am
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:12:49
haha, it think they better.  Sounds like Chris Giancarlo of the CFTC had a problem with it on twitter.  I hate MOST government oversight, but...   haha
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:45:21
They are already pump and dumping per say.  The US has been printing money like a madman and putting it into the stock exchange, that money will flow into bitcoin also , so they are basically devaluing their dollar to own securities and assets.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:46:34
I'd do what I'm already doing, getting as much as possible as soon as possible
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:37:06
Could that also be taken as they will not accept it for any kind of government transactions? I think this would be equel to Washington  stating that you can't pay taxes with it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:29:37
Been there, done that, not happening again. If people haven't caught on, this shit happens regularly.  In 3 months we will all have collective amnesia and forget and get stuck again in some bullshit coins and freak out! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:46:58
Bitcoin is hated for the same reason you asked for people who own at least 1.  Nobody can own one anymore.  They want their coin worth .30 cents to be bigger since they can't have yours.
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:54:28
Yep, that's why their stock is dropping like a brick
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:00:30
Haha, I've been here and yes he supported 2x but it's because he wanted segwit, he admits that 2x might not have been the be all solution, but also thought bcash doesn't address the problems either.  If he supported bcash so much, don't you think he would own some.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:06:02
Weak hands are gone and I don't think they will be able to continue this FUD much longer. not to many of us give a shit and the people they are talking to now might show up on their doorstep if it continues. Haha

I wouldn't say even, he's left the community.  He has shown his true colors and took a lot of newbies on a ride.  Yes, people shouldn't listen to these people to make their descisions, but he talked with confidence which they followed and now he left them hanging.  Fuck him.  If you listen to anybody it should be people like Andreas and Ronnie Moas.

How about a central authority that has registered as a security with all the proper authorities around the world and  its audited regularly.  If you have to use something like tether to offload your crypto, why not do it with something like gold instead, makes sense to me.  
2018 is the year that crypto and wallstreet start to merge.  You will have centralized industries with decentralized, its just a fact

I think the difference is that UNY or DIG is hooked up with a gold security and DigixDAO is mining.  Also the big difference is that UNY will always be $1, so its a tether replacement.

Well first, bitcoin is speculation, just like gold.  
There is no fake demand to Bitcoin, but obvisouly the market got to far ahead of itself. 
Bitcoin cant be a bubble, just like facebook cant be in a bubble. 
and lastly bitcoin is blockchain. There is a solution if you dont want to use Bitcoin, its called a database.  Databases work better and faster than Bitcoin and there is already an infrastructure and developers that do this everyday.  The problem lies in trust.  You might blindly trust or turn your back to the huge gaps this world offers the people, but thats what brought a lot of people here.
What give Bitcoin value, People.  Whats gives Facebook value, People.  What gives Fiat value, people.  No speculation required.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:05:55
I understand what you are saying but let's be a little more realistic.  How about don't keep all your coins on 1 exchange.  Split them out between 4 or 5 in smaller amounts and some in a hard wallet. Unless you don't trade, them take them off.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:43:23
They should disclose every inside trade they do first.

I tried frantically to find a place to move my funds during the 08 crash to no prevail. Gold would have cost me 15% over market value to get in and realestate was crashing.  Now I have bitcoin to run to and it's payed off immensely, just my 2 cents
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:33:22
Fuck the banks.  The true speculators here are those very institutions.  They are gambling with customers and they have put the country in the hole.  They want you to go deep into debt and carry it for years, just not to deep.  They take a bet, they only need 3 out of ten for it to payoff because of their 24.99% interest rates.  If they qualified you because of credit score, job time, debt liability and so on, they should fuck off on what I can use it for.  Do not think they are trying to save you, they are trying to save themselves.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:21:31

@_date: 2018-02-02 14:51:13
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:52:38
Well my tinfoil hat theory has been that they have been purposely devaluing the dollar.  They found a new asset class in bitcoin and crypto, so by devaluing the dollar, 21 trillion doesnt seem that much compared to this new world currency.  
The world is 220 trillion in debt.  Instead of wiping debt like they did after WW2, they create something more valuable.
So I agree, anything is possible
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:53:24
They might have more invested in the computer setup than crypto

What people think of as FUD, is adoption.  Who thought 2 years ago any nation would allow crypto?  So they are adopting by putting rules in place. I'm OK with kyc and shit like that right now because it will bring more.  There is no government that will close the doors to the taxes that crypto is and will bring in, they need any source of financial infusion they can get.

As Ronnie Moas says, "I don't know how much gold there is the ground , but I know how much bitcoin there is and in a few years there will be 100 million people trying to get their hands on it"  also he mentions " there are 220 trillion investments around the world and if only 2% comes to bitcoin it would put the value at 100k to 300k" and he admits he is quite conservative on these numbers, so I would say yes, it's a possibility.

 I would understand if it was best buy or GM, but in crypto this is crazy.  What can happen on 1day/1week/1month can happen in 2 hours.  Either you were here for the longterm or you should not have been here in the first place.

@_date: 2018-02-13 17:07:07
I think the coin will always be $1, it's the amount of gold that will fluctuate, that's why it will compete with tether.  Now, how and when it goes to a 1$, I don't know. I know they have some big announcements coming up in the next few weeks.  So for me, I just keep buying it for now.  I've bought at .006 all the way to .08 and I'll be buying more later.
From what I understand is that they have already aquired the gold along with filing as a security in the nation's they will be servicing.  I could be wrong about the details, but from the info I know about, I'm in deep.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:25:24

Bitcoin being software gives it the ability to change.  What other coins offer might be more inovative, but inovation doesn't necessarily mean safe.  So basically, being the safest first is more important and the changes that come later will incorporate the best of other crypto.  Just my 2 cents

It was only a month ago when the exchanges closed their door to new customers because it was to busy.  If you wanted to get a large amount of cash into bitcoin in Nov., it took almost a month to get past coinbase/kraken and so on.  
Institutions might try to shake big investors, but the people were lined up at the gates and couldnt get in.  I suspect places like Korea are going to be scrambling to fix its FUD problem because the people are pissed and nobody has talked about the Russians yet, its going to be an interesting year.

They kill people for carrying a plant, haha. You've got some fucked up thinking.  
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:11:26
They do pay prisoners .30 cents an hour to do telemarketing, maybe they are using them. Haha. But maybe

Cost of mining is what makes it secure.

I did it all through  . Read through the site, they answer almost all your questions.  They did everything for me.  Basically they are the ira holders, but you set up an llc(which they set up) and they give you the funds to deposit in your llc bank account.  You have checkbook control, so you can get a debit card and send the money to whatever investment you choose as long as it fits in their criteria.  Example- you can buy crypto, buy a car and sell it as an investment , buy a business and so on.  They have all the legal info on their site and will walk you through it.  They were great

I hope it crashes and burns.  We live in an oligarchy and I hope the people one day show up at the doorsteps of the few with pitchforks.  I understand you have to live in this system, but to support it is immoral.
If you are not one of 200 people in this world, I do not understand how and why you would defend it.

Yes it will, when redundant newbies find a new cause.  I'm expecting it will be TX times , cost of TX times, more Warren buffet news comes out,  lightning is unsecure, wolf of Wallstreet throws up again, China banning, India banning, bcash is bitcoin, or a man bought at 20k after taking out a mortgage.  So what's next?
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:05:24
I agree, screw crypto and it's losses.  I'm all XIV!

They hire prison labor for .30 c ents an hour to shill here, give him a break, he's almost earned his GED

Jamie Demon and demonettes need to go away.  The next generation wont bother with JP Morgan, they leave a bad taste in everyones mouth

Just like hookers, gambling, lottery tickets, strip joints and so on.  This is not for any reason other than  they know their days are coming to a close

Yes I understand that,  but how do you know that Julian is holding it back, I see no evidence

Bullcrap, voltitlity in bitcoin is that it is  always going up, 3 steps forward, 2 steps back, but always up.
If you purchased gold in 2011, you've yet to come close to making it back.  It's a stupid investment that has lost a lot of people a lot of money.
Go fuck yourself gold, there's a new sheriff!

Roger rabbit pays him to say that.  .30 cents ah hour for prison labor

We love them like a hooker likes a john, give us your cash and leave.

Because even if there was a problem, which there is absolutely no reason to believe there is, it would not effect much.

Bitfinex have a huge business that is making over $10m a day. The owners live in NYC with families. Why would they risk a business that makes 4bn a year for a few $100m USD?
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:26:13
haha, you know its the opposite.  Men who are trapped in caves have larger survival rates if they hold out hope.  
Now for a 100k. How can you not tend to think that there is a possibility for that to happen.  I admit the odds of it happening are very low, but with past performance you have to be blind to not think there is a chance.
