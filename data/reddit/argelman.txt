umm nope.. the 5$ VM has 512Mb ram and a 20Gig drive, both not sufficient for running a client (or even storing the complete blockchain).
the 10$/Month VM has 1GB ram and 30Gig drive space.. should work in theory, but i had issues with instability due to memory usage and had to upgrade to the 20$/Month instance with 2 GB ram and 40Gig drive to run a stable node.

nope, mostly because the only offer it in one location, and my main reason for switching was the Frankfurt Datacenter.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:12:54
I switched to Vultr, because they (now) have more locations than DigitalOcean and are slightly cheaper. ;)

Exactly this.
When credit cards where introduced here, they already required a dial-in connection so the difference between debit and credit cards are pretty much invisible for the consumer. 
For the Shopowners the fees of the credit cards make it extremely undesireable, since they can get the same functionality a lot cheaper, so most small to medium shops dont bother with "real" credit cards.
Also, German credit cards don't actually give you credit. The amount due usually is directly transferred from your account a few days later, as with debit cards.

My guess is that Bofingers point is to wean Germans from the very cash driven commerce today.

I just want to give a shout out to  where you can donate to support full nodes on the network.

to add a little background. Bitcoin.de is run by a German GmbH (German limited liability company with a maximum liability of 20.000 Eur) and thus is subject to German and European law.
In Europe any organization that holds funds for it's customers must Have a Banking License. This is the reason PayPal didn't (officially) allow European accounts before 2007.
see 
Currently they only allow deposits in Bitcoins. If you buy on their platform, you will be given the Banking information of the seller and will have to manually file a bank transfer, that the seller will have to manually confirm before the traded Btc are added to your account.

hehe sorry, but as a German this amuses me a little, Since a lot of regular (as in "real world, walk in") Stores here don't accept Visa or Credit cards because of the 4% fee they would have to cover opposed to selling in cash or using cheaper domestic systems.
Anyhow, i don't think this would make much of a difference for Bitcoin at the moment because of overall Volatility. (Bc value fluctuated at least 7% in the last week).

Payment is done with so-called "BitCoins", a (in general) legal, virtual currency, which can be converted into any real currency by online portals (and payed out again).
