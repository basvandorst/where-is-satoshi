Where are you from?  If you are a US citizen, you need to renounce citizenship as well as move.  You can purchase an Antigua citizenship for \~$130k and move either there or Georgia (the country) and renounce US citizenship, then you're tax free for future gains.
If you're from anywhere other than the US or Eritrea, you can keep you current citizenship - just move to Georgia or another country without capital gains tax and you're set (for future gains, no escaping tax on any unrealized gain on your moving date).

My strategy is to sell 10-20% every doubling of the price - this paid off my initial investment 32 times over, while retaining a meaningful exposure.

I'm using the "Bitcoin Lightning" app for Android.  Are these fees time-based, or something else?  My channel is 300,000 satoshis, and the fees are 12,399 satoshis so far.  They don't seem to be associated with transactions, as they are deducted at seemingly random times.  Actual transaction fees have only been about 20 satoshis so far.

Debt is one of the most powerful wealth builders out there...why would one want to eliminate their debt, especially with interest rates so low?  I have become much, much richer through strategic use of debt.

USD is physical, bitcoin can be transported quickly and easily across borders.  Good luck moving large quantities of physical USD safely into/through/out of Venezuela.

Only about 0.5% of the world population are millionaires, so it is definitely has meaning globally.  If you are referring to New York or Los Angeles, then you have a point.
I spend my time in Tbilisi, Medellin, and Kuala Lumpur.  One million USD goes very, very far in all of those cities.

It depends how much you have already invested, and how much cash you have available.  If you are just starting to accumulate, low prices are good, whereas if you have almost finished accumulating, low prices are bad.

That's why I said tax free for future gains.  Past gains will always be taxed, even if you are from a country with residence-based taxation.

I do buy at every price lower than my target price, but I buy more the greater the differential between my target price and the current price.  The reason I continually buy more is because I have income - I have a constant stream of new funds to invest.
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:39:31
Bitcoin has certainly served me much better than banks in international transfers, especially considering I've had an average of one account frozen every month for arbitrary reasons.  There is nothing stopping me from both using bitcoin, and also holding it as an investment/speculation.
Gold and silver have been valuable for over 5000 years...not sure how you can call them "speculative" at this point.  They are volatile, but the risk in holding either decreases with holding period, a characteristic quite unique among assets.  Considering fiat money has a failure rate of 100% and a guaranteed loss over the long term, there really isn't any better alternative.

Would you rather buy a commodity that soared 9999999999999999999%?
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:06:42
You aren't understanding that I am investing income as I receive it.  I am already fully invested in various assets, with the funds I have at the moment.  As an example, let's say I have $10,000 now and receive $1000 to invest every week.  In a year I will have invested $60,000 total, but I don't have those funds now.
Yes, of course it's not a certainty price will increase. It's called speculating.  I am 100% fine with a total loss of my investment, and this will not stop me from continually buying more - because the potential gain far outweighs the potential loss.

There are varying degrees of socialism - they're not 100% socialist, where the state would own everything, but based on tax rates and government share of GDP I'd say they're at least 50/50 socialist/capitalist.

How is it unusable?  I've been paying my phone bill using Lightning for months now.

Very true - would still be pretty cool though! 
@_date: 2018-11-16 16:33:38
Yes, that's true as well - probably why portfolio cash allocations are so high.  Many people keep a huge chunk of their portfolio in cash, being eaten away by inflation.

The majority of uneducated investors are always wrong.  They were wrong at the $20k top, and they are wrong again now.

Bitrefill, and they support many mobile carriers (I use them with Telcel).  They generate a lightning invoice, I pay it, and I receive my mobile top-up within seconds.  Yovopay is an alternative service that does the same thing, although I haven't tried them. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 07:50:03
Extremely capitalist society?  Which country are you from?  Much of the world is quite socialist, and constantly becoming more so. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:24:52
Sure they do, because they are looking for opportunities to buy more.   I monitor the bitcoin price, not to sell, but to buy. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:41:37
Why stay in the US?  Look at Georgia (the country)...no capital gains tax, low income tax, high standard of living, probably the most capitalist country in the world.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:37:56
I would agree with you, if this were a roulette wheel.  It is an asset with intrinsic value (although many would argue with that).  If you buy the same stock with a P/E ratio of 10 or a P/E ratio of 30, all other factors equal, which one has a better risk/reward ratio?
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:21:15
I'd buy them all first, when BTC hits 1 cent

Financial planners are certainly not good sources of advice - their returns are generally abysmal, underperforming indices consistently. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:16:14
When I spend bitcoin or use it to transfer cash, I replace it (using it as a transfer tool).  This is separate from my investment holdings.
The utility of gold comes from its use as money, and a store of value.  It doesn't need industrial use to have utility.  In the case of silver, there is a significant industrial demand and also monetary demand, so it is much more hybrid money/industrial commodity.  Gold has substantially outperformed the Dow Jones over the past two decades, so it hasn't been a bad investment for the entire time period I have been holding it.  It is cyclic, just as almost everything else...gold was a great investment in the 70s, a horrible investment the next two decades, and a great investment the last two decades.  Long term it underperforms productive assets, but it is also much lower risk when held for the long term.  Gold initially declined in the 2008 crisis in the rush to liquidity, but soared in the aftermath long before other assets recovered.  I expect the same of bitcoin, were we to experience a similar crisis. 
Productive assets are no golden ticket.  If you invested in a Japanese stock index 30 years ago, you are still underwater.  They performed well in the US from World War II to 2000, but I highly doubt this performance will be repeated going forward. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:54:01
If you think this is a significant risk, you should probably move to a country that better protects your rights - you have a lot more to worry about than just your private keys, in such a country.

I can understand why - it is a perfect application for lightning.  Here in Mexico, I pay my phone bill through bitrefill with lightning...cheap, fast, and convenient.

This is very well documented.  Finanvial advisers and their clients have ROIs 3% below market on average.  Meanwhile, my personal overall return has averaged 12% over the past two decades.  Just one example:

It is human nature to overestimate one's own risk tolerance...but then, without this we would never have capitulation. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:34:21
Yes, it's not ideal.  Unfortunately that's the best we can do until bitcoin volatility becomes much lower - however, this is a result of the small market cap, nothing to do with Lightning technology. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 17:32:04
Plenty of alts have come back through multiple bubbles - for example, Litecoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:28:08
A big shift happened the last few days - many if not most, now seem to expect bitcoin to go to zero.   Definitely a positive sign. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:52:02
It's not waiting on the sidelines, it's future income I don't have yet. If I had all my future available income today, of course I would buy today.  I buy a basket of many assets every time I receive new income - crypto, metals, stocks, bonds, etc.   The weighting of each depends on how cheap or overpriced it is. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 04:07:32
Yes, I agree.  I didn't mean to imply that I don't feel this is a risk - in fact, I left my home country (Canada), as I saw many basic freedoms being quickly eroded.  There are often significant differences between the theoretical rights and freedoms in a country, and those actually observed in practice.  My personal preference is to live in a country with an inept/weak government.  This way, I am protected regardless of political climate.
@_date: 2019-01-24 07:28:07
Very nice, looks convenient.  Thanks for sharing!  
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:08:40
Yes, it does look that way - judging by past cycles, it is typically ~1 year to the bottom, then ~18 months sideways (very roughly).  Of course we could still go lower, but risk/reward looks excellent to me at these levels. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 16:29:14
All of Western Europe, Canada, Oceania, US to only a slightly lesser extent, and in theory Latin America (in practice, much more capitalist).

Bitcoin was only a very small portion of my portfolio...otherwise I would have had astronomical returns.   If a financial adviser isn't actively managing investments, then why use one? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:16:00
I don't "expect" the price to fall, but it could.  I can't predict the future, so I work with probabilities.  A lower price without a change in fundamentals means a better risk/reward ratio, and therefore I am willing to invest more.  The same applies to a stock, bond, or anything else.  Make sense?
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:29:26
You are thinking in absolutes.  I am thinking in probabilities.  I believe it will most likely be higher in the future, but I am not certain of that...at a lower price, the potential gain is higher relative to the potential loss, so I am willing to bet more on that probability.  And yes, I know I am losing money right now on my crypto position, and I am fine with that...across my entire portfolio of assets, I have achieved a positive return every year of the past decade, so I believe my strategy is effective.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:53:28
Sure.  The true value of bitcoin is in transfer of value quickly, cheaply, and without government interference (especially internationally).  The banking system/government regulation have become such a joke that bitcoin is far more practical in many cases, Venezuela being a prime example.  I know from firsthand experience how useful bitcoin is in such a context, and as a perpetual traveler, I constantly use it in my daily life.
This is the fundamental difference between my analysis and yours - from your perspective, it is gambling on a useless asset, the same as "tulips."  To me, it is a valuable commodity, just as gold or silver...although of course, much more volatile and high risk.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:36:51
This should not be unexpected when investing in something as volatile as bitcoin.  Have these people panicking never looked at a long term chart?  Bitcoin has had many large "crashes" in the past - and yet people are surprised by a 70% decline.  Very short sighted thinking.
