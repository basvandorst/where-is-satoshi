You have to understand that bitcoin is different from dogecoin, dogecoin community actually care for dogecoin while bitcoin community is a bunch of sad people who lost money when they bought for $700 and only care about the price, they wont sponsor anything because they dont have any money to spend. I ll get downvoted but this is the reality of this sub.

They will use Unionpay. The fee really varies depending on every country, you can check yours here 
+ cryptexp´s fee  then its the same as for example a neteller card (neteller.com) sums that company fee+the processor fee is 4% + the currency conversion fee which is usually between 1-2% (1,5% most cards). You can ask support in unionpay for exact fees for your country anyways.

Because these are business man, not bitcoiners . They want to invest in a business, like an exchange, a service , etc that earns money from fees from the deluded bitcoiners. Those guys won't be buying tons of bitcoins or anything like that, they will be investing in a business that charges you a fee to use your beloved bitcoins. No surprise there to me, they know only kids and deluded idiots will be buying bitcoins and using those services and they will be charging you fees for every stupid shit you pay with btc.

They banned the other guy for telling you because dumb mods, but ok , I will tell you , hopefully they dont ban me for saying what the fees are...jeez..
4% per withdrawal +1,5% conversion fee to local currency (if different from your cryptex currency)
So as the other guys who got baned already said, this offers nothing but a bunch of fees to use your bitcoins.
