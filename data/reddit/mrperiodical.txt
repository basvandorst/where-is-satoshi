Look at altcoins.
Literally go open CMC and click on a random altcoin.
 Check how it's been doing the past two months.

There are 3 reasons why people are in crypto.
1 - Potential profit
2 - Buying stuff anonymously
3 - Usability
For all three you're better off with alts than Bitcoin. 
The only reason you'd even own Bitcoin is because it was first. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:59:11
Okay? 
Do whatever the fuck you want.

I know you all like to hate on alts.
But really most alts doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled in price throughout the last month, so even a 30% pull back on all of them isn't that much..
Lemme see BTC quadruple in one month.

Bitcoin interest is a fad. 
Exactly like PokemonGo, Fidget spinners, etc.
If we don't make changes immediately the fad will die. Along with the value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:35:43
For the most part all coins are gonna crash hard initially due to the USD drop in BTC. Once BTC starts rallying the following should happen until maybe late summer when there's another altcoin season.
Useless pump and dump coins like XDN, DOGE, REDD are gonna crash constantly. 
Coins with good backing and devs that actually care about the coin are gonna crash/stay level overall, but have random pump spikes throughout. Examples are DASH, XMR, and XLM.
Then you have coins that could actually be used post crypto bubble pop. These will crash constantly but could explode like ETH did last year at any moment. Examples are LINK, KNC, ZRX, and VEN. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:13:08
I just don't get why you would keep holding while the price is plummeting but maybe that's just me. 
I left in december, switched to alts, and made good profit.
Now I just switch back and forth between USDT and BTC to increase my BTC holdings.

As someone who tripled his portfolio with alts in the past two weeks..
I'm glad you all didn't buy Bitcoin for profit!
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:09:00
What's sad is that people like you must think alts are shit just because they don't currently have Bitcoin's market cap.
When in reality most alts tripled or even quadrupled in market cap over just the last month. Now Lemme me see Bitcoin quadruple in a month. 
So from a profit perspective alts are 1000 times better. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:26:13
Because DOGE is a truly useless coin.
Absolutely no one buys it except for whale pump and dump groups and then public investors who see green bars in altcoin season. DOGE doesn't even get news to cause random fluctuations. 
It makes the chart extremely easy to read.

@_date: 2018-01-06 05:07:40
I think you missed my point. Profit is not about current price. It's about how many times over the current price can increase.
Alot of people here dream of Bitcoin hitting 1 million. From 17k right now that's a 60x increase in value.
Now imagine buying into a new quality alt at $1. It would only have to go up to $60 to get the exact same return for your investment.
Now what's more likely? Bitcoin being worth 1 million, or a an alt being worth $60.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:52:13
The entire problem is that Segwit is optional.
Block size increases are mandatory.

Less people are using Bitcoin, that's the main reason why fees are down.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:01:04
OP this is not good for BTC holders.
This means less and less people are trying to do BTC transactions, which if you care about the price of BTC going is not good news.

I have to use dumb analogies because the people who haven't realized Bitcoin truly is a bubble are idiots who just chase green bars.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:25:28
Take this information as you wish I don't give a shit if you don't believe me.
Whales were pumping altcoins during the past month and a half, which is by Bitcoin went stagnant. Whales do this with altcoins about every 8 months or so. Check out the all time BTC-DOGE chart. It's the clearest example of when this is happening.
The current dump in BTC price are whales lowering the price of BTC so they can switch back to it cheaper because they're finally through with pumping alts. 
TLDR; Bitcoin is about to go on a serious bull run. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:05:49
I mean your right about the bull run, but it's not gonna be because of new tech.
It's because rich people wanna be richer.

1) I did. I invested in req and gained 50% over the past two days, but that's not the point.
2) The reality is 99% of people are here for money. You say that like greed is a bad thing. Sure there's some weird people here saying they're here for independent banking, but honestly even they're in BTC for the money. If BTC started crashing to 2k tomorrow I guarantee even they would drop the coin.
3) If those people really believe in decentralized banking without caring about price changes, they would switch Ripple or RaiBlocks.

A computer does a really hard math problem to create bitcoins. As time goes on it the math becomes harder and harder until bitcoins are impossible to create. 
Eventually there will only ever be 21 million.
The value comes from whatever people are willing to pay for a coin.

I take my laptop literally everywhere. To work, to school, on planes, everywhere. 
I'm not going to run around with a much heavier laptop, with a shittier battery life for gaming. Gaming is not the priority. I currently have the 2013 XPS 13, and I easily get 8 hours of battery everyday. I don't even worry about charging it some nights.
Now that you understand the laptop, sure I could get a full fledged PC if I wanna game, but what's the point? All my files are already on the laptop. What if I wanna do work at home? I'd have to worry about keeping files in sync between the two computers. If I just get the external dock I can come home plug in one single cable and go immediately to a desktop setup with a monitor, external graphics, mouse, keyboard, no hassle. 
For $2,300 I get both amazing portability, and great specs if I wanna game.

1 - Sorry, I don't know the future.
2 - Download the coinbase app
3 - Monoero is also good right now. If your looking into altcoins checkout Bittrex. (Also Doge but only if the price takes a massive dip.to under 20sats)
4.1 - A bubble is when a bunch of retail investors(people like you and me) buy a stock cause it's going up so we all flood in and raise the price. The bubble pops when the price takes a small dip causing some to panic sell. Leading more to panic sell. Leading to a crash.
4.2 - In a way Bitcoin right now is kinda like a bubble, but the massive difference is there can only be 21 million coins maximum. Remember there are 7 billion people, and 300 million people in America alone.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:09:46
No..it doesn't but guess what..
If we simply changed the constant. The problem could be fixed tomorrow. 
And guess what else the Lightning Network everyone wants wouldn't have to be rushed, while we sit here stalling bitcoin's growth with extremely slow transactions..
What's extra funny is that Satoshi meant for the 1mb blocks to be temporary, but he never changed it back before he left. Yet everyone here acts like it needs to be this way.

Okay. I get we need consensus, but I want to understand why anyone would disagree.


Drive centralization is this the reason? Why do so many people say this is a bad thing. The number one complaint about BTC are the slow transactions and high fees. Why is this important than those?


This doesn't matter. We have a problem apply the quick fix now, while we work on a permanent one. 


Okay so changing the block size is a exorbitant amount of work? I had no idea. Maybe this is why?


Not talking about those.


Once again apply the quick fix now, while working on the long term one. 


Don't know what these words mean, so i'm going to nod my head.
Am I understanding correctly?
To add to the 2nd one, I did some googling and apparently running a full node already has high requirements.
Are making these high requirements higher really going to affect the average person, and how centralized BTC already is?

I'm not the dude you asked but my method is ultra simple. 
Here's the coin I most recently invested in 
Remove the USD &amp; Market Cap charts completely. Only ever focus on the BTC To Crypto charts. (You have to trade whatever coin into BTC to get your USD out anyway)
Okay so now set time period to 1 year. (Cryptos hit it big this year so any information before 2017 is worthless).
Now look at dash. It's clearly going up down up down up ever 2 months or so. 
All I do is set buy order on an exchange for somewhere very close(may lower maybe higher) to the previous low points. If the buy never goes through I lose nothing. I'm simply hodling Bitcoin. If the buy does go through well clearly the price may drop a tiny tiny bit further(depending where I  placed my buy in) but over all the price has absolutely no where to go but up.
The only exception would be some crazy news that affects the price of dash. 
Now as a test go analysis the Dogecoin chart.
Note** Don't try to do daily flips. Those are too random/difficult and fees may eat your profits. Try to focus on month to month flips. But when you're setting your buy in limit you can look at how the crypto has been doing for that day. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:32:06
That's exactly what I'm saying. P
7k to 6k that's a 14% discount.

@_date: 2017-11-27 04:13:38
You're pretty much spot on.
There's 21M BTC at the maximum, and most of them are simply held.
Then there's 7B people in the world, and less than .2% are currently actively using BTC.
We could see exponential increases for years.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:51:40
I think you're calling me stupid.
But I'm not sure.

The researchers were able to extract files from the bitcoin blockchain containing copyright violations(firmware keys), privacy violations(doxxing), politically sensitive content(Tiananmen), and child porn(both links to an archive and an embedded image). 
People are just placing stuff there because it's permanent.
Personally, I suspect pedos are using another block-chain to dispute porn. One that's more friendly to uploading arbitrary data, but that's for the FBI to look into. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:03:06
You're not missing anything.
Bitcoin is an asset.
Anyone who says it's a currency is in denial. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:55:32
This is so incredibly stupid I refuse to believe eight other people agreed with you.
The glaringly obvious difference in that example is that the evidence cannot be accessed by anyone.
With the blockchain anyone anywhere can download the images as long as they know the blocks.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:48:15
So the answer is there's no way to remove it, but you need special glasses to see it so that makes everything alright
Edit: 
Can someone address this hypothetical? 
Let's say a suspected pedophile is arrested. He is found to have no CP on his acutal computer. But they do see he runs a Bitcoin node, and he has all the software installed to look at the encrypted blockchain images.
What are the cops supposed to do?
What are the differences between him and any other node runners? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:23:58


I simply want people to be aware that this is a consequence of immutable ledgers. I have no concern over what results from the information.


You oppose spreading the truth.  
The parallel between this and Freedom of Press vs National Security is spectacular. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:05:15


Maybe you should stop reading shitty articles from obvious pro-bitcoin websites, and go directly to the research paper.
Below is a quote from the [referenced research paper](


files with sexual content. While five files only show, describe, or link to mildly
pornographic content, we consider the remaining three instances objectionable
for almost all jurisdictions: Two of them are backups of link lists to child pornography,
containing 274 links to websites, 142 of which refer to Tor hidden services.
**The remaining instance is an image depicting mild nudity of a young woman.**
The researchers were able to pull both archives and a complete embedded image. 
An image that anyone can go back and pull whenever they want as long as they knew the block locations, because it's permanent. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:12:04
For anyone who doesn't understand the blockchain contains child porn.

What? Being anti-pedophile is political now? Jesus Christ. You're a mentally warped person. 
I'm not here because I want "blockchain banned". In none of my comments have I ever said that. I'm heavily invested in cryptocurrency if Bitcoin went to $10, I'll likely be screwed.
I'm here to spread the truth, and the truth in this instance is MORE IMPORTANT THAT MONEY. Everyone else on subreddit is motivated soley by greed. I understand it. They don't want soccer mom's and the less technically inclined to think blockchain is used to distribute CP, but the truth is this is exactly what it could be used it.
Personally, I have a sneaking suspicion the Bitcoin blockchain was just a test and pedophiles are using another blockchain that's more friendly to arbitrary data to distribute. But to act like that isn't happening, and isn't worth discussing is lying.
You don't even know how many people I've had to correct to let know it wasn't just web links. Then explain you can actually embed anything you want pernamently in the blockchain.
But really what all this comes down to is that you have greed and I have morals. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:56:04


Simply replace photoshop with whatever program pedos would use and point it at the blockchain.
Your anaology isn't helping your argument. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:00:10


I'm going to make this as clear as possible to you.
The CP on the blockchain CANNOT BE ERASED.
The CP found anywhere else CAN BE ERASED.
Do you now understand how serious the difference is?
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:57:55


And there it is.
Whataboutism to defend child porn.
Greed really is an awful thing. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:37:17
They're going to kill this.
There is no solution, except for the one that'll send Bitcoin to sub $50.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:59:19
Let me point out why this idea is terrible.
At the most basic level an image is basically an alignment of 1's and 0's.
You're literally saying having a CP jpeg file isn't a big deal, instead blame photoshop for combining the file into the image. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:33:47
I'm gonna let you in a little secret.
You seem to think our goal is to be invested in crypto for 10, 20, or whatever ridiculous amount of years, and use the profits to supplement a regular job.
That's wrong. My goal is to retire by 2020.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:06:39
You made me laugh OP.
Well done. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:37:46
The thing is.
This is a once in a life time opportunity. You can enter crypto now and potentially make life changing money. I'm not even kidding. 
Sure the "crypto bubble" may pop, but we're not even close to the 5 trillion evaluation from when the dotcom bubble popped. And remember this is a global market not US only. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:58:19
This isn't an answer to what I'm asking 
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:23:21
That's nice.
My crypto portfolio is up 500% since I started in mid November.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:54:25


I hope you know this is not true.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:28:32
Thank you OP
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:20:46
I don't think you understand what i'm saying. It's not about the file extensions. 


Photoshop renders ones and zeros on a computer(from a file) into a CP image.
The program pedos would use renders ones and zeros on a computer(from the blockchain) into a CP image. 
I don't see how and why you're drawing a distinction between these programs?
@_date: 2018-03-25 01:18:37
Let me be perfectly clear.
In none of my comments did I offer a solution or say anything along the lines of saying I personally had a solution. 
All I wanted to do was correct you because your understanding of the situation, where the CP was, and how anyone could access it was completely wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:23:53
But this doesn't even mean the article is wrong..
I'm so confused 
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:39:19
What are the possible solutions to CP being pernamently stored in the blockchain?
If I was running a node, I'd feel pretty uncomfortable downloading the entire blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:56:36
Volume and RSI signals it may be rising further soon.
Even if it does do one more massive drop to 5k I'd still buy in right now.
8k is a massive discount already from the ATH of 20k. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:49:56
Tbh I do think this is the last major dip for this bear run.
Even if it's not everything's still cheap enough to buy in now 
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:38:37
Why would this in anyway affect your coinbase assets? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:38:04
There's a massive difference.
Bitcoin raised in priced in 2017 due to retail investors. 
Bitcoin raised in price pre-2017 due to people buying it for DNM.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:30:33
No matter how you attempt to spin it 7% per year is complete garbage compared to crypto. I also really enjoy how you said "reliably" when the DOW just crashed this week.
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:25:10
Ummm you do understand that it doesn't matter who placed it there...?
That does nothing to change the fact that anyone anywhere has the ability to access it forever...
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:26:28
All you do is cash out slowly..
Every time you reach a milestone cashout something like 20%. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:51:13
This is an issue for every blockchain that allows arbitrary data. 
What's spectacular to me is how quickly this subreddit is moving backwards on this issue.
It's gone from complete denial with "bitcoin's blockchain doesn't have CP".
Straight to acceptance with "bitcoin's blockchain has CP, but it's no big deal" 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:25:33
You're really out here acting like CP being accessible by anyone in the world is the same as preserving evidence in court cases.
I really don't understand...
Yes. It's not a click and download situation, but the metholody is simple enough to learn.
The [research paper]( explains exactly how they found and accessed it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:52:37

2 - My overarching goal at the moment is 25 million.

I didn't say it's the worst..i said nearly which it is.
It's dropped in value 50% this past month, if you don't think that's massive then.. you're probably just in denial.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:30:56
Are you like in denial or something? 
The 50% drop this past month is huge.
[This is one of the worst months of all time for Bitcoin](

He seemed truly hurt to talk about that.

If you have an immediate issue  you fix it then and there, while developing a long term solution.
There's nothing complicated about this.
And for the love of god, Satoshi orginally meant to have 32mb blocks, but forgot to change it back. It's just a constant. There's no magical reason it's set where it is right now. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:00:33
Nothing makes it better. Literally just that it was first like you said.
I don't hold BTH or BCH so I don't care either way, but this is the truth. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:05:30
This whole situation is stupid. Everything is stupid, because people are stupid. I guess this is a side affect of dencentralized currency.
All that had to be done was increase the block size right now, so there's no immediate transactions problems, then an off chain solution can be developed in the mean time.
But no..people are stupid, and can't agree or takes extreme positions for no damn reason. And it put us here. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:38:11
It's like you read nothing I said or you can't comprehend how simple this is.
Did I say pernamently keep increasing the block size every year? No. 
I said increase it right now, while lightning or whatever is developed. It's so damn simple what need to be done but no. People like you over complicate something that's so incredibly straightforward.
Like the world isn't going to fall apart if we reinstated Satoshi ORIGINAL 32mb blocks. Then we'd have YEARS for lightning to be developed and all these transaction complaints would vanish. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:57:58
Don't tell people to go to bitcoin.com to learn about Bitcoin.
I understand. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:46:22
Exactly. 
Literally changing a constant in the code would alleviate all the transaction issues for YEARS. Allowing plenty of time for Lightning to be developed.
But nooo people can't agree to do it because that's bad coding practice.  Ohh FFS.
