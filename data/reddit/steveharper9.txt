Okay thanks very much, that has solved the issue - I didn't realise the public could always get the public from the private.  
I'll likely just true crypt the full drive also as an additional measure anyway... can't have too much security right?

I definitely wouldn't use hardware encryption either... who knows if there is a back door in it or if it can be brute forced or whatever. 
I'm unwilling to change back to a Windows PC but for anyone using one I'd recommend DriveCrypt... in a past career I was arrested as part of an operation involving the FBI and the NHTCU (British hi-tech police) and they couldn't even switch my laptop on after months of trying.

Sorry if this is a stupid question... but when I use BIP 38 I thought that was just encrypting the private key only. If you're saying remove the public address, I take it the BIP 38 encryption is actually both the public and private keys together?
So I could just memorise my password ("password" in this test one), store all the 6PRSmjqNmQb5VDSL2JMSNWM5aCMLJ9aVgQxJx28ratfp8hupwyc15sfiPx etc in a .txt file with nothing else, and then Truecrypt the full usb drives?

No, at the time they couldn't force you to.  Realistically the penalty for refusing to hand it over is low anyway - almost always a tiny fraction of what the sentence would be if you did hand it over and get charged with something more serious because of it...

I'm pretty confident, actually I'm 100% confident or I wouldn't do it, that I can memorise suitable passwords.  I don't see a need to print anything at all.

Thanks for the detailed reply. 
If I have data on 4x different storages, from different manufacturers and stored in different locations... surely the chance of them all failing at once would be near non existent, to the point its not worth worrying about?  I likely wouldn't be accessing them for at least a year (thats the plan anyway, subject to change!)
Perhaps I'm wrong, but I feel that I'm more likely to experience problems with a paper printout than I am with a USB pen.  From a practical point of view I can just tell non tech friends "its important work files that I need to backup, please throw this in your safe for me and forget about it, hopefully I'll never need it".  If I'm handing them a sheet of paper with weird numbers and so on on it... they'll be wondering wtf I'm up to.

16 week sentence - 
16 week sentence - 
Given they were in the dock for child porn and terrorism respectively... 4 month sentences seems the lesser of 2 evils at that point!

I intend to put them on these, all stored in separate physical locations:
1x Samsung sdhc card
1x Emtec micro sdhc card
1x Kingston USB pen
1x DataTreveler USB pen

I suspect way way more people have been busted and either 'no commented' their way through an interview, or said they've forgotten the passwords. If they don't go to trial then its likely they'd avoid the media, as I'm sure the cops wouldn't want it known you can get around it easily.
I bet those two above said something like "I'm not telling you" or whatever.
