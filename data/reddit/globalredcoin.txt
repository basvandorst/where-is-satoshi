I'm skeptical too. I think that blockchains have limited uses outside of cryptocurrency. Blockchains make lousy general asset registers when you run through various use cases in your head, taking into account that anyone can register anything, including stuff they don't own.
Cryptocurrency is the perfect application for a blockchain, because the ledger unit itself is the thing of value.

I think someone made an alarm clock on Ethereum. It's a revolution!
@_date: 2016-03-14 19:29:43
Agreed - someone has been trying hard to get this FUD to the front page, and they finally succeeded. The story isn't even true (it might be only partially true).

It's pretty obvious that most of "Classic" nodes are run by far fewer individuals than the numbers would suggest. 700+ nodes run on a single small virtual server provider ("Choopa") is pointless. 
Once the person behind those nodes grows bored or runs out of money, those nodes will disappear. 
It looks like the Classic attack has no traction, and thankfully it will fade away, just like the XT attack. I look forward to the next Bitcoin Core release that includes support for SegWit, which I will install at my home location, as a genuine individual Bitcoin supporter.

This is why the sorting is changed to controversial by default on these threads. The most thoughtful comments by knowledgable community members get downvoted by the mob.

It's like letting the public vote on the design parameters for a launch vehicle.

There's a good PhD thesis waiting to be written that explores why this concept seems to be so hard to understand.

 I noticed that things started to improve when the moderators got better at squelching shitposts/comments and their brigades.

The current developers operate under a completely open and transparent development model that strives for consensus before committing changes. In contrast the Bitcoin Unlimited team is semi private, not to mention tiny.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:10:32
They radicalized everybody by forcing the issue.
@_date: 2016-01-01 21:35:15
Nice spin. From other people's point of view, he's attacking consensus making. He's a troll.

Why don't you have a CTO? That seems odd for a technology company. Guiding the technical direction of a company is a full-time job.

Again, the article doesn't mention PoW.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:53:12
It says "most popular chain", doesn't mention PoW. Basing it on PoW alone would be utterly foolish.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:16:10
No way it's 50/50. More like 90/10 in favour of Core.

Their feelings were hurt, so now everyone else has to pay.

Would you people please stop brigading the votes in this subreddit?
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:17:43
That's a big *if*!

Brigaded bullshit comment
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:11:29
Uh, yeah.... I don't think that I'll be supporting Bitcoin Classic. Yeesh.

Excellent points, thank you.

Whatever your criticisms of Bitcoin are, Storj is just a solution in search of a problem and that isn't Bitcoin's fault.

There is a super low risk of an actual fork. Miners aren't gonna take the risk of mining invalid blocks that the rest of the community will reject, not at the currently very low BU adoption levels.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:06:20
No, this is not "literally the only sane response". A little less drama please?
The "entire idea behind bitcoin" is to create censorship resistant money on the internet. Its unique innovation is the solution of the double-spend problem, achieved by combining a distributed ledger with a HashCash-like form of Proof-of-Work.
Does the industry letter get in the way of any of that? No - it simply states that they aren't going to list a fork chain that implements a different blocksize as Bitcoin. To do so would be to confuse it customers and could be seen as a type of fraud. 
That's it.
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:30:00
The politics are red-hot here because of the brigades and bullshit from  causing this sub to become real nasty at times. Twitter is better but even that is getting heated up. You can't have a forum that remains apolitical for long because we're talking about money.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:09:19
According to Roger Ver he's going for a fork at 60% so that's not too far off.
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:51:10
That's how I see it. Reckless development in the style of Ethereum would have relegated Bitcoin to has-been territory long ago due to a loss of faith in the system. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:54:38
That's a question for the people of no?
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:56:44
So far the market has responded positively which is pretty funny.
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:47:44
But it's doubtful that full blocks actually affected their business model... I mean they could have just passed the increased fees (10-20 cents per transaction) on to their customers, that really isn't a big to most people. 
That excuse sounds like a convenient smoke screen.
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:00:52
Sigh. Hardly anyone wants to stick to 1MB blocks. Why must this ignorance persist? Also, how can you claim to know the emotions of the different factions in this debate?
@_date: 2015-08-20 00:39:04
And what qualifies Justus Ranvier to make such a statement?

You really don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:04:20
You aren't looking very hard - there are several threads discussing the block size on the front page.
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:57:16
The censorship seems to be coming from the straw-men arguments and downvotes aimed against the devs.
@_date: 2016-10-11 06:52:07
Jesus... is that your understanding of the blocksize problem? Do you know nothing about block validation/signature verification times, propagation delays, selfish mining attacks?
What are they teaching you over in anyway?
@_date: 2015-10-12 03:08:37
Without moderation, this sub would be clogged with constant altcoin shitposts and brigaded trollposts. It may look like censorship to you, but it's a huge improvement over the bad old days and it's made this sub readable again.
@_date: 2015-10-12 03:11:03
And trying to silence the disruptions is called "censorship".
