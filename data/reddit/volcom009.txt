I’ve lost 70% of my value from the ATH (altcoins) but my coin counts are even greater so the hope is now when it goes up we go Interstellar

But it will set the price at which they are willing to sell it to be profitable so....it actually does hold up and the reason it doesn’t hold up in “market dynamics” is because of the skewed electricity costs between holders and their home country.....the difference between those that mine and sell for daily profit and those that mine and hold is pretty drastic, the prior running the true market because the latter doesn’t truly affect the market....so when the larger miners start to hit their cost of production they will start to HODL and not sell, it doesn’t stop the rest of the world from matching their cost so you don’t see the price stop falling all you will see is the volume drop off drastically with a price fall.....that is the true bottom and it was stated in May the average cost around the world was $4.8k to mine, so with increase of diff and electricity constraints I would say it’s more like $5200-$5500 but with a premium $5500-$5800.....once she flips get ready for a short stall and then rocket ship in fall

Do you make transaction fees running the node? If so can anyone set one up? Or is it just similar to a  wallet style node?

Lighting network is great but the speed of transactions is only one of BTC's problems

i don't know how to exactly do that but if you could point me in the right direction for shopify, i can make it happen pretty quickly
