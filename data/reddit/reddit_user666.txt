Actually seems like a good idea, thanks. 
I'll look into it

this "friend" also advises to invest in USI  tech, but it might just be for the referral, idk. Any thoughts on that? i've looked into USI and the way it works.  Seems legit?

Currently have 2,000 euros ready to buy with, was meant to do it a week ago but i've been having second thoughts.
Have a friend/mentor who studies charts and  he keeps saying its gonna bounce to 25k at some point, but bitcoin seems to be dropping? His words:
 "You're scared, it bounced off resistance and onto a high support
a higher support than last week
which was 11k
just be patient man"
Should i go for bitcoin or alt? need some advice
Thanks and Happy New Year

Not at all actually, I wasn't waiting for a dip, I was just worried that it was dying
