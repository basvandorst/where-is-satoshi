We made a small video demonstrating the functionality. Would love to hear any feedback to improve the SDK.
@_date: 2014-01-13 01:14:11
Check this discussion on Android subreddit. As per the discussion, it really depends on the use case.
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:19:22
Depends on the use case. Uber uses PayPal for ride payments.

Thanks. Our overall mission is to make it easy for people to accept Bitcoin. Hence everything we do is open-source. Send us an email at contact at bitmonet.com, if you want to talk more about it. 
@_date: 2013-09-19 02:43:50
BitMonet is an open-source project. Let us know if you want to get involved. Github.com/bitmonet
@_date: 2013-08-01 09:00:17
Yeah, I agree with that. Aggregation seems to be the most promising option.
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:12:46
Being an open-source project, we can always use some help so let us know if you are interested in contributing to BitMonet.

I totally agree with you that off-blockchain transactions are complex. I might be wrong, but I think they will be effective if someone like Coinbase implements them. Anyway, i heard rumors about auction based mining, do you think that could be leveraged to bring down transaction fees?

The above link contains a demo which shows how a publisher can use a bitcoin based paywall to monetize digital content.
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:01:57
We also have a WordPress plug-in that allows any WordPress site to start using Bitcoins and set up a paywall in less than 30 seconds. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 18:24:24
All the user has to do is fill a for blogger or any website. And for wordpress, even no copy and paste is required.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:22:37
Also the project is open-source. You are free to modify it in all possible ways 
The server code is also included in the above repo.
@_date: 2013-08-31 00:23:14
Thanks for the feedback. What we have over is just one possible implementation. Going forward we will add other functionality that is not similar to a paywall.
Also, the focus is to provide a better reading experience by removing reliance on advertising.
@_date: 2013-10-27 08:20:34
Also, the same applies to any paywalls used by the likes of NYT, WaPo etc.
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:12:16
The code for this is open-source and can be found at 
@_date: 2013-08-29 17:59:28
Thanks. The idea here is to provide a lightweight way of monetizing the content without requiring the user to sign-in. We will be adding more payment options soon.
@_date: 2013-08-01 09:26:12
If you want to set it up, instructions are at the following link. It should be pretty quick with no server side development. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:44:14
Yeah. But I think after a point advertisers will find it hard to sustain that.
@_date: 2013-09-20 08:19:47
That's a great idea. We will consider this for our next release. We don't have the development resource to add support for litecoin, but since the code is open-source, you are free to add support for litecoin. github.com/bitmonet
@_date: 2013-08-29 19:08:52
I just want to emphasize the fact that BitMonet is responsive and it also works perfectly on a mobile device. So do give it a shot on your phone.

Thanks. I will update the blog post to stress on this fact. I am also working on using off the block chain microtransactions, which will further help me further bring down the transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-08-01 16:22:40
This is a leaky paywall. You can easily bypass paywalls used by most newspapers. The idea here is to make it difficult to access the content. I will be releasing a new version which will take make it more difficult to bypass it.
@_date: 2013-08-01 20:49:54
Thanks everyone for the feedback. I will try to incorporate it the next release.
@_date: 2013-09-20 09:23:23
Thanks. We know why that is happening, and we will be releasing an update tomorrow to fix this issue.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:48:52
I have an open-source project that enables publishers to monetize their digital content with Bitcoins. 
Basically, instead of asking the readers to sign-up for monthly subscription,  publishers can set-up micro-paywalls that rely on Bitcoin microtransactions to monetize digital content. With this model, they can monetize an article, or offer time metered-subscription services without even requiring the user to create an account. You can check a demo here: 
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:48:48
I agree a lot could be done with this. I am open-sourcing the code tomorrow. Let me know if you want to get involved.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:46:29
And our goal is to give the power to the publishers. The better their content, the more the revenue they will generate.
@_date: 2013-08-29 20:55:54
Hah. The idea was to provide an end to end experience. I will donate whatever I get to the Wikipedia Foundation.
Anyway, your comment made me realize that if people are willing to pay 10¢ to just read a demo article, they will be much more will to pay to read an actual news article.  And I can leverage the tracking data of my demo to roughly predict the number of users who would be willing to pay small amount of money to access content.
@_date: 2013-08-29 23:17:34
I should have clarified that the modal was responsive. I will have a  responsive version of the demo page in a few days. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 18:28:34
No coding is required in any case. For Any Website or Blogger, all you have to do is fill a form and copy and paste code. For WordPress just configure BitMonet and you are good to fo.
@_date: 2013-08-01 17:52:22
There were efforts being made towards this end during late 90's. The following link talks about it. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 06:39:52
Check out the demo at  I just rolled it out today, so would really appreciate comments and feedback to improve the platform.
@_date: 2013-08-26 21:42:26
Our goal is to remove all the friction that publishers face in monetizing content. Also, BitMonet is free and charges no transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-09-19 09:05:27


Thanks. I will take that into account for future post. BitMonet is an open source project, so you can always look at the code if you need more details.
@_date: 2013-09-19 21:27:39
Implementation of BitMonet in the wild 
Edit: Only works for 
Thanks nildram.
@_date: 2013-10-27 02:04:49
Sure. We would love to hear your thoughts about accepting donations. You can send us an email at contact
@_date: 2013-09-10 16:41:29
Writers have the option of giving out as many articles as they want for free.
@_date: 2013-09-19 21:33:05
@_date: 2013-10-27 01:55:19
Individual paywalls is just one option. You can also buy timed micro-subscription. So if you think you would want to read more articles after paying for a few, you can buy an hour pass. 
Also the publisher has the option of offering specific number of articles for free.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:16:07
We also made the integration process super simple. You can get started in less than 30 seconds here 
@_date: 2013-10-27 08:19:59
I agree that it can be blocked with NoScript, but we want to keep it as light as possible. Also. 1% of users might be able to block the paywall, which I think is acceptable.
@_date: 2013-09-19 03:42:10
I just want to emphasize that publishers can enable or disable monetization per post and can change the branding as per their website.
@_date: 2013-09-19 21:32:53
Thanks for the kind words. Also, thanks for implementing it on your blog. I hope the integration process was simple.
@_date: 2013-08-29 18:14:26
Thanks. I agree it would be great to have an extension that works across different websites.
@_date: 2013-08-01 08:10:23
I think aggregation seems to be the way to go. I will look into it.
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:49:49
We are doing everything on the client. We are just using cookies to ensure that reader can read the article they have paid for later.  If you look at one of the modal, the copy says that if you delete your cookies, BitMonet would not work for you.
We wanted to make sure that there is no friction in the process, so we decided to go with a client side solution that doesn't require account creation. Email me at contact if you have more questions. Also, feel free to build on top of BitMonet code.
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:22:35
That's a good catch. I think the same thing applies to all other paywalls out there. I will try to figure out a way to work around this issue.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:27:47
Bitmonet is an open-source project. Not sure if we can purchase ad, but we will look into it.
@_date: 2013-10-22 23:57:47
You can also look into a combination of techniques to improve the accuracy. Basically you can consider using the form address with some sort of fingerprinting to uniquely identify the advice.
@_date: 2013-08-01 07:09:42
Thanks for the feedback. 10¢ is just an example in the demo. As I mentioned in one of the comments, I am working on off the block chain transactions (support for which was recently added to bitcoinj wallet), which will help me get rid of the fees. Also, I would like to stress on the fact that it is really easy to integrate.
