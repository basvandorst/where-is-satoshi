Do you guys invest in btc for extra lunch money? Because from what I'm seeing, you need to put in minimum 10k of fiat to see any kind of useful money come in with these 5, 10, 15 percent rises in btc price. Gone are the days of 10x or 20x returns on crypto I think. Unless you want to wait for trx or xrp to moon when you're 90.

Guys need some trading 101 here please. How do i set an order in the exchange where i will buy if the price falls to a target price (this is i know buy limit order) but i also want to have an order in if price reaches a pretty high target ? Do i set a limit buy order here as well? Think of this as a fomo limit order. How would i do it?

Where do bitcoin transaction fees go? Miners, or people running bitcoin servers? Is serving bitcoin and mining the same thing?

Btc is being manipulated!! It's no good for an asset to shoot up so quickly it will end up being the same as 2018.

What are your favorite most accurate indicators on a chart? I heard RSI, MACD, and bollinger have great predictive power, true?
