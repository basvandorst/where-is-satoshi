Great post. Thanks for the write up. 
I was surprised when I saw crypto people analyzing graphs like they do with stocks. To those of us who run in the financial independence circles, it's well known that those so-called experts, or wanna-be psychics don't know what the hell they are talking about. Ever. They will tell you every time they guess correctly, but you will never hear their failures, or see their ratios of how often they guess correctly. Day traders all fail more than they win. All of them. Without exception. Except when they are lying to you. 
PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT INDICATE FUTURE RESULTS!!! 
I take comfort in the FACT that no one, no one on this planet or any other, knows what will happen. Just buy and hold, and watch all the 'experts' make claims, and all the spineless Johnny-come-lately's panic and lose all their money. 
Edit: throw in some anecdotal evidence. I've been holding Tesla stock for years. I've read over and over from the 'experts' that every new electric car in development will be the Tesla killer. Solar power isn't efficient and will never be cheaper than coal, nuclear, etc. Production delays, a cryptic tweet, a strong breeze and Tesla is dead! Sell now! Panic! All bullshit.

I'm laughing my ass off today. My crypto portfolio took a shit, like everyone else's. I haven't seen prices this low since December 9th! Now if that money I sent to the devil Coinbase would hurry up and hit. I've got cheap coins to buy!

I love my credit union, and they've been good to me for over a decade, but I would be in there tomorrow to close my account of they sent me a letter telling me what to do with my money. You're their customer, they are a business, but they're trying to act like your parents. Give 'em hell, op!

I'd like to nominate the 80's-90's Toyota pickup as well . It has the 22re engine in there, and a 6' bed in the back. I've been considering upgrading to a 4-runner, but now I'm thinking, Previa!

If you live in Canada. Or if you pay the fees to buy direct with a credit card I think. 
Edit: on Coinbase, that is. I'm not sure about other exchanges. Tomorrow is the 7th day for me. I'm losing my damn mind.
