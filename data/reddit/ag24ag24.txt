Actually the BGRF was originally created to allow me to avoid inheritance tax when I donated most of my inheritance from my mother (who was British) to SENS Research Foundation (which is of course a US charity). We didn't do it through BGRF in the end, and BGRF itself has gone through a few changes of personnel and direction, but it remains a very close and valuable ally of ours.

Thanks. It's fantastic to see so many people here suggesting us. I've replied elsewhere on this page and also emailed them, and we are sending in an application today.
Cheers, Aubrey

This is Dr. Aubrey de Grey, SENS Research Foundations chief science officer; see more about me here:
Having myself donated most of my personal wealth to the Foundation after I inherited it in 2011, I want firstly to echo the admiration of this donor that so many here have expressed. Since that money ran out a year ago, we have indeed been gruesomely short of funds (in spite of the wonderful contributions, large and small, from donors new and old), so I can strongly confirm that any donation from the Pineapple Fund will make a massive difference. I can be emailed at any time at aubrey to answer any questions relating to this. I will also email contact as suggested. Thank you again for this fantastic generosity.

It's a source of perennial curiosity to me that people still cite this criticism of SENS (and also a contemporaneous one published in EMBO Reports) without citing my rebuttals that were released at the same time. I'd be interested to know - did you really not know that the rebuttal existed (and won the day), or did you just decide that it wasn't important?

Thanks. It's fantastic to see so many people here suggesting us. I've replied elsewhere on this page and also emailed them, and we are sending in an application today. Calico indeed have basically unlimited money, but unfortunately they seem to be totally ignoring all that is known about aging and how to fix it (in particular they have totally blown us off) and are therefore criminally wasting it.

This is Dr. de Grey. Thanks for the feedback - and I will say in my defence only that doing an AMA is so rapid-fire a thing that one can't always give the best answers. The answer from "Humes-Bread" on the AMA thread augments mine very well. In short:
1) the progress we've made in the past decade, even despite the poor funding, has been enough to lead me to the conclusion that we are now only five or six years away from the milestone I call "robust mouse rejuvenation" in contrast to the estimate of ten years that I was giving back then. (Both timeframes are with 50% probability, of course.) That still means we've only gone less than half as fast as I had predicted - but my prediction has always been conditional on adequacy of funding. As of today I can say for sure that the shortage of funding has been the ONLY aspect where I was overoptimistic - the science has in no respect turned out to be harder than I thought back then.
2) The fact that the science has not turned out to be harder is actually what you're seeing when you see me saying the same things now as I did back then: it's not a bad thing, it's a really good thing, because it highlights that no bad news has happened. We haven't discovered any nasty new components of aging that need new solutions over and above the ones we already knew about, and we also haven't discovered any nasty difficulties in the various approaches I proposed, that would have required us to come up with a new solution to one or other of the seven original problems. The only surprises that have come along have been good ones: new technologies like iPS and CRISPR that make the solutions easier, not harder.
3) SENS revolves around the repair of the damage of aging, and that damage manifests in many different types of molecular and cellular change, which we group into seven categories. Thus, it's explicitly a divide-and-conquer strategy - which inevitably means that it's impossible to point to "the biggest" breakthrough we've made. I don't think that's an overly hard thing for normal people to understand.
4) The original question you referred to asked about measuring the time until this or that component of SENS is done. Maybe I should not have tried to answer it at face value, since everyone knows what Yogi Berra said about predicting the future. I'm sorry that my overly literal answer turned you off, but let's be clear: the value of pioneering technological (including medical) research comes down not to how soon it will succeed, but to how much the research will hasten how soon it succeeds. No one says that the War On Cancer was a bad idea, because everyone agrees that we are closer to the defeat of cancer today than we would be today if that hike in funding had not occurred. It's therefore irrelevant that people back in the 1970s thought we would get there sooner.
