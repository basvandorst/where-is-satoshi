I bet that 1% of illegal activity is the government using it for nefarious reasons.

You had to have really powerful computers running complex math for a long ass time.
I don’t know exactly how it works. I found it confusing which is why I just ignored it. I thought nobody would do it. I was really wrong.

I still kick myself for not getting into bitcoin when it first started. I remember hearing about it when it was worth less than a dollar and looked into it. Back then you had to actually mine it. You couldn’t buy any, so I just ignored it for 7 years. That was stupid.

I may use it because the ROI has been fantastic. I haven't yet. I look at it as an investment. I'm betting against the current fiat currency in the US. I'm betting against inflation and a corrupt federal reserve/government relationship. I like it because it is decentralized. It's the best investment for me right now that is the easiest to get into. I don't need to go to an investment banker or have to figure out all kinds of stock trading or this and that and the other thing. I can literally take 5 minutes out of my day to set it up and make my first purchase. I can watch what happens with it very easily. I can sell it very easily if I wish. If I want to buy things with it, I can. If a place doesn't take bitcoin, I can sell off what I need...at a profit...and then use that money. The only real control on it is the market. That's the way it should be.

I love it when people in comments shit on crypto currency with arguments that show they have no clue what is really going on.

How do I transfer from coinbase to Gemini? Is there a Gemini iOS app? I didn’t see it in the App Store.

Bitcoin can be used to pay for things. I think Japan has made it so you can use it to buy anything?
I can use it right now to buy stuff.

I haven’t put in NEARLY that much but it is fun to watch. I’m constantly checking. I plan on putting in some with each paycheck.

Dorsey is a fuckwad.
