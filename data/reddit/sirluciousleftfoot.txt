Where was this PSA in 2017?! I can't wait to dump my bags on the incoming class of 2020.

I would encourage you to not think about prices, but think about total marketcap as you consider options for a store of value. Gold is \~$7.1T and BTC \~$60B ($0.06T) . When you look at it from that perspective, BTC and Gold prices are not comparable and the upside for BTC is much higher.   
BTC has not yet proven itself to be a hedge against fiat or traditional investments. The stock market is down, and so is BTC. I believe the market cap is so small, it's still speculative and therefore not a hedge to the economy. That isn't to say that it won't one day become a hedge, but it certainly isn't right now. If the bear market continues or fiats fail, and the average person flees to BTC or cryptocurrency, then we can say it's a hedge. The market seems to be selling off BTC just as they would stocks and bonds in the current climate.
My advice is to not invest more than 1% of your net worth into crypto. BTC or any other cryptocurrency is not a sure thing, and we're so early we don't know who will win the race for store of value. The principles of blockchain and cryptocurrency are sound, but whether or not BTC becomes the world's fiat/financial hedge or digital gold is yet to be seen. The current favorites can all go to $0 and it very well may be the next generation of cryptocurrencies that succeed. For that reason you should be keeping a reasonable amount of your money, that you can afford to lose, in crypto, and not going all in this early. There's still plenty of time. We'd be lucky in 10 years if even 10% of the population (800 million) own any crypto at all. If a bull run happens with BTC because of financial collapse you'll have plenty of time to get in and you already have a head start.
