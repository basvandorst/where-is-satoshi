Roger keeps saying ''the first in the entire world'', he sounds like a 3 year old. He makes me fucking sick, and disappointed  in humanity. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:13:56
Thanks mate... I'm gonna try wait it out a bit more... problem is I kinda need the money but yeah... ill survive
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:12:56
I'm using a Ledger nano
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:27:59
Here brother. I'm not selling all, but made enough to buy a little studio in my hometown cash. It's too irresistible - I just need to take some btc off the table because I also have trouble sleeping. PS guys - just sent a segwit transaction, very quick and reliable. Don't let FUD about btc get you - and there is NOTHING wrong taking some profit when due, it's silly not to.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:13:14
Thats a kinda steep fee...
@_date: 2015-12-11 12:13:43
This is really bad news, to hear this happening again. BUT, I always thought crypsty was a little dodge, people should have learned their lessons from Gox.

Interesting, I was not aware of that. Although I also think satoshi would have some way of backing up his coins... what a mystery. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:38:53
How do you pay rent etc? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:06:17
Imagine, this could all be an inside job. MtGox can short bitcoin down as much as possible to gain back losses? :p xD
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:22:42
this is sarcastic, right?
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:44:53
Maybe he was genius and he meant mBtc? xD

Why would anyone have their btc in coinbase anymore?
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:11:38
thats my plan!
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:20:44
Nice, I bought mostly around $300 range but sold one bitcoin @ $2800 just before August 1st because I was a little uncertain. Oh well, sometimes you sleep easier spreading risk but always hodl on most of your btc stash :D
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:24:14
I dont know, but Poloniex muted me straight away for subtly mentioning it might be time to sell.. I will not sure their shitty exchange again. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:04:08
Guys, relax. I know it doesn't 'explain bitcoin' in the true sense, but for the average Joe it kinda dumbs down the explanation. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:33:45
Did you ever think, that maybe this time people aren't dumb enough to sell down to $500? People are now aware of the cycle, the ground has been raised.
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:40:19
This is what happens when people lose. I remember these type after the 2013 peak and crash. Hopefully one day he hodls long enough to see the light
@_date: 2019-10-15 21:56:42
best advice.
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:18:50
Will it pamp?

Good luck with that 5d chess.

'' I've been in since 2010, If I haven't sold by now I never will. Shit thanks to bitcoin I got 3 apartment complexes who's revenues I use to buy more every month. Personally, I'd love it to dip lower to 2k so I can grab a hell of a lot more. "
You bought in 2010?! Wow, you must be a millionaire otherwise stupid for not being a millionaire! Who would have a guessed such a successful person spends his time on r/bitcoin telling people to upvote comments to, I quote; ''reverse psychology these fuckers''.
You think by up-voting reddit comments you can turn market sentiment. Seems pretty desperate to me. Frankly, it's delusional.
@_date: 2019-10-15 21:59:13
more like a sure way to become rich
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:32:30
sure, bro. That's why reddit mods secretly take down my post from an hour ago with 18 upvotes, without notification, guess it ''too bearish'', although it's clearly a joke. I didn't realize mods were acting in this fashion, quite, how should I say, biased:

Mate, don't say anything for 3 years. Soon he'll asking you to pay for lunch ;)
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:32:39
$3600 is pretty good considering we are double that now :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:16:22
Yeah, I have some friend from work yesterday who was bragging how he bought a small amount of bitcoin at $5000 then he told me he sold at $7500 because the market is about to crash, but he said it in kind of a dickhead way. I don't care what he does, but something wants me to see bitcoin pump a bit more just to make him feel stupid. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:31:53
Guys, I'm going to party in Berlin and stay in a 4 star hotel and hopefully fuck some beauty's. Thanks bitcoin.

Fucken funniest thing I've seen all morning thanks! :D
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:33:49
Maybe he predicted that someone would point this out, and in fact is a step ahead of that? :?
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:08:59
Haha :D

Hahaha... delusional. ..anyone stupid enough to believe bitcoin cash is real bitcoin can't own much bitcoin anyway.  A desperate loser with a desperate dream
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:45:03
This is going to cause problems. People will send BCH to a BTC adress I know this will happen. Is there nothing legally that can be done about this?
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:32:29
True bro. I actually normally don't, but today I thought ''I should know my enemy'' and started to listen. This guy is crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:04:31
The network is obviously having issues because miners jumped onto bch for the time being, as it's more profitable. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:17:11
Yeah mate, if you bought below 1k why worry anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:28:45
I'm SORRY TO DISAPPOINT ALL YOU FOLKS BUT- I just bought some bitcoin so you can actually expect a HUGE selloff any minute now. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:42:53
You will never throw those pillows away ;)
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:51:04
Well, many people are. It's only a recent wave of dumb money throwing their savings in bitcoin at 15 - 20k that got people feeling ''shitty' ;)
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:47:52
The aim of a bear is to get more coins ;)
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:24:29
Very interesting indeed. I saw the same chart. I don't think there is some 'conspiracy' of people shorting btc. To me it's really simple - we almost doubled from about 6k up to 12k and were way overbought. The market might pull back to the bottom of the channel. I don't think there is any reason for btc to just break out to all new time highs now -forget it. A consolidation will take place, and I am hoping to score some cheap btc under 8k. But hey, anything can happen right. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:47:16
I know, almost suureal. I have been buying since 300usd range and holding more than most my colleagues can probably afford by this point haha. When they ask how much I have I say ''Ooh just a little bit'' :D
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:07:28
That' exactly how I did it bro. Been throwing my savings in bitcoin since 300 usd. Long term my friend, long term.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:22:38

@_date: 2018-02-10 21:30:13
The question you have to ask yourself is; if bitcoin was to reach one million in a short time we would see some radical shifts and economic mayhem globally. What kind of world would be even be living in? Everybody locked down in a bunker hodling for life? ;)
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:32:03
That's actually an interesting point. Perhaps we can look into the legality of that. Let's start a religion - Satoshi is already pretty mysterious enough :)
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:10:55
Wow, this just further proves what a scumbag he is
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:23:38

@_date: 2017-09-28 18:22:05
How much gold is used for payments?
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:46:04
Only the biggest loser in the world would walk around with a bitcoin shirt to get attention. It's like imagine someone who owns some gold walking around with some gold t-shirt - would be the biggest wanker ever. I bet this guy owns like 3 bitcoin or something
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:46:14
I would not say minor differences..
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:46:11

Sure lil Johnny! You're a smart one!
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:20:45
At the moment, people might say you are crazy for putting lots of money in bitcoin. One day, you will call people crazy for not having bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:05:09
Just hold. I bought between 300-500 usd and didnt sell yet.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:10:26
What would you do if you put a bit of money on btc a couple years ago, and now became worth more than the rest of your life savings? Sell it? Or keep it, because it didn't cost that much to begin. I am sure many are facing this predicament. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:34:41
Bitcoin isn't backed by anything except almost a hundred billion dollars... 
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:13:06
OOooor sell at the top buy in on the dip... but hey, some people dont want to make more btc thats cool with me :)
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:54:08
Uhh.. right.. people HODLING from 2013 agree with you ;)
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:19:12
So guys, I bought bitcoins around 300-500usd. At this point, I'm thinking the halvening is less than a thousand days. This is basically the countdown until I'm hopefully rich. The PROBLEM -it just sounds too good to be true!!! :D
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:55:20
yes, you will go down in a submarine ;)
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:22:37
It's becoming confusing. As someone in bitcoin for over five years, I feel the original beauty of bitcoin is dead. I am at the point of saying fuck this shit, where does forking end? This is no different to banks controlling fiat print, another fucking fork devaluing my btc. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:39:31
I bought in 2006 bitches
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:13:04
To everybody saying that I'm getting all religious and whatnot -  I'm not - I'm simply comparing how someone / organisation / group can use the name of something else for abuse. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:40:13
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:08:51
Yes, eventually. But there will be some kind of struggle to overthrow the bankers first, imho. That's IF btc were to reach 1m in a couple years.
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:27:12
And after this, when is the next fork coming?
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:52:37
BBC? :D
@_date: 2018-02-19 09:48:02
Easiest way? Create a bitcoin wallet for them, show them the deposit address. Tell them to fill the wallet with 10 btc. Then ask them how easy that was ;)

The fact that Roger is on such a nutcase show tells you all you need to know. I frankly think Roger is clinically insane. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:25:41
imo, neither is or should btc be one, its a store of value
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:07:27
Aren't you guys getting sick of this forking rubbish? Bitcoin used to be so whole... now a confused person who doesn't know who he is himself
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:09:22
Don't be a noop
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:08:51
Very similar story to a friend of mine -actually the friend who introduced me to btc. He mined about 35 bitcoin in the early days and when it went to 1000usd the HD wasn't working. He sent to a specialist but they couldn't recover it either :/
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:06:02

I think you should look into it ;)
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:09:32
its not a bubble to people who bought at 50 usd, its never going back there -and by that I hereby conclude the price is destined to go upward, albeit in swings, forever
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:11:29
Try using google trends to look at the term ''will bitcoin go up again'' - this will give some insight into what people are thinking. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:28:17
And then; is it too late to buy now?!
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:10:39
This already proves bitcoin has a future
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:47:53
Even so, 2 issues in 9 years that were solved. Better than any bank right? :)
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:14:05

@_date: 2017-07-27 11:56:53
yeah. Fortunately I know how to trade and make 1000% + profit ;)
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:35:31
Please mr bitcoin drop to $1500 so I can buy you more - this time I love you long time I promise
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:59:29
very interdasting
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:00:31
I was thinking this; PERHAPS a lot of the market EXPECTS that too happen and waiting for a buy -but maybe savy buyer are a step ahead and catching this drop now..
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:53:41
No - I did this in incognito mode and also from a PC I never used.. so why don't you shit your pants mate. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:41:31
Nice, holding with average buy now about $250/btc so not stressing too much. I'll be whipping out my card big time if we ever see under $1k hahahaha
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:51:43
To everybody here who is panicking, let me tell you this. People panicked after we dropped LOADS after the 2013 $1200 rally. A lot of those people sold and probably regret that now they would be more than 2x up. You might have to hold  for a while, you might not. After the 2013 drop happened I thought a new rally would take longer to get to this  price, but time flies. Depends if you have the patience to hold out.
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:41:04
The thing is, I think the $5k mark is a big psychological level, and with this pace I think we break though it easily, however I am not sure it we get far above $6k. But who the hell am I, I am little shrimp in this picture lol.
