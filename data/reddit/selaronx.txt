Nice. Can I create a paiment request using Eclair?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:01:05
When ICO? /s
If you call it crypt today, everyone will be calling it crypt next year. Name is importend imho.
But don't get me wrong, "crypt" seemes ok to me: short and kind of easy to memorize.

Thank you, already had done all this (Paydsome Starblock-Coffe etc )
But I'd like to create a Payment request that other ppl. can pay to. I don't fnd that option at Eclair.

The "bubble" already popped sometimes and recovered. Nobody can tell for sure if andwhen that will happen.
Nobody can tell if the price will continue to increase. Invest a tiny amount of money you can afford to loose and watch what happens. Be prepared for multiple heavy surprises each month - in both directions. Don't sell for panic, don't buy for FOMO.

I guess this is an emergency upgrade against the NYAttack.

99% loss imaginable too, but it won't happen becaus I'd buy then.
100% would happen if someone breaches SHA256 and mines all remaining rewareded blocks within a day or two. Would be good for mempool, but...
Or if a 12 year old boy breaches the asymmetric public/private key algos allowing him to proof beeing Satoshi Nakamoto and sell all his/her coins.

Where are thos 6 signatures? Did they segregate them? Was segregated wittness applied to mail communication here?
Please don't call names under a mail text "signatures" in crypto context!
While I hope it's true, I'm still not convinced there will be no miners using btc1 software. Question is if they ever find a single block.

How can I sign a message using an Address created with 'addwitnessaddress'?
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:42:37
Thank you - will Bitcoin Core support native segwit addresses in future versions? E.g. when segwit GUI support is added on next upgrade?

I expect lot of up/down this year, long side movements 2018 with overall upwards tendency, new ATH untel end of 2020.

As long as BTC price increases, new investemnt in mining hardware will pay off.
So difficulty is increasing with BTC price.
If that price decreases heavily, this will slow down difficulty increase - or even decrease difficulty a bit.
Problem of the miners is that they have invested in very special hardware that does not have any use case other than mining. So they won't let you argue to change the BTC mining algorithm or consence protocol in any direction.
If you try so, you just produce another altcoin (like said Bitcoin Gold).

It is not just the set of selected words relevant, but also their order. It is such unlikly to produce a collusion that it is said to be impossible. Else, what would prevent an attacker from trying to creat billions of wordlists per second, testing each for bitcoin addresses with positive balance?
This might interes you - with word lists linked:

$6000 and then $7000 and then ...
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:19:21
I learned guessing future crypto charts is just gambling.
BTC may go down due to chain split. Then go even more down below $4k by panic sellers who bought on the all tim high and want to stop loss.
If the new alt coin B2X does not get pumped too heavily, it will badly suffer from miners switching back to the most profitable chain.
BTC will start to recover at the beginning of 2018 and see new ATHs.
If this came true, it would be the best to buy the dip after Seg2x hard fork. But I'm sure everything is going to come completly different ^^

The only reward is that it honors peoples' lazyness. The don't have to (learn about) setup a wallet and safely store their quite long private key, but simply follow the odd username/password patter we all trained a lot.
Exchanges can be hacked or even be scam by sem selfes, so it is better to privately store the private key, as already said.
But depending on the amount of value you store on that key, be very very careful! It is like you store that value in bare banknotes at home.
If the value is huge, don't tell your friends or even family about that. The news might spread until it reaches some strangers interested in where you life.
Don't mention your public BTC address in any online media where ppl. might then check your balance and try to contact you, tricking you into a trojan horse.
Would you publically tell someone that you have $75,000 under your pillow?
Don't store your private key unencrypted on an online computer.
Don't follow links who may trick you into a scam wallet web app asking for your private key.
Don't follow any links!
I remember there was a comment on reddit stressing this online bahvior very strongly. Can't find it yet. (may have bben about "Dues and don'ts about ICOs" in )
Good luck, have fun :-)

The elecricity consumed by cryptos is giant.
Is PoS on BTC Core's roadmap? if not, lets simply do a UAHF:  simply don't accept PoW mined blocks anymore ;-D
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:25:23


Possibly. But likely there will also be a big decrease below $4000 next months and I bet you won't manage to hodl untel next rise but sell with loss.
