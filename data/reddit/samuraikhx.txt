Signing is the process by which a transaction is made valid.  The best analogy is a person's checkbook being given to anyone who wants a copy.  However, the bank only accepts checks stamped with the stamp of the person whose name is on the check.  
If you have a wallet on your phone for example, all of this is done at once when you click "send".  You generate a tx and sign it and broadcast it.  Offline txs separate the generation of a tx (which anyone can do with anyone else's account) and the subsequent signing (affirmation of the tx) and broadcast.
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:23:59
There is no one "Bitcoin". There are only computers. They agree this moment, they disagree the next, all is as it was. As with every prior upgrade, there is a chance some are not going to upgrade.

You have 3 wallets:
Hot wallet on phone = Pocket wallet for cash, you kept ~$50-$200
Hot wallet on computer (hopefully safer than phone) = Bank checking account with loads more money
Cold wallet (offline) = Your own bank vault 50,000ft underground
If the wallet is offline, you cannot attack it from the internet.  Viruses cannot contact home base.  By using a 24/7 offline computer than is never allowed to reach the internet, you secure yourself.  You generate a wallet on this computer and send all the public keys to your regular computer.  You generate a transaction on the regular computer and manually ask (by bringing over the USB stick) the offline computer to do the transaction.  You then broadcast this tx onto the internet.

All addresses are accounts unto themselves.  It seems you want to import his private keys into your wallet.  I would suggest downloading Bitcoin Armory for that task, as pywallet [ might not be best for you.

I normally use Armory, but if I ever need a wallet online, blockchain.info is the way to go, especially since the site works really well on Android.

Lastpass not the worst idea, not the best. 
Veracrypt is overkill, probably a net negative because you lock yourself down to admin only devices.
Gpg is well documented and available on any platform. all you have to do is 
# gpg encrypt -m

The hulu and netflix problem is to be expected, its a Swedish ip
* The apache problem can be solved by getting another port forward and matching that to the apache settings (you can have multiple ports in apache)
* As far as game latency goes, I can't say playing anything through a VPN is a good idea as it has to run all the way to Europe and back just to shoot a bullet.

Coinbase is a bank. They send your documents to the government every year, like a bank. They make you sign long contracts, like a bank. It is a bank with send/receive features with a wallet ***interface***.
If you look at a real wallet like Electrum, you'll understand it is not a bank, it is a wallet ***application***.

There's also replace-by-fee and parent-pays on some wallets which allow you to set let's say 2 sats now to let it roll for as cheap as possible and if you want you can later either bump the fee or boost the transaction by spending the output.

It doesn't get broadcasted, fully internal.  Payment processors in my opinion will take over most of the transactions to mitigate block chain bloat.  We had these before but they all died due to the security issues.  Someone will get it right (Coinbase seems to be on the right track)

The answer to this is using payment providers.  You would deposit money into their system and within that system the vendor and you would agree to a subscription model outside of the blockchain itself.
