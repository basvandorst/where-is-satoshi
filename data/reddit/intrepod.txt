Larger blocks equal higher orphan rates, which allow greater opportunity for double spends to be included in blocks before the initial transaction. It comes down to simple physics.

The link is bullshit, but regardless, you should do a historical correlation analysis. I don't think you'll find anything.

When I send money internationally between banks, it costs between $5-10, and takes an entire week. In contrast, bitcoin generally takes up to an hour for full confirmations, and costs between $0.00 and $0.05. That's not exactly a fair comparison because the recipient still need to buy fiat with the bitcoin I sent (for now), but even then I think that's pretty competitive with traditional payment networks, especially with knowing that you're not relying on financial intermediaries. I stopped using PayPal because they charge exploitative fees and close accounts without cause. I stopped using credit cards because I'm sick and tired of our debt-based lifestyles. 
I was also pretty annoyed with everyone saying "no transaction fees" when I first got started. That's totally misleading. Somebody coined the phrase, "Nearly instant, nearly free", which I think is more representative and still competitive in many cases.

Any Germans here that can tell me how to handle my tax situation? I know that capital gains on commodities held more than one year are tax free, but I did a little trading when I first started out last year (and lost some). I also spent some which complicates it further. I think I can get my cost basis for last year, but I don't know what forms I would need. I'm wondering if I should hire a professional who has heard of bitcoin. Now I just try my hardest to hold them for at least a year before moving them. Does first in, first out or last in, first out come into play like in the US?

Well, there was this post claiming to be the 'early release of Two Bit Idiot's news'. The post was heavily downvoted due to lack of evidence, but what the poster says does seem to coincide with certain events. Be sure to read cscottnet's comment too.
It would be very bad if when Mt Gox halted trading and the Foundation said they were all shocked, and there would be no bailout, it turns out that the Foundation had been bailing out Mt Gox for years. The poster says that Two Bit Idiot knew about this all along. I think maybe he stepped back from revealing this story because the Foundation told him he would be in just as much trouble as he was.
This is something the community needs to talk about. Yes it's kind of conspiracy-ish, but if there's truth to it, it's a very serious problem. Burying and ignoring it isn't the right approach.

I redrew an [approximation of the logo]( and put it through google image search. Sometimes I get lucky doing that, but it didn't turn up anything compelling, but one of the results happened to be a bitcoin logo. This is purely coincidental, because it was also returning swastikas and who knows what else. I also searched through model train logos and found nothing similar. 
I think the logo's irrelevant. It could be a completely generic logo, or a local club. Even if it was an anarchocapitalist logo, that wouldn't confirm anything. Supposedly we already know Dorian is a libertarian.
Unless somebody already recognizes the logo, I also think it's a waste of time.

For some reason, my old Macbook refuses to boot from a Linux CD, so I installed Mavericks onto a 16 GB USB 3.0 stick. I made sure to encrypt the full disk too, so I can use it to run Electrum completely offline if I want. I downloaded my printer drivers and Bitaddress.org before booting from the USB disk, and made sure to completely disable any network ability when booting from the USB disk for the first time. It was pretty slow since my computer doesn't have USB 3.0, but that's okay, and it will be faster when I finally buy a new Mac. From there, I generate a handful of paper wallets, print them out and also store digital PDF versions on the encrypted USB stick. 
If all of that is too much effort, or the amount of Bitcoin you're dealing with is too low, the absolute minimum would be to disconnect from the internet when generating and printing your wallets, then making your digital backups to a USB that NEVER gets plugged in when you're online. Make sure you delete all the public keys from your computer before reconnecting to the net. Really though, it's safer to do it from an offline operating system.

I don't doubt that a lot of those transactions are moving bitcoin to fresh addresses, but unless you can prove that 'most' of them are just exchanges shuffling their bitcoins, you shouldn't make the claim. You also can't assume to know the total number of people spending or earning bitcoin each day. And it's stupid to say that the only users who count are the ones using bitcoin every single day. I didn't spend any dollars today, but that doesn't make them any less valuable, nor would moving them to another account that I control.

I have been looking for a definitive answer to this too. I think the other guy is right that if you keep them for more than one year, there is no capital gain tax. What I don't know is if you need to pay capital gains on the bitcoins that you spend. I also want to know if it's okay to ignore small amounts. Like if you only have 0.1 bitcoin and spend it.

You don't have fourth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable search and seizures unless you surrender your fifth amendment right to be free from self-incrimination, in which case you are obviously guilty? Why is the judge ignoring the fact that the FBI violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by illegally hacking a server? 
If the "IP leak" had revealed the server to be located in the United States, would it have been any different, or is the FBI using that excuse as carte blanche to violate the rights of Americans and non-Americans outside of US borders?

No, those measures are actually very *unreasonable*, as well as completely unnecessary and highly troubling. We should absolutely shun this sort of 'security' measure because it's likely to drive people away from adoption. Nobody wants to get scanned three or four different ways for an experimental currency that can be used to track their behavior. There's some very good reasons why Vancouver disabled their ATM's hand scanner on the very first day, and whoever thought it was a good idea to begin with should be kicked in the ass.
Do you honestly think some hacker thief is going to allow himself to be tracked down via biometricly scanned evidence? Haven't we provided enough of our data already? How long until the data itself is stolen and abused?
It's simply unacceptable. I plainly refuse to use such a machine, and I don't think you actually understand the desire for anonymity, or the fact that a currency must be fungible to survive. Biometrics kills fungibility.

I didn't interpret your response as obnoxious. Once I finally found a working mirror (took about 10 minutes), the music did not get me excited. It was more of a turn-off. It's definitely subjective though. I wish I could offer a suitable alternative, but I know there are open source audio sites available. It can be hard to find something that fits the mood that you're after, but free and royalty free music is still an option. 
*Technically* Germany didn't block the video. Google blocked it because GEMA *might* have an issue with it. It's a subtle tit-for-tat difference instigated by Germany's overzealous copyright lobby.
The best solution would be to just upload a mirror to LiveLeaks at the same time and post the mirror in the comments so that people don't have to jump through hoops to watch your videos. When developing an anti-censorship market, you should take steps to avoid censorship with your promotional videos.

Here is the tweet where I found it. 
I like it for when I'm between classes and don't have time to go eat something. Sometimes I'm too exhausted to cook dinner afterwards and eating out is expensive. Mana tastes like oatmeal cookies. I already tried [joylent.eu]( which also takes bitcoin. They are both good.

Is it just for that franchise or for all EDEKAs in Germany? 
edit: it is working in Munich. Shipping is very high for a single item that I picked.

You sound like a cultist with all this "Satoshi's vision" nonsense.

Don't forget to count the time you spend gardening, the money spent on supplies, and the land you need to grow it. Plus the time you need to prepare and clean up. Also fruits and veggies aren't a complete diet. I wish I had time and space for a garden. Maybe some day. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 15:10:20
I'm not attacking you. I'm informing you that you sound like a cultist. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 11:14:56
that's how it was here when bitcoinXT came out. it was so annoying.

You are a centralized entity. You should probably do something about that. :)

what are some cryptos i can hedge that are similar to USD?

One follows consensus, the other does not.

A divorce is the best thing that could happen to the network now. Mike needs to stop mucking about or get lost.
@_date: 2016-05-09 20:09:55
You came off like a crazy person.
@_date: 2015-11-19 16:15:56
It's good news if more bitcoiners start seeing Mike for who he really is.
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:24:02
The only oddity is that it hasn't been brigaded yet.
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:44:04
I know that article. I think it's wrong though. Sorry I don't have time to dig up my own research, but regulation in Germany is not that clear.
@_date: 2016-05-23 20:44:07


it doesn't work that way at all. the amount of stupid hurts to read.
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:41:12
In my research, the law said that there would be no capital gains tax for people holding assets more than one year. This includes stocks, gold, etc. That law changed around 2009, but you should do your own research or consult a professional.

What happened to asking?

Don't forget Plasma.
@_date: 2015-10-23 15:04:29
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:09:21
pretty sure that's not true anymore. the law was changed way back in 2009 or so.

UASF could be avoided with MASF. We're done waiting.
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:17:37
I don't know, but I think many are probably home nodes. If they were hosting services, why would people chose a country that is already pretty well covered?
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:28:02
You need to see They have threads filled with $1 tips or more. I saw a .5 BTC tip last week here. What are you don't to spread bitcoin awareness?

How is your diet? I think I would starve to death.
@_date: 2015-02-17 10:34:40
I counted about 90 of them. There must be around 1000 in this net since they all have at least 1000 'friends'.
@_date: 2015-10-21 08:03:51
What's the Twitter account? Did you report it?
@_date: 2015-10-01 08:59:00
Trolls get banned all the time. It's not newsworthy.
@_date: 2015-02-17 17:01:12
dupe. we already have a changetip hate thread from a brand new troll acount. reported.

Per capita ought to be included in bitnode.io's stats.
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:32:16
Interestingly, [Germany]( is 2nd only to the United States as far as the number of bitcoin nodes deployed. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 13:56:51
It will reach dollar parity within a week or two. Probably even lower, but a lot depends on Greece.

"redditor for 27 minutes"
why do you need to make a complete new account for this? your answer is competition from paypal and too many regulations. do it yourself if you think its a good idea. outplay them at their own game.
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:43:14
I like HoneyBadger as a wallet name.

Sidechains do exist but they're still a few months away from public review.

Clickbait is Coindesk's bread and butter.

you can tell who they have been listening to.
@_date: 2015-02-23 09:53:34
You're thinking miners. Full nodes can run on a raspberry pi and just help the network spread transactions and blocks as fast as possible.
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:28:09
Who is the new provider? Do they also take bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:43:59
wow dude relax. i said if you think you have a good business idea then you should stop waisting time on reddit. go out there and make some money throwing penny shavings around.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:31:05
you must be very successful. what is your companies name so i can try it out.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:51:48
+1 on not giving paypal any info. just hope they dont freeze your account. so obvious he is just trolling.
@_date: 2019-05-16 10:24:05
makes no difference to me. I walk in, get coffee, pay with Bitcoin, walk out.
