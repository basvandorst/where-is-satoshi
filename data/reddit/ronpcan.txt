Read my replies to the comments I received. Can you help me recover my android wallet backups? The blockchain.info shows my block transactions and the stupid android Btc wallet I used to send my Btc to in June 2014 when the price spiked to around $600 then dropped after that. I've tried to recover my backups but the old android wallet isn't bringing back my transactions and obviously my coins. I had just under 2400 Btc backed up in June of 2014 and gave up on bitcoin after the price dropped a few months later. Now I'm freaking out. Im assuming it has something to do with the first hard fork

I'm freaking out. You just jogged my memory a bit and gave my an idea. The wallet.dat file from my rig should be able to recover my coins to pretty much any wallet. I've been so focused on my android wallet backups that I didn't even think about going onto the hard drive and pulling the wallet.dat file which I have backed up as well on flash drives.

That's the thing. I have the backups with private keys only they aren't compatible with any current wallets. Therefore they aren't recovering. My wife and entire family thought I was insane for spending everything I had to purchase my headless rigs and my electric bill was insane. I moved my Btc to this "android wallet" (at the time in 2014) and then also used a different application to remotely monitor my rigs from my cell phone. It allowed me to be mobile and monitor at the same time instead of being stuck in my basement making sure everything was still running. The last backup I created was on june 8 2014 and I was mining for just over 4 years. I watched what my profits slowly increase until the price dropped dramatically and I looked like a fool, now I look like an even bigger fool because I can't recover this damn backup. I tried to recover to -bitcoinj after decryption my backup but it isn't working. I have to be missing something in my coding.

The blocks I found were mainly all found right when I started in 2011 and the difficulty went up in time and the time it took to find a block got further and further apart yet I kept at it

Royalty would be interesting but no I'm not. Just a guy married with 6 kids that found out about Btc in 2014 and setup a headless rig to mine with and now I'm basically screwed, read my replies above

I'm from jersey why would you ask if I was a prince lol

So yes right now my backups are holding me back from recovering around 43mil.

Actually when I backedup my wallet it was on june 8th 2014 and Btc was around $600 so it over $1mil then it dropped drastically in price and I gave up on it thinking it wasn't coming back until I saw the price of Btc last at $11,000 and obviously now well over that. Between then and last week I figured it a lost cause and gave up so I'm S.O.L. For my Btc, Ltd, and doge

I still have my rig which cost me over $20k in graphic cards alone, I started mining in 2011 and in 2014 I moved my coins to my android wallet so I could watch it easier and have it on me at all times thinking it was the safest way for it. Now I know better obviously

To be honest I don't need donations but it doesnt hurt to ask. I just need some help with whatever coding I need to do to decrypt my backups and recover my coin to another wallet, the donation part was just a bonus and it got attention

Thank you. When I get these recovered, which I'm certain I will, as long as the wallet.dat file and what I'm thinking about because of your help works. I will be sending you a pm to let you know if it worked and I will send you a generous amount of Btc.

Honestly yes to a degree. In 2014 I used my galaxy s4 as my Btc wallet to deposit the coins I mined with my rig. The backups were saved before the first hard fork, 2 on flash drives and one in a Google drive account. I can't get anyone to help me with real instructions on how to decrypt the backs so that I can recover them because they aren't recovering on my old s4 even after waiting for it to sync through 46 months and after that still nothing.
