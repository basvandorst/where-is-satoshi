I can't read their name in any other way than 'you no coin', which I think is an unfortunate name for a bitcoin website, but I'm glad to see they activated Segwit.

That nickname is actually a reference to "Arrested Development" where Tobias Funke wants to combine his skills as analist and therapist so decides to call himself "analrapist".

If you mistype a bitcoin address it isn't a problem, so this won't be a problem as well.
From the Bitcoin wiki: "The probability that a mistyped address is accepted as being valid is 1 in 2^32, that is, approximately 1 in 4.29 billion."

I admit it was stupid, as soon as I clicked "Give permission" I thought: "Oops, maybe that wasn't so smart".
What's the best way to go now?

One block was 3000 bitcoins. So your comment doesn't make sense if they didn't buy all 10 blocks. That's why I think this post is bullshit as well.

This is an excellent overview for bitcoin:

A common reoccuring theme within anything related to computers seems to be: "Anything can be hacked". Recent incidents like the heartbleed-bug and bash-bug amplify the relevancy. What do you think about possible bugs in Bitcoin?

Change your DNS settings and it's easy to get US Netflix (google how-to). I switch from Dutch to US Netflix all the time.

If you really feel like that .gif, you should think of the option of buying the bitcoins back you spend. 
Everyone who doesn't want to see his/her Bitcoin position get smaller should just monthly buy an amount of Bitcoin to spend on stuff you would buy anyway with fiat currency. This way you keep your Bitcoin position and you build the Bitcoin economy (and don't forget: paying with Bitcoin is fun!).

I think this is an awesome in-depth explanation of some of the technical parts of the bitcoin protocol:

I do this all the time, but since I'm from the Netherlands most people have heard about Bitcoin and reception of the question is ranging from confused to positive, more often to the positive side.
I urge everyone to keep doing this at places you are actually planning on paying with Bitcoin if you could.

Imagine paying 3.1862btc for a lifetime membership and immediately buying 3.2 bitcoin after. If the price goes up like you're imagining you end up with a lifetime-porn-membership and 3 million dollars in bitcoin + an extra 100.000$+!!!

I watched it live and it seems the same person who put up the big sell wall sold into the buy wall at 300$, so about 4k BTC were sold by the whale I would say.

There have been a lot of topics on this subject on this subreddit. Also about their sistersites accepting BTC.
Doesn't dismiss the fact that it's awesome: just now ordered there for the 11th time since they started accepting BTC.

Because Bitonic is the largest in the Netherlands giving the option of buying bitcoins with iDEAL, users seem to have a fairly large likelihood of getting their accounts blocked while using them compared to other sites. Smaller sites seem to have less problems with this.  never had this problem. (disclosure: I'm co-owner of this site)
I don't think banks do this on purpose to screw with Bitcoin, they just have systems trying to prevent fraud/theft.

They were showing lots of media stuff. This wasn't the only time Bitcoin appeared. They used it as a hot news topic.
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:16:21
Feels like an attempt to gather email-addresses of Bitcoin users. Be careful.
I'm emailing Bitonic now to confirm.

I volunteered for a month at an animal shelter in Jogjakarta, Indonesia: [Animal Friends Jogja]( These people do amazing work. Animal abuse is a way bigger problem in Indonesia than in the west. 
I was in the process of setting up Bitcoin donations for them, but ran into some problems and left before I could finish it. 
If you think this might be a cause you want to contribute to, then I can contact them again. I'm sure we can set up Bitcoin donations and I would be happy to donate with Bitcoin to them as well.

For most people there are not a lot of reasons to use it, but there are to invest. Once invested, the step towards using is easier. 
I personally recommend everyone to educate themselves, to buy a small amount to play around with (also part of the education) and then to invest if they feel confident. I also explain them that I use Bitcoin both as an investment as well as a currency.

Priority is based on fee size (in satoshis) per transaction size (in bytes). You paid a fee of 11300/226=50 satoshis/byte. The OP paid a fee of 10467/2110=4.96 satoshis/byte. Therefore your transaction had a way higher priority than the OP's. According to  this transaction may take between 2 to 18 blocks to be included in a block. According to them there's a 90% chance that it will be conformed within this block length range (2-18)

The price equals purchasing power. The purchasing power is changing all the time and easily measured in dollars, since the dollar has relatively steady purchasing power. Measuring in pizzas would be less convenient.

Volume != buying. BTCChina didn't have any fees, so more trades per person per day were possible. Daytraders from other countries would be best off there as well, so I don't think the volume there represented the buying pressure. If you looked at market depth it was lower on BTCChina than Mtgox and even Bitstamp. They had a fair share though.

In the Netherlands you can't put that in your terms.

While you're visiting Amsterdam you could visit Delft if you have the time. It's about 45-60 minutes by train and is a cute city to visit. In the centre you can find restaurant de Waag, which i've visited a few times and paid with bitcoin for a pretty nice dinner/lunch.

If I understand correctly deposits will be converted to dollars. What conversion rates will you use for deposits/withdrawals?
