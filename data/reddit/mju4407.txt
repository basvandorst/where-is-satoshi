New Support
Jafari said in the report that there is a potential for another drop into the $1700 to $1800 range, after which she sees a substantial bump in pricing to well over $3000. The minimum target in the final wave, according to Jafari, is $2988, and the maximum is $3691. She concluded later:
    "Consider range-bound/corrective below 3,000. Shouldn’t retrace much further than 1,857-1,787. Eventually see potential for 3,691.”
Further corrections may be in store, however, considering the impending August 1 scaling deadline. Until full activation of Segwit, pricing may be anyone’s best guess.
