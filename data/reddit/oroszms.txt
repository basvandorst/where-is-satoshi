The drivers are the part of the RaspiBlitz setup. The status screen is also described in the Bonus section of the Raspibolt.

regarding wifi:
I have no experience with ZAP yet.

Are you thinking about 'prune' -ing? It would have some drawbacks, like not being able to run a Personal Electrum Server. I prefer to have everything from the Genesis block. HDD-s are quite cheap, you can get away with 500GB one for a good couple of months.

Full bitcoin node and lightning node.

Don't be confused. The Bitcoin Core 0.16.3 is the latest stable version of the reference node software implementation for the Bitcoin (BTC) network.

Anyone else trying to imply something else or just slightly different is a scammer.

There is no financial reward except some satoshis what a well connected and funded Lightning node would make in transaction routing fees.
The main benefit is being able to verify your transactions and not needing to trust a 3rd party. Like being your own bank or having your own goldsmith.

Less then 100 USD not counting the HDD (recycled) and my time. All well spent.

You're right, they should have written the same as under SEPA. It is working for deposits, just tested.

Faster payment is working, that is my post about. 21 minutes vs 2-3days of SEPA.

Yes, Coinbase is not pulling from your account, but you could set up a scheduled recurring payment with a decent banking app like Monzo.

SEPA takes 2-3 days for me, far too long with the currentvolatility. Also withdrawing any small amount of BTC is free, don't even need to pay mining fees (which are minimal now anyway). Don't keep funds on any exchange!
