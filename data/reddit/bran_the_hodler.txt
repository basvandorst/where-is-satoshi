It starts to feel that every other EU country has 0% tax when I have a damn 34%...  
Do I need to get citizenship to other country to enjoy those free gains or is it enought to just move there and live there couple of months? :/

It might be smart diversify a little bit. Do your research on alts, all of them are not trying to act like currencies and are filling totally different hole in ecosystem than Bitcoin. You might want to pick a coin or 2 from different usecase cryptos: some give privacy, some are targeted to companies for anti-counterfeit and supply chain management, some are looking to change online adverisements, there is so many potentional uses for blockchain techonology. When you find a product that you like, just go for it. Those things have massive room to grow.

Funny question to ask from bitcoin sub
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:35:34
I am quite sure that it is not profitable to mine any altcoin either with a damn 1050ti, specially laptop version
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:41:50
Here 30% for less than 30k, 34% for over 30k... It might be that those numbers did even rise 2% on new year...

Every day I think more and more that Murica is underdeveloped country. You have to pay for schools so if you are born in poor family, you are fucked for generations. You have no free healthcare, fuck poor people. You actually have limited access to internet? Feel my freedum peasants. And this whole thing with net neutrality you guys have, LOL. I am quite sure that the list does not end here, those are just first fucked up things that cross my mind. Even when I was traveling in Vietnams rural areas (10 people in tinder 100 mile radius) where people actually live in mountain tops farming rice, making their clothes by hand (fabrics too) and sell their daughters for 2000 usd... Well guess what? They too have 40 mbps unlimited internet

I have same amount of coins in all bitcoin chains, I am all set no matter which chain will be dominant in years to come. i just really really wish that it would be bitcoin and not bch or anything else. Them hardforking their own coin even though NYA was written pisses me off too as then people could use the argument that there is already a big block bitcoin

Price going down -&gt; people panic sell (which requires transaction) -&gt; fees rise -&gt; people panic more. Endless loop, we need emergency hard fork right now or people just need to stop moving their btc for a day and let the mempool clear and price to settle
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:00:28
You know that price would never increased to these numbers if no "idiot" ever bought at all time high? I assume that you are crypto billionaire by now if you have a crystal ball that can tell where the price is heading? I bought in at 350, 900 and 6000 and I am glad that people keep on buying.

Full node takes about 2 gigas of bandwidth in day right? Even the most basic internet connection available in 2017 could easily handle 100 times more. Bandwidth bottleneck is even worse excuse than HDD.

If you haven't noticed, btc was his life jacket that kept his head in surface and now that it is dipping he is drowning to depression and anxiety. My father did hang himself when he I was 13 yo, he did talk about it alot, I have been really close from taking my own life and I have had my own battle with depression for 4 years now. I am hanging on to see game of thrones finale and hope that my blockfolio is 1M by then and maybe I'll find joy with it. Luckily I got in at 400$ so this dip isn't so bad for me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:12:18
Then why arent you on ethereum subs glorifying vitalik?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:09:53
Mempool is 100 MB, it means 100 blocks. If there was no new transactions , it would clear fast
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:01:23
The difference is that we do not have "cash" after our name. And we are still having segwit + LN coming. But we seriously need scaling solution right now if we want to keep our status as  crypto 2018. See what happened to myspace, yahoo, motorola etc
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:25:28
Those CEO's present over 80% of hashing power, 58 companies from 22 countries. You can't really get a better deal with decentralized system like bitcoin. Do you propose that there should have been 200 000 node runners and 10 million users to sign that too? On that date majority of bitcoin agreed for 2mb segwit and the minority should just respect that
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:50:17
  America might be big, but population density is in quite good shape. Also your GDP is huge, so there should be no excuses about fiber prices.  
Can agree that your ISP/government situation is really fucked up. But for most people outside of US it's defianetly more about hardware cost to run node than bandwidth limits. This backlog is unacceptable and we defianetly will need blocksize increase asap. There is many cryptos out there that want to take the crown from BTC and if BTC is unable to make the changes needed, I am afraid that we will lose the  spot during 2018. This latest dif adjusment ate quite alot of bitcoins dominance and every week without solution to scaling solution will eat investors trust to not just bitcoin but whole crypto market.  
Now that you look back how much media attention bitcoin has got during 2017, just imagine how much adoption it could have now if we scaled to increased demand. We might easily be over $40 000 by now. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:54:33
Finally! Gdax has been flat lining atleast 24 hours! That is not how I like my cryptos!
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:01:20
Bitcoin is brand, the first, the biggest, the bitcoin. That alone would give us one way ticket to the moon really fast, if we just had a scaling solution. It does not matter what kind of technology altcoins have, make bitcoin great again and we all get moon lambos.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:46
Bitcoin failing to scale for rising demand, we need bigger blocks right about 2 months ago, exponentially rising mempool and fees, media saying that bitcoin jesus bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver sold all his bitcoins, coinbases adding bch without warning when btc difficulty adjust, insider trading etc etc. This is bit of healthy correction, lack of trust, panic selling, takin out profits... Who knows
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:11:13
None wired connection have ever had data cap, and even wireless connections had data caps only in the early days of 3G, haven't seen any isp having data limits for years now. Actually I let my wired adsl internet go away about 3 years ago after lightning broke my modem 3 times in 2 years. I've been using cheapest 4G since then, it is faster and more reliable than my old internet, it only has little higher latency which is quite sad for gaming but I am really happy with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:14:20
Good, so after increasing the blocksize we get 4MB+  as current blocks clearly are not enought.

I was never against the 2x fork and I was geniunely pissed off when it got rejected. Disrespect of the NYA kinda destroyed my whole trust in the community. What was the main point of it being rejected? The lack of replay protection? That is exactly how you should handle the hardfork, let the old chain die and move to another. How can we ever agree to any change anymore when written agreement by all parties just got dumpstered earlier?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:01:51
This, absolutely no need to move coins atm if ypu do not really really have to. Changing to segwit address would just make things worse, do it with your next meaningful transaction
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:55:10
Oh yes please, lets have this kind of posts coming until we get a block size increase! HDD space costs almost nothing and 4g internets can easily handle waaay bigger blocks than these. Every transaction in our mempool will come to main chain anyway, do we really want to pay 100 times higher fees than necessary and wait hours when we could have instant and cheap transactions? And as these kind of posts are considered as trolling shill talk or whatever I need to state that my blockfolio is 80% btc and 20% alts, invested balls deep in 2015. I really want bitcoin to shine, but it isn't happening with these fees and hopes that LN and segwit would get 100℅ adoption right now.  
Without IMMEDIATE scaling solution we will get the same destiny as myspace, yahoo, motorola and nokia
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:45:16
This should be stickied to front page untill people stop living in their cloud castles with their pink sunglasses. Hdd space costs nearly nothing, not everyone needs to run node with 5 year old android phone

Most recent? There is dozen of other forks after bitcoin cash ��
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:53:20
Meanwhile 49% of hashing power comes from 2 mining pools
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:17:23

Any cryptocurrency that isn't bitcoin. But I think that even all altcoins have too hard difficulty for solomining with 1050ti. Electricity costs more than you get from mining.
