I can make any chart look like Bitcoin's (or any other crypto).
Truth is - nobody knows what will happen next. Just sit tight and enjoy the ride.

Why would you need your $20 in 30mins so badly you're willing to pay such a high fee? Quality shitpost.
Not defending the current scaling issues but these shitposts are getting ridiculous.
Go buy some biiitconneeeeec instead.

How is that stupid? If you look into BTC for 10mins, you'll quickly find out about these high fees and long transaction times. I just don't get why people act surprised. Not saying it's okay - but please do your research before you act. All I'm trying to say.

Sir, you have won the HODL game. Not only did you hodl througout all of the dips - you literally HODL'd your life. Much respect. I wish you a long and prosperous life!

Still waiting mate.

So people will massively panic sell when it goes from 7.xk to 6.xk again? Utter bullshit mate. The real panic sells happened in the last 6-7 months ;-)

Sherman’s comments are ridiculous �� You can tell he has absolutely no clue and is scared.

Two things:  
\* You never shared the public address of the wallet. This can help people help you.  
\* Why on earth did you, allegedly, transfer 30 BTC and 3BCH to a new wallet without even doing a test transfer first?
