Why should we finance your dream? 
I have my own dreams to finance.

Here you go.

Why would he do this? There was barely enough time for him to get his own coins out! A much more sensible solution would have been to do it over a week or so.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:12:03
Right, Are you free now? Do you have skype so we can talk. Ill PM you.

I think what people don't seem to realize is that a bitcoin is STILL WORTH $125 with a market cap of 1.8 Billion. 
In no way is it dead.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:18:50
Could you expand this to the UK? I would love that!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:26:39
Is that a buy or a sell?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:54:21
This may sound silly, but a tip to anybody of 20btc would definitely make news across reddit... Would be a good way to get a message out.

1. 20
2. Student 
3. I like the ideas behind it but I got in to it to make quick cash. 
4. I dont think it has long term sticking power but if my aim to to make some money. Then yes.
5. Far too hard to convert fiat to BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:25:25
So... Is that good news or bad news?
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:20:23
Id be up for buying a bitcoin. This is a 10 Minute Email address:
Contact me there.

I doubt he was an actually billionaire. You'd need 4Mil coins to be a billionaire which is over 1/3 of the total market.

If by 'not cancelling' you mean, 'the cancel button doesnt work'. 
It does. Click it and then wait a few minutes.

Just replying to say that the deal with Rotsor went very well. Great Buyer! If you need me to vouch for the payments then just PM me!
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:22:20
Like shit. Why would they do that if they can prove they can make this much money without? 
Will upgrading their servers improve their income? I think not.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:52:47
Ive replied.

I am tipping him so much when he brings it back up. He could well be doing a better service than any single force in Bitcoin at this time, by literally doing nothing...
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:48:47
Going via LocalBitcoins I would be underselling by about £8 per coin. I cant really afford that.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:38:21
Cant I transfer via USD? OkPay is only 1% to transfer but I cant seem to enter any information to get it to my account.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:40:43
Well, lucky, their values going back up:
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:54:04
And Mt.Gox charge 6%.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:10:28
What makes you think this?
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:02:22
Are you interested in purchasing the BTC-E voucher?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:10:54
Nobody did this. There is nobody to blame. When the price starts to drop there is no stopping it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:41:48
And how would I go about selling BTC-E vouchers?
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:04:32
That may seem like a lot but just yesterday there was a buy of over 1500BTC. Its weird that 77k doesn't even seem that outrageous to me anymore...
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:16:51
Its not a DDOS. Its just that MtGox cant handle the load.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:38:57
Brace for the end of this dip.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:28:31
On my phone I'm getting between £70 and £103... This is crazy.

Turns out it was a problem with PingIt as it appears they where overwhelmed by the number of transfers. The guy I talked to was very helpful and is going to refund me the amount of bitcoins I lost. Kudos to blockchain.
