Acknowledging reality is delusional? Do you even know what delusional means? K genius, check back with me 100, 200, or even 500 years from now and we’ll see if poverty has been “eliminated”. I bet you think FDR was a great guy and the reason his marxist domestic policies didn’t “eliminate” poverty in the US was because he was just misunderstood, amrite? Lmao, fucking hell you reddit superheroes provide some much needed comic relief around here. Thanks for the laugh sweetheart.

Ok so how is everyone using bitcoin? Do you just buy btc with fiat and then do all your spending with btc? Are you actually making more btc off your btc? I just don’t get it, it seems like such a clusterfuck now. Back when there were simplistic exchanges like circle and mining was actually profitable it made so much more sense.

Give me 50 btc right now and I’ll go buy a GT-R, fuck those italian pieces of shit.

What goes up must come down, ie. Prosperity, inflation, markets, etc. etc. etc. 
You are either trolling or simpleton of the year if you really believe planet earth will ever be some kind of marxist utopia where everyone is equal and usury doesn’t exist.
