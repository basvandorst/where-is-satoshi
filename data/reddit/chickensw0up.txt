So, what kind of math are we looking at with 24TH/s?

He is probably talking about one of his friends/acquaintances, who said he will "hack bitcoin" while in reality neither of them know anything about bitcoin or hacking

I bought a 14TH miner a month ago, because i can still break even, with my hydro rate, and because at some point, in bitcoin history, someone paid a ridiculous ammount of BTC(for today) for Papa Johns pizza. Point is, if it was a bubble, it wouldve bursted out of its existence by Febuary 2018

Here in Quebec, a province in Canada, electricity is $0.05CAD per kWh. So in USD its even less. My 14TH/S is profitable to run. I got into mining because the S9 cost me lessthan $250 USD, and i always wanted one. Planning to get more miners, onve my financial situation gets better. What you also have to keep in mind, is the fact that alot of people that are mining, are doing so as a form of investment, with long term goals. No one knows what future holds for Bitcoin, but like many others, I believe it has a potential to climb to $8-10K by the end of 2020. Especially because of the halving event.

Thank you for breaking it down for me. I will stick with the smaller pool. I believe that people should keep in mind the idea of what bitcoin stands for, when choosing a minibg pool.
