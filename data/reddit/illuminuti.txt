Satoshi means "born from the ashes"
*‘What about Satoshi?’ ‘It means “ash”,’ he said. ‘The philosophy of Nakamoto is the neutral central path in trade. Our current system needs to be burned down and remade. That is what cryptocurrency does – it is the phoenix …’ ‘So satoshi is the ash from which the phoenix …’ ‘Yes. And Ash is also the name of a silly Pokémon character. The guy with Pikachu.’ Wright smiled. ‘In Japan the name of Ash is Satoshi,’ he said. *

Look at the Rothschild owned Economist magazine from 1988.
They said we'd be ready for a world currency by 2018.
Coincidence?

Right now, yeah, most people give their power away to the government and whoever claims to be the authority. 
But we the people way out number the small group of people who control the financial system. 
325,000,000 Americans obeying the 535 members of congress who dictate their lives.
We have the power, in numbers alone.
Fortunately people are questioning the government and banks now more than ever.

Look at the stock market, when it inevitably pops, people will look to put their currency elsewhere. 
The US dollar has lost nearly 1/3 of it's value since 2000, due to inflation alone.

Watch out, you might end up believing that the mainstream media and government are lying to us... and that Freemasonry is more than just a gentleman's social club.
We all know money controls our lives, we all know money controls the world... but to think there are men who control money... now that's crazy talk.

It's just coincidence.
