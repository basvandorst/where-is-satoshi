The sheer rate at which they are issued is enough to raise eyebrows, not to mention the shabbiness of their last "audit". This is too important for "innocent until proven guilty", I shifted towards "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" a long time ago.

Their *white paper* says they will prove solvency by issuing regular audits. Most of their business model relies on this solvency.
No audits since they opened for business means they're not respecting their own standards for proof of solvency. 
Therefore they are worth exactly no trust, and we should assume they are insolvent since part of their "solvency equation" is missing. They explicitly put the burden of proof upon themselves. They failed to fulfill it.

It's what people refer to when they say that bitcoin is deflationary. No central entity can flood the market with currency, so increased use means using smaller and smaller amounts of the currency to pay for the same amount of goods/services, globally increasing the price of every unit of currency.
This is actually extremely basic stuff in bitcoin theory! I hope you didn't buy too much of it because you sound very clueless and if you bought you're probably the greater fool they're referring to here.

You got the order mixed up. Innovations in ASIC energy efficiency benefit Bitcoin, but Bitcoin-mining ASICs are a drop in the bucket of the entire ASIC industry. R&amp;D money invested in Bitcoin ASIC production and design is unlikely to effect the industry at large.

Seriously dude, I don't know what you're not getting. Others have pointed to you already that the costs of running a full node are higher than running a light node. If utility (to yourself) is the same, you go with the lowest cost option. This is basic 101-level economics. The benefits of preserving the system as a whole by running a full node are not material enough to the individual user to justify the vastly higher cost, so most individual users choose to offload those costs to the ones who benefit from it (ex. miners), as well as the few users altruistic enough to shoulder high costs for no benefit (in the lingo, those are called "suckers", and even though one is born every minute, it might not be enough). Have you seriously never heard of the Tragedy of the Commons? I mean, take a few minutes and scribble some payoff tables on a napkin, this shit ain't hard.

I totally agree with your statement. Except in real life, the [exact opposite is happening]( Since this chart was made, both Steam and Square, two big players, stopped accepting bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-02-06 00:12:41
3 things :
1. So what?
2. High transaction fees is as much an economic problem as a technical one. Technical problems limit the supply of available transactions, demand drives up the price. Supply and demand is economics 101.
3. [They totally did drop it because of the volatility](

This has been tried before. 
The usual result is that merchants get pissed off and end up with a negative opinion of bitcoin users, rightfully seeing it as the harassment campaign it is. The ones who succumb and setup the required facilities to accept bitcoin end up with no one actually using them (because face it, most users want to HODL to get rich, not actually spend the things). The ones who actually get clients paying with bitcoin end up having bad customer support experiences because of fees, transaction times, volatility, etc. 
You must be incredibly new to crypto if you didn't see this play out yourself already.
