How so?
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:01:03
Lol, you mean you don't know, because the SEC won't become irrelevant, not from bitcoin anyways. If you stepped off the bandwagon and actually learned about capital markets in the United States and their mechanics you could see that.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:56:13
How would bitcoin replace the SEC? Truly curious.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:54:23
What does that even mean, you're success has to do with yourself not the big bad government blah blah blah 
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:07:53
You should just quote other people's ideas professionally. Not but seriously the SEC will not be defunct in 10 years from bitcoin, I'm not sure you fully understand what the SEC actually does based on your reasoning lol 
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:03:43
Yas yas, there is great talk about making banks irrelevant with bitcoin (though is it not logical to think that banks would begin loaning bitcoin?), but this still doesn't answer my question about how it would make the SEC irrelevant. The SEC is not a bank. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:52:53
Do you plan on living with your parents forever? Will you have no other bills in 2-3 years? How can one be so indifferent to $10k?
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:54:09
Haha, settle down sheesh is that how you get your points across, by hurling insults? All I am saying is that to mitigate risk you don't keep all of your assets in cash. I didn't say I trust banks. Just that it would be wise not to keep all of your holdings in cash, or even if one was so inclined, within one bank. Most businesses follow this. Just like it would be unwise to keep *all* of your holdings in Bitcoin, which is what I feel you are implying is a wise thing to do. 
Do you really not use banks in any way? Do you not use currency besides Bitcoin lol?
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:58:34
You would use market technicals like moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc., they all attempt to show when assets are over/underbought and when momentum is shifting. 
Look at [this chart]( if you're interested, you can clearly see when BTC price crosses below the EMA there is a sell-off, and vice versa when the price runs up. For some reason people here like to say "Always buy now" or "the time to buy is always now", but this is often not true from a technical perspective. 
Even if Bitcoin is the be all end all of currencies, it still behaves just like any other asset class and it's comical how people intentionally overlook this on this sub.  
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:56:06
Lol what world are you in where you do not use banks? Do you have no savings? No home/mortgage? How would you provide for a family without a loan? And if you do not have any of those things, you fail to realize that the most of the world does and population is exponentially increasing and they will all rely on banks for loans. **Even if the world switches to bitcoin people will need to borrow bitcoin to survive**.
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:23:47
Lol ok. Yes, there is a divide between rich and poor, as there has been since the Roman times. Those who work in banking (even though that is the broadest thing ever) specifically those who manage/own banks, are among the top wealthiest in the world. You're right, it is like a big club, as when you get to the top of *any* industry it is. Your two sets of rules could apply to anything similar, like those who use facebook are schmucks but those who own facebook are in the club. When I started replying to you bitcoin was heading towards its all-time high, now it has corrected itself, just like every asset class does. Would it have been wise to have all of your money in bitcoin at this time? Absolutely not, as the high will always correct itself. You're the reason people lose money buying bitcoin, you regurgitate all of these semi-agreeable things from this sub like "banks are evil (even though I use them b/c they provide a service that everyone needs and it's really just the people who use them stupidly who are stupid)", even though you provide no other alternative besides putting all of your cash into bitcoin. And that is just bad advice. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:04:13
tbh it sounds like you want to keep riding the high from your sizable returns thus far. The last time it hit $1000 I did the same thing and bought more thinking I was a genius (not saying you think you're a genius). It is important to remember that anyone who makes bolder predictions on bitcoin's future, (like 100+% return year over year for 2 years in a row) probably has a vested stake in bitcoin itself and would profit if people en masse invested based off of their words.
Bitcoin is at an all time high, keep in mind that, historically, there should be a correction that follows.

You can't say true, anti-hive mind things here!
@_date: 2017-01-01 16:58:38
Right, still important to note though from a technical perspective, one could buy all in, watch the price detract for a year then sell for a loss not knowing that they bought at a high 
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:38:35
Lol I'm in my 20's, not a scared old person, and I see the value of minimizing risk. Let's say I own $1 million in investments, and also work a full time job, do I have the time to safeguard that $1 million on my own? For a small fee I can pay a professional to manage it, and continue to experience my life without that worry. Do you not see the value in that?
I like bitcoin, it serves a new, unique purpose. However, banks serve a purpose as well. If the world turned to bitcoin tomorrow, the banks would be right there lending and loaning people bitcoin. Banks will always be around, there are good and bad ones, but to say banking will die off when the "scared old people" die off is not true, because it is not just scared old people who use the banking system, it is pretty much everyone. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:53:41
Tbh the volume of bitcoin compared to bank transactions is miniscule; a rounding error if that. Not to mention banks don't just hold your money, they invest and sell loans (this is how they make money). So they really do not have any competition nor will they for a long, long time. Or at least until bitcoin becomes user friendly for the average person or business owner. Bitcoin's shtick is that it puts the power in your hands, but imagine a business owner doing millions of dollars of business a year, at that point I would gladly pay extra for a bank to safeguard my funds with insurance instead of worrying about security on my own end. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:10:21
Haha with that kind of discourse youre soo destined to be a millionaire 
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:28:24
Yes yes put your son's future into one, new, unproven asset class
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:05:24
You're right, every single person who doesn't like risk is a socialist, progressive, liberal, risk-averse baby. No one should take risk into consideration when holding assets, because that would be stupid, and you wouldn't have any "freedom". 


What is so evil about our "banking system", if you need money to buy a house for your family, you get a loan and pay it back. There's no free lunch. Educate yourself on how to correctly borrow money, or manage money instead. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:44:57
When you invest in anything you should kiss that money goodbye immediately. This is the reason you do not invest 90% of your money into any one thing. If you are thinking of a scenario where you may need to cash out your bitcoin to pay your bills then you're going about this wrong. What if bitcoin goes to $100 and you need to pay bills? Bitcoin is not as liquid as cash in a savings account. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:59:55
Lol $100k will still be a lot of money even with inflation of 2%, add that to your salary and savings accumulated over 30 years of work, along with 401k, Roth, other investments (if the person is smart). How could you shy away from a low-risk $100k in 30 years versus a high-risk $100k in who knows when. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 01:30:24
Did you go to school at the anti-establishment academy. How do you judge someone as a nobody just because they use banks? EVERYONE USES BANKS. Since you didn't answer my question, and chose to hurl insults instead, I assume you do as well. Here's what you're missing, if I wanted to borrow money to start a business and the only currency in the world is bitcoin....I would have to borrow bitcoin...from someone else....like a bank that loans bitcoin. Do you think borrowing money is bad? That's how the world works, people borrow money and pay it back. Hence, banks fulfill the supply that *people* demand.
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:04:47


Lol what an indictment. Money managers aren't all scammers, if you're a millionaire you're not going to take the time and effort to manage your own money. It's too risky, time consuming, and you should have a professional. That's why the person is a millionaire. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:18:04
If from bitcoin, thats different, that means you were at the right place right time. Someone whos worked for their money knows what I'm talking about when I say you'd pay someone to manage your money. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:05:11
why are you quoting "has your back"? I didn't say that. What you're saying still doesn't negate my argument of spreading out assets to mitigate risk. You don't have all of your assets as one type (ex, cash in savings). By your examples, one could hold gold instead of bitcoin to mitigate the risk of currency devaluation.  
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:59:03
...so what would a price decrease signal?
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:48:27


But I think he is referring to after it hit its peak &gt;$1000 all of these "wise bitcoin sages" came in and claimed $10,000 by the end of the year mark! my words! its deflationary! blah blah blah. We know what happened after that, and there were probably many suckers who listened to those people and lost money. I think this person isn't thinking about risk and only the *non-guaranteed* ridiculous returns that he is hearing from all of these "analysts". 
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:56:31
What OP seems to not understand is that proper money management doesn't have you put all your cash in savings or even *one* bank, so if things do "go south" (like it happens instantly right) you will still have your assets spread out and avoid more risk. 
You are apart of "the system" as well if you live on Earth. If you think reddit didn't borrow from banks or your parents/relatives for that matter...

Lol you can send me $100k then, since you seem to not value it. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:27:59
We may be the same person. I used to trade everything based on emotion and if I thought the company or Bitcoin looked good, then I learned about technicals and realized it's the only way to trade and effectively minimize risk. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:01:35
In fact during the Tulip Mania if someone said something like this they were mocked for not investing
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:53:04
You add a negative connotation to that like the people who would be issuing Bitcoin loans wouldn't be banks...If Bitcoin really is the "currency of the future" then it follows that loans will be in Bitcoin, meaning banks will be giving Bitcoin loans. Does that really sound illogical?
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:41:49


lol if you can give me proof of this and how you *know* then I will pay you for the rest of my life

Honest question, why does the block size need to increase to 2MB? And won't it just have to keep increasing throughout time as transactions increase?
