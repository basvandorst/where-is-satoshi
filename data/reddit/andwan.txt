China saves the world from bitcoin:
Imagine the energy consumption is rising and rising because bigger and bigger parts of the financial world are moving to cryptocurrencies (with Prove-of-work). So the whole of human economy starts to depend on the cryptocurrency system. But there is also climate change.. And thus, China takes the role, they were already given fictionally in the movie 2012: They save the world with their technological skills, their size, and their centralized political structure.
What they do is the following: They coordinate their &gt;51% mining power to sabotage the block chain. -&gt; People run away from BTC, or try to make changes to the algorithm. But whenever there is a new currency rising with Prove-of-work, they just start their machines again, and destroy that one too.
So, in the end, all the big financal streams have moved to Prove-of-stake, where china has no influnce, because they wont ever posess more than 50% of the coins. The world is saved. And China can proudly lean back. (Of course while keeping their farms ready to be restarted at any time. Similar to the US/Russia and their mutual destructive arsenal of nuclear weapons)
Sorry for the overflow of fantasy here :)

I do hold BTC and no BCH. But still I feel that both have the same right on the name "bitcoin". Only time and people can decide what will be "the bitcoin". Of course at the moment it looks lile BTC has won.
But then again, I really see the problem with the high fees. However, instead of BCH, it could also be any other altcoin to win on the field of small transactions (where fees just cannot be five times the value of your coffee).

So if I wanted to invest some 1000 dollars in cryptocurrencies in the next weeks: What would you recomend me, to support Proof-of-stake, and still make money with it?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:34:04
Interesting! Thanks. At the moment, after reading parts of the wikipedia article, what strikes me most is the following (next to the energy question): 
"Peercoin's developer claims that this makes a malicious attack on the network more difficult due to the lack of a need for centralized mining pools - and the fact that purchasing more than half of the coins is likely more costly than acquiring 51% of proof-of-work hashing power ."(wikipedia)
The last line seems so important to me, because I believe it's a big thing, which few people talk about: Much more than 50% of the mining power is located in China. There was one small post on reddit about this. Where someone also added, that a single company produces 70% of the chips.
And about China: Ok, I see the argument, saying, as long as they want to make money with mining they are absolutely not interested in changing the block chain and thus losing peoples trust in bitcoin. But however if they at any time in the future have some different goal, they can easily stop the network from working (or beeing used) quickly.
And it's not that I think China is evil. Its just maybe the singlemost country that has, or will have, the political structure and skills to guide such a complex synchronization of individual miners. I feel.
But who knows: maybe they will save the world from bitcoin once (see next comment...)

I assumed the number of transactions per block beeing constant? Isn't this what has to fit into the 1MB of Bitcoin Core Blocks? Or are you a fan of increased block size? (8 MB etc.)

I never really though about the cooling. That is also interesting.
In general I would say: maybe in the future, the heat can even be used to heat buildings. Heating is still one of the last bastions where fossil fuels is better than using electrical power. But I guess if so much excessive heat is beeing produced, you could gain from using it for heating.
Maybe in the future every district of a city has a small mining farm that produces heat for the houses of the district by mining bitcoins!

Tell this to your grand children which will live in the climate that we are influencing now.
@_date: 2018-10-17 02:03:34
I am very concerned about the energy consumption of bitcoin. But the one positive argument I see is more or less what you have pointed out here: It can help to accelerate innovation in power technology. Making the burning of fossil fuels useless much earlier, because power has become so much cheaper thanks to bitcoin (and many other factors of course)
I so much cross my fingers! We, as humanity, are really running fast towards abyss or at least towards steep descent with the climate issue. Lets hope our grandchildren wont hate us :)

I think I see what you mean. Me myself I am still using an ecological footprint of more than two earths. Here in switzerland it is just very hard to go down to 1 even if you dont fly and eat little meat. But I would tell them: I try to use it to solve problems and to convince others to reduce it together. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 01:55:12
Doesnt for example Peercoin combine PoS with PoW? For exactly this reason, the fairer coin distribution, they have a small PoW, that also reduces over time. Thats how I remember it.
But I think you are pointing to an important issue: I saw some graphs for the coin distribution of NXT and Ardor and in both cases, some few persons were holding two thirds of the coins. Which also would be the killer state for a PoS Algorithm, I guess. But I have to admit I never investigated it further, just saw these figures.
Would also love to see these figures for Peercoin (a favorite of mine, very old/stable).

Mining them always at times when electicity is cheap! Currently this is at night, in the futre it might be during daytime, due to solar power plants...
In both cases, this would not be a problem for bitcoin! Because there is always one half of the globe that has night (or day). 
@_date: 2018-10-17 01:43:12
That is a very interesting calculation! (I myself cannot judge the correctness of all details)
But as another person has also stated, I do believe that big miners in China for example have prices for electricity that you get nowhere else. E.g. caused by power plants that are built for cities that dont even fully exist yet. Things like this. But I do not know any details here either.
And I also think, that with the wrong equipment many small miners are already making minus now. Or have switched to altcoins.
In general, isnt it exactly the concept behind bitcoin mining, that these two big numbers will always be very close to each other? Maybe with a positive rather than a negative difference.
And also in general: this huge energy cost is a pitty.... A big pitty for me..

If you are trading bitcoins from a ideological motivation. Even if its only partly ideological: What about the crazy amount of energy? 300 mWh per transaction... (According to wikipedia) and this will even rise a lot, I guess
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:44:25
Thus would be the coolest thing: The success of any mining-farm really depends on costs of power like almost no other part of economy. And since farms can be placed almost anywhere in the world: this might drive technology towards an even more efficient use of cheap renewable ressources.... so long the ideal plot :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:27:34
I think the increase in difficulty for the algorithm to mine one bitcoin will (and also should) outcompete this increase in efficiency. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:18:01
Yeah of course: I wanted to say KWh, sorry. (What I actually wrote was milliWatthours, I guess :)
Which still means: letting 150- 250 vacuum cleaners run in parallel for 1 hour... But ok, the price of 32$ (or less) is also a good comparison.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:39:48
I think the broadness of your comparison is legit. And to go even broader: For my taste bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still not going far enough to fight the system. I believe that virtual cultural entities (like god, but also like the reddit hivemind) are an even more radical way to oppose static and materialistic/hierarchical classical systems. 
Maybe in the not so distant future, with the advance of AI, there will even be something in between: mining bitcoins is pure and simple math. Getting Reddit karma on the other hand is mostly knowing how humans work and make some good jokes here and there. But as AI proceeds there might be some entity online where you have to get your score/money by interacting with a growing blockchain of content-like information, just in a slightly more formal way than on reddit.

Go on... What is the content of your cypherpunk philosophy?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:27:40
Ever since that front page article about the energy consumption of bitcoin, it was on my todo-list: learn what exactly proof of state is.
@_date: 2018-11-17 07:08:01
I am a bit out of the loop: What was the "hard way" that made nChain learn about the block size? Did they have technical difficulties in the hash war?
