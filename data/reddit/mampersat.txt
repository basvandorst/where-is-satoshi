A girl at our office is pregnant and everyone puts in a buck and guesses the baby info (weight, date+time born etc) and whoever is closest gets the money.

Feature: Google Maps integration showing how the world is currently swearing.

Added some "proof of charity" stuff... still not 100% satisfied with it. Removed the "keep the server running" as that sounds kinda sketch when I think about it.

For "proof" sake - I'm posting the address here:  18cQQknxu1XJXVCbCnuyZq9Ws48mfYLmzd

Fixed - thanks

Somehow let user enter phrase and pay and verify the payment was for that phrase then post on additional page for public view - maybe make this an option?

Looks like the same QR code under the fist one... the bottom row matches

One possible feature I'd like is to let the user submit a twitter-length phrase that is analyzed for swears (regex) and if they pay it get's posted on the page.
@_date: 2013-05-11 20:56:28
Feature: Different payment for every swear or maybe just group swears into buckets of "Really Bad" down to "Not so bad" and corresponding ammounts
@_date: 2013-06-01 16:30:31
Added all suggestions except "suck"

The internet decides. Working on API call to NoSwearing.com list of swears. For the alpha/beta I google and found a list to start with. If need be I can open source the list/etc, but for the sake of this project, I'm not too worried about being perfect on the list.

Charity:  = MPAA - help them determine what really is a swear
