Yet another company using "blockchain" for something, where I can't figure out why? 
There's an NFC chip in the shoe. Fine.
There's a unique ID / key in the chip that can be read by a smartphone app. Fine.
This is a bit more hassle for counterfeiters to implement. Great.
The app can query a server to see if the scanned ID / key exists. Wonderful.
Now where does a blockchain come into it?

That's true in general. You could implement a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency system using just one timestamping server. But the problem is that people will have to trust such a server.
Yup, but here it's a private blockchain implemented by this company - there are no other miners except them. I don't see the point.


Read the code off the NFC chip in a real shoe, write that into a new chip in the counterfeit shoe during manufacture. All this is, is a serial number. There's no difference between what they've set up and just printing a serial number on the shoe that you can type into a website with a database.

I'm no expert, but mining is just your computer taking the last valid block and trying to make a new one based on it by guessing a solution over and over. 
Every 10 minutes or so, some miner on the network guesses correctly, and their block becomes the new one that everyone uses for their guessing. 
If your miner isn't on the network, it'll never be told that some other miner guessed correctly and that everyone else on the network is now working on a newer block. Your miner will keep on guessing, but if it does eventually guess correctly, it won't matter as the network has moved on.

Super. A few more hacks and controversies, and the price might get back down to 2 dollars again so I can buy in. ;)

As it stands in the US at the moment, it comes down to particularity - if the government can show that a bitcoin address is yours, refusing to give them the associated private key would not be protected by the 5th amendment.

This is completely baseless, these regs are from years ago and were never introduced.

Again, login timestamps prove nothing. Without the timestamps of the actual transactions - the hacker's sell order and Kevin's buy order - MagicalTux hasn't a leg to stand on.

Hi, I'm thinking of a similar set-up. What motherboard and PSU are you going to use? What cooling will you use, given the 4 cards will be right next to each other?
@_date: 2011-06-22 16:08:35
Where does it say "Kevin places buy order"? Oops, it doesn't. So this log is completely meaningless. 
@_date: 2011-06-22 18:51:39
By all means link them then. I asked for a source and haven't seen anything yet, just hearsay.
@_date: 2011-06-22 18:53:42
Sure, but again the log that MagicalTux posted in no way indicative of collusion between Kevin and the hacker. Until logs of the actual transactions are made available there's no way to tell.
@_date: 2011-06-22 16:06:42
Without a line that says "Kevin places buy order" this log is completely meaningless.
@_date: 2011-06-22 15:50:11
Do you have a source for that? All I've seen are login timestamps, which prove nothing.
@_date: 2011-06-22 16:12:15
We know MtGox whipped up a witch hunt because we can read their posts on that forum. They slandered this guy Kevin with zero evidence. 
All they've shown is that he and the hacker logged into the site around the same time, the same could be said of dozens if not hundreds of other people on a busy website.
If they could show that Kevin's buy order happened *before* or suspiciously soon after the hacker's sell, they might have a case. However all they've shown so far is login times, not transaction times.

I still have no idea what she's on about..
Like, she has a compressed encoded waveform (MP3, whatever) on her server. Fine.
I need to have a copy of that waveform on my computer so I can send it my sound card. Great.
What *exactly* is her novel mechanism for getting the data from A to B, and what is the benefit given that once I have the data in memory, I'm going to do whatever the hell I want with it?
@_date: 2011-06-22 16:16:27
That simply isn't a believeable claim based on the log he quoted. You can login to a web site and then do nothing for minutes or hours on end before deciding to create a transaction. 
We need to see the timestamp of Kevin's buy order and the timestamp of the hacker's sell order. Without this info there is no basis for a claim of collusion between them whatsoever.

I want to know how they got the server. Even with all of DPR's mistakes, without the server they would not have had enough to build a case.
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:25:01
Apparently so, check out the top of page 30 of the PDF.

I haven't been paying attention to these ATMs so far but.. scanning your palm? What the fuck? There's no way I'd do that no matter how badly I wanted some blow stamps.

ID is one thing, but literally no-one else in the world has my fingerprint data right now and I intend to keep it that way if at all possible.

Yeah if it's a VM you're screwed.. I wonder is there a way for a *nix kernel to prove to itself whether or not it's running on bare metal, even if the VM is trying to fool it. I guess it's one of those "is this the real world or a simulation" sort of questions.

He wasn't arrested until now though, so they would not have been able to take his computer. Plus they talked to him on July 10th, but only got access to the server on July 23rd. tbh I can't believe Ulbricht didn't fucking wipe everything as soon as that first interview was over.. one of his many mistakes.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:53:22
I really want to know how they got the server. Without the server (and it's foolishly comprehensive store of apparently unencrypted private messages going back months) they would not have had enough evidence to build a case. 
The complaint PDF above glosses over this part, probably because they did something dodgy like the malware incidence a little while ago?
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:23:54
Wow that's like 8 pizzas right there!
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:09:59
Possibly.. but that happened back in July, surely Ulbricht would have pulled the plug as soon as that happened if he was hosting there? I'm not a user of SR myself, but wasn't it operating normally until now?
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:19:01
Is it possible he's been under arrest and in jail for 3 months on forgery charges and no-one on SR has noticed? I'm not a user of SR so I don't know if he's been missing since then.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:37:21
Makes sense.
Step 1: Bust a silk road vendor the old-fashioned way.
Step 2: Get his (foolishly saved) list of customers names and addresses.
Step 3: PM Roberts threatening to release this list unless he pays off a debt.
Step 4: Convince Roberts that another account is the guy who is owed the debt, earn Roberts' confidence by "executing" the "extortionist".
Step 5: Having earned Robert's confidence, get him to buy some fake IDs, complete with his real photo.
Step 6: Stage a "routine" intercept of the parcel, confirm Roberts is Ross Ulbricht by matching the photo on the fake IDs with his face and his Texas ID.
Step 7: Surveil Ulbricht, somehow over the next two weeks track from him to the server.
Step 8: Image server, get loads more evidence tying Roberts and Ulbricht together.
Step 9: Arrest Ulbricht

They are already far more fast and efficient at moving money internally than Bitcoin could hope to be. Their whole business is made in the spread between how cheaply they can move money vs how much they can charge for doing it. If they are to make money from Bitcoin it's as mini exchanges, basically treating Bitcoin as yet another forex.
@_date: 2013-10-04 10:10:28
We still don't know how they got the server, that will hopefully come out at the trial.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:33:49
Who are the presenters? Is it normal for them to have absolutely no clue about what they're discussing? I feel dumber having listened to that.
@_date: 2013-02-06 14:20:53
I think he's saying the per-nonce speed increases with difficulty, which is nice, but the 'difficulty' of finding the right nonce is increasing even faster with difficulty. So this method would never make the problem trivial, but it could potentially beat out the standard brute force method eventually.

Like any smart technologist he's able to separate "bitcoin the payment system" and "bitcoin the currency". He's praising the former but leaving his impression of the later unsaid, though you can guess where he stands by his mention of governments.
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:14:03
Yup, certainly enough has been published about Tor vulnerablities, and SR would have been enough of an outlier on the network in terms of traffic. I'm surprised they got so much from the server. If I was designing such a service I would be expecting it to be found and imaged, and would set things up accordingly.
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:18:02
I was bitten by one of those little fuckers as a kid at Vic falls! Grr. Anyway, best of luck with your trip.
