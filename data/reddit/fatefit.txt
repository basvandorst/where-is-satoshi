I have a few years under my belt and I can say that no matter where you are in life, you end up getting used to it and it soon becomes the new normal. I guarantee that dude with the BMW will soon be tired of it and looking for the next car. Guys who have a BMW 535 wish they could afford the 550. The guy with the 550 wants the M5. It’s human nature. I bet you have driven by a guy riding a bike who thought - “oh man, that’s the car I want. I’m sick of riding this crappy bike. I need a job so I can get that car.”  The key is to always live within your means and realize the rich guys have bad days/months/years too. The more wealthy you get, the fewer people you can hang out with at your level. The 1% can only vacation and go out to eat with 1% of the population. It can be very lonely.

Agreed there are all types and if you are above being defined by money then kudos to you.  Most people aren’t and its human nature to think that the grass is greener when you have more money. That’s not necessarily true - it all has to do with your attitude about it. Be kind, be humble and if you find a yourself    in a situation where money isn’t a problem, then remember you those that are less fortunate and lend a hand.

The master touch was using “there” instead of “their” in the last paragraph. I LOL’d

This reminds me of the days when I would deposit $10 into the ATM to get the last $10 out.

I’ve missed you old friend.

For me, this is the meme that really captures how it feels to hit major price milestones.

I love this - easy to forget that there is a limited number that will ever be out there.

Hey there are different ones! Love it.

I'm the idiot who kept hitting the arrow in the screenshot wondering why it wasn't going back.

Thanks I needed that laugh!

Agreed - or have editors that hold the contributors to a higher standard.  I like having more content but some some of the articles are so poorly written and obviously biased. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:56:21
Oh man I needed a laugh like this - thank you.

Personally I love these!

When Forbes started allowing contributors, I lost all respect for them. Can’t trust anything that is from a contributor.

Just watched this over the weekend again. What an epic film.

Thank you! I’ll be sure to pay it forward.

If she's a crypto gold digger, does that make her a miner? I'm so confused.

Oh wow that really looks like someone throwing away their BTC in disgust!

I’ve tried doing this. You can make some headway when the price goes through periods of predictable ups and downs in a tight range like we just had around $8k. The risk is that you set a sell at the top end of the range and miss out on a huge breakout like I just did. This is why holding works out best for most in the long term - it’s almost impossible to know when those huge breakouts are going to happen. Most if not all are due to manipulation and not tied to any news.
