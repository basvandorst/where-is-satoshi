No, actually, we are talking about apples &amp; apples. We are discussing insurance paperwork. But, whatever.

You are claiming that someone's 'method of payment' will ultimately have an impact on their insurance? 
Keep in mind, this sign is being shown at a counter where people are actually paying for services. Some people don't have insurance and some people have insurance where they are reimbursed by the insurance company, not the service provider.

Paying with Bitcoin/credit card/debit/check/cash VERSUS paying with insurance are two completely different things. You may have to pay a portion of your visit and you can choose to that with  
Bitcoin/credit card/debit/check/cash. Either way you pay, the dentist office is going to have to do the same amount of insurance work. Bitcoin is not eliminating paperwork for insurance in this instance.

The payment method wouldn't affect insurance claims.

They make it difficult to use local credit cards to buy BTC online. You have to go through bank wire, which will require a bank in another country. They won't be able to control the peer-2-peer/private sales though. Those can and will take place using local currency.

No, it's a brick and mortar.

It's more about wanting to GET Bitcoin, not really reward anyone. Don't you want more merchants to accept payment in BTC? Isn't that the whole point of this?

Both these are only for Andriod, so maybe I need to invest in a spare phone to give the staff upfront. Sorry if this is a stupid question, but when I download the app, it will basically allow me to have 'back room' access to tell the phone version where to send the BTC once I've received it from a customer? At that point, I can send it to my Exodus or something similar?

The MoonPOS says coming to IOS soon. I also can't find in the app store. Seems like exactly what I need though. I've also found [

This makes sense. I have to actually put all this together to make sure it works. Maybe do some test runs.
  
Do you think I can ask the employees to download on THEIR personal phones, instead of operating a new phone?
  
So when the customer comes up with BTC, we would just take their total, say $230US and look at the current BTC/USD and do the math?

I get it. Thanks for this help. Much appreciated.

The value of BTC and the ability/ease of using it to pay for things go together, for me.
