Dont be hyperbolic. Lots of first mover projects have failed in the past to be revamped again in some form.

Negative interest applies to money sitting in bank accounts and not outside of them, ie cash.

What about 2 phase proof of work?

Haha, yep. I guess we need to reconfigure u/decronym bot for space acronyms in r/cryptocurrency.  Maybe borrow the ones r/space uses :)

Yeah but it sounds more sensational.

Why not? You already rely on them for everything else, e.g. Apple, Google, Samsung, Toyota, etc. 


That would only happen if governments incentivise them to move overseas. 


Forgive me if this sounds incendiary or to controversial but what has NASA been doing to us all these decades since the moon race? If SpaceX is proven anything its that traditional rocket designs were always more efficient than the space shuttle model. I don't see any reason why what SpaceX is doing now couldn't have been done back in the 1970s. For one most of their manufacturing is done internally so they don't have to outsource to numerous external vendors which have all their additional administrative costs. Two they're of course recovering there hardware. NASA landed the Viking probes on Mars in the 1970s so I don't think it's out of the realm of reason to think that NASA couldn't have landed a first stage on a drone ship out in the Atlantic. I think the difference today is that they're incentivized to do more with less because of budget cuts. Pressure makes the diamonds, as they say.

Do you know anyone who uses Bitcoin?

Or BAT.

Not as likely when there's no gold standard.
