thanks for your feedback - this has been noted. generally, you'll receive an email each step of the way, but this would be very practical too.

this will be fixed ASAP, thanks!

Hello everyone - Eric from Bylls.com here
Just want to chime in and assure all users that our service is most certainly not a scam - these issues reported by a small amount of users are being investigated and appear to be problems with payments being applied to the wrong accounts. Simple misunderstandings that are being fixed ASAP
The site will be experiencing downtime in the next few days to improve some processes and bugs that will enhance the overall user experience
If anybody has any questions or concerns, I encourage you to contact me directly at eric

Hello! Really sorry about this mixup :(
There is nothing shady going on. The reality is that banks in Canada hate Bitcoin, and they are putting obstacles at every turn, including shutting down bank accounts and pressuring payment processors to shut down our accounts with them.
However, we never give up and we continue to provide the Bylls service because it's immensely important to us that people can "live off their bitcoins", and what better way than to use Bitcoin to pay their bylls?
Indeed, Bylls was recently acquired by Satoshi Portal Inc. from Eric Spano. Satoshi Portal is being run by Francis Pouliot and Mathieu Gagnon (Bitcoin Embassy directors). We are doing the transition of operations, hence why there are some minor mistakes on our side.
However, we have never failed to make a payment (or reimbursement) and we will happily re-imburse the fees if our payments are made late!
You can cc me personally on communications with Bylls at francis so that I can make sure that the customer services representative does the follow-up correctly.
Thanks for using Bylls, and really sorry you had a bad experience. This will motivate us to accelerate the transition and start offering our new and improved services soon!

Yes you're totally right. We are planning a massive, major upgrade which will include cryptographically signed and timestamped receipts that prove that we received the bitcoins and can be used as evidence.

Ugh, just push a controversial fork so that we can have two competing bitcoins, confuse everyone, ruin hundreds of bitcoin businesses and radically decrease Bitcoin's value proposition!

You should really check out shakepay.co -&gt; their fees are 1% and the source rate is bitpay.

Very impressed... 200 000 unocoin users. What market share do you have in India? Safe to assume over 1M indian bitcoin users?

We used to do it for free for the longest time, the hardest part of being a Bitcoin consultant is invoicing clients, because it's so much fun to get people into Bitcoin!

What do the green highlighting represent in the enchancements list?
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:41:34
It's pretty new, I think around summer 2016.

oops, my bad didn't read correctly! This is great, particularly the RBF checkbox

It's actually not that pricey. If you're a noob, making a paperwallet securely is very hard. Our consulting company charges $95 per hour for helping clients set-up cold storage securely.

We will be releasing guidelines for our BIP148 softfork activation policy and the acceptance of coins in case of network split.
Our users will receive these guidelines and be provided tools. We invite our users to use our electrum server electrum.satoshiportal.com as backend for their electrum and airbitz wallets.
