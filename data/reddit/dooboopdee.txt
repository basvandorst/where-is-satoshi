If jailbroken you can install the ipa file. You'll need the appsync for ios 7 package from Cydia. This will let you install unsigned apps (not for piracy of course ;)

Hope to use your exchange soon! Is litecoin worth mining and selling? (profablility?)

I like that idea, do you have any sites to earn bitcoins in mind? Is it like creative work w/ photoshop? Or just a bunch of survey's and advertisement to watch?

I'll take your advice and buy half a bitcoin tonight. I just realized my blockchain.info account had a $5 tip from reddit a while back and now its worth $17. My plan is to just buy bitcoin if I have the extra cash to invest.

It's sad that people have to resort to jailbreaking to get simple, non-dangerous apps. However I'm glad I did jailbreak as the walled garden was just a little to tall for my tasts.

Correction: Straight cash flow

Coinbase. Im under 18 so I can't be verified, but I can still buy and sell with my bank account (with a 4 day delay however).

Thanks for the tip! Just opened up a bitcoin wallet at blockchain.info, nice to not have an empty account :) You are a good person.

He isn't talking about the amount of coins that will be created (21M). He (or she) is saying that the number of 0's after the decimal place can be infinite.

Hopefully they look into bitcoin. The massive # of chinese = a massive increase in the price of bitcoin. Would be great for the future of the currency.

I've only recieved tips but have never actually tipped anybody. How do you do this? I have some bitcoin in a blockchain account but how do I transfer that to the tipping bot?

I still live with my parents as i'm 16, but it's nice to have money for gas and whatever I happen to want/need.

why not sell once the price crashes? Say it rises to $1200 or so, then begins to fall at around $50 an hour (does that sound about right?). Why not sell asap to get a nice $900+ profit before rebuying at the new low of say $300? That will leave you with $600 to either reinvest or buy whatever you feel like (PS4, weed, pc parts, ect..).

I need to find a place online that accepts money without a huge amount of verification, so Mt. Gox and Bitstamp won't do. I would use localbitcoins.com, but I don't live in a hugely populated area.

Very brave decision.. A lot of pros and cons to every decision and this one just happens to be a little larger. You could buy a new house debt free and travel around a lot, or you could wait it out. Maybe the whole world will adobt bitcoins and fiat exchanges will be a small blimp in the revolution. Everyone else will work 40hr weeks for 0.0000015 bitcoins while you live one hell of a life. You got sone serious determination and I respect that. (or laugh if this is just a fad)

Great idea! As a high shool junior I see kids all day who are almost addicted to social sites as well as texting/snapchat. I've brought up bitcoin to several people and they have absolutely no clue what it is.. Except for yesterday. I heard a senior in my chem class bring up bitcoin and try explaining it to the others at the end of class. I jumped into the convo and he used me as a great example of what kind of currency it is and how much money I've made on it. This whole occurence makes me happy as I see the cryptocurrency is spreading! (also I live in northern Mn where hunting and snowmobiling make up almost every conversation..)
