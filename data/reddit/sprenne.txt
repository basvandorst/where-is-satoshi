Thanks for the feedback. 
We don't have anything on returning funds yet, as we went with an idea that a bitcoin transaction is final. But it sounds right to address this question. There can be flexible funding like on Indiegogo, but it should be clearly stated. 
There are more scenarios to fail than just "running away" - an idea can fail, the team can be not fit for the job and more. Maybe we could be implementing some kind of credibility score on people? There was something similar  were doing. The score could include experience, endorsements, previous projects, education and other background information and publicly available data on a person. Scammers should be brought to justice, I don't think that we should limit the opportunities of all the rest because there are a few dishonest people.

We've heard all the comments and now we are doing the reshaping of the idea. Will come up with a solution shortly.

That's why we intend to create this upvoting style platform, where only projects with high engagement and positive score are on the first and second page. Project owners still have to do their job and run a campaign to gauge support for their idea and low engagement projects are just somewhere deep on the platform.

You have to do your decision making based on such factors as 1) do I like the idea; 2) do I trust people behind it, before giving anyone your money. The same as in classical crowdfunding aka Kickstarter or Indiegogo.

Your feedback &amp; comments got us thinking and we understood where did we go wrong. Day2/Update2

I like ethereum too, but as I see, ICOs are an investment with potentially high liquidity, and quite uncharted waters yet. ICO could be the next step in the development of this idea if there is any support from the audience.

Every platform does it, so we can also limit it, but I would rather want users to do their "background checks" - who is the campaign owner, what experience they have, who endorses them, how many projects funded before? And a nice metric would be - how good am I at backing solid projects?
Crowdfunding is huge and a global platform can monetize in many other ways.

if we set aside fraud and scam, which can be fought, is there a need for a decentralized crowdfunding platform that's globally inclusive and accessible?

Any successful implementation on this?

yes, I agree and still, I believe that Kickstarter doing their "verification" does more harm than good. If it would be the responsibility of backers to do a fair assessment then in a longer run, people would become better at judgment and decision making. Influencers endorsing projects in their respective industries would be a far better verification than getting through the centralized Kickstarter filter.

Some ideas are as simple as - I saw this homeless guy and decided to buy them new shoes. Who's in? And if the guy who asks is credible and has a follower base, they will raise money.

Sometimes all we need is a simple act of courage. Kudos my man and let the coins rain your way!
