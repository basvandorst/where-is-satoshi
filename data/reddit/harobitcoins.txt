It doesn't matter: how many people know how does an ATM work?

Every merchant accepting bitcoins is good news

Sweet. I'm from The Netherlands ;-) Unfortunately I wont be able to be in Rio, but how is bitcoin doing in Argentina?
@_date: 2014-02-03 15:14:43
It looks really nice. Unfortunately I can't read one word of it:)

Regulation is a very general word. Is Bitcoin not been illegal a form of regulation?

Thank you very much for sharing. I was thinking to try The Rock Trading, but now I don't think I will. Anyway, I use [Happycoins.com]( but I'm from Europe.

Take the train to Den Haag and go to the Bitcoin Boulevard...forget A'dam

Well, if your friend already has experience on cryptovaluta, than talk to your friend. I guess he will just love to help you.

If Euro deposits has been hold, than you probably need a license in every European country
@_date: 2014-06-25 12:21:51
How do you know they accept bitcoins? I can't find it anywhere...
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:21:33
Thank you for sharing. It is a “easy to read” report. I remember a presentation of one PWC lawyer at the Amstedam Bitcoin Conference 2013 that was positive about Bitcoin as well.

They will be in NYC and Singapore: interesting move.
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:54:37
I love good news...

If you are in The Netherlands you can easily purchase Bitcoin with iDeal at Happycoins.nl. Or you can look at bitcoinprijzen.nl for a complete overview of Dutch Bitcoin resellers
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:48:44
The Netherlands is doing well in Bitcoin acceptation. I guess this is the reason BitPay has chosen A'dam as Euro headquarters
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:13:29
I like this video, we should have something similar somewhere here in Europe. Maybe London?
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:55:26
Bitstamp works pretty good
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:54:27
Very good. I guess helping people installing a Bitcoin wallet is one of the best way to get  new bitcoiners.
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:47:45
I like to spend bitcoins every time I have the opportunity to do so. But I also save euro's before I use them for buying a car or going on holiday. I've never really liked the idea of begging a bank for money...
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:32:29
More concurrence on the European market is always good. Bitpay is ok, but it is a positive development for the resilience of the system to have more btc psp companies.
@_date: 2014-08-28 08:12:27
Yes, it seems the island is getting more and more bitcoin friendly. Is there any particular reason for that (political or economical)? Anyway, it's a beautifully island with a lot of tourism going on, so bitcoin is not misplaced.
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:04:42
The majority of people ask for what they understand.
@_date: 2014-06-25 12:09:28
Yes, very easy indeed.

It is easier to invest in a smart phone than build a traditional bank office. This is one of the reason digital payment systems can have a future in Africa.

All I know is HappyCoins has consistently better prices for at least the last 12 months:

Nice, the best way to introduce people to Bitcoin is bringing them in this places and show them how easy a Bitcoin transaction can be.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:44:09
Sorry, my fault. I mean “secure mobile wallet”. I follow the advise of bitcoin.org:

Loving those livestreams: I can listen to very interesting panelists from my lazy chair.

I hate Windows 8. Not just for Bitcoins....
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:19:25
What do you mean with “secure online wallet”? I never have more than 50 Euro on my mobile wallet...
@_date: 2014-07-13 10:40:39
A step in the good direction.
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:01:32
Great. Keep us informed
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:24:25
Usability of Bitcoin wallets is still a problem for the major part of people that approach Bitcoin for the first time. However, I'm quite positive that with a little help most of those people can easily start using Bitcoin. Bitcoin strength is not been able to buy beer at the pub next to your house, but to buy beer from wherever you want within just 10 minutes.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:41:54
Oh, what a surprise....
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:53:16
Great news, but I bet they will introduce a lot of AML rules for Bitcoin transactions...
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:28:45
Buy a small amount of BTC, play with it (buy, sell, whatever)  and understand it. After that you may decide how to move further
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:13:02
If you want to use iDEAL as payment method:
On this site you can find almost all the Dutch bitcoin resellers. Otherwise you can use an exchange but you will need to verify your identity.
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:49:15
Bitcoin meet ups are awesome. You can talk about anything: technical issues, political issues, funny issues...
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:45:57
Maybe they are just afraid to become money transmitters...
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:53:32
Credit cards in Spain? Is this a good idea? No charge back?
@_date: 2015-09-16 08:58:59
A lot of money going on...
@_date: 2015-09-16 09:00:35
wow no charge back problem?
@_date: 2015-11-02 14:35:40
Cash (dollar or euro) kept under the bed either. But do you really need a bank to invest your money of bitcoins in what ever you like?
@_date: 2013-10-03 10:34:24
Me too.:+(
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:54:12
No problem with Bitstamp at all. Withdrawals Euro from Bitstamp is easy and fast. Not clear how TRT is working about Euro withdrawals (via Second Life???).

Stratumseind in Eindhoven is really cool...
@_date: 2013-10-09 15:21:07
Nice to see more exchanges for Bitcoins

Here very happy with happycoins.nl. They use iDeal and SEPA. Very low fee and fast service. You can find their reviews on the international reviews site Trustpilot.com (happycoins.nl)

Bitpay just arrived in Amsterdam and than this....great job!
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:17:33
 I buy my bitcoins at happycoins.nl: easy, cheap and fast. And I use them everywhere it is possible to use them.
