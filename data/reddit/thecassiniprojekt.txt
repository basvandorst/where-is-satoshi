Haha delete coinbase

Hahahahaha, so true

Could be wrong but if you transfer bitcoin from coinbase to coinbase pro you don't pay any fee and from coinbase pro you can transfer to any wallet and it will absorb the fees on the network so you don't have to pay. I think that's the idea but may be open to correction.

Oh my, definitely a noob mistake! I read that wrong. I misread the statement, it was from my electrum wallet that the transfer fee was added! Now it makes perfect sense. Thanks.

I really like this, very true. It's almost religious...

Dude! This website is anything but a failure, it's magnificent! A month ago someone told me about another website that also involves freelancing for bitcoin but your website is like x1000000 better in design and also the number of ads posted. Well done, this is great too because I want an independent crypto economy so that people don't have to trade their bitcoins for fiat.

If you do any research you'll see bitcoin is less scammy than fiat. If you want to buy a house with fiat it takes ages for the sale to go through, imagine buying one with bitcoin? You get automatic ownership in a day instead of months because it's recorded in an immutable ledger for all time. Bitcoin imposes existential honesty, you can't not be honest on the blockchain. Given the informationalisation of pretty much everything since the dawn of the human species, from tablets to writing to the printing press to the internet, bitcoin is the abstraction of credit which will be perhaps the most essential currency of the virtual world we're entering. And it will also be like gold for the internet/virtual world we're hurtling towards but better than gold because you don't have to transport it or determine if it's real! The only caveat is if there comes along a crypto that works even better than bitcoin. But the genie is out of the bottle, crypto and the blockchain are fundamental innovations like the printing press and internet and it's very predictable that the status quo wants to repress it.

I don't know. I saw a prediction that it's in a longish term bear market based on this dude who was talking about hyperwave theory. Who knows though. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:30:42
Not really. There are more optimum times to buy than others. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:01:50
I would prefer if bitcoin dropped even more.

You are seasoned and unfathomably generous Mr Big Shot
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:35:02
Oh yeah, agreed, of course, it doesn't matter in that case.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:06:44
And you sound like a douche! Oh look a block button, adios fucker!

Nothing has intrinsic value beyond what humans assign to it. In a desert what is more valuable, gold or water? Does a dog see gold as valuable? It's complex but I am the definition of average, I agree though it can be simplified.Agreed, mining should and must be more environmentally friendly. However bitcoin miners want cheaper energy sources which should encourage increased renewables usage which will drive further investment in the sector. As to practicality I don't know why they haven't increased transaction speeds as is the case with litecoin. However, compared to business transactions it's way faster as it takes days to weeks for cheques etc to clear through the banking system which is archaic. Last point, fiat is also used for crime, in fact it's better as bitcoin records every transaction on the ledger and criminals could be more easily traced through circumstantial evidence.

Congrats, you resort to an Ad Hominem. What makes you think I care less whether you think I'm an idiot or not? I'm just disappointed you lash out like that, as I get the impression most people are primitive in this regard. I'm not trying to sound wise either, just stating opinions and some facts. I think we should invest not for the money but to undermine the financial system and create an alternative to it. It's a beautiful technology, the genie cannot be put back in the bottle.

Are you a douche? I'll answer for you: yes.
