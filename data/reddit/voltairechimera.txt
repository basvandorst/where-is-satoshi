I'm sorry but Bitcoin is going to get absolutely brutally murdered ISIS style in the next few months. 
I can't help but wonder at the coincidence that all these "WTF is Tether doing?!" articles are coming out at the same time as all these "Bitcoin will now have futures!" articles.
The parallels between this shit and the housing crash are uncanny. Watch The Big Short. Guy sees housing prices are skyrocketing. Futures to short them with don't exist, so he pushes to have them created. Buys futures to short housing. Housing crashes. Guy becomes millionaire.
We're gonna see a movie in a few years just like The Big Short, except this time with Bitcoin instead of real estate.

No. Nothing was manipulated by *futures investors* in the housing crash. They simply saw it coming, pushed to open a futures market, bought the futures to short housing, and became millionaires. The parallels between that and bitcoin right now, are incredible.
Funny how all these "WTF is Tether doing?!" articles are coming out the same time as "Bitcoin will now have futures!" articles.

POP! Goes the bubble!

This is extremely bearish. Nobody pushes to open a futures market with the intention of losing money. Watch The Big Short. They pushed to create a futures market for housing, then bet against housing and became millionaires when housing collapsed.
This is what's happening with Bitcoin now. Get the fuck out of it as fast as you can.

You're all fucking criminals participating in a pyramid scheme. The similarities between this shit and the housing short scheme of 2007 are insane. It's no coincidence that these "WTF is Tether doing" articles are blowing up around the same time as "Bitcoin will soon have futures for you to short it with!" articles.
