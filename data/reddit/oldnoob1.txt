Don't ask this here. So much trolls online. Do you're own research. When you buy and want to hold longtime, make sure you save them in a secure place.

They (Classic) had so much support from miners was in the news. Now miners did not say they pulled back. Actually we dont hear so much from them (miners), am i right?
@_date: 2016-01-28 20:41:48
So there is concensus already?

You can trust me. Presume I am Andreas Antonopoulos.

Most important. Once your wallet is funded, every transaction is OFF CHAIN

No problem, what you want

Somebody seen the light
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:48:59
No, but I can buy one
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:01:52
Exactly how I feel. It sometimes feels so lonely. Sometimes I think.. Am I mad, why don't you want/can (to) see this genius thing?

Would be nice to see a big fight going on.  Chairs flying through the air, black eyes......
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:09:21
Makes sense
@_date: 2016-02-27 17:25:26
I disagree 
@_date: 2016-02-26 21:09:04
I Would love to see this in other city's in the Netherlands. Cool to order a burger with Bitcoin and give the second one for free to a frend, so they can see how usefull Bitcoin is.

Spot on.

Cool site: "chemicals online for research purposes" 
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:16:50
Don't be ridiculous
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:40:42
Yep. And igniting a discussion. I think no matter 1 MB, 2 MB, 8 MB, etc etc. At some point, the same discussion will start again, when BTC adoption goes mental. So no hard fork needed, just add some more fee.
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:20:18
I am dumb. You're right. 
I mean, at some point, settling something on THE BLOCKCHAIN will be expensive.

Breaking news. I left a hunderd dollar bill on the street. Looked a hour later and it was gone

Mr Voorhees, if this is what you ment to say, then you did not make it clear with the tweet. I also thought you were against full nodes after reading this. I understand this is not what you ment.

Found some BTC on an old drive? Wish I was a holdler.
