[Bitcoin]( (BTC) price woes may not be over just yet, as a key technical indicator is about to turn bearish for the first time in four years.
On the three-day chart, the 50-candle simple moving average (SMA) looks set to cut the 200-candle SMA from above, confirming what is popularly known as the “death cross.” This specific bearish crossover was last seen in December 2014. 
The onset of a death cross can be a warning that a bear market is looming, according to technical theory. In reality, however, it is the result of a prolonged bear market – i.e., it’s a backward-looking indicator. As a result, the oversold market usually sees a bounce after a bearish crossover is confirmed.

It sounds soothing. I dont knew that in 2011 there was such a growth and such a fall. I agree that Bitcoin has all the same characteristics, features and functions. People succumb to panic attack.

Статья интересная, есть определенно интересные мысли, но за последнее время слишком много прогнозов, анализов и т.д., и большинство из всего этого не осуществляется...

Why? Or would you like to sell before all prices have fallen down? In principle, it was predictable in the morning that in the evening the prices would be at the lowest possible levels.

This is not very safe for the seller, I do not think that someone will respond to your request. It is very risky. I think the only condition for which people agree to sell - this is a prepayment.

I think 3000$ it is lowest price level of Bitcoin

I'm already tired of news. Every day I see hundreds of messages that Bitcoin died, and even more messages that everything is fine and everything goes to the HODL plan.

Bloody bath? Pretty well-chosen name of everything happening on the cryptocurrency market.

 It was quite expected.

Somehow the name of the topic is not very suitable in the material that you provide. How can a person's prediction be?

I would not hurry with such sharp conclusions. I believe that the project team intends to solve this, because Bitcoin Cash is in the top 5 cryptocurrencies, and this is not easy. We need to wait, time will put everything in its place.

Why you do not want to use the exchange or any trading platform to buy?

Bear market absorbs everything in its path!

Although the name of the video contains clickbate, the information in the video is quite interesting. Thank. But in the future I would advise you to make the title and cover of the video more restrained.

Wow, even such things can be bought at a discount. I thought they had a fixed price.
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:19:06
I believe that no, now there is no such thing will happen.
