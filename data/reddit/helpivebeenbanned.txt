Bitcoin is so volatile that you'd be a fool to accept it over USD right now.. you have no idea where it might be in a week, zero predictability or shown stability. 
If you want to gamble your every paycheck then sure, but for me I'd rather invest after the point of getting paid in USD.

debit cards, electronic banking ect are just a middle man between transitions. It normalizes people to spending money without actually physically handing over cash.

Soo considering we don't even know where bitcoin came from, it's highly possible it's actually a deep state op being used to wipe out physical cash.

I always hear people say this, but I mean I would still have paper money after an EMP, but if the blockchain was entirely erased you'd lose everything forever. 
Now whether or not the paper money would ever be valuable again is a different question, the fact is it still survives and can be applied to any tangible object of value; gold, silver, real estate ect

Our  problem is fiat currency. It has no basis in reality and it's value is created by faith. U.S. dollars are literally printed out of thin air, loaned out with interest which inevitably creates debt.
If we returned to a commodity based currency we wouldn't have inflation and people would be able to afford things again. Ever since we took away the gold backed standard to the USD it's value has plummeted.

The thing with it is it's entirely useless in an emergency type situation. 
Say if Puerto Rican's had invested in bitcoin, what good is that going to do them while their power is out and won't have internet access for 6 months? 
You could lose your entire savings just by somehow getting your account blocked or hacked. The biggest downfall of cryptocurrency is the huge list of possible abuses. 
It's just in my opinion physical money &gt; internet money.

The thing about fiat money is that it isn't backed by anything. US dollars, bitcoins are all made out of thin air. 
Commodity currency on the other hand is directly exchangeable for actual goods. For example 1 shekel would've been equal 11 grams of barley.
Currencies aren't bad, but when they're backed by faith alone they are always bound to fail. And don't get me wrong, I have some bitcoin myself, but I don't think it's going to change the world or anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:20:42

You want real freedom? Create a local commodity currency with your community. 
A cashless, digital currency is just bound for total control. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:12:44
You have to look at and address the reason WHY people can't afford anything, which is simple really, our monetary system is fiat meaning it's not backed by anything of actual value, therefore the Federal Reserve can print money out of thin air day and night which in turn devalues the dollar which diminishes it's purchasing power. Ever since the U.S. dollar was taken off the gold backed standard it's value has plummeted. 
If we switch to a commodity based currency we would fix very many problems. Fiat is a faith based currency and is built upon debt.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:48:48
Bitcoin in all reality is just another fiat currency. Bitcoin is like a new world digital monetary system where your entire savings can be 'deleted' in a blink of an eye. A true free currency would need to be backed by something physical of real world value, otherwise it's worth is completely unpredictable. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:11:32
I mean physically. Say if a massive solar flare hit Earth tomorrow and blew out all electronics, your entire savings would vanish. Or say somebody dropped an EMP on your country, what good would bitcoin be then? 
It has similar problems the USD has, if the economy collapses overnight, suddenly all the cash you have under your mattress becomes completely worthless.
Commodity currency is the only system that really makes sense in the long run in my opinion in terms of stability.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:06:10
Commodity currency could be backed by anything.. It's the principle that matters

To be honest it's a little nerve-racking. I'm still in the positive with my initial btc purchase but watching it twindle is hard. At the least I figured I could sell now and reap the benefits then purchase again once it's finished tanking and starts coming back up.
I think the hardest thing is having no idea why it's falling so much and so fast across the board, not only with btc but all the other alts. Why are they all crashing in unison? How far are they going to drop? ect

I'm not saying the current system is great, I just don't think bitcoin is too much better. It's an improvement but has some pretty big flaws. 
What happens if a giant solar flare hits Earth and wipes out all electronics? Or the power grid goes down and you can't access internet for at least 6 months? What if somebody hacks your account? 
Atleast with commodity currency you can bury that shit in a box in your backyard or something to physically hold onto it.

If the system fails then it means the system is broken. Putting a giant band-aid over it with UBI is not going to address the actual problem imo. 
And as far as automation goes, if a robot can replace your job then people shouldn't be working it in the first place. Automation will not be the end-all of work, robots will need to be produced, they'll need people to repair them, society will advance and more job opportunities will open up.
If anything though I think we need to start taking steps back rather than forward. Mass production is not good, it overuses natural resources and creates tons of waste. We need to revert to small communities with local businesses rather than a handful of worldwide corporations that run the world and their governments.

I don't think crypto's are all as revolutionary as they're said to be, there's too much potential for abuse if fallen into the wrong hands. What happens if tomorrow the government decides to freeze bitcoin transactions and deems it illegal, then comes out with a government backed crypto? They could take all your money in the blink of an eye or shut down your account if wanted to. 
That's why commodity based currencies are king. For example gold backed currencies can't be inflated because you can't create gold out of thin air AND you can hold the gold coins in your hand as tangible, physical objects which you can store in a safe.
