Every price point is a dip and an all-time-high (ATH)! Consider it Schrodinger price: It is both an ATH and a dip at the same time, until you buy it. If you buy it and it goes down: you've bought at an ATH, if you buy it and it goes up: you bought the dip!

Hi! You will need a wallet that is compatible with Segwit: e.g. A wallet that uses a Segwit address (electrum, Ledger Nano S, Trezor).  Send your funds to the wallet you want to use and voila! You can now send Segwit transactions!

Futures = A contract settled in cash (no bitcoin is ever bought!). It is basically betting on Bitcoins price swings: same risk, but you only have to pay 10% of the contracts worth. Most futures are settled daily so your gains (or losses) are settled each day. 
Please correct me if I’m wrong. I have only read into futures since a few days. Still learning

Greenaddress! They support Segwit addresses I've heard.
Since you;re transfering from Coinbase, you are tied to their set transaction fees. Just move them from Coinbase to your new wallet.
As for your last question: most wallet apps can scan the public address and will show you the balance it has.
Hope this answers your questions.
To keep track of the current value of Bitcoin (ans all other altcoins) use Blockfolio on iOS (or Android)

If you are looking for a wallet that supports multiple Cryptos that you are tied to a Ledger Nano S or Trezor. If you don’t mind that your funds are stored on an exchange I would recommend Bittrex as they offer a broad variety of altcoin trading pairs. And you can store your alts there. There is always a risk of storing your crypto on an exchange: not your keys = not your bitcoin!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:02:52

r/all! We did it!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:21:37
The problem with the current backlog of unconfirmed tx's is that the majority of these transactions are non-segwit. If they were, we would not have a backlog.
Edit: nice downvoting, keep at it! ��
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:46:43
I guess he made quite the omelette?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:57:36
Yup. My guess is that nothing significant will happen since all contracts are settled in cash and no actual bitcoin is ever bought. It is a zero sum game: for every short that is a long involved

@_date: 2017-12-02 09:39:05
Hahaha S2X was such a farce. Don’t forget that a lot of people lost big money in the futures markets. Remember the ones that tried to activate this Frankenstein’s monster piece of shit software: Mike Belshe, Wences Casares, Jihan Wu, Jeff Garzik, Peter Smith, and Erik Voorhees
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:44:53
Uhmm did you just describe how fiat was backed by gold a long time ago???
Now their tokens are backed by Bitcoin.. LMAO!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:42:33
Bitcoin Cash is BCash
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:12:09
Not really
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:36:27
Nog gonna happen. In 2 weeks BTC will be fully recovered. Reason why I believe this is because dips/corrections took longer to recover months ago, and trends show that recovery periods are decreasing, meaning the recovery to an ATH is much faster.
RemindMe! 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:05:31
lol wut
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:49:41
Alternatively: Buy a ledger/Trezor, or any device or app that supports Segwit and move your funds to that address
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:22:55
Exactly, just saying it is backed by commodities doesn’t mean it actually is. I would not believe a single word from that corrupt government 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:24:11
Good, because Bitcoin isn't a get rich scheme anyway.

Hahaha now that is fucking dead obvious. I thought about riding a possible second BCH spike just for quick profits but now that I think of it it’s best to ignore that shitcoin for what it is.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:59:31
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:42:38

Hahaha thanks for the laugh!
it is indeed a cancer and we need to get rid of it. 
Edit: for clarification, I gave r/btc a chance. but the sheer hate and circlejerking about BTC censorship gave me headaches. not to mention the Bcrap shills. That place needs chemo...

Seriously. Doesn’t anyone else thing it is absolutely crazy that this dip only lasted 4 days? The China FUD lasted a month.. dafuque...
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:05:10
Ask yourself: "how much am I willing to buy?"
Here is the trick:
Say you are willing to spend $500 (assuming you can afford to lose this much). Buy $100 immediately. wait for a few days, buy another 100$. Et cetera!
That way if the price jumps you don't feel that bad, because you already bought $100 of BTC from the start! If the price drops, wait some more until you think a stable price had been acquired.
Remember: only spend that which you can afford to lose!

Wtf do these guys even have any idea what is going on? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:32:34
No, It can only be viewed as an indication of what might happen. Considering all news around S2X, I think it will fail. There is a very high probability that BTC Core will remain the dominant chain.

Its because it is incoorporated in the price of the product.
"Apple users incur no additional fee to use Apple Pay, but Apple, acting as its own TSM, has other options to skim the cream from Apple Pay transactions.
Apple is reportedly collecting a credit card transactional fee from financial institutions, in addition to (a) existing “interchange fees” (although in various countries the Apple fee may be taken off the normal interchange fee), and (b) the new fees charged by credit card networks to tokenise card data for secure mobile payments.3  The banks don’t pay Apple directly – these fees are collected  by card schemes, who then pass on Apple’s share."

@_date: 2017-11-29 06:11:39
Because the hard fork failed. The hardfork did not even occur because of a flaw (multiple) in the code. No replay protection was in place. No one wanted B2X because it would replace the core devs. 
B2X supporters basically risked everyone’s BTC funds by trying to make B2X happen. Imagine what would happen if miners were to activate B2X. New blocks wouldn’t be discovered anymore potentially causing huge losses for everyone.

“Jihan Wu is the proprietor of Bitmain, a large mining operator and mining equipment seller from China that controls almost all the hashrate of Bitcoin cash. Known for his patented ASICBOOST, a hidden mining software discovered by the community that gives them an unfair advantage over other miners. Segwit, Bitcoin Core’s upgrade, nullified this, hence the hatred for Bitcoin core.”

Not really possible in some countries as they require you to set up a bank account for things such as health insurance. (Monthly payments need to originate from somewhere). Also: does your boss pay you in BTC?

I do have it's private key but I have no intention of using it for long term storage if that is what you mean :P
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:46:38
Basic procedure:
1) Set up a static IP on the device your node is running on
2) open port 8333 on your modem
If you have a router connected to a modem which also functions as a router, you will have to forward port 8333 on BOTH the router and the modem.
Took me some patience but at least the Core client is showing 16 active connections instead of the default 8!
Hope this helps you guys!

You can buy via Coinbase, but send your BTC to an adress of which you know the private key off. AKA: send it to a paper wallet/Breadwallet/Ledger Nano S or something similar

in short: You cant have BTC on an ETH wallet just as you cannot have Euros on an American bank account. Doesn't work that way.
ETH is different tech than BTC.

If you have BCC you can buy it, but if the tx takes longer than 1 hour to confirm your order will be cancelled. Since the hashpower of BCC is crap it can take a few hours for a tx to confirm.

Because I want to be able to choose for myself which coin I will be using. And I want to be in control of both the BTC and B2X coins. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love the app, but I want to be sure which coin I am sending (BTC or B2X) after the fork without losing one or the other.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:48:34
I bought BTC because of the interest rates (and storing wealth). My bank only gives me 0.1% which soon will be 0.05%.

I’d agree with EUR 6000 / USD 7000 in December (peak). 2 months ago I claimed that it would be EUR 5000 / USD 6000 in December but we already “passed” that point.

Hahah yes I wanted to show my support for Core BTC. After tonns of reading I think Core is the way to go! S2X &amp; BCH may crash into oblivion.

This is nice, But I am still very annoyed by the lack of wallets supporting this.
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:35:33

@_date: 2017-10-17 19:17:47
Wait seriously? Man how is S2X ever going to survive at this rate...
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:27:30
I sure hope you are right!
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:02:14

@_date: 2017-10-17 09:01:07
These r/btc people a so ignorant and naive..
