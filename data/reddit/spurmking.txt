Bitcoin is a slow, inefficient database/ledger. Why do you think it will be adopted as a currency when there are much more efficient cryptos?

Bitcoin is only practical for people selling drugs online, and smart vendors have already jumped ship to coins that are easier to use. Bitcoin is on its final leg. Posts like this are so devoid of reality that they are hilarious. its why i come here.

bitcoin is the least practical planetary currency currently in existence. How does it make sense to compare it to a heart?

People aren't using cryptos as currency, they are being used as speculative investments. In that way Bitcoin is just as good as any other coin. It just has more name recognition.

I'll bet everything I own and everything I make in the future that this won't happen. That would put the market cap at 12,000,000,000,000,000.

miners dont drive the price of bitcoin, buyers and sellers do. Can you explain how this makes sense?
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:36:34
Dude. I understand how math works. You said that price drops don't matter, only percentages. Why did you claim that?
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:29:41
who is going to buy bitcoin to drive up the price? whats the target demographic? The whole world learned about it in 2017 and this is the reaction. Nobody has been able to answer the question, who is bitcoin for besides those looking to hide money?

Percent changes directly correlates to value. This is the stupidest thing I've read all weekend. Congrats.

This guy believes in chemtrails and thinks big pharma is holding back cancer research.  He's also denied the existence of aids and has no education in economics.  I'm not listening to G. Edward Griffin ramble for 40 minutes.

Yes it does. Why are you talking about porn and spam? This is like saying cars don't help people because reckless driving exists.

What do you propose as a better system?  The gold standard?

I doubt he owned his apartment outright.  Probably was gambling with equity.
