China's market - whether it be stocks, futures, cryptocurrency, housing - is extremely illogical and really doesn't reflect how the economy is actually doing in terms of people' quality of living, real GDP growth, or even investor confidence - it's a giant bluff driven by a huge aspirational class that didn't get a stock market until 1992 and resembles a lot like the market in England around the late 1600s to the 1800s when the South Sea Bubble happened and they had to create the Bank of England to fight the French - they're still working on it.
My father was one of the first to really make it big in futures trading and today every single person except him is in prison because they essentially changed the rules and ex post factoed everyone in the firm. Took 20 years to clear the charges.
Don't get me wrong, my family has significant investments there in light manufacturing (vacuum cleaners), tea, and electronics, but if it's not "real" it'll feel a lot like gambling for a long time.
Also on kind of a related note the Chinese darknet market is hilarious because people don't really know what to buy with coins directly, not much to sell, the mail sucks there, etc.

It's already throttled to hell and a great deal of the beneficiaries of the well-peered links to the outside world are controlled by the Chinese government or related interests anyway. A better hypo would be - what would happen if they threw open the gates, but there's a reason why no serious investor - not anyone you'd hear about openly, but I'm talking about relatively old-money types who bought out huge mining concessions in Africa or Brazillian papermaking - is treating BTC as anything more than a very small if at all a part of their overall portfolio over there.

New fucking money, can't plan. The old money and old party-connected have been doing the pipeline for 20 years and at this point we don't even have that much liquidity in China anymore. The really wealthy don't seem to be speculating in crypto too much though, still a lot of emphasis on shadow investments in BRIC countries and foreign infrastructure. I literally have no idea what my family does to make money except my generation cousins-wise happen to be fund manager who is also a CPA, lawyer, and the executive of a subsidiary of a large American joint-venture, so I'm sure if not my parents at least my uncles or aunts are using my ID to do something but I just have no real way of finding out 12 time zones away with a career.
But at one point I got my ass dragged to Nauru for a week and that sucked, and you can imagine what kind of actual ways were being used.
