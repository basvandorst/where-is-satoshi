Sure, theft is already illegal, but if we're dealing with simple incompetence here by Gox letting people steal their stuff, that's not stopped by current law, but could be prevented by (a little bit of) regulation.
The way bitcoin works, as this develops we're likely to see some exchanges in countries with no regulation, and some in countries with regulation, and then people can use whichever one they want.  I think a lot of people would feel safer using an exchange that they felt was well regulated, even if it charges slightly higher rates.

Russia's been selling off US bonds as fast as they can since the start of the crisis to try to prop up their currency.  It hasn't had any impact at all on the US treasury bond market.  Honestly, Russia doesn't have enough bonds to make a bit of difference no matter what they do with them.

No one's talking about "requiring people to pay millions to obtain permission to buy or sell coins".   We're just talking about, say, requiring people running large exchanges to demonstrate some basic security precautions, and to let their books be inspected by a federal regulator from time to time to make sure that they can account for all the money they say they are holding.   That alone would have been enough to figure out that something was very, very wrong with Gox a long time ago.
For that matter, there's not even any need to make it a requirement; make it optional, but if you agree to follow those rules you can get some kind of "seal of approval" or something.    That's probably best, since there's really no way to stop someone from running a small exchange secretly anyway; just have some kind of voluntary way to get your exchange regulated and your books inspected so that people will have confidence in it.
