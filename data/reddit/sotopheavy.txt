Basically bitcoin miners are like bartenders with big machines in the back that actually make the liquor. You want to get your drink (transaction processed) and they want a tip (fee). The fees on bitcoin transactions are like tips to your bartender. Good tipping and they serve you more quickly, bad tipping and you might have to wait a while.
Some software might not give you full control over what fee you pay to send money, but in theory, if you wrote your own software, you would be in full control over what fee you are willing to offer up to miners, but it is their call whether they include your transaction in the block they just mined. Each block has a finite number of pending transactions that will fit and because they mined the block they get to choose all the pending transactions they can fit, ideally the ones with the highest fees will get picked first. They do this because they are the ones that get all these fees.
So if they can only include 500 transactions in the block and you are number 501, you will have to wait for the next block, and if there are 500 better transactions next time around, you will have to wait again.

"Fuck you" money is a lot of money these days. I wouldn't quit my job for less than $10 Mil after taxes, but $20 Mil would be ideal. 20 Mil would get me about $200K in risk-free interest to live on per year. That's about how much I would need to cover my boredom of not working all year long.

Everyone has a level of risk they are willing to accept. Either they are very risk-averse or they are investing in generally safe stocks, but at such a high level that it becomes a source of risk in itself.

So by keeping my bitcoin in an exchange through August 1st, I basically have to keep it there indefinitely or until the exchange decides to do the right thing, otherwise if I move it out, I might be giving up all claim to my bcc that was created during the split. Also, while the exchange makes up its sweet mind, the value of bcc plummets as everyone who does have access sells it off for bitcoin.

I have the basics down, but the main gap in my knowledge is between bitcoin in theory and bitcoin in practice. I only found out last week how a new person, who fires up their software for the first time, to mine bitcoin would even locate other peers and broadcast that they found a valid block. Also that pending transactions are broadcast to every peer and it takes a while of being online before you have a good list of all pending transactions to actually fill a block you find.

Well it wouldn't have to be part of the bitcoin protocol. It would just be a company offering to consolidate many people's transactions into a single transaction in order to spread the fees around. They would hand up their coins and anonymity to this company and the company would complete the transaction. Without them, the transaction cost would be too high to be workable.
Basically people would give up their private keys to their existing wallet, and provide a public key to a new wallet to a company who would perform all transactions as a single transaction then put each customer's change into their new wallet, minus some fee for their services.

It means I live in a country with laws (not Somolia) that require me to report investment income on a 1099 tax form each year. I choose to always follow those laws rather than getting hit with unexpected fines and fees. The IRS can look back 7 years and I'm guessing that in 7 years, their blockchain reporting tools will be vastly more capable/sophisticated.

Earning money is simply the act of making money legally. Just because less desirable ways of making money exist (selling your time, selling your strength, selling your property, selling your knowledge, selling your bodily fluids, selling your dignity), does not mean you have to take part in them if you are capable of earning money in other, more desirable legal ways such as putting your money to work for you.

Well, also, coinbase is holding my bitcoin cash hostage until next year. So if I spend it, I lose any claim I may have had to that asset.

The way I look at it is that I have multiple convenient ways to buy the goods I want. Given any number of options to achieve the same result, why choose any of them but the cheapest one? Even if it's a penny difference. Why chose the one that costs a penny more if there is no other difference? 
I can just wait out the capital gains until the rate is lower or hodl if I expect the value of BTC to continue rising.

I haven't spent any of mine because I don't want to mess with the 1099 capital gains taxes this year. I was thinking of buying a video card on newegg and realized that I would be paying 30 cents on every dollar of profit I made on my investment.

Think about sending money to someone on the other side of the world. There would be fees to send it, fees to change it to another currency, and possible fluctuations in values relative to the two currencies, there would be a delay while the banks "approve" and "settle" your transaction, there is also a chance that one of the two governments block the transaction if they don't like what you are buying/selling, etc.
With bitcoin, the fees are a fraction of traditional money sending fees and the money gets there in 10 minutes to an hour. It stays in the same currency and businesses all over the world are beginning to accept it. So you get it, you send it and the recipient can spend it without ever going through a bank.

I assume that once you find peers, transaction broadcasts begin hitting your computer and you just store the list as they come in, you then verify them and then broadcast them back to all your peers as well.

Find a friend or family member that wants something from Amazon. Offer to buy it for them in exchange for cash. Then take the cash and put it into a bank. Connect the bank account to a bitcoin exchange such as coinbase. Use the exchange to buy bitcoin. Repeat until your Amazon balance is $0.
