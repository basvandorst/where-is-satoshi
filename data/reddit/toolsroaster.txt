You must be new to crypto.. If you were half way intelligent, you would realize, as supply DECREASES, prices go up. Try Google, it’s your friend. Moron.

The block reward for miners will be cut in half come August. Theoretically, the price should increase, due to the fact the reward will cut in half.  Basically, inflation should take place. That is why you might hear a lot of people talking about Litecoin at the moment.

No, he did not. He did sell all of his coins near the ATH, claiming he did so because people were speculating he was trying to influence the price for his own benefit. He is still 100% involved and progressing forward.

I accept Litecoin as far as a payment option for my business. I go off of usability, as well as “mad gainz”. I hold, trade, and actually use crypto as a form of payment. So if the “mad gainz” come, I’ll certainly take them. I’m not really a fan of turning down money.

So, is anything that’s not Bitcoin a “shit coin” to you? I can send Litecoin about ten times faster than Bitcoin, and for much cheaper. Also, it has tripled my beginning of the year investment. 
Edit: I hold Bitcoin as well as Litecoin. So I have an unbiased opinion, and the facts are what they are.

Actually, Charlie Lee is still fully involved. Yes, he did sell all of his coins near the ATH though. At least get your facts straight.

I think it’s a stay at home mom?

This sideways action is a trading dream right now! If you even have a little experience in trading, you can be making a lot of money right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:44:30
And that’s fine. I then increase my HODL stack for the time being. Which is why I said it depends on your individual position. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:59:11
In my opinion, ETH will be $1k+ by the end of 2018. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:35:07
Not relying on past performance at all. My prediction is based on the amount of exposure and new money that is starting to flow into the crypto market. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:59:30
Could be a dead cat bounce, could be the USA waking up to cheaper Bitcoin and buying back in. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:47:44
No, it is correcting from running up so fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:10:50
If it can break ~$9,600, the short term downtrend may begin to reverse and head back to $10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:46:06
No, it locks in at that price. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:42:35
I’ve held crypto for quite some time now. So for me, whatever I purchase to hold and trade with, is merely profit I have made. 
Only risk what you can afford to lose. Treat this as a gamble, but with slightly better odds than blackjack. Crypto isn’t going anywhere, so for me personally, it’s a good investment. 
The best move I ever made was pulling out my initial investment, when the time was right; so now, if I were to lose it all, I would only be losing profits, nothing from my actual salary.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:49:56
It’ll be back up before the end of the year. This correction was long overdue. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:19:28
Seems to be trading sideways between $9,300 - $9,500 which is a very good sign. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:04:59
$12k+ (1/1/18)
$15k+ (4/1/18)
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:17:50
$9,600 is what I’ll buy back in at. I would like to see the short term down trend begin to reverse first. Just my magic number, not guaranteed. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:50:20
When the dip from $1,300 to $170 happened, we were in a completely different time then, from where we are now (as far as crypto goes)
This is not a bubble, this is merely a much expected correction. What goes up must come down. A bull run simply cannot last forever; there will always be corrections. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:20:37
Another run up to test ~$7,500 again? ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:53:16
Profit taking. This correction was inevitable. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:56:42
With high risk investments comes significant gains or significant losses. I’ve went to bed and woke up to see my portfolio down over $5k. One week later, it’s back in the green. Just remember, you don’t lose money until you sell at a loss. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:56:27
All good my friend. You will tell yourself to quit checking it so much, but you will continue to check it more and more. It’s like a drug! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:25:48
I agree. If it breaks $9,600, I see it going past $10k before the end of the day. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:32:16
True. But it really depends what you’re working with as well. I trade 50% and hodl 50%. While I buy at $9,310, I set my limit orders to $9,490. If we do happen to drop, I do not sell at a loss. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:25:30
Weird, because I originally bought Litecoin at $3; today it is over $80. I’m betting I have made more off of Litecoin alone in the past four years, than you have made in the last 10 years of your life. So yeah, I’d say you can “make it big”. 
@_date: 2019-09-14 02:55:22
Meh. My iPhone 7 still works just fine ��
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:48:22
No problem at all man. 
Yeah, you can create a “limit buy-order” if the funds are in your Coinbase Pro account. The price you create the buy order for will just have to be lower than the current market value (again, even if it is only by .01 cent). 
Then the BTC or whatever you buy will show up in that account. You can also instantly transfer your coins to your Coinbase wallet, or any address you would like from Coinbase Pro.  
At that point you would go to the “withdraw tab” of CB Pro, and select what you want to withdraw (BTC, usd, or any other coin on there) and where you want it sent. (Whether it be your bank account for usd funds, Coinbase wallet for your coins, or if you have a wallet address you want it sent to)
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:32:57
Coinbase Pro. The fees to sell on Coinbase are ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:54:02
Taking profit or breaking even is always good! Best of luck to you my friend. If you have any questions, you can message me. I’m happy to help.
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:38:32
Yes. Create a “limit sell order” and put the price you wish to sell at. (The price will have to be higher than the current market value, even if it’s only by .01 cent). 
It will add the usd to your Coinbase Pro account as soon as the order is filled (same account as your Coinbase), and as long as you already have your bank verified with Coinbase, you can withdraw the money to your bank account straight from Coinbase Pro.
