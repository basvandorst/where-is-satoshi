How do they move away if all the roads deny them service?
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:07:07


It's still a rational choice. If you don't put it in the bank you get nothing, a tiny bit is more than nothing.


Your list has little to do with keeping money in a bank... But yes, keeping your wealth secure is one thing a bank offers, along with a small interest rate that is better than nothing, all with the convenience of being able to ask for your money back at any moment.

Apparently some people don't see that there's a difference in kind between forcing someone to have sex and taxes. It's clearly the same thing since there's not a whole lot of choice either way &lt;/sarcasm&gt;.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:40:13


Err... I think you're arguing that legality is irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:53:15


How is this limit enforced?


If a corporation hires a tiny army of 20 guys to "deal with him", the vast vast vast majority of "hims" on this earth aren't going to be able to defend themselves.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:38:40
Also why would the insurance even pay? No one can force them to.
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:00:43
I can't believe your actually useful service is so far below the "taxation is theft" comments...
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:35:29
Ah of course.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:49:07


It will be resolved in favor of ~~the public~~ the **wealthy** public because that's who will be paying to ~~use it~~ **enact their will**.
You said it yourself: money talks. Poor people don't exactly have a lot of money to challenge powerful wealthy entities.


According to you this looks like a paradise. To just about everyone else this looks like Somalia.


You really don't see that you can dislike one thing about an entity and understand the need and value of other things? I've never found any person (let alone anything else) where I didn't dislike something about them (usually some opinion), but I don't let that take away from me enjoying the things they do or their presence.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:31:01
That's not really his point. His point is that without regulation, fractional reserve banking happens. Your point is that with regulation, FRB is well defined...
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:34:37
Depends on how you resist. "Gun at your head" doesn't come about until you're violent.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:43:59


Wait what? The slave-labor roads will clearly be nicer and better maintained because the cost of maintaining those is clearly lower than if you didn't have a slave-labor force. I also don't think people would bother with actual slaves when they could just have wage-slaves that they pay with corporate-store-money that can only be redeemed at corporate-store.
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:35:14




...the answer is not death nor a gun at your head. I wasn't denying there'd be violence if you ran, I was denying they'd try shooting you for running.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:26:07
So what happens when one corporation builds a large grid of roads and refuses to let any other road cross their roads?
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:26:56


Why not? What stops them? There's no government.


And if there is no different one?
@_date: 2013-06-15 03:13:11
Err, no, banks are by definition places that hold money. You put 100k in the bank because banks have big safes that your home doesn't have.
@_date: 2013-09-25 21:24:25
You realize fiat and fractional reserve banking are separate issues, right? If bitcoin really does take off we'll have fractional reserve banks for bitcoins just as we do for fiat (and just as we did for gold).
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:39:06
You should probably sell now. Please, just trust me. And maybe send a tip my way when things work out for you. The saying is "Fortunes are made by buying low and selling too early". Buying back in higher is usually a great way to lose everything.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:03:51
Hah. Right.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:23:33
How do I make my own HFT? I've got "hard computer science" background and do an awful lot of math. I'm watching this all go down and know that the volatility could be really valuable if only I knew how to write or find the algorithms...
@_date: 2013-06-15 02:30:29
* You can have inflation without FRB
* Look at computers: it's always better to wait until "tomorrow" to buy a computer, yet people still buy computers.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:13:21
Ah the "this isn't a *true* bubble".
You know, you're arguing that the utility of bitcoin provides it a real-world value that separates it from dotcom... Except that most of the dotcom "bubble" companies survived until 2004.
Psychology (very) often overrides actual value.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:18:38
A post (possibly yours) saying "no one ever lost money taking a profit" and another saying "fortunes get made by buying low and selling too early" were responsible for me getting out near the peak. You may have been flamed by active loud people, but for me it sparked me to do what I knew I should have been doing anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:49:04
That works both ways and for the person with high latency it applies to *everyone* whereas for the person with low latency it only applies to that one character. Also see my comment to Uniqueduck.

The speed of developing in haskell is more valuable than the speed of the program in, say, C?

A lot of places offer google authenticator. bitstamp, bitcoin-24, bitfloor. Coinbase offers 2-phase authentication (i.e., text message).
@_date: 2013-06-15 02:18:36
I mean, we could all just keep our money in physical dollars...
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:38:08
It is a losing strategy. That's one I learned the easy way :D (in a game).
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:37:40
Transfers into and out of banks seems tricky and time expensive. Also potentially monetarily expensive depending on your margins.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:24:06
What kind of crash? There's two different ones going on here: crashing the general "value" of the market, and crashing the exchange itself (the means of trading).
@_date: 2013-06-30 16:43:32
Roman is certainly taking his time at this point...
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:47:45
That's not true. I know because I've been the person with high ping being killed after I took cover, or before I rounded corners, or before my client even registers that there's a person there (let alone that they're firing).
I also know that in every multiplayer game I've ever played, there is a distinct disparity in how well I do based on latency, and I always do better with lower latency.
Edit: clarity and conciseness
@_date: 2013-06-15 02:19:56


When bitcoin gets big, we'll have fractional reserve banking with it too...
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:28:45
He got fired, right? Pretty sure that guy got fired.

These can be done with debit cards.

I live in the US, so I did the smart thing and went to the two US exchanges.

And if hits are registered client side and you have high latency, you choose to go behind cover but because your position and velocity updates take a while to register, your enemy sees you just standing there like a dumbass. Or rather, the entire enemy team sees you just standing there.
Like I said, it goes both ways. I've got a degree in CS and I've written network code, it goes both ways and it's unfortunate but there's no perfect solution, but it sucks more for the guy with high latency. It's why I spend an awful lot of money per month for cable (fiber if they had it): I don't care about downloading and streaming *that* fast, I do however care a lot about latency for server side or client side detection games.

I'm not sure I understand. What stops them from reopening?
@_date: 2013-06-15 03:38:17
Can you explain why to me? At what point is it worthwhile for someone to purchase an ASIC? Why does anyone purchase an ASIC if it's better to just buy the coins straight?
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:07:39
But you need money in the exchange to buy the coins...
@_date: 2013-02-24 16:56:59
Wouldn't he set the buy wall below the sell wall?
@_date: 2013-06-15 02:21:50
It would seem he has a problem with the dominance of fractional reserve banking.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:21:40


Why is have next to no liquidity something they have going for them?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:25:39
Ah, ok, that makes more sense.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:28:39
That's honestly not necessarily true.

I feel like if I were the NSA I'd inject for mozilla and modify that plugin somehow...

The NASDAQ is still significantly down compared to that 2000 peak. 40% according to another comment here, I don't know if it's quite that bad, but it's still down quite a bit.
@_date: 2013-06-30 16:41:56
Doesn't look good these days...
@_date: 2013-06-30 16:53:59
What happened in that case?
@_date: 2013-06-30 16:48:45
I doubt he planned it, for the same reasons you list, however after it happened cutting and running is more profitable than returning everyone their money...
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:24:21
This is a myth.
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:01:30
Fractional reserve banking is possible with gold. It's possible with dollar bills. It's possible without regulation.
You put 10 units of value in my bank. Now I have 10, so I loan 9 of these units of value out to other people. Bam, I have a fractional reserve bank where the reserve is 10%. It doesn't matter what those units of value are, whether bitcoin, gold, dollars, fluffy pinkerwheels, whatever.
@_date: 2013-06-30 16:42:52
I wish you had been correct.
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:31:09


Learned this the hard way :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:57:49
That's fine, then you just wait for buys to come...
@_date: 2013-06-15 02:17:06


Cash transactions are push, not pull. Yet people manage to have their money stolen or mugged out of them. Just because it's digital doesn't make that meaningfully different. Banks weren't built for ACH transfers initially, they were built for physical tender.

Not just something unfamiliar, but something that is difficult to become familiar with.
