I still think 12/2013 was way worse then this.

Whoops, I meant January 2014. I was going through the get-rich-quick phase and trading at 4:1 margins and burning through my savings. After I made a bad short I was done with bitcoin trading.  
I’m still done with day trading, I’m just waiting for when to get back in.

I’m got in at January 2014 for like $500, got out at $15,0000. I’m waiting for the hype to die down and for things to get boring before I get back in. Then I’ll just forget about my wallet for another 5 years.
Edit: January 2014, not 2013. That was not a fun month.

Seriously ppl need to be looking at 6H or 1D

Just be aware that lots of crypto investors are also trading traditional stocks, and US markets are seeing some record setting losses, driven by fear that the fed may raise interest rates. When that happens, people tend to get out of risky investments and into more conservative securities like bonds.

Shoutout to the bros/sisters that bought at 11.7 and didn’t sell cause they believe in the product/coin.  
TLDR did not sleep much these last 24 hours 
Edit 1: I sold my ETH at a $9 loss and used it to short BTC for a $9.50 profit. Only good trade I made all week.

I don’t understand why you were downvoted, that was a smart move

If you’re freaking out because you bought high, wait 4 years. If bought high in December 2013 you were freaking out January 2014. But if you held, you’d still be profitable right now.  
Patience is key here folks.

The dead cat has bounced a lot today. Break into 6, jump back to 7, stay at 6.5 for a while, fall into 5, jump back into 6...  
Wonder what’s gonna happen next /s

Ppl freaking out about this drop from 11 something to 9, it’ll be ok.
Patience. And balls. Lots of balls. And maybe whiskey.
