Really? Damn, I hope a lawyer can help me.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:35:53
Thank you lol, I have enough shit going on in my life. I wouldn't add a fake Reddit post to it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:25:24

@_date: 2017-12-10 16:26:00
Yeah, he was a great brother. I didn't even know he had this much money, he was very modest.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:36:26
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:28:04
It belonged to my brother who gave it me and has passed away.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:30:10
How am I lying? Why would someone even lie about something like this?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:22:06
Thank you.

Should I get a tax attorney or something I'm afraid I'll make a mistake and get fined or go to court.
