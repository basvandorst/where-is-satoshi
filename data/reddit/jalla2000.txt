Bah. Yeah I guess I made a throwaway post years ago. Thanks! Some info in there might come in handy. Not that I think I'll recover the coins...

I agree with you. I really really hope the Fed raises rates in December (edit: but I too doubt that they will), because I believe it will release a clusterfuck of problems. Either way, gold and silver may go stratospheric. Not so sure about how bitcoin will do. Probably well.

Yep. Here in Norway too, the interest rates are too low to keep the money from losing value. The savings accounts pay ok interest, but still, the capital gains tax eats enough of the "gains" to shrink the final purchasing power.
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:26:26
Unless you had a virus, the coins just disappearing is unlikely. Don't panic. You should take a carbon copy of you drive before doing anything. If you don't have the skills, you need to find some that has, that you can trust. If you had 43 BTC on a windows pc, with no backup, I'm a bit surprised. If they are not stolen, I'd assume they're recoverable.

Keynesian principles are defined for a world of fiat and "flexible" currencies (amirite?), and seem somewhat valid to me. I don't like Paul Krugman's arrogant ass but I agree with him when he keeps stressing that deficit spending will boost aggregate demand and that this has been proven to actually work. In my opinion it's still immoral, and it seems to me that the only reason he's right is because inflation is a non-obvious scam. The manipulation of the fiat currencies are creating bubbles and distorted markets.

A lot of people will disagree with you that gold isn't money, and I'm one of them. Ron Paul tried to stress this to Ben Bernanke:  Also, Mike Maloney clearly defines money in his youtube series. See also Mike Maloney interviews Ron Paul: 
I know this might sound gold-circlejerk-ish, but I just wanted to highlight that there are many people that think gold is money, and that currency is NOT money. As Ron Paul often says, "Gold has been money for thousands of years. When did it stop being money?"

The problem is that printing more money steals from the savers and favors the lenders. It's immoral and it's straight up fraud, and makes it damn hard to save for retirement. The fresh money is not fairly distributed and tend to inflate the housing market. My understanding is that when interests go back up, the housing market(bubble) contracts, and the money is "released" and inflation runs wild.

Ok, so currently, the blocks are max 1 MB. That means the blockchain grows by 144MB per day, right? With XT, the blockchain will grow 1152MB per day, if the blocks are full. It sounds like a lot, but then I realize it's not 1998 anymore, and even though 1152 was two full length movies back then, it will take at least two years to fill up my $100 harddrive. Not saying XT is the way to go here. Just thinking out loud about the future size of the blockchain.

Originally, banks' responsibility was to provide a safe storage for gold. I don't want to invest in home security because I don't want to be running my own fortress (bank). The odds of being robbed increases a lot when you promote bitcoin. It's not hard to find someone holding a lot of coins. Get a knife and their address, and you could be rich. A security deposit box might be an OK idea.

So if I understand it correctly, the instant transfers are achieved by not really transferring bitcoins via the blockchain, but by updating the balances of the input.io users. Right?  
So the downside is that if I want to do instant transfers to someone, they also need to have an input.io account. Right?  
Fair enough. That's the way it has to be, I guess.

I don't see how splitting the key would help much. The coins would still be available for the user to give to the robbers...
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:44:26
what is BFL? So it's just missing software?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:24:00
There are reasons why I think you are wrong, that I don't want to share just yet. I'll let coinbase conclude about what's going on. OP will deliver.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:58:07
I have checked. I want to be good guy greg and wait for a response from coinbase before I reveal anything about the sender.
@_date: 2013-05-11 21:34:04
Sorry about that. Didn't really expect to find any buyers here on reddit, but then someone started asking. TIL about @_date: 2013-02-02 22:03:35
what will happen if the date is after the first transaction for that key? will I be unable to use the key, or will the balace just be wrong?

A bit risky to rely on the security of someone's e-mail. I can imagine someone sending a bunch of coins to a compromised e-mail account. Nice site anyway. I'm a fan.

Does he ever adjust the price of the coins? Bitcoins are so expensive these days, and I don't want to pay 1.5 BTC per coin.

that's why I've been feeding Netflix for years

If a local news paper wants to do an article about bitcoins, they might want a spokesperson or someone to interview. I'm not sure I'd like to be that person, or even promote bitcoins at all, since it makes it obvious that I'm holdin'. Also, it's not that hard to find the name of a person that holds a lot of coins. I'm sure St. Gavin has a pile, and also a lot of the other promoters around on the interwebs. And: never underestimate criminals.
@_date: 2013-08-22 07:45:05
How about if the buyer states the receiving address and amount in his buying request? Then the escrow can easily verify if the bitcoins are transferred or not. Yes?
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:14:23
they don't deserve you
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:45:11
Totally agree. I've been drooling on the Trezor for a long time, but 1BTC is a bit much.
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:32:35
but I'd like to promote bitcoin. the problem is that it strongly implies that i have a bunch.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:35:50
this. it's like a one-way exchange now. dollars in, bitcoins out. never the other way. it's been almost 3 months since i requested a withdrawal, and i'm still waiting!!
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:18:04
If it turns out I've discovered such a fatal bug, I really don't think they give a damn about a few ringos.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:48:19
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:05:00
... nice
@_date: 2013-07-10 20:27:09
This is what I completely missed. I'm so used to thinking dollars are dollars.
@_date: 2013-10-17 22:14:29
I already have an account at bitstamp, but the price difference at the time was too juicy. and I didn't really need the money right away...
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:58:35
I tried withdrawing USD to Norway. I have now been waiting for almost 3 months....
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:51:47
Yes. Kindof. I guess I'd like to have a bitcoin bank. Maybe. In my country.
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:52:19
why is version 1 more valuable?
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:31:17
i think you've got the essence right there
@_date: 2013-05-11 20:49:53
In norway, a 125cc is classified as a "lightweight motorcycle", but by the look and feel, yes, it's pretty much a scooter.

When I click "code" on the sourceforge page, I'm presented with a SVN url. Why? bitcoin-qt is using github, right? Wth?
