I pulled out my initial investment and am enjoying the ride with a very healthy gain.  If it goes to zero, its just a small portion of my investment portfolio and I will still have a 20%+ gain over the last year.

Well, I had to borrow money to buy a house, banks did that for me and my interest rate paired with my tax savings not only made that possible, but I am beating inflation by taking my time paying it off.  
If I have an accident of sorts and have no funds, banks will let me use my credit card to pay it off, and because I have a good credit history and am willing to look for the best card, I can use a credit card to get me through my emergency and pay little to no interest.
My paycheck shows up in my account every thursday, instantly beginning to earn me interest (not much, but every dollar counts) and from my phone I can pay all my bills, with zero fees, and it is credited right away.  
I can send money to my friends bank accounts instantly with services like Zelle, which is also free.  I havent paid any bank fees in over a decade.
I can walk into a car dealership with just my ID and drive off in a couple hours with a new car, no down payment, and good interest rate.

You have to pay taxes on any gains in any form in most countries, just because you're comfortable breaking the law doesn't mean that the law does not exist and you cannot be eventually penalized.

Personally don't care much, have a few grand in it, but its all from profits, sold off my initial investment plus plenty when it went crazy high last year cause it jumped so fast so high i figured it was too good to be true.
Although I almost bought some more when it was hanging around 6-7k, but I feel like I was just gonna give myself a gambling problem if I started doing that shit.

Because its a dumb way to look at things. It's not really true.  It's more true to say that you don't have gains until you sell them, because you could actually sell them at that moment and cash in your potential gains.
But if its down, you don't have the option to recover your loss, you just have to wait, and watch all the other stocks go back up while your investment circles the toilet.
When you are down you have lost your money and all you can do is hope it comes back.  When you are up, the ball is in your court.

Lmao.  I got lucky and made some decent money last year. I got lucky and bought and sold at a right time.

And, more importantly, I make my decisions and live with them.  I'm certainly not envious of other people's success, I cheer it.  But I certainly an free to speak my mind and offer my advice.  And you are free to mock it and move on with your life. I don't know you, but I would feel bad for you if you like lost more than you could recover from.
Just offering my 2 cents.  I did well, still got some even, but yeah, I will open up and call anyone stupid if they are borrowing money to buy Bitcoin.  Because it's fucking stupid.

Good Lord this is ignorant. Someone is supposed to just give me a house or money to buy it for free?  My mortgage is 1/3 of what my house would rent for if I had to rent.  I could put a new roof on my house every year and still come out on top.  You speak like somebody who has never owned anything but just repeats the dumb shit you hear on the internet.
And I'm union, I work hard and have excellent health insurance.  I love my job.  My boss treats me great.  Hell he just bought me tickets to the Stanley cup finals, because I joked about it and he surprised me.  He even paid  for a hotel near the stadium for me and my girlfriend so we could enjoy ourselves.
  I work in hospitals and schools, I certify labs that make chemotherapy medicines and planned Parenthood centers.  I've worked in low income areas and built clinics that help poor people have access to healthcare.
You have a small, terrible view of life, well buddy I love my life and I spend my money wisely and invest wisely and will retire early.  You make so many assumptions maybe based on how shitty things around you are, and I guess I feel bad for you if things where you are have become so terrible, but proper use of banks and investments have helped me get into a comfortable position.  So keep bitching and praying to whatever you believe in that things change for you, I was just giving you some examples of why banks are still necessary and helpful.

I cashed out mostly, made some decent money, even tried trading for a while, but felt i was begging for a gambling problem.  I've got like $4k of crypto, all from profits, but I just can't talk myself into spending any more money on the whole thing.  I got no confidence that no matter what happens its just gonna tank overnight for years or forever.
I just havent seen any solid reasoning on why I should have my money in crypto over a company like Amazon or an index fund.  Crypto is more of a slot machine, and it hasnt been paying lately.
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:51:39

@_date: 2018-06-22 21:31:26
If you sent it in bitcoin today it would have dropped in value by even more than your fees.  Plus, unless you already had the bitcoin, you would have had to buy it with a credit card, which costs with fees, and then the person receiving it would have most likely had to convert the bitcoin to real money which can take significant time.

I've ran departments with over a hundred workers and I spent a few years teaching adults.

The "current system" involves customer service representative who will guide you every step of the way, and if you forget your passwords, you haven't lost your life savings, just prove its you and they will get you squared away.
Bitcoin has benefits, sure, lots, but don't pretend it's easy for most people and more beneficial at this time then what they already have.  
It's easy if you're 20, start talking to people that are 30, 40, 50 or more and the interest and the desire to learn it are going to drop quickly.

Generally speaking, the more you feel the need to insult the person you are arguing with, the weaker your argument is.  Bitcoin is way too complicated for "the average" person, especially since you cannot demonstrate a need for them to use it.  
For the majority of people in countries that are not under collapse or not under a fear of imminent collapse, bitcoin serves no purpose other than to the get rich quick crowd or the darkweb crowd.
Im not saying its useless or will def collapse, but its way more complicated than the system that most people have had their whole lives which works just fine.

Yes I am mocking the people that believe that bitcoin is a good long term investment and that it is gonna take over cash. I still do.  But I also know that it's gonna be a roller coaster and still go up and down, I'm only playing with profits, and yes I traded while saying those things before.  
What's pathetic is you looking through two years of my comments because you don't believe a couple comments I made.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:43:20
I'm not recommending day trading or anything of the sort, but bitcoin jumps up and down soooooo much, that a little risk and a little patience will likely beat the HODL mentality.
Watching it jump from 8 to 14 in a week, doesnt take a genius to see that its probably gonna have a major correction.
Either way, I cashed out my initial investment and then some long ago, so Im playing with house money, not really stresssing it.  I'm not expecting bitcoing to make me a millionaire, but I work with my hands and tools and I want to retire before I wear out.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:47:01
Thats what I did in 2017 at 17k.  Paid off debt, maxed out my IRA for that year, 2018 and then some.  Bought more after the crash.  Was VERY patient, sold today.  Im happy even if it keeps going up for a little while longer.
I got a strong feeling it will hit 15 and then start collapsing again.  And then it will go up, then down....

During all the hype in 2017 I tried to daytrade and was lucky to not lose my ass.   That was stressing me out and I was into it with more money than I should have been. I def put myself at risk bouncing around with it all back then.  Now, all the money I am playing with is leftover profit, so its not like I can "lose" per say, but I am by no means a trader.  I gamble in vegas for fun, but I'm not doing the day to day trades trying to make 5% at a time, no need to be greedy.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:32:25
No, I'm saying I'm NOT doing that.  I tried that back when all that hype was going on, didn't have the stones, caused too much anxiety.  When I was trying to day trade, I was aiming for 5% swings, but day trading was not for me at all.
My trades besides that brief time were months apart at a time.  But yes, in all I made a handsome profit.

If you are having a hard time  understanding this, investing is not your strong suit.
Here, I'll try to explain using smaller numbers.  Lets say I bought 2 BTC for $5 each, held them for a year, then sold them for $1000 each.  Now I have $2000 and no bitcoins, off of a $10 investment.
I keep my 2000, wait 6 months, now I bitcoin has dropped to $100  each, so I buy 20.  Sure, I paid more per coin then the last time I bought them, but now I have 20 instead of 2 and it didnt cost me any money really, because Im just using the same money I got when I sold last time.  Now, it goes up to $200 each, and I sell again.  Now I've got 4000, even though I sold it for less than the last time I sold, I am still profiting, because I averaged down when I bought the dip.
Make sense now?

I think its a sign of emotional weakness to get all bent out of shape about a word that some puritans decided was worse than another word.
And that whole "lack of intelligence" is so ignorant. Thinking you're better than someone else because you have chosen to remove some words from your vocabulary?  Give me a break.

What the fuck are you talking about 5 months and 11 months? Stop making shit up.  Anyway dude I don't care if you believe me or not, it doesn't change either of our lives.  I threw my experience out there, I'm not claiming to be a genius, I admitted that I am not cut out for short term trading at all, but that simply being patient has done well for me.  Why do you feel the overwhelming need to try to pull some "gotcha" to discredit me? What would be the point of any of that?
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:22:30
Already did.  I kept .25 just to justify the money I spent a while back on a ledger wallet.  I'm kinda holding that small amount just in case I'm wrong and somehow bitcoin does someday become worth hundreds of thousands maybe I can add it to my retirement savings.
I'm not some guru, I don't know analytics and all this other stuff, but I know some smart, rich people and one of the basics that has stuck with me in most kinds of investing is "buy when everyone else is selling and sell when everyone is buying." It's done me well.
Runs like this don't last.  The reason that pushed me to sell back when it went on that crazy run on 2017 was when when my grandfather asked me about it.  It was clearly overhyped. He could barely send a email and he kept hearing about it.  I felt like I could be making the most regrettable decision of my life, but the run seemed too good to be true.
There just doesn't seem to be any reason for this run, I don't trust it, but if I'm wrong, I'm not greedy, I've done ok, helped pad my retirement account some, and I'll move on.  If it drops 50%ish, I'll probably buy some more and just wait.
Just be careful in this sub, there's a lot of people who think they are really really smart because they've done two hours of research and they are betting their life savings on this, and don't want to reason at all.
My only suggestion is don't be greedy, take some profits while they are there and be patient.  Don't use money you need anytime soon cause it could go really well or really poorly.  Anyone telling you different is trying to sell you.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:36:28
And I still say that.  I will never put new money in it.  I'm only using a small portion of the profits and being patient and notbpanic buying or selling.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:14:36

A stop loss can fuck you so hard you won't know what hit you.  Volatile market, btc drops 40%, your stop loss kicks in and sells it all and saves you. 4 hours or 4 days go by and it is right back up where it was.  You just took a 40% loss, the hodler is fine, and probably bought some more (from you) on discount.

It's called dollar cost averaging. If you just keep investing as it goes up and down, sure you are buying some more expensive than you could have a month ago, but overall it's going up and the ones you bought when it was low will pay off the most.
If I bought a Bitcoin when it was 100, then another when it was 1000, then another when it was 2000, I would have invested 3100, but would be worth about 14000.

I think its gonna be a lot closer to 0 than 18k for a long long while.  Probably never hit "0" but all the crazy hype we got last year brought out everyone that is into investing in speculative investments, and now it is going back down to just the main core of true believers, and everyone else is going to keep selling off at a loss, driving the price down.
I think its got a lot further down to go before it settles.

That's clearly not what he meant.  Somone might have a 100k portfolio, they could easily sell a few shares of Amazon and buy a btc,  and that few grand isn't gonna effect them, but if three years from now Amazon has tripled and btc is worth $200, they are gonna still experience regret and wish they had invested differently.

@_date: 2018-04-11 19:36:18
well, half that technology doesn't exist anymore, or at least most people dont use it. 
Theres like 4 different analog cassette recorder/players there.  We don't use that shit anymore because we replaced it with something totally different, totally better.  It was cool for a decade, then we replaced it with cds/dvds/ then we replaced it with hard drives full of music, now we are replacing THAT with "the cloud" and on and on and on.
I mean, if ANYTHING, this picture is a warning not to blow your money on tech as soon as it comes out, cause its gonna be replaced by something better and cheaper soon.
I have NO idea how this relates to or proves bitcoin is the one that will survive, if altcoins survive at all.

"Why didnt you buy apple when it was cheap?"  FFS this is some real dumbassery but it gets upvoted by a bunch of people who think they got the entire history of world economy figured out because they saw a few youtube videos on bitcoin and blockchain tech.
Dear stupid people, just like your dad could have picked all the wrong stocks and watched them go to zero, you can pick the wrong coin.  Just because bitcoin is your favorite (and im sure you can argue for hours about why its the best) you don't have a crystal ball to see which, if any coin makes it and makes people wealthy.
Good luck, but stop acting so damn smug, no one has a crystal ball.
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:49:09
Its not gonna go to zero. Your country could ban it, making it impossible to legally transfer the money to a bank and use it, but you could probably find a way if it was enough to be worth it to you.
But it is used internationally, so even if a major country like the US or China banned it, it would still have a big circulation.
