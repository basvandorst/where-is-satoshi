They are working on an HD wallet. its in beta
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:19:19
Here is a working code sample using 
    var bitcore = require('bitcore');
    var HdPublicKey = new bitcore.HDPublicKey.fromBuffer("enter xpub key here");
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
    	var derivedPublicKey = HdPublicKey.derive("m/0/"+i).publicKey;
    	var address = derivedPublicKey.toAddress();
    	console.log(address);
    }

Think of a keychain, it's a better metaphor than a wallet.
If you 'import' a key, then you add a key to your keychain, now you can open that safe. If anyone else still has a copy of the key they could still access the safe too.
If you 'sweep' the key, then you're using the key to open the safe, and moving the items from that safe to a new safe protected by a new key.

**It works anywhere bitcoin is accepted.** We hope to become the  credit card for the internet economy. No more 'pull transactions' and no more entering credit card numbers online. Oh, and we're out to eat the lunch of [the retards at mastercard]( :)

Great list. All of these are debit (not credit) cards, right?
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:29:05
NO!! Stay away from that scammer!

[You can watch a preview video here.]( We submitted this to the coinbase hackathon. (I recorded the demo video after about 40 non-stop sleepless hours of working on the app, so excuse my rambling, lol )

:) I think most of the 'other cards' are debit cards (and tied to the legacy payment network rails.)

Hey Guys,
I'm very excited to announce the world's first 'bitcoin credit card' :) We have built a wallet app that functions as a credit card. We extend revolving lines of credit to users. We're working on figuring out all the legal red-tape so we can give this wonderful community the download link... our app is built and ready to release once we figure that out :)

Bitcoin is global and we intend to bring Credit Wallet to the world, especially the underbanked. Risk metrics and credit scoring options will vary from country to country and we anticipate challenges. Burdensome financial regulation is our biggest challenge in the US at the moment.

That is a risk for any lender. We would assess that risk based on your credit score and other factors. We also will report to credit bureaus so defaulting would impact your credit score in the future.

Our iOS app is built and working. Our Android app is being developed and should be ready soon :) I am an Android user so I can't wait to get our Android app finished!

Send them a rushwallet URL. No app to install, they can just open the link and spend the bitcoin immediately.

The great thing is, you don't need to trust us much because you never deposit your bitcoins with us. We are extending credit and taking the risk.
But to answer your question, trust is something we intend to earn over time, and with the right management team.

TouchID will not be the only security feature. But it seems to be working ok for ApplePay security.
@_date: 2015-07-31 21:19:09
Those three steps (create rushwallet, transfer funds, send URL) take a total of about 15 seconds on my smartphone. But yes, it should be made easier. Rushwallet should allow you to Send to a phone number and SMS the link for you.

Unless you used an escrow agent :) I think BitRated has huge potential to revolutionize consumer protection.

To reset the ledger wallet device enter an incorrect pin 3 times.
