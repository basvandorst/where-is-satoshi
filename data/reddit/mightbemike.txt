Libcoin port is the main thing, moving to a nice streamlined codebase. But also making FreeSpeechMe a standalone solution, instead of simply a Firerfox plugin, so people will have a nice easy way to resolve .bit names.

Agree. No need to trust *any* other nameservers if you run a DNSChain server for your family and friends. It's not that difficult if you follow a [step by step recipe]( and you can resolve .bit and soon .p2p and .eth.
  
If you don't want to go to any trouble just point your machine at OpenNIC DNS servers. That's preserving the status quo (extending trust to 3rd party nameservers) but adding the capability to resolve .bit.

FUD - .bit has tens of thousands of names reserved. 
.COM has tens of millions.

Not quite solved. An amazingly bad couple of processes exist to offer IP holders a chance for remedy. Usually a UDRP is chosen, because a tiny group of people can make a quick decision (there is not the usual judicial notion of precedence) but the outcome is not very predictable. To this day, most IP holders complain that their rightful names are squatted.
Namecoin lets market forces enforce fairness. Not sure you realize how few .BIT domains are registered, or what's likely to happen if Namecoin is successful. If it's even 1/10th as successful as .COM, NMC will have value, and the prices for renewals will be prohibitively expensive, effectively making hoarding unsustainable.

Hope this question isn't too naive, I listened to Peter Todd mention coinjoin, and I had this question about it. It sounds like this method of jointly spending coins in a single transaction shouldn't be too hard to attack.
Suppose a nation-state or botnet operator with considerable resources decides at a certain point in time to put more users into play than are currently using the system. In many cases a transaction involving n number of participants might really have n-1 users in collusion, and only a single "real" user. No ambiguity exists when there is only one other user involved in a transaction. The attacker alone should know exactly who spent to what address whenever this n-1 out of n scenario occurs.
What am I missing?

Interesting idea! Any idea what would be needed? Is it enough just to store the mapping between friendly names and CJDNS/IPv6 addresses? That would be easy.

So you're running a bot or botnet trying to brute force people's bitcoin addresses. You steal people's money and then make this one lame offer to return it IF they happen to be a Reddit reader? Don't act like you're doing anyone a favor, you're really just a thief trying to rationalize your predatory behavior.

Stolen bitcoin is often unused. If Karpeles stole a few hundred thousand from MtGox he may decide that there are too many people watching some of those 50,000 coin addresses. Or did you intend the focus to be on grammar?
And how does it make any sense to calculate based on current market cap? Seems pretty reasonable to think about millions of  bitcoins used by billions of people. And yeah people are careless and do lose their private keys all the time. Maybe you never lost any bitcoin but I sure have. That will continue to happen I'm sure.

Despite strong growth in the number of relay nodes, there are still just over 1000 exit nodes as per  - virtually no growth here. HUGE bottleneck considering number of users are approaching 2.5 million per day. Not just due to legal problems either, the prospect of doing MITM attacks makes exit nodes particularly attractive targets.

How about some TNABC Miami limmericks? Seems like a kooky way to try to win, but it's what I'm feeling...
   
I'd love a free ticket it's true,   
to hear interesting speakers like Xu.   
I think I should get one,   
it would be so much fun,   
I might learn new a thing or two!   
    
Or maybe the more sympathetic approach, since BTC dipped below $200:
   
Bitcoin Miami draws near,   
and one thing is certainly clear.   
My holdings went down,   
but I don't wear a frown   
'cause I might win a free ticket here!   
   
And if all else fails, name-dropping seems like a good strategy:   
   
Come down to Miami, hear pros,   
the Garziks, Vitaliks, Paul Snows.   
We'll hear Tucker and Ver   
and big Vern will be there   
and great party peeps like DeRose.

yes please help, my ears are popping!

Spotted every tree but missed the forrest. Love the long-winded analogies, but the conclusion drawn is as far from valid as Cold Fusion and Flash are from being helpful web technologies.
