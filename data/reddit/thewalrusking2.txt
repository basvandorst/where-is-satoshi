Skinny protocols vs fat protocols.  Look that up if you are not familiar .

I loathe this guy 
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:42:22
I am not being adversarial just check it out.  Just thought your experience and what you are sharing is related to the fat protocols concept

Just use bisq. It’s a decentralized  exchange. If we want decentralization to protect us from  censorship, corruption and manipulation we must apply it across the board in every facet of our ecosystem . Our exchanges must be decentralized and agnostic . 
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:34:27
Did you look up fat protocols ? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:10:23
uh no I ha ha i just need support on the exchange whaleclub.co. I was hoping they had some representative on reddit answering questions. although i am sure you theory about manipulation is correct but i am just a dude trying to get paid from this exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:08:24
Feel free to elaborate. And regardless my point is this kind of conspiratorial rhetoric is toxic for our community . Banks suck . But reverting to Soros and Rothchilds conspiracies make us seem like crazy racist uncles at the dinner table.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:49:37
Help does anyone have any experience with the exchange name whaleclub? I can't seem to get any support. They have banned me from the chat for inquiring as to why i did't get a pay out for my trade.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:19:44

I would love for you to elucidate me. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:00:53
i had been trading with them for about a year and had no issues. And so many other review sites rave about them. i did't bother checking reddit. i don't know what to do.  now i can't get any support and my withdrawal still hasn't appeared on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:06:30
I hate banks but and I am long btc hodl all the way, but Rothschild conspiracies are based on suppositions, hearsay, and anti Semitism. This kind of shit will make the community look crazy. For instance what is the source of this quote ? Seems made up.

What makes you come to that assumption? Macro data ? Some ta?  Enquiring minds need to know. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:44:06
You do know the fed was managing  monetary policy when the depression happens and also when the Great Recession happened .  They have been doing a greAt job.

That because this decentralized currency is still in its infancy . Remember the key word is decentralized . There is no arbitrator that can manipulate it aside from market forces . Once enough coin is in consumers hands it will stabilize .

You think a system that hands billions to defense contractors and bailing out bankers instead of educating our children and providing healthcare and a dignified retirement is just ? It’s not an abstraction for the poor. It’s not an abstraction when you have to decide whether to eat or pay for a gas bill. Or whether you will be able to afford to pay your kids way through college .The abstraction is how you are perceiving it. For many Americans it’s real.

For the record I am not one to demonize banks I feel they were a necessary evil but as all things evolve so do financial markets . And I think we are evolving to the point that traditional banking has become obsolete and a hindrance to freedom and democracy .  More specifically fractional reserve banking has seen its last horizon,
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:04:50
Your level of fanaticism for the banks is alarming .  It’s like Stockholm syndrome .  You evidently don’t know much about the space . There are tokens for lending too. There are also third party sites that democratize the lending process allowing holders to loan out btc for a return .  Once the ux is smoothed out even you could become your own bank.
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:10:02
How effective are they ?  
@_date: 2018-08-14 08:46:09
On what exchange ? 5800 was the Low
@_date: 2018-08-11 08:11:31
The issue with Great Depression is more a symptom of fractional reserve banking and ineffective monetary policy a system  that bitcoin is entirely divorced from.  There would be no banks runs if everyone had their private keys.

I am a free speech absolutist and although I think gab is filled with hateful abhorrent bigots I respect their right to free speech regardless of how odious their beliefs are . That being said coinbase is a private company and can react to that behavior as they see fit.  Forcing coinbase  to tacitly condone the idiots at gab would then also constitute a violation of the company’s right to free speech.

Jobs? Those jobs have nothing to do with him.  Only thing that creates jobs is demand for labor . Has nothing to to with any president. Further more those trends were taking shape long before trump took office . You know which president presided on the largest expansion of minority employment prior to trump ? Obama . So.... but regardless the president has very little to do with employment.

True but people might start building things meant for old code.  I mean both sides have very good points. I think a happy medium needs to prevail. We should remain cautious and reticent to build out too much on proto lightning until devs have a finished product , the ux once finished will be wildly different from it’s current iteration.

@_date: 2018-03-02 21:42:54
You have no clue what you are talking about . Look at the value of the local fiat in African countries . Inflation is rampant .  When you have governments failing you also have currencies failing . Fails states equals fails currency .
@_date: 2018-07-19 02:23:10
I would argue this is less about bitcoins development than about price. While the two are not mutually exclusive they are not one and the same.

Let me add madbakers1’s argument for an etf is exceptional . I am surprised this is the first I have ever heard anyone make that point .
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:04:34
That’s just categorically false. The fed decides quarterly whether or not to raise interest  rates. They artificially keep them low at the moment but have been slowly raising them.  
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:26:17
I think we are quibbling semantics . Monetary policy is set by the fed and interest rates are the tool that they use . But yes a bank can then set retail rates at whatever price they want . But the banks borrowing cost are set by the fed and therefore they will pass the cost onto the consumer.  
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:55:01
Are you versed in technical analysis? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:57:12
I would suggest the problem is frequency of trading not ta itself. If you are a disciplined trader and use ta as one of many tools I think you can be rather successful .
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:40:50
The fed controls interest rates

@_date: 2018-04-21 03:41:19
The fed controls interest rates .
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:45:42
Incorrect . Banks can not pay whatever they want on borrowed money, they pay what the fed tells them to pay.  And right now they are paying incredibly low interest on said borrowed money .
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:07:05
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:54:29

Reinventing a corrupt, archaic , slow, centralized, and weak economic system is not important? We are searching for censorship resistant money that is quick as lightning with no need for a third party intermediary to leach value from your wealth. So I think it’s pretty important and I don’t think you have any idea what any of this is. Turn off the tv. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:01:59
I am no fan of bitmain but how insecure would the network be if they stopped mining ?
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:54:27
So you will buy in after your hard earned savings is devalued? You will buy in after fed induced collapse ? K.
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:42:49
Remember the Great Recession ? Remember how the central bank devalued your savings and congress and board rooms did away with pensions because of the greed of a few traders and irresponsible lenders ? Ever live in a country with with high inflation ?  Yes crypto is a nascent market , liquidity is an issue  but that is changing . The market is growing and so Is adoption . Once enough consumers buy in we will reach equilibrium of liquidity and the volatility will be diminished.  And as for transaction speed it is much faster than true settlement time for a current visa transaction. It takes 2 days to settle a visa transaction. Btc 15 min tops and cost you maybe .60.  Last week Binance moved 850 million for less than $ 20 . In the legacy system that would have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars and weeks to settle . The most important thing about btc is that it is censorship resistant . Fiat on the other hand comes with a laundry list of restrictions.

Correlation is not causation. You  would have to see the dispersal and accumulation of the coins on the blockchain. And even still doesn't not mean it was manipulation.  It's a finite commodity with variable price swings.  Rise in price is nothing but that. Proof would be a smoking gun. What you have is a weak theory.
