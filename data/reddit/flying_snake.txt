OK, special offer just for you - we force you to pay your fee.

You like taxes because you pay less than you take? If you "buy" something cost $100 for $10, someone forced to buy this for $190. 


They can do this voluntary.

State always charge more than it give to me. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:23:06


But you wanna take large portion from someone else. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:34:00


But why your govt force me to pay taxes for my income, but not for services provided to me upon my request?
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:22:40
I believe - I can pay to other human being if I need something from him.

Your answer is robbery and theft. Ok.

I pay bills for electricity that I use.


Why? I buy my phone with my money and I pay bills for use.


I prefer pay to this service directly to fd or doctor or voluntary insurance, which not depends of my income amount.


I can pay for things what I need directly to people who provide this things for me.

Why IRS spy on everyone's income, but not for amount of used goods?

If some person steal for paying his debts - he become thief and you put him in jail, but if govt steal...

Better? Bitcoin created to avoid this damned things like AML, account blocking, funds seizure, etc. If someone like this, he can use paypal, banks, credit card and many other regulated systems.

You claim with taxes you pay less for "free" treatment than if you pay directly  to hospital? It's because someone pay more because your state rob him.
@_date: 2013-05-25 18:09:27


No, if I pay price depends of use this road service, not my income nor price of my car. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:42:11

@_date: 2013-05-25 17:56:48
What real difference with tax collector invading in my house with powerful weapon and seizing my property? Why do i need care for potential foreign invader if govt can seize funds like on Cyprus because they need pay his debts? 
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:16:27

@_date: 2013-05-11 16:02:32

Actually, I can make many copies of wallet.dat and store it in different places or even use brainwallet, but I can't do this with fiat.
