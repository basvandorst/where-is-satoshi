Because it's not in a single wallet. Satoshi knew better than that. 
Satoshi used a lot of different wallets in his early days of mining and as only he was mining, he received mostly all of the initial block rewards.

This  A lot of people will lose funds because of this.
Nodes are centralized because they require 8 times the hard disk space because the blocks are 8MB.
The recent insider trading on Coinbase the the previous pump are both timed exactly as the mining difficulty of Bitcoin was increasing. 
r/btc and Roger call Slushpool and other miners stupid because it mined on Bitcoin even when BCash was more profitable than Bitcoin, but then they thank miners who mine on BCash even when it's less profitable. That's hypocrisy. 
Edit: See this thread about CNBC and BCash

Want something between Day Trading and HODLing? 
Try Swing trading. The time frame of swing trading can range from 2 days to couple of weeks. 
If you're sure that the coin is going to increase in a week or two then buy it and then sell when it rises.

Yes, but if we resort to increasing block size once, it'll be very easy to go to that solution again instead of solving the problem.

No significance at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:51:39
Yes. The main problem with this is that most people keep their Bitcoins on exchanges and they have to use the fees that the exchange decides. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:43:57
You guys should read this!

Spamming doesn't mean transactions with a low fees. The minute you add any kind of fees to the transaction, it becomes a legit transaction. Transactions having low fees means people are okay with it not clearing immediately. 
Furthermore, if you classify transactions with having low fees as spams, you are effectively censoring the Bitcoin network. Every transaction is legit if it has fees attached to it. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:08:36
I am talking about the EDA of Bitcoin.

The best thing about Bitcoin is that you can directly pay other people without the need for a third party in the middle. 
This is exactly what Visa is. They can track your every purchase using this card. They can block your card for 'suspicious transactions'.

You can memorise your private keys or write them down so even if you lose your phone, you can revive your wallet on a new phone. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:06:55
Well we could increase the blocksize to 2MB blocks and it would have been fine for an year or 2. After that, we would have encountered this problem again becasue of more users coming into the ecosystem. Should we increase the blocksize again if that happens? What if 2 year after that the number of users increase 3 times and the same problem happens again. Should we increase the blocksize again and again?  
Increasing blocksize can never lead to optimisation and optimisation is what we really need. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:48:26

It says it can't be used for payment i.e. it'll be illegal for you to accept payment of sandwich in BTC. 
Also, if you own someone 5 lakhs, you can't pay them 1BTC. 
It can be used as Store of value though. 
That being said, they can't do anything if both the parties agree to BTC and keep it private.

It will get processed 'eventually'. You can decide how fast you want to process the tx and choose the fees accordingly. If you pay a fee of 15 sat/byte then all the txs below that fee level won't matter to you because your priority will be more than those. 
Anyways, my point was that the act of adding fees to a txs makes it legit.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:24:56
Haha. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:22:17

First of all, it'll lead to more and more centralization. Each time you increase the block size, less and less people can participate in running a full node because of memory(storage and RAM) constrains. 
Users won't be able to run full nodes with Raspberry-Pi like a lot of people are running now. An increase to 2 MB will require double the space and processing power and a further increase to 4 MB will increase the it by 4 times! 
Now about your example about adding lanes if the the highway feels congested. It will be a temporary solution because with the increase of cars, the highway will be congested again in no time. So, a better solution to solve this problem would be that instead of 20 people travelling in 20 cars which causes congestion, we can use a bus and fit those 20 people in 20 times smaller space.

It's highly unlikely that the new users will not sell. They have just entered the crypto market because of FOMO and they do not understand the revolutionary technology behind it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:35:10
But isn't it going to be rejected by others? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:34:37
Do not tip if you can't set custom fees. You'll lose a lot in fees. Otherwise set the fees to 30-40 sat/byte.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:07:00
That's exactly what a bot would say. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:32:12
There is already an option with increased blocksize (BCH) and a whole lot of people are taking it as you can see from the charts. 
Why do you want to see BCH go down? Those guys wanted bigger blocks so they want ahead and did it. I don't think core has any plans to derail BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:29:40

@_date: 2017-11-19 06:19:35
You have to download the whole blockchain the first time for verification. 
You can set prune to 20500 so only 20 GB is stored on your machine at a time. The older blocks will get deleted as new blocks are added but you have to download the whole blockchain the first time. 
My sugestion is to download it now as it is only 150GB and not to wait until it becomes 300GB.

I know I'm going to sound like a conspiracy nut but what if Roger Ver only agreed to exchange his BTC for S2X with Charlie lee and others because he already knew that Segwit2X was going to be cancelled. I mean if he really believes that BTC is shit then why whould he have 1000 BTC lying around? Why doesn't he change all that to Bcash already. 
The thing that saddens me the most is a lot of people are going to lose a ton of money because of this. I don't have anything against BCash but this manipulation is utterly disgusting.

What you can do to help the network more is increase the size so you store more of the blockchain. Right now it's 550 MB because of the value you've set. Increase it to 5000 or more which will increase the size of blockchain to 5GB.
I run with prune=10000 and I'm thinking of doubling it.

We are currently in a phase of high fees because the traffic in Bitcoin increased after the 2016 halving. Segwit is being adopted right now which will lower the fees for some time and then the traffic will increase again near 2020 halving and will increase thefees once more.

A bitcoin transaction is not like a bank transaction. Money doesn't travel from point A to B. 
Bitcoin has atomic properties. The transaction is either completed or not. If it is completed then you don't have Bitcoin anymore and if it's not, your Bitcoin is still in your wallet. 
You will **never** loose your Bitcoin if your transaction address is correct!

This will happen in year 2140. That's more than a century from now.

Yes, it'll be a very bad situation in the first few months but guess what will happen if Jihan gets pissed and removes all his hashrate from the network? The difficulty will come down drastically! **DRASTICALLY!**
Maybe it'll come down to a level where it'll be profitable to mine on computers again and guess what will happen then? Everyone will start mining on their computers again and it'll be more decentralized than ever. 
I believe we will be fine in the long run.

Most of the people are who bought at $4000+ and now are trying to get out of this alive. They'll buy again when the price starts rising.

Bitcoin is not a result of blockchain. 
Blockchain is the result of bitcoin!

Consider the "now" to be dynamic. Now is whenever you read it.

Yes you should! I do too. 
It helps making the Bitoin network more decentralized.

All the coins will be mined by 2140 so you've got more than a century to worry about this. 
Live a little, eh!

I think the people who are genuinely excited about Bitcoin technology and decentralisation will be more than happy to do it. 
The people/organisations who are just looking to make a quick buck will just dump it because they don't understand the story and sentiment behind the inception of Bitcoin. I hope more people understand the technology and actually help the network rather than just 'buying low and selling high'.
