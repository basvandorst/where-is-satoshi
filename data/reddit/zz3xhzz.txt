A major milestone for any product. Also note that bitcoin has never had a breach and its network has had 100% uptime. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 04:31:10
Low on base, high in space! This a good news fellas. Ironic though that stability brings investors that make the price volatile again.

"Phishing is when someone tries to trick you into thinking they are a trusted company or website by having you visit a fake site" 
This line above lifted verbatim from their own website! 
@_date: 2018-08-21 04:29:19
I'm pretty sure this website [bitcoin.com] should be classified as a phishing site. It spreads misinformation and is for financial gain. 
You can report malware / phishing to google:

there are numerous examples where if you didnt know better, you'd think youre dealing with bitcoin. They mix the terms "bitcoin" "bitcoin.com" with "BCH" "bitcoin cash" so much that you wouldnt know what the hell you're dealing with. They shouldn't be associated in anyway with the term "bitcoin". I dont go to cocacola.com expecting to find some knockoff derivative of cocacola. They are cybersquatting and purposely soiling bitcoins brand.

Says the country that will accept just about any currency except their own for trade. Every time I go there they gladly accept Rand, US Dollar, Euro, Pound, ect.

I have an unused raspberry_pi and a 1TB USB hard drive. whats the easiest way to get this going?

Luno! Awesome exchange that started in South Africa.
@_date: 2018-06-04 07:28:50
That's a pretty enticing deal for the business owner too. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 12:13:16
every time i make a payment with a new online store, i first ask support if they accept bitcoin. I'll probably end up using my CC anyway, but good to make my voice heard. 
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:15:00
This is amazing!  I will be running this on my PI 3. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2019-02-08 09:05:52
I too am Running a node on my raspberry pi in Johannesburg. Theres dozen of us! 
@_date: 2019-10-07 14:17:51
What's the easiest/ quickest way to setup a node? I have some Linux experience.
@_date: 2019-06-11 10:37:14
I do the same. Before I purchase, I send them an email asking if they accept BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:42:39
I did the same at $12500. You can't time the market. Its time in the market that counts. just hodl and check on it in a year.

[Blockfi.com] you can earn upto 6.2% per annum. I've been using it for a few months. It been great. No missed payouts, interest every month. Just remember, not your keys. Not your Bitcoin.

what wallet should i download for my windows laptop / android phone if i dont want to download the whole blockchain. whats this kind of wallet called?
@_date: 2019-12-09 13:53:35
this is how bitcoin evolves in a sense. people come along and make the experiece better. better experience = more adoption. Best of luck to Breez.
@_date: 2018-11-04 13:10:20
fair comment. that is absolutely correct. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 05:56:00
I am in favor of the stability of bitcoin. The more stable it is, the more it can be used as currency. The more it can be used as currency will influence its value. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 13:53:44
Um, so can I send my support via bitcoins? 
@_date: 2018-11-03 18:13:25
Africa invented and adopted digital money long before bitcoin. its called m-pesa. bitcoin's advantage is that its decentralized. Africans (in many regions) already are living cashless society.

Well I dont know who this guys is, but I did pirate Jordan Peterson audiobook and feel a little guilty about - So Im happy to send a few dollars to him even If I dont agree with everything, I happy to support a bitcoin supporter. I'm glad I somebody is using bitcoin for its its intended purpose. [Jordans Address](
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:29:52
Excellent. What's the name of this place? Are there any places in Johannesburg that accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:42:37
South African here. Everyone here knows or has aleast heard of it. Takealot.co.za, our biggest e-commerce retailer in even accepts it.

Fantastic news. Ive been a Luno user for many years and have never had any issues with their service. Good Luck to them. 
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:07:32
This is great and something I'd would use. How can I keep up today with the progress?
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:28:37
Trading bitcoin for goods and services increases demand for bitcoin.

Gonna show my support!

Could you integrate a sienfield calender into the app?

I'm that guy :)

I have my profile picture on whatsapp set to a discrete little bitcoin logo. Though its reach is small, its powerful as all my contacts and business get reminded about bitcoin. Its not as grand a billboard but does keep it in the mind of my social circle. If everybody did this, it could help a long way. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:10:43
thanks for highlighting that point.
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:37:28
I run a bitcoin node on a raspberry pi, its all through the command-line, so once the daemon is running there is nothing to see. 
I was wondering if there is some kind of interesting display/ stats screen/ front end/ visualization/ dashboard/ graphs to see what was going on under the hood just to make it more visually appealing
@_date: 2018-12-23 09:04:10
this is so cool. 
Whats this login script and where can I get it?
