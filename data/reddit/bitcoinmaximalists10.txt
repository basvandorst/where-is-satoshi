I've thought a lot about this and I simply believe BTC is at least 10x better investment than property.

I made the bulk of my btc margin trading on bitmex. Level 7 master hodler on whalepool. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:35:33
a lot of it is new comers bandwagoning on the past.

My family was(is) very poor and I did liquidate 50% of my btc at one point to give it to her. I regret it now because I have lost hundreds of thousand in gains... She has the money just sitting there doing nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:55:21
This is why bitcoin is great.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:03:13
i dont understand how theres so many new people advising against investing in bitcoin. As a maximalists I find it stupid not to be in bitcoin 100%. It is safer than any other asset or currency because of its decentralized nature.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:35:21
thanks you sound very open minded and kind
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:19:19
ok mr. i want all the money
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:24:36
lmao i am an immigrant and dont have papers. I can get a labor job but that would mean I wouldn't be able to read up on bitcoin as much.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:43:46
I don't know why the people aren't so supportive. This is gambling with the risk closer to being less than 5%. This is more of an investment than a gamble. It's people who don't follow the developments that say it's a gamble.

The complicated thing is, I was brought at 10 and grew to american culture. I am an outcast in my home country. I speak my first language with an accent. If I leave the states I can never come back because my family overstayed their visa. So I have to get paperwork in America before I can set foot outside it. I am a prisoner in America.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:00:09
lmao u have 0 bitcoins. wtf u doing here scrub
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:56:13
I'M ILLEGAL! Gov handouts are not given to me. Believe me, I tried going on food stamps few years ago when I was hitting the bottom hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:24:13
Governments will need to turn the internet off in order to stop bitcoin. It's that powerful and that comes from decentralization. There are only 21 million possible bitcoins available. If you consider all the positives... the price should be in the hundreds of thousands at least.

150% since i leverage my life savings to earn more bitcoins. I'm that bullish.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:34:33
Nah bro... I'm just gearing up for my life to start.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:41:15
I discovered btc a few months after mt.gox failure(5 years ago?) but didn't buy in because of falling price. I just started buying in few years ago and even started leveraging because I believed in the moon rocket. The more you learn about bitcoin the more it makes sense. The way most people view bitcoin (as a bubble), I view the USD.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:30:06
I don't need the money. I don't mind staying at home where I'm kinda needed.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:36:26
I buy things with my credit card then pay it off by selling BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:26:31
is that why winklevoss brothers hold no ethereum? lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:56:15
Will you eat your dick if it does reach it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:32:59
I've always watched non stop since I got in. But the weird thing is, I'm so far in profit these "little" drops don't bother me at all. If anything, it's a good thing. I have told people and it never ends up good. They either envy or want something from you now just because you're "rich"
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:41:09
I also have btc stuck on there because of verification this is ridiculous!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:46:48
nobody really knows the lows so it's best to space out your buys with days or weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:34:25
lmao ez money coming in boys

I was brought to America when I was a kid.. I didn't have much of a choice.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:23:18
for fiat? So it can shrink in value daily? I'm good.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:49:25
dem bitcoins gonna overtake ur 401k and IRA. Good on you for being diversified though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:27:36
def real. I believe in btc a lot. I look at life so differently in many ways now thanks to bitcoin. Wealth is not important if you aren't doing anything to help others. I am not that wealthy yet.

As a bitcoin maximalist.. my view is everyone should have all their money in bitcoin. Think swiss bank in your pocket that can (and will probably) grow due to limited supply.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:46:44
winklevos twins are also believers in bitcoin and no other shit coins.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:31:05
ty but i'm never selling large amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:08:36
I refuse to sell my BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:41:52
ya it's just a measuring stick.

@_date: 2017-12-03 20:58:51
You don't get how anything works if that's your reason "governments" lmao gl on shit coin journey
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:44:29
I have some cash (less than 1k) and I have access to my moms money that I gave her. She even asked if we should invest back in bitcoins with her money lol.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:33:46
