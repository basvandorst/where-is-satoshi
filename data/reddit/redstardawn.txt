I don't see Bitcoin ever replacing fiat entirely, but rather complimenting it. The only place I see Bitcoin replacing fiat is for Internet-based purchasing as it has lower transaction fees, faster true confirmations (not the pre-authorization system that credit cards use), and it can easily provide a medium between different fiat.
@_date: 2014-06-17 07:31:21
Thanks, man.
I'm really torn over it because I'm not against companies doing well with Bitcoin, but I know how dangerous 51% can be. Hell, 25% and up can be dangerous to the network. The problem is that so many people don't give a shit about Bitcoin. They only care about money (miners included).
I ended up deleting my post because optimism isn't accepted here. I'm not blind to the negatives, just hopeful that people will do the right thing.

I've never ever paid anything for an account with a bank nor did I have to go to a credit union for a free account. From what I know of passport accounts in the UK, they are often more expensive and have much fewer benefits.
Credit unions and building societies are pretty much the same. You literally defined credit unions in the US when describing your organization. Yes, being a shareholder makes a big difference as the organization is driven by the members and isn't concerned with profits over taking care of the customers. That results in better rates, higher interest earned, and lower or nonexistent fees. PS: We have national credit unions.
As far as the debit/credit changes, the EU has decided to put caps on the amount that retailers have to pay, but banks are basically insisting (threatening) that it will result in higher fees for consumers.
The Bank of England is regarded as one of the most effective central bank as all decisions are made by a 9 member committee, whereas the Federal Reserve utilizes 12 members. By definition, since the decision is divided amongst more people at the Federal Reserve, the UK's banking system is more centralized.
The UK ranks third as an economic power in Europe with a 2013 estimated population of 64 million, only around 12.5% of the population of Europe. I said 'overall' which means in general. It doesn't mean it's applicable in every situation or country.

Easiest way, honestly, is to have him open a Royal Bank of Canada account, then open a RBC Bank account in the US. Free, instant transfers between the two.

It's a shame that it would be auto-removed. I think it could have been a good place for discussion on it. Some of the concerns are not unwarranted and I feel you could probably have addressed at least a couple of them.
Posts against other exchanges and companies does not seem to be as readily questioned, criticized, and removed as those against your company. That is actually quite alarming as it creates the idea (whether it be illusion or not) that questioning you is taboo. I may trust you personally, but I don't like how these things are playing out.

Any form of mining *could* be detrimental to a coin if you have a large enough concentration of the devices in a single entity's hands. With more and more ASICs being produced, the price drops and more people will purchase them. ASIC pools seem to be growing, which would help combat ASIC farms. Regardless, any coin with such a long PoW lifespan will run into such issues, in my opinion.

Oh, I'm aware. It requires your own stupidity or negligence in order to lose Bitcoin. With credit cards, one disreputable employee at a business you frequent could easily steal your credit card information. My point is, however, that you are protected as a consumer against credit card fraud. When you lose Bitcoin, it's often just a learning experience. It's not a repairable mistake.

Notice the downvotes? That's because you were being a twat.
*Many* means "a large amount of", *much* means "a large number". *So many* behaves an an adjective, defined as "a group/pack" or as "an unspecified number". It's functionally correct in that sentence, though the inclusion of an additional adjective (*good*) and the fact that *news* is a plural noun that is often used in singular constructs causes the sentence to sound awkward. If you are utilizing *news* as a plural noun, correct though not common, *so many* is perfectly acceptable. If you are treating *news* as a singular noun for sentence construction purposes, *so much* would be more appropriate.
Summation: Both are correct.
Also, uses 'very', 'such', and 'much'. Can't say they use 'many' often.

If you knew about the leak, why didn't you change all of your passwords? The exploit was only used to determine Coinbase users via email and only names were extracted. How would this compromise your account?
I honestly don't care about Roger Ver's opinion on this. The weakest link in any chain is the user and we have no way of verifying that you don't have a keylogger on your computer or connected your iPhone to an insecure or compromised wifi network.

Anything that starts to be worth something will become a target for criminals. Unfortunately, Bitcoin is a technological innovation and this attracts digital thieves. Cybercriminals are still hard to combat with their ever-evolving techniques and ever-growing numbers. Half of the fraud, though, occurs as the result of human error or, to be blunt, stupidity and gullibility. The fact that most transactions do not occur face-to-face doesn't seem to dissuade a person's trust in the unknown individual on the other end. I think a bit more caution would do wonders to prevent a lot of these Bit-transgressions.

I never said that tangibility affected classification as property. It does, however, affect whether or not it should be classified as a hard commodity, such as gold or diamonds. Because it is intangible, rules and laws that apply to physically mined property should not apply to crypto currencies.

Whether or not someone is under the jurisdiction of the IRS in regards to their income doesn't matter. The point is that the IRS put out a statement defining Bitcoin in a specific manner.

You are creating an asset, which could be utilized for income, but you are not directly earning income in so much as building yourself an apartment building isn't providing income, but has the eventual potential for it.
The problem is that the IRS hasn't fully established what is a virtual currency. Instead it has arbitrarily chosen rules that apply to different types of assets in a half-hazard approach to defining it.

WoW gold is not a virtual currency as it is not readily usable in place of "real" currency. In addition, the exchange of money for gold is a violation of Blizzard's terms of service. All transactions conducted in such a manner are technically taxable, but it is an issue of sales tax for general property transference rather than capital assets.
Linden Dollars (Second Life), however, may possibly be classified as a virtual currency as they can be purchased and sold for fiat as well as be easily used outside of the original intellectual property constraints to purchase virtual currency.

Since it can be used as a medium of exchange, it's a currency. This is based on an accepted definition of currency, so your opinion on this doesn't matter.
Volatility doesn't change whether something is a currency or not, it just determines whether it's viable.

They don't treat it as "real" currency (which they also put in quotations) because they define true currency as backed by a central authority of some type. It's contradictory to the idea of a decentralized currency, though.
Basically, the IRS says it behaves as a "real" currency, holds value and can be exchanged for goods and services, but will be taxed as property.
To be honest, this definition and treatment will likely change in the future, but will require legislative measures to do so.

Actually, no, I do not have to consider it. The UK is a small part of Europe. That's like saying that North Koreans are wealthy because the oppressive regime has money.
Also, for someone who doesn't like generalizations, you sure are making them when it comes to the US.
It's much easier to open a bank account in the US compared to the UK and we typically have more financing options for purchases. Building societies are not a good comparison because they are more closely related to our credit unions, which are not-for-profit organizations. The UK central banking system is actually more centralized than the US and will likely not be fee free at all in the near future with the changes to credit and debit card legislation.

The rules are different for different types of assets. What aren't you understanding about what I'm saying? You brought up a comparison to hard commodities. Now, while the word choice of 'mine' may have led you to this comparison, it isn't truly valid. Bitcoin is not a hard commodity. The rules that apply to hard commodities, such as mined minerals and ore, do not apply to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a capital asset and taxes should be deferred until the point of sale.

After reading their whole site, it seems like they just want to push what they think would be a good symbol for Bitcoin.

There is nothing saying that Gyft can't partner with a third-party vendor to sell the gift cards. The "extent required by law" is very open-ended and could probably allow for many scenarios in which there is nothing illegal. In addition, these are new gift cards and that rule applies to previously purchased ones. If the gift card is issued by ACI at the time of purchase, then it isn't reselling.

The 'most' clause refers to the idea of mass adoption, something of which you don't seem a proponent...which is fine if you want the value to stagnate. More merchants means more products are available, which further increases the independence from fiat.
In regards to *illegitimate* versus *illegal*, I'm afraid it's you that needs to reexamine the definition of the word. The first definition of *illegitimate* is "Not authorized by the law; not in accordance with accepted standards or rules. Synonyms: **illegal**, unlawful, illicit, criminal, felonious."
You are correct, though, in that immaturity does not necessarily play a role in the equation and I should have not brought it up.

To be honest, this isn't really a strong point. The use of fiat, specifically the American dollar, is much higher than Bitcoin, so it would make more sense that the more prevalent and accepted currency would be the medium of choice for any thing, to include terrorism.
Let's look at it a different way, if I want to attack as many people as possible with a computer virus, would I choose to code one for a PC or a Mac? The logical choice is PC because the user base is significantly larger. Terrorists will utilize fiat because they can readily use it in more places.

Bitcoin does not officially fall within any of those categories. The IRS had mentioned stocks and bonds, but only in discussing capital gains. They did not classify it as such, though. Bitcoin has been declared a virtual currency, which is a new category and most closely resembles general capital assets, which are tradable in like-kind exchanges. Like-kind being loosely defined as "the nature of character of the property and not to its grade or quality." (Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(a)-1(b))
Until the IRS further defines the classification, I'm not going to worry about it.
