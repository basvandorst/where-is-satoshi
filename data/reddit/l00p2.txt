So could anyone explain how it going to work if miners don't reneg on S2X? They can setup few thousand nodes within few hours in ACS.. So Core nodes will fork off with no hash power. No confirmations no mining... How would core fork work??

That's bcash. There is no such thing as bitcoin cash. And how does a shitcoin be better than another shitcoin? Be shittier?
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:07:15
I think that what they actually did is even worse. They HAD the temper proof stickers on their packaging, they promoted the idea  and they removed those without any public information - mind blown.
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:06:13
We are at 80.5% and that is without slushpool or f2pool
slush already announced they are joining the party some time today!

I think most people who doubt the second part of segwit2x don't understand or give in to FUD.. It is the 2x part that all those 80%+ people want. The segwit is a compromise to keep everyone happy.. without the 2mb there would be no segwit to talk about.
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:52:39
Well, that's not what Bitcoin was ceeated. But in a way segwit opens doors to LN and other off chain solutions
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:56:43
Coinomi is only for Android. Other platforms are in beta. Should be out in few weeks.  
If you want very secure wallet for cold storage without buying ledger nano s you can install Electrum wallet (portable version)  its one of the most secure wallets out there. Many altcoins use it as a base for their native wallet.

Why nobody is mentioning that 90% of miners are signaling for segwit2x today that pretty much closes all speculations. Segwit is in. UASF is Out. 
Little later 2mb kick in.. all goes nice and smooth. 
STOP SPREADING FUD
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:21:08
From what I gather the mark shows the signaling and the blue line shows blocks mined.
So 60% of net is already running segwit2x software and mined 10% of blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:44:32
learn how reddit works. The name is the link
@_date: 2017-07-20 11:57:36
it is a close one.. could be decided just by few blocks
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:07:27
would need a margin of +83% at this point to be safe.  it'll lower closer we get to the end of lockin period.
Could be decided by few blocks 
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:47:03
Where can we follow how many blocks were actually mined with segwit2x? Coin dance shows only intent.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:38:26
few min in crypto = few weeks in real world
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:42:29
HF is not a bad thing if doesn't result in two permanent chains. Actually in a way its better s HF is cleaner than SF.
 Actually UASF is a Hard Fork - it's just called soft fork for PR reasons. Whatever happens there is going to be a HF.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:48:33
What is going on with f2pool???  They signed NYA.. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:43:33
You know all that and the brain says its ok. But seen like 50 boxing videos  where they stress the seal part and you get yours that has nothing - reason and rational thinking blown out the window.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:34:56
Well, increasing by miners is exactly what is going on right now... 
And meanwhile Core are just bitching about being tossed aside 
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:22:13
Are you for real? 
The only reason is that Core devs kept promising and never delivered on agreements (HKA)
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:21:24
I think there is plenty of room for many altcoins like Eth or Monero that have their own niche and purpose. I am not talking about shitcoins I wonder more about alts like Litecoin or Dash. 
With Dash at least i see the business plan and how they actually make it work (obviously not as privacy coin)
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:09:26
The appeal of fast cheap transactions is the driving force and the only thing that differentiates Litecoin or Dash from Bitcoin. So what do you thing will happen with prices for those?
@_date: 2017-07-18 09:19:46
what is the difference between BIP91 and BIP91 LOCK-IN???
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:40:49
Ok, if not them then in general every single unboxing video about ledger/trezor points it out as an important feature. I didn't open the package yet.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:35:56
Could anyone help with moving the Storage dir to drive D: I'd like to run bip148 node but had problem with space on C:
In theory if you move the folder it should initialize and look for it but it doesn't happen and start syncing form start.
And since we are post segwit/uasf what should I run to support the network. Can run node 24/7 
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:08:03
well.. there is a point to it. But most of them will follow, some will overtake 
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:45:30
Ok, THX.
YES in fact the is a card inside with the info on this.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:56:18
Nope. I'm talking long term perspective. Blocksize increase is going to happen soon one way or another. 2x part is most likely to happen just like BIP91 as those are going to be the people who actually want that part more than the segwit one. Its only about he politics and who gets what, not about the technical side where all the devs agree that size increase is coming.
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:35:50
At this time the HF is an avoidable it is just a matter what will survive.. 
Where did you get info on HF from core on August 15?
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:31:38
No, they really did have the sticker before.
@_date: 2017-07-20 11:53:25
Waaay to early to tell... One pool backs out at the last min, we drop under 80% and the price will dip like crazy.
Current Count: 201 / 336 blocks (80.4% so far)
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:29:56
F2pool is a douchebag. What haven't he broke? He is breaking bip91 as we speak..
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:40:46
so 9% left after one day! 
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:54:10
Cause the guy is a douchebag? Cause it was obvious as he does that every time? Tiny dick? Did I mention him being a douchebag?
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:52:39
If you mean coinomi - it is the one of the best wallets out there. If you want super secure wallet  that would be electrum portable version on usb drive.
@_date: 2017-07-09 09:06:24
But is there any technical or security reason not to do the segwit2x? Yes,  politically it is a turd on a stick but lets forget that for a sec and concentrate on getting this over with.
