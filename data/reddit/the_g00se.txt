I've been an avid jailbreaker for awhile now and I agree that it would be a perfect application for Bitcoin. But anytime this is brought up in there is a negative response. has stated something along the lines of "Bitcoin can't be implemented due to government or tax regulations in various countries because Cydia receives a percentage of the sale and some countries don't allow Cydia purchases to be made" Hopefully he can respond here with the more accurate response than my fuzzy recollection from a few years back.

I can assure you that I did not do anything of the sort and you can feel free to test the image when I post it later today.
@_date: 2014-11-15 02:42:10
Keep up the good work. Also, you should try tipping in some other popular subs! It is quite rewarding.
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:53:19
I will look into this. Thank you for the idea!

B+ has additional usb ports and would just be another option for people that want to use the latest version of the raspberry pi for applications other than just cold storage.

The new Cassius coins. They will be loadable. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:04:55
It could be possible to have them pay for one drink ahead, then be refunded the left over amount minus the tip once they stop drinking. Ex: I go in and buy two rounds, but I pay for 3 drinks (drinks = .01btc) so I pay .03btc for the 3 drinks. When I am done with my beer and ask for the receipt the tip is taken out of the .01 BTC buffer and I am returned the difference. (Sorry for formatting, I am on a mobile device.)
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:01:10
I believe circle bakes the fee into the price of the coin you are purchasing. I often check both to see where I will get the most for my money and 9/10 Coinbase is cheaper, even after fees. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:18:28
Didn't work for me. Kept receiving an error.

Did you ever get the link? I am still waiting too...
@_date: 2014-08-01 21:09:35
I am glad you gave me criticism which helped me to improve my site.  If you purchase the Key Lime Pi Basic, it includes the Raspberry Pi, a blank 8gb SDHC card, a clear plastic case, HDMI cable and power adapter. Everything you need to set up the wallet!
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:53:00
Thats for letting me know! It has been fixed.
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:01:14
Wow! How ironic. I was just trying to purchase a walmart gift card with bitcoin not even 2 hours ago on gyft.com, only to find out that it wasn't possible. This is awesome!
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:37:20
Spend the BTC and buy back that same amount as you spend it. Rinse and repeat.  Then you will be stimulating the bitcoin economy and working towards mainstream adoption, which in turn will increase the value of the bitcoin you hold. Gyft.com, Tigerdirect.com, &amp; overstock.com are great places to start.
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:45:50
I plan on posting the image later today, so anyone can install it on their own SD card.
@_date: 2014-09-03 11:45:25
I tired to purchase a MOBO and CPU on Sunday at 2PM EST, it didn't work for some unknown reason ( it was not a combo deal and they both did not include any promos). Tried again on Monday at 1030PM EST and again it didn't work. The customer service rep stated that it was caused by "ForceEnd". 
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:24:56
I do something similar, but I set up a reoccurring payment for a daily purchase to average out the fluctuation of the price from week to week.
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:00:38
I'm talking about literally having two tabs open at the same time. One to buy the gift card and one to buy more BTC. So even purchase the BTC before you buy the gift card or merch, if that makes you feel safer.
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:17:17
It might be out dated but I find that it works pretty well.

I see your point , but what if it was a generous bitcoin tip? Also, would it also be considered bad taste to leave a USD tip in a country that uses the Euro?
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:08:06
I used Coinbase payment processing integration. I am helping them integrate Bitcoin onto their blog,  too.

You get 3% back with bitcoin purchases with gyft.com. Also, i'm not exactly sure but I think you can use your credit card on coinbase to buy BTC, so double whammy!
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:43:58
Just got one. Thx for the heads up
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:51:03
It doesn't work on mobile devices very well.
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:14:55
Would you prefer if I just shipped the Raspberry Pi and a blank SD card, with instructions on how to install Raspbian OS and Electrum?  Feel free to mention that in the comments section of the checkout process and I will happily ship you the package without any software preloaded.
Edit: I updated the site with a Key Lime Basic option that comes with everything you need to set the wallet and software up yourself!
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:07:15
I am not a big fan of Armory, I prefer Electrum.  But I can create an image with Armory if you are interested.
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:18:31
Just because you don't care about something, doesn't mean other people don't have any interest.

Why not cut it into more than 2 pieces? (Ex: 4,6,8) then distribute. A lot less trust  required from each party.
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:16:33
I'm pretty sure you can goto your purchased apps and since you have already downloaded the app, you can redownload even if it is not in the App Store anymore. Worked for flappy bird anyway...
@_date: 2014-05-08 16:56:25
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:54:09
The great thing about electrum is you can input your own private key or generate your own seed.
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:10:29
Looks great but I would expect it to be recently updated for $5.
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:01:39
Both Electrum and Raspbian are open source so the source code is readily available. You can also generate your own 12 word seed or private keys using dice, cards, etc... I can post the Linux image once I get home later today for anyone that would like to inspect the code or install it on your own Raspberry Pi.
@_date: 2014-09-02 15:06:10
What time did you place your order? I tried to make a purchase at 10:30PM EST and the promo had ended. :(
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:06:39
 A bunch of gyft cards.
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:34:38
Thanks! I figured the pi didn't keep anything in memory.
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:35:01
My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:34:01
Great! That's what I thought. Do you have any recommendations as to what OS and what wallet software to use for cold storage? I was planning on using pidora, rasbian, or tails and either electrum or armory for my wallet.
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:21:48
Here's a 20 bit spot to get you started @_date: 2014-03-24 16:58:37
I personally wouldn't feel comfortable putting 10 BTC on one paper wallet. More like one BTC per paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:09:33
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:18:58
That's what I plan on doing. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:23:31
You should definitely spend it! Just buy back the same amount of bitcoin at the time of purchase. It is surprisingly pretty simple.  Scenario: About to make a $40 purchase on Amazon.com, navigate to gyft.com, open another web browser tab with your BTC purchase method (ex:coinbase).  Purchase $40 gift card for Amazon.com from gyft.com for .0619195 BTC (1BTC=646USD).  Purchase .0619195 BTC from your BTC purchase method. It seems like a lot of extra steps but it is pretty painless and it helps to support the bitcoin ecosystem!
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:43:17
I have thought about offering this.  I will have to look further into it.

Why 128gb and not 4gb? I would also like to see a guide if you have time.
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:24:34
Thanks for the great question! Feel free to checkout my 100% positive feedback on eBay, my username is Leggett500. 
The device runs Raspbian OS and is run completely offline. The raspberry pi doesn't have a wifi adapter and as long as you never connect an Ethernet cable the device will be forever offline. The SD card contains a fresh install of Raspbian and Electrum 1.9.8. Also, a wallet has never been created on the device.
I have updated the site with a new version called Key Lime Pi Basic that supplies you with all the tools needed to set this cold storage solution up yourself. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:03:19

I am simply supplying the tools to easily set up offline cold storage.  Linux does not automatically boot off of usb and you can create your own keys if you do not trust me.  I decided to offer this solution to those who don't have the time or the know-how to install this software, but would like to be able to store their BTC in cold storage. It is cheaper than buying a stand alone laptop/desktop that is used strictly for cold storage.  It is also a lot smaller and easier to transport or store in a safety deposit box.
EDIT: The site has been updated to include the Key Lime Pi Basic version which includes the tools needed and detailed instructions on how to to create the offline electrum wallet yourself.
