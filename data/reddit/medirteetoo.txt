no, sorry its not how i meant it. in fact the big power struggle is yet up to come. Wait for the next crash in any major stock exchange and you'll see bitcoin rising even more.
the non-bobbly rise will occur after all bitcoins are mined (if ever). With 8 billion world population and only 21 million bitcoins, an $1000 cant be the end of the line logically speaking.

I wanted to write that when the suicide hotline was top voted. But im new here, and kinda make my way slowly out of lurking. So im gonna do it now, as its still of relevance.
1. It is **never ever** worth killing yourself about money. (Allthough having no money is a very deep and bad experience)
2. **Never ever** invest money you cant afford to loose in a risk investment (almost everything is risky)
3. **Bitcoin is a risky investment** we can only figure out what happens when all of them are mined.
The way i see bitcoin going: We are on the hype-cycle ( see:  ) That applies to every new technology. Currently at the "Through of disillusionment" where FUD-Campaigns arise and competitiors (in that case central banks and govts) try to fight it.
Once we have risen to the plateau of productivity the exchange rates will stabilize at significantly higher value than now (after all there's only 21 million bitcoins that will ever be available). If the IMF and several fed banks continue to screw up like they did in the past 4 years, Bitcoins will be in unimaginable high demand a yr or two from now.
So if you're drowning hold your breath (and your coins), if you're flying high postphone popping that bottle of champagne, there's nothing to celebrate (yet)
