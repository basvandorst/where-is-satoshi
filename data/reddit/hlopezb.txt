Are does add to the price too?
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:15:30
I will try them out.
Do they have any limits?
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:21:20
They are not virtual; they are digitally stored.
Virtual implies they are not real.
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:15:05
Could you rate them?

I have 100 in btc-tc.  Got in at around 2.5 so not bad. They are still a good investment on my opinion, 30% dividend payout per year.

It was 25 usd for 500 bucks.
@_date: 2013-05-21 05:58:09
How would I go about buying about 10k usd worth of shares?
Would this buying affect the sell price a lot?

I am interested in setting up an exchange in Mexico.
The exchange rate MXP/USD has been fluctuating a lot during the last year and BTC is a sound investment to avoid this. Also, Mexico's second source of income is tourism.  So the ability to change BTC to MXP is a real need.  Anyone have anymore info on how we can go about doing this.  I found a group of friends willing to start this and have about 150k USD to start this project.  Would this even be enough?

Just tried to make a deposit from Mexico and failed. The Astropay website will ask for document field. I have no idea what they are talking about, its a text field and not a file field. I decided to put my bitstamp acount number and it failed.

I got it to work but here are my thoughts.  This service is really expensive.
1)They charge you 5% for the wire
2)The exchange rate is way off 13.4379 vs 13.13 at the bank
3) Bitstamp will then take a .5% comssion
So you end up paying a 7.784% more or about $10 USD pero coin.
