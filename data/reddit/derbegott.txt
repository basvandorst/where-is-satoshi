Is there a german version? Or german sub? Would like to show it to some people who are not that good in english
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:35:20
because the guy on the left flashed(that small teleport, very important spell which you can only use once every 5 mins) because he expected a hook from the bitcoin guy on the right side but he didnt use his hook spell he just used a spell for allied champs(no hook no damage) at him. it was a troll move that worked. guess you need to know the game to understand it better
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:55:28
you might use the term 1 millibitcoin = 1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC which is allready used by some

LoL is actually a very good game and as i said over 30mio people play it every day. its not about the game its just that the game is played by so many different people over the world that its mirroring the average person pretty well and once again you can see that the average younger person still hase noo fuckign clue about bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:37:58
@_date: 2014-03-16 10:41:51
source? i think its wrong. with 35 million people playing or even more today you have people of EVERY age playing. the main group are people between 16 and 20 for both games
@_date: 2014-07-02 10:58:55
the lol players have a lot of money since they buy ALOT from the riot store and thats what matters. they buy a lot and they cant buy it with bitcoin and that should change
@_date: 2014-07-04 14:37:05
just let them panic. please.

What do i need to actually pay with bitcoin? i mean having bitcoin on an exchange or paper wallet is not enough right? i need an app to pay with it?!
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:47:27
sometimes but even if you play the game every day it is not that interesting imo

Tl;dr: when you are a dumb person stick to fiat money.
you got my downvote btw. not because it is against bitcoin but arguments like "if you have money in your bank, you know that it is safe" just make me facepalming.
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:50:08
thats the satoshi version.. anyone the updated verion?

you guys keep forgetting that your walls are number in dollar.... these "walls" are no walls for many others.. 1000 dollars are like 6xxx yuan and there is no wall for them. if you know what i mean
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:48:00
ROFL do you even recognize what is happening in the world?
i am sorry for your lack of education but it happened many many times that people were unable to withdraw money from their banks! there are more countries on this planet than MURICA my friend. you are so damn brainwashed pls dont dare questioning anybodys intelligence because YOU are caught in your own little world.
and with bitcoin it is at least MY choice how safe i want to keep them. and since your country and many others are in debt as fuck its just a matter of time untill the next financial crysis.

@_date: 2014-01-06 18:32:38
actually it is exactly the other way around. AFTER bitcoin "crashes" he attacks it.
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:06:09
but riot adding bitcoin as a payment method would be huge indeed. i think over 35mio people play this game every day. the ingame shop has like every payment method available on the planet but bitcoin :/
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:42:51
i know.. but it is just soo much of it in this subreddit..
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:27:24
yes BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY
@_date: 2014-07-12 22:29:07
im not rly talking for me. im not interested in using grooveshark
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:39:54
indeed. hard to believe this is actually bitcoin related
@_date: 2014-12-01 16:39:31
change addresses? i would just use it for long time storage. once i will use them id clean the whole wallet. i would not risk anything.

its a pain to read your comments. how can one be this dumb
@_date: 2015-09-06 00:37:57
still drawing lines and marking highs lows and bottoms and predictings were aaaaaaall wrong the past 2 years. they all can only tell you what happened so far and we all know that bitcoin is unpredictable
@_date: 2015-09-06 00:40:09
few days ago i read a thread about r/bitcoin going down...

@_date: 2015-11-03 19:46:02
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:31:03
no its not down. it still doubled within a month
@_date: 2015-03-12 17:00:09
still pretty bad imo. they should make it like 5mbit at least
@_date: 2015-10-15 13:12:50
thanks :-)
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:37:20

u dont know if ure at a peak right now or not;)
@_date: 2017-06-24 13:24:06
thats also what rly confuses me. what hhappens to my coins when there will be 2 different ones? and what are the chances of that to happen? i think it could hurt bitcoin alot if there was 2 bitcoins... and what are the chances now that this segwit 2x is happening and what would that mean?
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:37:27
You are right but it is still a high risk at the moment to invest everythign you have in bitcoin :D it can still possibly drop to 0.1 dollars or even lower
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:15:21
damn you are one real brainwashed applefag
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:32:40

the moment bitcoin was created the credit card system was behind in the technical aspect. by far. the only question is when they start to be behind in the amount of transaction made. but for sure thats no question IF it will happen one day.
