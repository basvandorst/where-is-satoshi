The statism is strong with this one.

They're re-enabled now. Sorry about the delay on communication and inconvenience.

This happens to me all the time.

I didn't log into reddit for a while. If you're still waiting, message me again.

Yes, we're working on what you described. We've called a bunch of people already. We have no reason to think verification id docs were compromised. 
Return address crosschecked against an address you withdrew to before is a good idea, and we might do that too.
Our thresholds for "high confidence level" might be different. We could be paranoid off the deep end, but we're going to stay that way.
Also, I messaged you and BobBTC directly.

We're limited to $150k per day out via direct deposit by a payment provider. This has created a queue, but people are getting their withdrawals. We'll put an announcement up about the direct deposit limit and status on crypto withdrawals today or tomorrow.

Open a ticket or email us, and we'll get you taken care of. We're automating this stuff as fast as we can.

PMed you

Email us or open a ticket--or even message me here, and we'll get you taken care of. We're automating as fast as we can, but we're being very very careful.

Crypto withdrawals are coming soon. We are taking this long because we're trying to make sure that users who will be withdrawing are actually the owners of the account. Turns out this is difficult to be confident about if we are concerned that password hashes and 2FA secrets are compromised.

If you're making reference to the phone line, we're not using it right now. Traffic on it would be too high for our people to handle. If you have coins on the exchange and want them out, fill in your return address in settings &gt; user preferences, and then either open a ticket or email us. Sorry for the delay here.

Direct deposits are going to take longer than a business day now because there's a queue for them because we're limited to 150k/day by our payment provider.

This isn't CAVIRTEX. We don't use perfectmoney, and we have more than 10k users.
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:26:07
We're going to email everyone with a balance soon (unless something breaks).

PMed you (sorry for spam)
