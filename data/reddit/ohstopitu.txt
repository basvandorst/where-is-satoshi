Because 1) it's them coding not you. 2) they generally don't get paid to do so - they do it because they love and believe in what they are coding for. 3) and lastly - what makes you think they'd continue to work on something for free when they are assumed to be essentially "code monkeys" to code and "stfu" so big boys can talk.

I generally don't like making accounts...and while I am interested in bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, I don't know much about it (apart from what I read on reddit and a few other blogs).
That said, I could easily make up a nice website and send a link to whoever is responsible and they could use it if they are interested.
EDIT: I have a startup which makes custom websites, apps, etc...and imo $25,000 for what you are building is a mega ripoff.

if you don't mind waiting....I could possibly build one for much less (maybe even free) 
That site needs to be static (apart from the forums that is) imo!

I can see where you are coming from (if I spend money that I don't have from a credit card, I'm the idiot - not the credit card company loaning me money). That said, bankers took your money (you really didn't have mich of a choice) with the promise of not screwing you over, and gave out insane amount of loans to those they knew could not afford it (for no reason other then to further then own ends) and when the shit came crashing down....bankers made money, those that didn't have any can't loose all that much anyway but those that followed the rules, lived in their means were the ones that got the short end of the stick - which is absolutely not fair considering the bankers broke the law and didn't pay for their crimes.
Ducking hell, RBC recently introduced mortgage backed securities once again knowing fully well that the Canadian housing market is in a massive bubble.
