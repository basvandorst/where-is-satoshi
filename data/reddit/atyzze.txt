He's not. Selling the bfxcoin is optional. You have a choice. Recover some of your 36% haircut funds now or take the risk and hope that Bitfinex will repay it in full. They're giving you an option. How exactly is that fucking you?
The only way you could argue they fucked you is by complaining they should have prevented the hack or should have had funds ready to cover for potential stolen funds by a hack.
Though I agree that this is a neat way for them to potentially cheapily buy back their losses due to people lacking trust in their capabilities. In a way, It's beautifully set up in their adventage. Which ironically gives me more trust in the business being run by smart people. And I'm saying this while being personally affected by the hack.

You can't hack a hardware wallet unless you have physical access to that. The moment you have physicl access to it, it's frankly already doing better than regular cash since bills you can just take, hardware wallets need further hacking to get the funds out. And by the time the hacker is able to do that the owner will have been able to move out their funds to a different wallet.

@_date: 2016-04-12 13:00:17




I'm saying that if you want a car that will only drive on land you own, then you might as well get a fine tuned car that isn't allowed on the public road due to it not confirming to regulation out safety restrictions. Since we're talking about performance/benefits here, what benefit does one get choosing a regulated car overr a fined tune car to whatever the goal was when one doesn't use the public road?


I never argued it's not a blockchain, merely arguing that there are better alternatives for private blockchains.

Could be coincidence, some bot or person removed that order a few moments before you decided to send yours.

No. Unless you want to start your own mining company. Get profitable mining bitcoin out of your head. With the exception of having free power somehow, but even then, breaking even might not ever happen.
Also do you realize that if you consider all the possible outcomes of your investment in mining that there is only one where you break even and many more where you don't? Profitable is already pretty much out of the question. So the most likely thing to happen financially is that **you will lose money** on this.
Does that mean you shouldn't do it? Of course not. You could learn a lot about bitcoin in the process. You could be helping the network. All valuable things if you ask me. But what is almost certain is that you will lose out financially. So ask yourself if it's worth it or not.
If you seek profit or to get involved with bitcoin in some way, then just stick to buying/sending/receiving bitcoin itself. Might also lead to a loss. But at least the odds are way more in your favor compared to investing into mining hardware.

Yes it's as simple as copy pasting an address. Welcome to bitcoin. To backup your electrum wallet, all you need to do is remember your seed. The word list you were provided. Write them down on a piece of paper, or just make sure you somehow make sure you can access it back in case you need to restore your wallet. Also be aware that anyone who knows your seed can access all your bitcoin in the wallet that was created by that seed.

I'm already dreaming of the day where OpenBazaar gets as popular as eBay is now. It would truly be revolutionary.
It might seem like a small insignificant thing, who cares you might ask. But true free global trade, is a powerful thing.

The world economy will flourish, and not without heavily affecting local economies as well. 
Multiple times I've had ideas to make money online, but always struggled on how to get the money to me. Bank transfers aren't feasible. Neither are Mastercard or Visa if you're a small one person operation.

The end game is very hard to predict and hence depending on whom and where you ask, you'll get different answers.
Personally, I see multiple layered crypto currencies becoming the future. Bitcoin being the first, most trustworthy, slowest and most robust of them all. Then faster sidechains on top that have their own coins but regularly use Bitcoin to settle transactions within their own chain. And then there's lightening networks too, which might negate the need for multiple side chains. As you cannot solely rely on the Bitcoin blockchain to handle *all* the transactions worldwide. Technically just not feasible.

Electrum is a SVP wallet, so it's not a full bitcoin wallet as in that it communicates to the bitcoin network through another server. Those servers can sometimes not lag behind. It's not really possible to say how long it takes. All you can do is try rebooting Electrum or trying other settings in the network settings. I'm not a full export on the Electrum wallet myself so. I do use it a lot though.

Indirectly it does though, you need incentive for there to be miners.
Without sufficient mining, there is no blockchain to trust.
Though, if the price lowers so much that enough miners have stopped bothering, we'll eventually get back to a point where people who care less about the price and are more future oriented will still mine.
The big danger here is that once such a thing happened, combined hashing power is going to be considerably lower and a sudden huge increase of more hashing would be possible and potentially completely destroying the network as one person could invest a few million to get 95% of the hashing power.

BTC wallets only hold BTC. No other type of funds can be sent to them.
Depending on your bank they might charge for wire transfers, the exchange where you buy BTC with your own currency will also charge a small fee on every trade you make. Bitstamp takes 0.2% for example.
So for a full cycle: bank might charge fee to transfer money to exchange, buy bitcoins on exchange, exchange charges around 0.2%, sell bitcoins on exchange, exchange again charges around 0.2%, send money back to bank, another small fee depending on the exchange you use.

But it is impossible to make the difference between the two. One can spend a lot of money easily to incentivize thousands of people across the world to run nodes as they requested. If I contact random people, offering them $1000 a month to run a bitcoin node I tell them to run I can effectively get 1k nodes under my control for 1 million a month. Which is peanuts compared to how much money is flowing into mining. This is why node count is irrelevant, anyone with money can setup thousands of nodes if there's economic incentive to do so. But there's more to gain from investing that money instead in additional mining power. And that is exactly what Proof Of Work means. Not Proof Of 'economic' Node
@_date: 2017-02-08 21:20:51
There isn't any. Feel free to point it out for me?
If you mean that the block won't be propagated cause no node is doing so and hence it's an issue? Then no, the answer is that that isn't going to happen since miners are incentivized to mine on the most profitable chain. They won't mine on a chain that doesn't have enough nodes to propagate their work. So yes you need some nodes to sustain the network. But that doesn't make it so that 80% running node software A has any significance, for miners, over 20% nodes running software B.
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:47:27


No, the problem is that *you* don't know that I control all those nodes and am thereby fooling everyone else yes.

@_date: 2015-01-13 11:36:59
Why would anyone suffer? There have been 1 minute blocks before. Difficulty only tries makes the average settle to 10 minutes. 
How about:
If no block has been found for more than 15 minutes, difficulty should lower itself for 5%  followed by another 5% every 15 minutes for as long as no blocks are being found.
When a block is found, set the difficulty for the next block proportionate to how long it took to find the 10 previous blocks. 
* If it took 90 minutes to find 10 blocks, increase difficulty for the next block by 10%
* If it took 80 minutes to find 10 blocks, increase difficulty for the next block by 20%
* If it took 110 minutes to find 10 blocks, decrease difficulty for the next block by 10%
I didn't think this well through, but on first sight, it seems to me that it would do a much better job at getting the average block to deviate less from 10 minutes and would also insure that in the event that 90% of the hashing power was shut down for whatever reason that blocks still can be mined in a reasonable time and quickly adjusting back to the 10 minutes. Same thing for when that 90% hashing power would suddenly turn back on, blocks at first be generated around every minute, to quickly even out to 10 minutes.
Or am I missing something?

The whole reason why Bitcoin works is because it managed to align the incentives for everyone involved to act only for their own greed and to make that beneficial for the system itself.

@_date: 2017-01-24 12:48:15


No. Blockchain is as a technical, social and economic combined invention. It found a way to form consensus between people whom do not need to trust anyone other than trusting that people will always be greedy. So miners are very much so free to chose which chain to append. There's just a bigger financial gain to append chain X over chain Y and therefor most if not all miners append chain X.
But there is most definitely not a 'should' 


And this is exactly why you'll naturally find a balance through market forces and technology improving. No miner in their right mind will mine blocks that are so big that the risk of it being orphaned is higher than the reward of reaping more fees. Miners who wont to profit as much as possible will tune their blocksize to be exactly the size that gives them the least chance of being orphaned while maximising the extre fees gained. And this is nothing new, this has been in effect since day one. The difference now is that miners are no longer able to keep increasing their preferred block size due to some arbitrary tempory hard coded cap of 1MB
This imbalance, is exactly what BU is aiming to correct.

This has always been the case. It's what makes blockchain work. Miners incentive being aligned.


Because it's not called 'contentious' there. Instead it refers to hard forks as the intented way for the system to find consensus.
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:30:49


That is not what BU wants. Just like miners are free to chose which transactions to include (and whether or not to include even a single transaction) BU wants miners to be able to choose block sizes, like they already are, but without the 1MB limit in place.

@_date: 2017-01-25 11:43:29


Miners would be shooting themselves in the foot if they did this. Just like miners are currently able to collectively no longer include any transactions. It would have a similar effect. Miners benefit from acting in a way that increases the value of the chain they're mining on. Not including any transactions or including way too many transactions lowers the value of the chain. Hence they don't do this, as seen in the entire bitcoin blockchain history.


No, miners are currently free to set the blocksize between 0MB and 1MB currently. BU just removes the upper limit and allows the natural market forces to continue to scale as technology improves. No miner would mine a block too big and risk their income. How big is too big? That's exactly BU is about, letting market dynamics find the balance as already has been the case since the beginning of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:00:07
You don't need to run a node to be able to control your money. You only need a node if you refuse to trust anything or anyone other than the bitcoin blockchain itself. Most people use bitcoin without ever refusing to trust other parties.

@_date: 2017-01-16 17:37:08


No ... miners care a lot about how big blocks get because the bigger it gets the less chance that it gets accepted by everyone else on the network before someone else mines another smaller block that gets accepted faster.
Basically it's always a trade off miners have to make. The bigger the blocksize they chose the longer it take for the entire network to accept their block and the more chances of another miner releasing an other smaller block that gets accepted entirely before theirs does.


Then explain to me why occasionaly there are blocks far below the 1MB limit with very few transactions in them?

@_date: 2017-01-25 11:54:36


That's a fork, it happens. And whichever miner is on the minority chain will sooner or later take a financial hit. It's the very nature of what makes blockchain work. You can't completly avoid this. And there's no need to. Miners are incentivized by profit to do their best to avoid this. But mistakes will always happen. And they'll pay for it.


They are aligned in the sense that if miners want profit they need to act in the benefit of the users. Miners can always choose to 'attack' the network if they don't care about the profit and want to sabotage the network. Blocksize has nothing to do with this mechanism.


Because 'hard forks' is jargon that came into existence after the white paper. But essence, the conclusion at the end, as copied below basically describes 'hard forks' by using words like 'voting with CPU power' and 'extending or rejecting' .. 'any rules can be enforced with this consensus mechanism'


work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are
not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what
happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism

What if the attack starts *after* I already broadcasted my transaction that is now in limbo due to its fee being too low?
There is no reason to keep the block limit as it is, it needs to adapt to the evolving available hardware and its prices. Currently, the 1MB limit is way behind that curve.
However, obviously hard forks should be kept to a minimum. So I'm all in for a hard fork that has a gradual increase for the blocksize limit instead of another fixed cap. This is exactly in line with what Bitcoin XT is planning to do. Hence I've already been running an XT node for quite a while.

Unless you have some specific question that cannot just be quickly and easily googled?


A lottery, the winner gets the block reward and the fee attached to all the transactions that the miner chose to include in the block they just found. Many people all want to win, so they end up competing. Faster computers lead to more chances of winning the lottery. The network will try to make the average time in between someone winning to be 10 minutes. So it will make it harder or easier to win depending on how many people are trying to win.


Yes, but you're most likely not going to make any profit.

No it doesn't? This is just fear mongering.
Unconfirmed transactions are not to be relied on. The basic principle of what allows bitcoin work the way it is is a BLOCK chain, anything that isn't confirmed in a block is as far as I'm concerned not real. And hence, being allowed to try to edit or revise your transaction before it gets picked up in a block is just perfectly fine.
Yes, it's a timestamp system, but the unit of time is not seconds or minutes or whatever other regular time measurement. It's blocks.

I agree, but the biggest issue or hurdle to overcome for cryptocurrencies is the public trust in it. 
Everytime there's a mass exodus to a newer supposedly better crypto out there there will be a huge drop in confidence in cryptos. As the values of the currencies involved will suddenly become insanely volatile.
So while I agree competition is good, if currencies can't adapt on its own so that people have to hop from one currency to the next. Then currencies are doomed to fail.
It's a bit like evolution. The best cryptocurrency is the one that is best at adapting to the environment.

Yes, but, you're not the only node seeding the new block data to the other nodes. Only one node will need to seed the data of the newly found block to all its connected peers. Then all those peers need to upload it to peers minus one. And so on.

Allowing a fork to exist not make the original chain any more fragile, I'd argue it's the opposite. Worse yet, a system that prevents users from making a choice is more fragile.


Depends on how you define scalability. If we go with 


Then increasing the blocksize does improve scalability, through increasing one of the limitting parameters. However, it does not make it more efficient because it's not inherently improving the underlying architecture.

@_date: 2017-09-27 18:43:57
It won't. It'll actually boost decentralization by increasing the amount of development teams working on the protocol. Currently it's just one. That's centralized by definition right there. It's a complex topic.

Except that 2MB is no where near corporate level. And there will never be millions of people running nodes since the transaction capacity and thus use of the network is capped to 1MB of data every 10 minutes. 
Regardless, there's more to decentralisation than just block size.

What you're asking is what all exchanges already do. The only difference between those and the one you're looking for is that the time the exchange controls your money is minimized. This is irrelevant since no matter how short it is, at some point. They were in control. You can't avoid this unless you use some peer to peer market system, which isn't really an exchange. In the future you could use OpenBazaar for this. You can use localbitcoins for now, but then you're dealing with cash and meeting strangers.
So all you can do, is:
- send fiat from bank to exchange
- buy bitcoin immediately after fiat is confirmed at exchange
- withdraw bitcoin immediately to your own wallet

It's because everyone who's currently still invested in bitcoin is probably very aware of what it is they bought in to. And as such, further positive news isn't going to magically give those people more fiat to buy more btc because of this news. They'll just get a confirmation that their investment was a good choice and will likely pay off very well in the not so far feature.
It's not just about changing the sentiment of the current traders, they are mostly concerned with TA these days.
It's about drawing in more money from people who haven't been exposed to bitcoin yet.

Either bitcoin goes to 0 due to some yet unknown fatal flaw. Or, given enough time. It will go, way, way higher. To a point where it won't matter whether you entered at $800 or $100 unless you're just that crazy about being even richer. Greed, keep it in check.

Your reason for not supporting BIP101 is actually the main reason to support BIP101. 
The goal of BIP101 is to keep the cost of using bitcoin low, it does this by increasing the amount of transactions the network can process. Net result being that end users who only use bitcoin pay less transaction fees.

Now Ethereum ... that's a whole other story, there's actually something there that bitcoin cannot do. The Ethereum ledger allows for programs to be stored and executed.

I don't think you truly understand what Bitcoin is all about. Bitcoin is designed to mimic cash, but to be digital. Do cash transactions get reversed? No. You might get a refund, but that's just a new transaction that undoes the previous one. It's not reversible. And it shouldn't be. Who would want cash that they can't be sure of that it won't just disappear from their wallet if some client made some claim somewhere?
There is massive fraud possible from both ends.

But I think it brilliantly explained bitcoin in a way that people who have never questioned what money is might just start to get interested. I'm saving this one to link to people as a great first introduction.

Owning coins does not enable you to force others to use your code. It is simply impossible to change the code of how bitcoin works (and thus the limit) unless everyone agrees. Otherwise you'll get forks. A fork for the code that doesn't allow new bitcoins to be created, and one that does. They could in theory co-exist. But who the hell would want to own coins of the one where more get created? 
Basically, Bitcoin brings true democracy to money.

They are one and the same thing. Miners look for a low enough hash value for a new block to be added to the blockchain. That new block will contain all the latest transactions. Hence, confirming them. At the end of this whole process, the miners are rewarded bitcoins predetermined amount of bitcoins + all the fee's that users added to their transactions.

I'll give it a stab myself then.
 private used 10^6
 private keys 10^48
chance of guessing a private key with claimable bitcoins = 1/(10^(48-6)) = 1/(10^42)
10 billion people making a billion guesses a day = (10^10)x(10^9)x365x100 = 10^24
the chance of that ever happening if bitcoin would stop using more private keys = 1/(10^(42-24)) =  1/(10^18)
but bitcoin will keep being used, and it will probably be used more and more in the future.
especially since they encourage using each address only once. so given the maximum transactions a second at the moment of 4, for a 100 years that gives us 126144x10^5 extra private keys.
around 10^10 private keys will have been used 100 years from now if every new transaction used a new private key and the block size limit stays 1MB.
if we fill that number in, we'll get 1/10^(48-10-24) chances of one private key being guessed in 100 years from now. which is still extremely low, 1 in 10^14 chances of this ever happening.
but what if the block limit gets increased and more transactions are used?
visa processes 2000 transactions a second globally, say bitcoin gets so popular it processes x100 as many transactions. what are the odds then?
from 4 transactions a second to 200000 transactions a second is an increase of say a million times more, just to round things up and be safe.
then we'd get 1 chance in 10^8 of this happening
which frankly, makes it feel very safe. since I've rounded up a lot everywhere and assumed absurdly high use of bitcoin and people guessing at it. And even if all of this would become true, there's still only about one in a billion chance of one private key being guessed that has been used before in a time span of 100 years.
that doesn't mean there's going to be any funds left on that address though, and neither on how little there might be on it. meanwhile a lot of time and energy was spent on guessing.
I guess it's safe to say that it's just not a worry.

When things are bad enough, people will prefer to barter since they'll prefer to stick to things that have immediate use to them. Gold has no use to them, it only functions as a means of exchange. People who will accept gold for some of their directly useful goods are people who have excess of those goods and would do better to convert it into something that stores value better.
When society is bad enough, there won't be any excess of anything. Just people struggling to survive.

Bitcoin is never going to be used for all those transactions, decentralized systems simply aren't as efficient in speed compared to centralized systems. So to say bitcoin is digital gold is probably a better analogy.

That's never going to happen. There will always be something that comes first, simply due to the nature of computing. So what might happen is that miner X finds a block but milliseconds later gets a message from the bitcoin network that a block has been found already with the same block height. It's then in the miners interest to figure out asap which chain to mine, their own? or the one received by the network? If the miner seeks to optimize profit, it's in their interest to mine the chain that has the most hashing power behind it. So you'd look at the rest of the network to see what chain they are mining on and follow them.
TL;DR: The miner would first seek consensus of the rest of the network to then continue mining on the chain with the most hashing power behind it.

Better, but since it's newer it's more volatile which most will not consider a good thing. Those who argue that Gold doesn't rely on the internet like bitcoin does are forgetting that if the internet goes down globally that'll be due to such huge major issues that it pretty much implies the entire society collapse.

Yup, and Ethereum is close to having their own lightning network ready. It's called Raiden. They're also working on Sharding and are looking to further reduce the block times. Which further increases usability. I haven't used Bitcoin since Ethereum was able to do the same job cheaper and faster.
Meanwhile for Bitcoin ... we're still arguing over which arbitrary integer number to put for the block size limit.
@_date: 2016-07-13 10:14:10
It's the nature of PoS (Proof Of Work), it's what secures the Bitcoin blockchain. Scaling has no baring on energy expended by mining, the only thing that drives that is the competition between miners. Now obviously if there are more transactions that means it's being used more and hence valued by more people. And that will probably drive up competition in mining even more due to reward for finding blocks going up. The network would continue operating just as fine if we were to expand just the energy of one light bulb for mining. But that also means transactions could be undone by someone whom can power on two light bulbs. The more energy expanded on mining, the more energy attackers will need to spend themselves in order to attack the network.
Can similar security be achieved without expanding as much energy? No one knows for sure yet. There is a lot of experimentation and research going on in this area. PoS (Proof Of Stake) being a possible alternative.

Find solace in the thought you'd almost certainly would have sold your bitcoins long before they reached the value of today. So even if you **did** buy €20 worth of bitcoins in 2010 you'd have cashed them in at perhaps €200, €2000 or even €20000 if you somehow manged to predict the future very well. But you can't. And you'd have sold them and would feel the same regret you're having now. It'd be 'Why did I sell so soon?' instead of 'Why did I not buy?'
