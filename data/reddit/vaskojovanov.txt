Would you know if under the new circumstances, having the seeds to a HDM wallet (Coinbase multisig Vault) once I transfer the BTC from the vault (perhaps using Coinbase Multisig Vault recovery tool)  to a regular Wallet IP, will I have access to the Bitcoin cash?
If I transferred directly to Ledger Nano S Bitcoin address, would there be bitcoin cash on the bitcoin cash wallet (They do have that update)?

In other words, coinbase adds support for Bitcoin Cash by 1th of January 2018.
At the time of and before the fork, you have your bitcoins with coinbase. If you withdraw you bitcoins after the fork, will coinbase credit you with equivalent bitcoin cash when they support bitcoin cash even though you don't have any bitcoins with them anymore?

Using a good passphrase on top of the mnemonics that trezor or ledger give you, solves the problem. You do need to enter it each time you retrieve the wallet and it's not stored on the device, unlike the mnemonics you mixed with dice.

May not be entirely decentralized as well.

Definitely "One Ledger" instead of "No Leader". I believe [Cryptograffiti]( put his signature above "secretary of treasury" as someone who designed it.

With wasabi coinjoin it is.

Instead of 'GreenAddress', simpler and more intuitive '[Blockstream Green]( ' wallet.

S2X didn't even happen. They called off the fork after realizing their incompetence. Bcash forked on 1 August, even after the fact there was going to be block size increase with segwit on 23 August.

It was canceled. Ppl were trading the futures on Bitfinex or other places and lost money.

Roger has the face of a scammer. Ain't nothing honest about that guy. Fro doing the right investment he has gone to the need of control and ultimate power.

Thank You!

This is the same reason Saifedean points out in his book and everywhere else. I disagree.   
Good monetary policy is still centrally controlled and can change. If you have lightbulbs, why go back to whale oil?

Thanks. Fixed it.

if Ledger wanted to steal your bitcoins, would that be possible without them knowing the 24 seed words?
The private keys encrypted on the device itself, would it be possible to be extracted with their closed code firmware?

Thanks. This worked. At first deinstalling wouldn't work since the directory was already created in library, so I just removed it from /Users/aspiration/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin, deinstall and freshly installed it again to ask me for a new data location.  
Lopp's page doesn't say have any bitcoin.conf tips for data location.

Do you maybe know why do I get this error at the end?  
ERROR: Directory '.' is not installable. Neither 'setup.py' nor 'pyproject.toml' found.

Thanks. Fixed it.

I was simply comparing superior over inferior technology. Once discovered, you can't rollback superior technology. Going back to gold standard and good monetary policy, would not solve the seizability and censurability.

Unlike the trezor, ledger nano s has an option for passphrase to be attached to a pin. How practical and useful is the passphrase this way, if there is a  backdoor from their closed source firmware or secure chip? Doesn't passphrase get stored on the device memory itself and can be extracted all together with the keys unless you have to put it each time you open the wallet?
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:47:34
Speaking the obvious.

OK, that explains. Thanks. The multisig recovery tool works, but the second step you do need to stay online otherwise the transaction key would not be generated. You can confirm this yourself. 
How are you calculating the transaction fee? If you put 1200 b for 4 inputs, would it be ~2100 b if I had 7 inputs?
