I like this idea. Might be the best way to do it without giving up personal information.

I think the point is making that BTC can't be dying, as OP posited, because there are more transactions involving BTC than ever before.  
Things that are growing rarely die. The value is definitely undergoing a correction right now and there is a whole shit ton of conversations to be had about whether or not the value will recover in a reasonable amount of time, etc., but this post and brighton's comments aren't about value.

No, it did not work. Upon entering my cards' numbers, I was prompted for a cardholder name, address, etc. Since that information doesn't exist and is irrelevant to the card, i was unable to make use of it.

Wow! That's fantastic and generous. Holy cow! Thanks so much!

Hey, you're alright. I really appreciate the generosity! I honestly was just looking for a way to buy some BTC on my own, but you all have me starting off on some solid footing! I can't wait to take part in the BTC economy.

I'm excited! I hope I find something that works well/cheaply.

great insight, here. Thanks for sharing!

What a treat! You're a wonderful individual, and I wish you were in my family so we could enjoy thanksgiving together. Thanks so much!

$0.42! That's wonderful. I am floored by the patience, kindness, and generosity you've all showed me today! Thank you, kind redditor!

Yeah, it's going to take a long time before people decide and agree on what BTC is. This is not a huge impediment as long as there continues to be exchanges.   
Use those BTC to buy, guys! No one is impressed by a currency that doesn't gain anyone anything!

Holy cow! You just gave me money. For free. That's super awesome sauce! Thanks a lot!

Checking that out right now. Thanks for the suggestion!

As a buy and hold strategy, it's just a dollar amount i've decided that i am comfortable with. If it straggles about and vanishes, I'm not going to be angry about losing the $320. However, the prospect of holding on to that one coin through the release of the 21,000,000th has tremendous potential for gaining value.  
Investing is always about your personal situation. In mine, I feel like about now is where I want to get in.

Yeah, I'm not sure what wallet to use yet. I just synced my blockchain or whatever. It took me 3 days. No idea what I'm doing yet! Thanks for your advice and your generosity!

Yeah, circle doesn't let me redeem gift cards, though. And I don't bank.

I almost bought my first bitcoins two or three weeks ago, when it was around $405. It's definitely dropping in value right now, but do you see this as a correction or an event because investors are frustrated somehow?
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:01:43
it's not available in my area, goddamnit. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 23:00:29
Correct; bitcoin core is what I'm using. I have zero transactions so far, so I'm not terribly concerned with backing up just yet. However, I didn't know that was a thing and I'll definitely be mindful of it moving forward thanks to your advice.  
Much appreciated!

I just checked out purse.io, and folks there are trying to get more than $450 per BTC. That's a little hefty of a mark up for what I want to spend right now. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 07:10:45
Do you have any reason you expect it to take such a tumble, or are you just saying to say it?
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:44:12
Wow, man! Thanks so much. I can't get over the kindness and generosity of this community. You're great!

Less miners in one location means better odds for the rest of the players. So that's good.
