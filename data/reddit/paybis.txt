they could have moved own funds from one address to others, as part of security measures since they would not know if their cold wallets are compromised or not. that would be the most logical step imho

If you have checked the card your self on your amazon account, can you check if you by accident didnt redeem it your sefl? The button to redeem is right after you check the balance and it's very easy to do it your self by accident. 
Also, are you sure that nobody else could have taken control of your physical card and redeemed it? We have had situations like this, where someone from customer family used the card...

Well, we are also a trader on paxful, and have customers like you.
We had a few controversial cases, where card was used and we are sure that we didnt use it and customer says same. 
In most cases, after investigation of Paxful admins, it turned out that user (client) send the picture of the card to some other trader, who did not respond initially. 
There are some scammers who pretend to be solid traders and you send the card and they go "inactive" but at same time use your card right away.
If you have opened dispute, did you get any response from Paxul admins?

I totally agree. They could have just added a simple 2 factor to grant their customer a Buyer Protection, instead they put all blame on merchant. 
Never the less, we found a way on our side to filter out suspicious customers before they even would make a payment in paypal.

It should, we are trying to help it as well by reducing fees for large volume buyers.

We totally agree, banks restricting people from making payments ofcourse are only thinking from business perspective, managing fraud   is expensive due to fact that they did not manage to implement comprehensive protection for card users. Look and N26 for example, every large or unusual transaction you make has to be approved from mobile app on your phone, why major banks still did not manage to implement such a simple 2fa protection?

We are in process of getting MSB, paypal never asked if we have a license. Also there are examples with companies who had license and paypal did same to them. So i'm not really sure that look at it this way.
