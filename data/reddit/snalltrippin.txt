I really wish I had mined back in the day...my 50Mhps is nothing now (I believe it might have been ok a long time ago for a bit if I got lucky?).  
Good job, enjoy! 
EDIT - Or...you can all fuck off I suppose.. :-)

You can also spend it, that's still a win.

Now if they could just give me a couple grand worth to build a new PC on Newegg...

Why do the good things happen when I have no money...why do I always have no money?  Lol, enjoy everyone!

Yeah, I have the concept down now.  It is still strange as fuck to me...but frankly "normal" currency is about as crazy.

*shrug*  It seems to me that you make, as in create, Bitcoins through computer power.  If someone could please explain the truth I would like to know exactly how they are created then.   EDIT - Like I read here -   
Maybe "selling" is the wrong word...but...

Ok, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:58:06
  No? I could be confused.

Well, since I was basically right I'm happy enough.  :-)  /Actually I was 90% right in my head I just said it mildly incorrectly.  
/Feel free to insert a joke at your expense here if you were trying to be a twat, tis hard sometimes for me to tell and I can be aggressive. 
EDIT - Hahahahaha. Thanks. Sadly I could have gotten into this earlier with a pretty good bevy of machines...sigh.

Can't you just...make bitcoins by selling CPU cycles? Or am I confused?
