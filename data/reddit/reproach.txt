Or the government would be pushed to act in a more responsible manner and spend only what it can actually afford, being unable to print out money at will or bailout cronies.

You might not know this but Bitcoin is far from the only crypto around.

I should have sold my pizza to that guy who wanted to give me 10,000 Bitcoin for it.

Well, first of it'll be harder for the government to push lending institutions into giving out subprime loans, and if they did the government wouldn't have any money to bail them out because there would be no Fed to just print out however much they need, so likely something like 2008 wouldn't happen, and if it did those responsible would be forced to pay for it.

Gonna sound cliche but that's a first world problem. 
If you are at the point where you care mostly about gains you are probably not taking into account all the people who actually have problems getting their hands on money that is not either worthless or at risk to be seized by whichever authoritarian  government is ruling your society at the moment.
Those same governments are going to have a hard time getting a hold on a society that is able to reject their currency going forward.
Not a solution for everything but it is indeed a game changer.

Do you work in a Lambo dealership?

I don't take responsibility for other people's actions. I will unapologetically always buy a puppy.

What if it's a very, very large pizza?

Bitcoin is impractical, but its value is undeniable and whatever comes after will be huge.

They didn't try it, they did it, and it worked for a while but turns out there's a lot more porn and memes in the real internet.

You did nothing wrong by buying a dog you wanted and you don't need to apologize or feel bad for it.

Spare some coins?

That guy is trouble.

I know at least 3 people who are waiting for their first buys to go through, so I think it's pretty much everyone buying at this point.

Man, all I need is a small amount to get started, if you can spare some I'll go away, I'll even take Litecoin.
