This is bullish. I had a similar dream in January that things were going to crash. Should have sold, RIP money.

Well yah.. but it also means people are willing to buy or have their orders set at a certain price. AKA 6,000, thus a battle ensues as to who wins whether it's the buyers/sellers

I never said I was in it for a quick buck, I started last year before the hype and never sold. I'm referring to the constant pessimism in this thread when things are down which gives a better idea of your target audience

I'd argue that it's spilled over from the streets into the water at this point.

I still feel like 6k is going to be extremely hard to crack. Capitulation for sure happened back in February and it's evident in the dip that people just gave at that point. It's the freakin day traders and the emotional buyers killing us right now. Anyone who thinks for more than 5 seconds knows it's completely foolish to sell right now or below these levels.. which is why I don't think it's going to fall off a cliff like in February. Volume exploded last week when it hit 6,200, imagine if it hits 5,900 - 6000 this time around. Smart people are lining up to buy or just waiting to jump back in. If I had more I was willing to throw in at this time, I'd be buying a full bitcoin for sure at 6,000.
FUD along with the traders/emotional buyers are going to keep us low and range bound until the sentiment changes or something brings a spark to this market.

I know, it's like index funds are being created for no reason.

And here, we, go!

If people panic again, a flash dump to $5,500 sounds about right and maybe we'll get our bottom.

Guess I misspoke a little, don't hate

Patience. The demand for Bitcoin is more than ever. If you're panicking, then you're the one supplying it to who are trying to get it cheapest they can.
I was -70% back in February and became positive again +30% not too long after. My only regrets are from trying to swing trade shitty alts after.

Anyone watching Bitfinex? Bunch of constant buy/sells of .002 over the last few minutes. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:40:15
They were buy/sells, so I get what you are saying but it was for .002 Bitcoin asking at those prices.
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:00:04
Just thought it was strange as it was for prices like 6100.1, 6100.2, 6100.1, 6100.2, 6100.1, 6100.2, like it was trying to make a floor

Hey now, close to a 5&amp; price swing in under an hour is a means for a little excitement.. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:51:41
One thing is for sure, I never have to go to a theme park again. I can't think of a better roller coaster. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:13:36
So if this thing bounces a grand tomorrow you're telling me you wouldn't get excited? People want to buy when things are positive and right now everyone is fearful. A good portion of the money in crypto right now is from us little guys trying to get rich quick.

Ahh the good old days, all of those games consumed much of my teenage years.
