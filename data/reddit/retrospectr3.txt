I cashed out of BTC at $5,700 but I don’t see that as timing the market.
I do agree that timing the market is no different than gambling and that people will lose money more often than not trying to do it. 
But when BTC grew nearly 20% to hit an all time high in just a single day, I wasn’t trying to time the market when I sold. 
I saw that as a good time to sell because I was comfortable with the returns I would get and because I saw it as being overvalued at the New price. I wasn’t concerned about whether it would keep going up or down or trying to make sure I sold at the peak market price.
Selling doesn’t necessarily mean timing the market. You could have one without the other.

I'll bite: 
Suppose legislation gets passed that outlaws it or regulates it into obscurity.
Multiple states are already in various stages of putting laws on the books regarding the use and sale of digital currency. New York was once touted as US's nascent crypto capital - alas, no more. Some companies left the state as a result. North Dakota tried to pass a related bill in the house and failed.
There's a senate bill in the judiciary as we speak looking to put regulations in place as well. It's not just a US issue, either. Plenty of other countries are giving push back against digital currency as well. When China announced it would look into cracking down on Bitcoin in mid-January it's price fell ~30% in a matter of days.
There's risk and reward in every investment. You were right in saying that sometimes, unique opportunities present themselves that tilt the balance in your favor. But those are exceptions to the rule. And digital currency is the furthest thing from a "low risk" opportunity.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:35:03
The Bitcoin economy doesn’t exist yet either. 
Although quickly growing, its utility is still very limited and most people invest in it for its future potential and not what it can do today. 
The people putting money in ICOs are the same ones who created the dot com bubble in the late 90s. They believe crypto is the future (which it is) and all crypto will be successful (which it won’t).
TL;DR: Be prudent in your investment, a promising future market wasn’t enough for crap websites and won’t be enough for crap cryptos.

This is a salient point that doesn’t get talked about as much as it should.
The public ledger is bitcoin’s main selling point, but what’s to say that companies won’t misuse this to their advantage, as you just pointed out?
As much as I dislike big banks, I get a lot of peace of mind knowing that I have a lot of recourse for disputing charges. Some credit cards even offer extended warranties, price protection, and a ton of other benefits.
If all  of that goes away then consumers are squarely at the mercy of vendors. I suppose providing customer service would be a motivator for them to provide good service but I sincerely doubt that it would completely replace all the card services we take for granted now.

Again, it won’t bother me. I see it as letting go of an overvalued asset at a time that was great to sell; not because that’s as high as it could have possibly went but because that was higher than what I thought was a fair evaluation for it and a price that gained me adequate returns. 
All because there was no major reason for this spike. If say, it was announced earlier yesterday that every retailer in America would accept Bitcoin as payment I would hold that shit until my dying days, buy more at $6,000 and $7,500 and $10,000. I wouldn’t see it as overvalued anymore given some massive news like that.
But that wasn’t the case.That’s why I see it as overvalued right now.

Higher risks for consumers in exchange for cheaper prices is a questionable value proposition, IMO.
Even if I liked the idea of saving a few bucks by paying an online vendor with bitcoin, knowing that I might get screwed at some point would dissuade me and I imagine a lot of other people from using it.

The black market for illegal drugs is fundamentally different from digital currency. Drugs are a palatable product and they have a very specific purpose: They get you high and that is why people want them.
Digital currency is valuable right now because people believe it is. It's a novelty. Sure, it has some limited utility; a few places do accept it as payment and there is without a doubt a ton of *potential* for growth, but what happens if the fed decides it doesn't want to give up control of people's money? If they outright ban anyone from using bitcoin and retailers from accepting it?
Of course they can't touch the block chain network, that's obvious. But who is going to invest in something that has zero utility and no future? Who cares about how many bitcoins you have once they're valueless?
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:55:29
Perfectly reasonable point. And I always urge people to not try to time the market for that reason - you have no idea what it’s going to do and you will more than likely lose out.
I don’t see this as timing the market though. 
I sold last night when it was ~$5,700 on Coinbase. Whether it goes all the way up to $6,000 or even $7,000 isn’t a concern for me. It shot up 20% in a single day to an all time high and those were perfectly adequate returns for me to feel comfortable cashing out at (for now).
If it goes to $7,500 tomorrow I will see it as clearly overvalued and will need to reassess my position before choosing when and where to buy back in at.

Fair enough, I might have misunderstood him. But analyzing his claims from this angle:
First dip, 1150 &gt; 775, looks okay. He called it near the bottom and it would have been a great time to buy. 
Second dip, 1300 &gt; 950 he "called" on March 9. Let's take a look: high of 1280 on March 3, check! But by March 9 it only went down to a daily low of 1141... The 950 he claims to have called didn't come until March 18 and then it went to dip even further to 903 on March 25.
Third dip, 2100 &gt; 1700 he "called" on May 13. Pardon my French, but: what the fuck? The high the day before was only 1856 and the low was 1650 on May 13. A far cry from the 400 point call he claimed.
One more for fun, 2900 &gt; 1800 he "called" on May 27. Real numbers: peaked at 2760 two days prior and went down to 1850 on May 27. His numbers look accurate-ish! But where's the call? He trolled the forum and made fun of people who thought it would keep going up. Not quite a "call," is it?
Mind you, I am using daily lows and highs for the above comparisons. Which happen for a split second every day. So I'm giving him the full benefit of the doubt that he called it right at that moment and not before or after when the numbers could have been completely different. 
Look, I'm not trying to yuck anyone's yum here. I just don't think misrepresenting information or pretending you know things that no one does is very honest or responsible. We all wish we had crystal s to see the crypto future, truth is we don't, and if young investors start thinking it's possible to "call" anything that is a sure recipe for losing money.

Your loss/gain isn't realized until you sell, though!
The Intelligent Investor deals with securities trading but a lot of concepts are still relevant to currency. One of my favorite parts of the book explains this concept of realized loss/gain with a metaphor, roughly paraphrased:
You bought a small widget business. Some days you sell a lot of widgets, others not so much. But every day a man named Mr. Market comes in and gives you an offer to buy your widget store. On the good days his offer is generous and on other days it's not. Here's the takeaway: whatever offer he makes you, the stake in your business hasn't changed and neither has your bank account!
If one day his offer is generous enough for you to sell your business, that's when you'll see a profit/loss. Until then your position hasn't changed and you shouldn't see it as a loss or a profit.

A few things to consider before calling other people ignorant:
1. Take off your tinfoil hat and consider that it’s generally agreed by economists that slow, steady inflation is good for an economy. That’s why the fed has ~2% inflation goal they try to maintain through interest rates etc. The reasons should be pretty obvious; if your dollar is worth slightly less next year, it’ll incentive you to spend it, invest it, or otherwise put it back into the economy.
2. The 2008 financial crisis had fuck-all to do with inflation. You could have pointed to [countless]( [historical]( [examples]( of inflation spiraling out of control and wrecking an economy, but 2008 is an entirely different conversation. 
3. Consider what **de**flation would do to an economy, which in theory is what will happen with Bitcoin. Less and less Bitcoins will be produced and the value of each one will grow. That’s great for investments but god damn catastrophic if Bitcoin was our national currency. Now, your money would be worth more next year, so the incentive to invest it or buy things with it is decreased. You can imagine what that does, and if you can’t I’ll let you google examples yourself. 
Cheers.

Again, if you think Bitcoin's future is doomed then why are you investing in it?

If only there was a name for the cost of goods *inflating* in price from a currency’s loss of purchasing power...


If inflation is such a big concern for someone then there are tons of traditional avenues for investing that protect against that (real estate, inflation-protected bonds, gold, etc).
They’re sure as shit not going to invest in Bitcoin, the most volatile asset in the world who’s future is completely uncertain and who’s value is down 50% YTD.

Pretty simple answer: because it’s good for the economy. That’s literally the single reason why the fed wants a steady, ~2% rate of inflation.
If your money is worth less next year than it is today, you’re incentivized to spend it, invest it, or otherwise put it back into the economy.
If your money started being worth *more* then you’d have **de**flation and you can imagine that that’s a shitty scenario which brings the economy to a screeching halt. No one wants to spend money because they think they’ll be able to buy more with it in the future. It’s unsustainable and can put your economy up shit’s creek real fast.
@_date: 2018-07-07 15:05:20
I should have qualified my first statement:
[Based]( [on]( [everything]( [we]( [know]( [right]( [now]( deflation is bad.
What would happen if we tested a “true deflationary economy?” I’m not an economist, I have no idea and I don’t think anyone else does either. But the problem has little to do with physical money being indivisible and more to do with the fact that our current system works fine and taking a gamble by flipping everything in its head based on little to no research is counterintuitive, dangerous, and completely silly. 
Also, there is a limit for how much you can divide Bitcoin the same way there are (granted, very large) limits on how big of a number you can program into a computer. This is the same reason why 32 bit operating systems only support 4GB of RAM - the length of addresses needed becomes too long for the operating system architecture.
Look, not trying to get into a whole thing here. Just pointing out that as much as we love Bitcoin, it does have some serious limitations for its uses as a nationwide or worldwide currency. Here’s a long hackermoon article about Bitcoin, the problem of deflation, and its viability as a true currency that touches on some of the same stuff I talked about but also expands a lot in other areas, written by someone much smarter [than myself.](

Honest question: how does one even determine if there is a bubble in a currency market?
When trading assets you can pretty well assess the health of a company and determine if a stock is under/over valued through metrics like price/earnings ratios, net tangible assets, dividends, etc. 
But crypto and all currency for that matter doesn't have that. 
So besides looking at the going rate for bitcoin and thinking "hmm... that sounds high" is there any quantitative basis for thinking about bubbles? Or is it all purely speculation (which is my gut feeling)?
