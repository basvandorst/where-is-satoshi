Care to share your insight that goes against common knowledge? There is no easy way to consistently beat the expected return of public equities unless you take on additional risk i.e. use leverage. I have a background in finance and have been beating the markets by a significant margin over the years. From my experience (and public consensus) it takes a great amount of work and skill to consistently outperform.

That's like saying people who invested in Netflix at $1 made easy money because they gained 160000%. Being at the right place at the right time once in the past doesn't mean much. I've invested in biotech stocks that have gained 1000% but that doesn't mean it was "easy money" or that I expect all my biotech investments to make similar returns in the future. Past results do not guarantee future returns.

I'm as big a fan of crypto as the next guy but it amazes me how many people are dumb enough to put their entire portfolio into cryptos. If you treat it like gambling or if you've invested money you easily can afford to lose then more power to you, but if you think about it as an actual portfolio investment it's absolutely insane to have even just 35% of your savings in crypto. I know this isn't an investment forum but some of you should really study some basic portfolio management. Also, if you panic after a drop like this then you don't know what you signed up for in the first place. Cryptos might have slightly higher expected returns than stocks because of the high risk and the fact that most investors don't understand it but it's not some magic asset class with 30% expected returns like some people on this sub seem to think. Don't get me wrong, it's awesome that cryptos have almost 0 correlation to the stock market, that gains are tax free in some countries etc. but there is no easy money when it comes to investing.

Thank you for the advice everyone.

the expected ROI of an asset doesn't decrease just because it's at all time high.. I'm not looking for investment advice, just technical advice thank you.

Kraken is very good. They have relatively low fees (especially if you're market maker), no deposit fees, high liquidity, their market exchange rate is good, good security/reputation and validation is quick (I got tier 4 within a few days).

200k might mean the world to you, but if it's 5% of his portfolio it's not any more "gambling" than someone with a networth of 20k investing 1k in bitcoin and looking for advice on reddit. Anyone who doesn't understand the relative value of time vs. money will most likely never get very rich, frankly.

Wow you're a complete asshole. He just got out of prison and this is what you say? He had 15k in cash to pay his lawyer + prison expenses for 1,5 years + 4,5k in BTC. He's clearly not a "broke bum", but even if he was, so fucking what? You life must be absolutely pathetic if you feel the need to demean other people like this just to feel better about yourself.

Might wanna look at the strong correlation between income and IQ mate. You don't have to "worship money" to have a few 100k in the bank. You don't have to be lucky to go to university and get a decent job. We're talking about having a 6-figures networth, not hundreds of millions. That kind of wealth has everything to do with intelligence and life choices if you were born in a 1st world country.

Damn you are salty. It's your own (and nobody else's) problem that you've failed financially in life. Of course they should prioritize large customers because they are more profitable, it's called capitalism.

The fact that you think that's a good counter argument just shows that you don't understand statistics. Statistical abnormalities are not counter-arguments against the powers of other statistical tests lol. Why do I even have to explain this?
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:59:31
Yes I agree. All customers are valuable! But it does make sense to slightly prioritize "better" customers.

Of course there are. If you're just buying bitcoins for fun it's whatever, but coinbase's fees are insane if you are investing serious amounts.
