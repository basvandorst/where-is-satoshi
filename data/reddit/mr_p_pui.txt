That's not a bad thing. Here we sit on opposing sides of the world talking through electric wires and invisible waves exactly because of science and math. 
I think that worked out quite well.

Bitcoin now turning into a religion ? 
1000 years from now Bitcoiners will be the dominant religious force on this planet prosecuting the Pastafarians and Jedi's by the looks of it....
@_date: 2019-07-22 04:01:11
World is going off religion. Number are falling across the board, including the muslim world. I don't think religion is a given in our future. Hopefully it will disappear with time...

Amen. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:30:46
I said hopefully early this week. Prophet I'm not. I don't have a 100&amp; hit rate just like everyone else. But of course the week is very far from over. Not even Tuesday yet in some places. 
I bought this. I love moves like this. How you pay the bills.
@_date: 2018-05-05 07:10:54
Lol \- astounding powers of observation. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:10:11
For the love of god it wasn't the farking futures !! If you do 2000&amp; in a year in a parabolic move it's going to crash. For farks sake. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:24:26
At least you got a refund. Some brokers will simply freeze it.
@_date: 2018-05-05 11:58:09
Just going to have to figure it out mate. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:57:34
He is spot on. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:23:58
Top traders don't make claims at all. I didn't say all trades are 75&amp; I said this pattern has a 75&amp; success rate.
This trade is about as sure as it gets. Take it don't take it,. Doesn't matter. I took it. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:16:55
The book at one stage yesterday was 6000 sells and 1 000 buys and it went to $10k anyway.
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:21:44
This conference thing is going to call it I think. Last year it was 50&amp; on the conference and 130&amp; or so after. I don't think anyone wants to risk missing that. $11.8k or so is also where the next serious resistance is. So that's perhaps where we run up to now. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:25:49
Monday To Wednesday. So I was out a little. Still knew exactly what was going to happen. Breakout was Thursday. Out by a day. Depending on time zone actually.
I'm just wondering why people who can't make calls criticise  people who do make quite accurate calls ? Seems to be fashionable over here. Bit of group hysteria. Maybe that's why I don't see other competent traders here. They just go away.
In all fairness it is a Bitcoin reddit, not a trading reddit, but the two go hand\-in\-hand. You can't do one without the other. I'd think the group would like to encourage people with technical skills, not chase them away, 
@_date: 2018-05-07 01:29:52
Support is at $9k now. $9.1 maybe. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:35:18
Wasn't wrong. We're at $10k. Going to $12k. NAV says I nailed it. All that counts. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 09:21:53
Lambo too, not even going to be able to afford a Tesla like this...
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:20:57
$10k doesn't really matter, you're seeing the battle for $10k right now. When we break out here, which will happen before 5th of May, we're going straight to $12k. I can smell this breakout. Alt's are already on the move. Everything is green.
I'll even give you dates, $12k about 15th \-20th of May.
$12k I suspect is going to be a problem. Going to take a few tries to get through there. 2 weeks maybe.
After $12k the whole world is on notice we're going to $20k. There's nothing between $12k an $20k. That will happen very fast.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:02:13
I've got a whole pile of people on my six who expects prophecies . It's not really worth it to post here. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:53:35
I know what I said. And I stand by it. We should do $10k this week, hopefully sooner rather than later. At least I have the balls to make the call.
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:20:26
Why don't you worry a bit more about your shit and less about mine. My account is busy apeshit, mainly because I took the correct positions again at exactly the right time. Again. I don't give a rats arse what you think.

12000 is obviously 12 000 \*\+1
So the opposite of \+ is \-
@_date: 2018-05-02 00:21:34
Buy and hold. We're going to go take out $20k. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:04:45
You missed your point. If it doesn't take off soon we might end up with a very different result to last year. Even a negative one. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:57:10
It will go. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 09:05:08
C'mon man. I wouldn't be surprised to see $11k today.  And if that happens then my next set of targets for $12k is also out and has some major implications for May. Have you even thought about that ? Or you just going to sit there and take swipes at the guy doing shit you can't do ? 
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:01:22
5 or 7 days. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:29:37
Nope. Just need to know how quickly we get there so I can decide if I need to take profit or not. We're going to $20k plus. But we can pause at $12k and come off 15&amp; or so. If we get there slowly I'll TP out a percentage and buy in lower again, if we get there fast it's not worth an attempt at TP and I'll just hold.
$10k and $11k are non events, we're just going to cut through them like they don't exist. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:09:33
Perhaps. Bitcoin is not really behaving like it did last year. So this conference can also have unexpected results. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:30:16
I'm up to my eyebrows in them. Amazing what happens if you just let the noise and opinions fade away and position yourself where the volume and interest is.
Everything is manipulated. There are no more open free markets, no more price discovery. This is true for gold, LIBOR , Bitcoin and anything else you can think off. Our job is to be on the right side of the manipulation. That's what we do.
And for Bitcoin now, that's long.
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:27:11
Dunno why he bothers. That address has only had 2 transaction so obviously it doesn't work. Bit strange, one has to question the motive. Or is it just pure stupidity ? 
@_date: 2018-05-01 01:30:45
What's denial got to do with this ? More guys like me see buying opportunities the more we support it by putting money into it. I'll do 100&amp; on this move in the next 48 hours. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 23:39:15
Went from $1000 to $20 000 in less than a year before it crashed. I wouldn't bet against something that does that.
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:24:33
Ja I don't know. I wasn't expecting this at all. There goes my Lambo in it's tjops. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 23:20:25
Lol \- I don't see how a whole pile of extra profit makes me wrong. NAV's well up mate. And that's all that counts.
If we were at $8k I'd say ok I got that wrong.  But we're a whisker away from $10k and it's likely to go this week\-end. So ja. I'll count the money and you can have nice cup of STFU.
If we don't make $12k I'll also be wrong. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 11:23:20
$10k doesn't matter, $11k Doesn't matter. $12k matters. It's about how long it takes to get there that matters. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:10:32
Don't need the 1000's of percents increase, As long as it remains volatile. All we need.But compared to last year, no matter how you cut it this year is slow. We should already be making ATH's everyday.

@_date: 2018-05-05 07:31:04
Unless they're on back order because the supplier ran out and will be delivered a bit later today. Might not have 100 of them, but the other 2 will pitch up like they have been for the last 10 years I've been ordering beer.
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:00:01
Well, considering what's  happening next week and how it looked last week it was more than a reasonable expectation that we were going to have a big week. Time of year, technicals and I don't even know what to call next week were all in agreement. 
I don't know what this is. It's 3 days before this conference thing which has always had a positive effect. Who'd be selling now ? This is the worst possible time and place to be dumping crypto's. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 07:28:02
I actually can't respond to that without directly insulting your intelligence, which I won't resort to.  I think I'll just go drink a beer while I wait for the other $200 to appear. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:59:20
Battle for $10k was over Thursday already. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 07:16:05
Good, we need to get to $9 300 before the US kicks in. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:37:39
Take profit. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:01:04
Think you're missing the point. People do have to use Bitcoin as money for it to have any value at all. Otherwise it's just clever math. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 20:56:30
Probably $10.5k again. I think we'll consolidate at $12k for a while. I hope we don't, but it's likely we will. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:11:55
Moves like these should pull back. It's very common for it to break out, go back to support and then go. It broke out at $9,260, peaked at $9.9k should have pulled back to $9.2k and then go to $12k.
None of that has happened so far.  So everybody and their dog knows we've broken through.  $12k is a week away if it is even that slow.
It's just my opinion, not trading advice.  I've loaded up to my eyebrows. I bought everything I could afford on that down move 2 days ago.
I think we're going to see big bars soon. We're not going to $10k tonight, we're going well past.  Just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:08:28
Cap'n we ain't have enough power, we're going to have to eject the dilithium crystals into the sun and surf the shockwave...
@_date: 2018-05-09 07:36:49
$9k held...in theory we go back to test $10k now...
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:01:35
I couldn't care less what other people say. This is my view. If you knew anything about pennants you'd be able to work out we're going to $12k.  We are indeed in the middle of the pennant. Your powers of observation is astounding. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 03:28:19
We make higher lows every 6 days at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:49:56
The natural conclusion of a parabolic move dragged Bitcoin down. Nothing else. There is no other reason and no  point in looking for one. If something goes parabolic it is going to crash. End of story. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:36:22
Never be able to call it exactly mate. Don't beat yourself or your friend up about it. But it is going to break out soon, if you want the ride get in.
@_date: 2018-05-05 07:37:41
The beer always comes. You are hopelessly over complicating life.

Some whale is having none of this. Bidding thousands just below market. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:31:14
We only go this far because it went parabolic last year, if it isn't going to go parabolic again then next year this time will be a new low in the Bitcoin misery index. So far we're going to be very miserable next year.
Some of us might even have to give the Lambo's back. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:11:57
I suspect it will go quickly. So will $11k. Just week\-end. Bit much to expect things to just carry on 7 days a week. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:37:44
Don't you think perhaps you should wait till the week is over before you call bullshit ? If I miss it, it will be by a day or two at most.
It is only early Tuesday still or can't you read a calendar either ?
You and your mate are exactly the same, useless. Can't trade your way out of a wet paper bag.
Blind man with a guide dog can see were going past $10k, I don't think we'll even stop there. Going straight to $12k. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:44:29
But life lesson 1, don't try short something that does 2000&amp; a year. That was always going to hurt. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:53:11
And it was going so well....all loaded up, 1&amp; to 7&amp; up already looking forward to the US picking up the momentum...
Kabam..! Everything knocked out. Heathen savages. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:30:37
I bought this. Did you ? Or still to scared to make a call ?
@_date: 2018-05-05 07:16:05
Yeah. And we're still there. 2&amp; off. Not at $8k. Would have liked it to happen a bit quicker, but still at $10k no matter how you farking look at it. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:19:53
Like 3 day from now, no it's not going to drop significantly. It will either bounce around resistance or support and that range is getting very narrow. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:46:56
It has been a disappointing week. When we broke out of that pennant it should have left the same way it came in. Instead the breakout failed and went to test support again, which so far has held. 
So now we wait for the next up leg and hopefully it will behave like I was expecting it to behave. 
Not a major crises. But disappointing none the less.  
@_date: 2018-05-05 07:50:27
Well, you sit there and worry about $10k, that stopped being relevant days ago. But still you cling to it. Where's my 2 six packs ? In the truck man, on it's way.  With the rest of the new order for next week.
The only thing that matters now is how quickly $12k comes up. $11k is as irrelevant  as $10k. But I'll put money on it you're going to freak out about that as well. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 10:37:32
Well, bear meat might not cut it. Fish, maybe chicken and a salad. More might come. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 23:55:14
I'll be wrong when I take a loss. Hasn't happened yet this year. Well actually, Jpy gave me a hiding this year, but the Crypto's have already covered that. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 04:54:06
I hope what happens here is Europe comes in, they go "OMG it's cheap, conference next week, history of a bullish influence, $9k held more or less.. Buy, buy, buy !!"
@_date: 2018-05-04 09:58:35
Here comes those brand new chickens...
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:09:13
Can I just swear ? It frustrates the hell out of me. Obviously if your asset does 2000&amp; it's going to crash.  I don't understand this search for a reason. The reason is known. It went parabolic. And that's that. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:30:31
Really ? 
@_date: 2018-05-04 09:26:40
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:20:19
There are ways to trade this without prediction. Bitcoin is much weaker than I expected it to be this year. So ja I was wrong. But I've taken a step back, considered this a bit more. Now I'm going to black box the farker with focus on trading the volatility. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 22:58:58
I haven't. Who cares if it's a bit late. $10k doesn't even matter. Only thing that natters is how long it takes to get to $12k.. That's the next determining factor of consequence. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:28:25
At $12k I will double my account for the second time this year. I think that's perfect. I don't care what a chihuahua has to say about my calls. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:33:49
I think Europe will see it the way I do. The next few days might be very exciting. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 09:32:53
1 mil bitcoins or $1 mil worth of Bitcoins? Big difference.  
@_date: 2018-05-04 20:57:12
12 maybe 24. Should have been over already, got damn close twice. $10k won't last long. It doesn't matter anymore. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:53:34
As far as I can remember and I'm definitely not going to go look it up, I said the breakout pattern closes 5th of May. We'll break out before then and from there it's hopefully about 10 days to $12k. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 06:54:25
I think we'll see the lows today. They're either already in or at 7800.
Then hopefully I can get busy working the longs again from tomorrow. My wife eats like a horse, need the moneys...
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:37:27
Shrug. Still prepared to call it before the event. Not after. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:04:58
Seems like a little bit of self positive reinforcement. The voices of doubt creeping into the inner monologue.

@_date: 2018-05-05 12:01:15
$10k and $11K went on Thursday. Only $12k matters now. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:46:51
C'mon man, moment you took a bond on your house you put it into dishonest. Whole worlds financial system is dishonest. 
Bitcoin is also openly manipulated. It's no different to BCash. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:10:07
$10k didn't work out. I'll give you that. Should have gone up. Still, everyone is wrong at some point. As long as you stay in the game and work the next time you're right. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:47:15
I didn't think so either. What's even more surpising is the timing. We're so close to this consensus meeting that usually pushes prices up. I'm itching to buy but I want to see prices hold above $9k first. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 11:05:05
Did we enter a prolonged bear market ? No, it did 33&amp; for the month. Worst bearish signal I've ever seen. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 10:38:35
Do a thesis, prove me wrong. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:08:05
Normal mate. Nothing strange there. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:17:52
I think it's $7 800. Hopefully will hold here and if we do it's all the way back up to $10k, which should take a few weeks. I'll be working the longs if we hold here.
If it does hold it be an extremely bullish sign for Bitcoin. Higher low from $6.5k
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:57:22
So the death cross didn't work. I would expect we can safely presume to golden cross is also bullshit ? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:01:21
Need a bit more of that. If we can get real momentum going it's back to $10k for another test. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:08:31
What you saw was the natural and obvious conclusion to a parabolic move. Had stuffall to do with Mt Gox. They might not have helped, but I don't' think they're dumping enough volume to make much of a difference.
The other day we traded 10 000 coins in 5 minutes. They're only planning to move 16 000
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:53:48
Today looks like it's going to be explosive...big bars coming. 
Hope we all loaded up. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:19:58
Ja....I'm not onboard with this no inherent value thing.
These are massive distributed networks. At some point they'll have more users than Facebook. There must be value there.
I also use these networks to move money around the world. Often. And the banks just can't compete. There's value there as well.
Interest rates on FIAT are near 0 anyway. Physical gold you have to pay to store and it can be confiscated at will.  So how does say USD or gold have more value than a network like this ? I just don't see it.
Oil ok maybe, but I drive a scooter and quite frankly can distill a potato or three into pure alcohol for that.  Fusion is coming anyway so even that has a declining value. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:54:17
No it's 7.704 with 5 zero's in front of it if I read that correctly, so 0.00007704, so about 0.77 cents
@_date: 2018-05-10 09:17:43
Was May last year as well. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:50:55
Some of the wealthiest people on the planet are traders. That pattern has something like a 75&amp; success rate. Especially on that time frame. They know it. You should know it. And it's in the direction on the fundamentals. 
It's a question of knowing your craft.
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:43:25
I said 15th to 20th. And it might not be $12k, it could 11.8 k or something that will greatly offend some "people" and it's likely we get there earlier which will offend a whole bunch of other arseholes...sorry meant "people".
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:47:39
We know exactly where it's going. It's going to $12k and will break out before 5th of May or so. It's doing a consolidation pattern which is almost complete. It's how markets move. Any market. They sprint from consolidation to consolidation unless they are going parabolic.  Then they just sprint. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:17:23
Can never have enough Lambo. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:30:32
Why do you even do that ?
@_date: 2018-05-10 09:05:51
Almost 50&amp; higher than the previous parabolic high. The equivalent this year would be $30 000. We are having a bad year. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:23:16
Probably about \-10&amp; maybe \-15&amp; Like we just did. $12k is a significant level. If we go through that all hell will break loose. Going to be a tough one to trade. I'm still idling over what to do myself. I will see how it behaves when we get there. I have a week or so to figure it out.
It would probably be prudent to take some profits, but leave some exposure in the market, so if it goes apeshit you're still in and if it comes off you can buy more. Something like that. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:40:09
Lordy Lordy.  1 in a million pennant ? Looks like farking normal run of the mill pennant where I'm sitting . 
I swear, people are their own worst enemies. K, don't buy it. Sell all your shit. It's doomed to failure. Bitcoin going to zero folks. Heard it hear first. Bad pennant rising.

No reason it can't be both. It's one of the most, if not the most volatile trading instrument available in the market today, meaning fast growth for speculators. And there's no reason why you can't store the profits in Bitcoin, effectively opting out of the system anyway.

You need cash and gold/silver in the house. If things really go south, like say a "Carrington event" having everything in Bitcoin will suddenly be a very bad idea.
Diversify your risk, keep some hard assets on hand just in case whatever the event is, you get deprived of electricity and internet for a while.
And the same for life in general. You never know what's going to happen when. Keep a range of assets so you have a fallback.

Good old barter would be my guess or a new technological version of it. We're about to find out anyway. Been 10 years since the last crises, $7 trillion more in debt than then. ATM's are going to stop sooner rather than later and then we will find out exactly what people do when the money simply stops. My guess it's going to be Crypto's. 
Look this happens from time to time. World changes financial systems. Last example we had was the tally system in Europe, which ended in 1834 when they burned them all and parliament in the process. See here:  
With the size and scope of the coming crises the little girl with a Bitcoin for Lemonade stand might just be ahead in the game and its question of falling back onto the new plan or the new technology to avert complete disaster.
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:39:10
ATM's won't work without electricity either. So it's a mute point. You're not going to be able to draw cash anyway or swipe your credit/debit card.
As for the lemonade. Tech is here to stay. Better to start them early. The lesson you're trying to convey is you work for current medium of choice rather than anything of value. Would you sell lemonade for gold, silver or swap it for a car ? That's just not practical. Just like cash might not be practical in the future. If the currency of choice were sea shells currently, then we'd transact in sea shells. If it was rice, we'd transact in rice. But cashless societies are coming. So we need to teach that as well.
I already pay for everything from my phone. Hardly ever carry cash. Be better in fact to teach her how QR codes work.

We had an earthquake here not so long ago, the difference between everything ok, you sitting there in your room looking at the bitcoin price and standing outside with your child in your arms wearing nothing but shorts is about 30 seconds. Any time of day, any day. 
At least you can dig out your hard assets and survive, but electricity might be a while in coming. Then it doesn't matter if bitcoin is a global currency. Bitcoin is really your hedge against economic and bank collapse. You need something on hand for the natural and other disasters.

Well actually the world is revolting. Since about 2017/2018 we've had CIPS and AIIB. Which is a new real world international banking system that doesn't rely on the US. The first country that signed up was Iran. For obvious reasons. Shortly followed by Britain and the rest of Nato. 
Which is why I think someone is trying so hard to start a war. Because if NATO is at war, then obviously BIS and the rest of the western banking system won't lose their monopoly on the monetary system. 
The world is busy doing a *de*\-*dollarization*. It's not a unique event. Reserve currencies have changed many times during the history of money. 
That said it's probably going to be a 30 year process. That's roughly how long it takes for tech to settle in. 
I use Bitcoin for international transfers. The banks are useless. It takes days to do a transfer. I buy Bitcoins in one country, transfer them to another where I hold another Bitcoin broker account, sell them and then transfer out to a normal bank account for a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the time for a standard international transfer. Even over weekends. 
The banks are doomed. They just can't compete. As of last month Opera has a browser wallet. Soon I won't even have to go to FIAT. 
Banks won't last mate, their time is done. And so if fractional reserve. And inflation. 30 years roughly, that's how long it's going to take.

You don't mention if it's an international flight or not, but I wouldn't even try. Not even with just a hardware wallet. Not even local flights.
The police have been running a scam in Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport for example, where they accuse you of shoplifting. They arrest you on suspicion of shoplifting and then you get given the option, pay the spot fine, usually $3000 or so, or go await trial in the Bangkok Hilton. It's irrelevant wether you're guilty or not, you will pay or be held for months. They simply need to accuse you. The moment you involve your embassy and don't pay the spot fine, they have to back off on the blackmail and that almost certainly guarantees you a few months in prison awaiting trial.
See here: [
Now imagine they pick up your steel seed in a Xray, recognise it for what it is, and a phone call is made...
If they have access to you and/or your device or keys, trust me, they will take every cent you have.
There have been cases where people have been held with devices, it could be a device of any kind, and they are held indefinitely if they don't give the passwords.
So you are running a huge risk here. I wouldn't fly with either a key or hardware wallet. Maybe you're not going to Bangkok, but you are making yourself extremely vulnerable to any form of corruption which I have slowly come to realise is in fact probabaly the global norm, not the exception. Wether it's the Bangkok cops shaking you down in Bangkok or the TSA in the name of the US goverment (because terrorism, anyone flying with Bitcoins must be up to something right, just like someone flying with too much cash ? ) it's the same thing.
See here : [
You are much better off buying new devices, storing your Bitcoin in one of the custodial services and then transferring to your new devices once at your destination. Leave your old devices behind or locked up at home.
Sorry, just to mention there is another way, on Mac's for example you can create an encrypted folder. Likely on Windows as well. Put your seed in one and leave that somewhere where you can get access to it once at your destination, again get a new device for your destination. Don't try take it across a border. Once you are in the international zone they can do to you what they want to. Best not to give them a gap. Rather drag over an encrypted folder over an encrypted connection. Much safer.

I'm not new at this. 
I had Armoury running on Ubuntu on a VM on my Mac, but an update came through and it nuked the whole thing. So several attempts at sorting it all out, I finally deleted the VM. This is like the third time this has happened to me. 
What's different this time is I'm deciding to take Bitcoin very seriously from this point onward. I see what's happening to those poor people in Greece, rest of the world isn't far behind, and it's clearly time to opt out of the system as much as possible. Not even gold is helping, banks aren't even open so people can get to their safety deposit boxes. 
So the problems I had till now I just let slide as it wasn't important. But suddenly it's very important to get this running and get it running safely. 
QT is still downloading the blockchain. I'll see if I can get Armoury to work once it is finished.

It's not about earning money or the lost revenue. It's about content being shut down because it doesn't fit the official narrative.
Today it's them, tomorrow it's you.
First people will disappear from the internet, or be economically shut down. This is already happening. Both Bitcoin accounts and moderate right wing narrative is being shut down by banks and big social platforms like Youtube. The protesters in Hong Kong is a current example. $9 million confiscated by HSBC. 
We might not like what the "them, those people" have to say, but that's the thing about free speech. The other guy can also say what he thinks freely and without censorship, we might not like it, but that's the whole point.
Soon, people will just disappear...no longer from the internet, but life too. Just look at Julian Assange. He didn't break a single law, yet there he is being tortured to death after years of incarceration for charges that were dropped the moment they had him. They knew they didn't have a case. His crime? Telling the truth.
Just wait till the state crypto's are in place, you'll see how quickly they can switch off any wallet or raid it at will.
And that is why this is important. What they are doing to these people they are going to do to you next if you don't fall in line. Pay your taxes and shut up, use goverment crypto's or you are a criminal. That's what's required of you or else...

I do it all the time, just need an exchange both sides. Singapore and USA side. And maybe Bitcoin is not the best for that. It takes up to half an hour for a Bitcoin transaction to clear, XRP is seconds. 
Due to volatility of the crypto's if the idea is to go from FIAT to FIAT you don't want that risk on the table for very long. It's gone both ways for me. I did a transfer once and went to sleep, woke up with 25% extra in my account, similarly I've lost 10% overnight recently. 
It's cheap and it works on week-ends. I've stopped using banks for international transfers now. Waste of time.

@_date: 2018-04-08 09:21:34
It might not repeat, but it will rhyme...
It's not about new money. It's about what the current holders of the money think the value is. It doesn't take just new money to send it up, it takes the current holders to decide the value is too low I don't sell at this level. 
The more it goes up the less likely current holders are to sell. Everyone watching Bitcoin knows its low. There's a few short sellers but they are getting less and less convinced as you can see by the slow down in downwards momentum. And in fact Friday there was a big short cover as you can see by the jump. 
So now as we start hitting the levels going up more and more people are going to cover driving the price up and less and less will be selling, they'll be holding out for higher prices. 
And we have the next leg up. And historically it will be maybe 1000%, maybe 2000% up. I think you'll find sellers thin on the ground once it's confirmed we've turned. I think that will be at $12 000

Not quite how it works. If you're short and you can drive price down with sell orders, but with no intention to actually sell, you can get out with more profit or at least less of a loss, iow's you can buy lower to exit With margin trading you can in fact hold both positions. 
And you certainly don't dump your entire fortune on the market at once if you're trying to get the best exit price. You do it slowly and softly to get the best possible price.

$12k is the next big level. We might struggle there, last time it failed and we went back to $6.5. I'm not even worried about $10k, that's going to go today. 
I suspect we'll get to $12k by week-end and then struggle there till next week sometime.

I'm looking for a Bitcoin broker with a good trading interface. 90% of the current brokers are just websites with order forms. I like Bitfinex as a trading platform, but I'm getting a bit worried about them. News seems very negative around them. 
Any suggestions ?

Go buy a packet of chips. You know, crisps. One of those small packets. Count how many there are in there. Don't tell me there is no inflation. I see it everywhere. 
The bulk of it still isn't visible, but it will come. 
I don't know what bonds are going to do, but equities are going to come off at some point. Probably this year. But to me if one buyer is buying $400 mil, that's big money. For crypto's anyway. 
When Bitcoin gets to $100k I'll tap your for that gold if it isn't to late.

No mate, do the work. Learn how to code, essential life skill anyway. And become independent along the way. Most brokers offers REST API's now days. Nothing teaches you the details of what's going like having to explain it to a computer. That's when you really learn. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:42:35
Well -  there is a way for your average Bitcoin millionaire to get out of that loop. 
Stay out of your country of origin, most will have you non tax resident after a year abroad. Think tropical beaches here. Can't come back for more than 90 days a year. 
Trade in a different country than you're in. If you're in Singapore trade in Hong Kong, if you're in Hong Kong trade in Singapore. 
I know the perception is the US want's global income tax, but I have a few mates from the US who are tumble weeding around the place and they don't pay tax and they are submitting tax returns, so there is a way.

I wouldn't be surprised to see full on crash this year. It's very close. Fed has already started tapering QE and raising interest rates. Turning off the tap that's driving the markets. Just a question of time now.

I very clearly said I don't know if it's the answer, you need other assets as well, yet there is a significant chance that a big enough crises will cause people to simply abandon a deeply flawed and clearly broken system completely. Fractional reserve banking is inherently unstable people are starting to catch on. We don't need to stumble from crises to crises. 
What is it with you mate ? Why all the hate ? The whole universe is based on math, why can't a currency be ? We've used rice, cowry shells, printed pieces of paper. Why not math ? And code?
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:49:44
I bought in easter. I wasn't in last year because I won't chase a parabolic move.  Had to wait for the crash to get in. And of course I had my fx portfolio to handle. So I wasn't in a rush to switch to Crypto.
It was a leap of faith to move actually. The brokers are so dodgy you never know if they're still going to be there in the morning. But I  saw the volatility last year, decided I want some of that and I figured the whole thing had matured enough this year to get in, once the crash was over.

Nothing has fundamentally changed that will make this year any different to any other Bitcoin year. I don't think it's ended one year without at least 1000% growth. Last year was 2000% before the crash. We will be at $20k by June or July. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:44:57

I wouldn't call this market held back. I'm up 30% yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:19:09
Ja, but if half your support disappears it's time to start worrying. If they've been clamped down on to the point where they're almost out of the market then the same thing will come to the West. 
European sessions are also weak. It's only late in the US session that we're getting the moves. 
It might be something else entirely of course, but it is noticeable how quiet the Asian and European sessions are.

Takes a week for a 3% move, then you still have the risk of 50:1, meanwhile I see these things change 30%, 50% sometimes in a day. So here I am.  
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:33:49
Tell that to the crowd that owned Chf at 50:1 two years ago or so. 
The brokers do their best, but if you're in the market with leverage there is no guarantee the broker can get you out before it goes negative. In the Chf example the change happened in 1 tick. From one quote to the next there was a 50% value change and nothing in between. Some brokers went under because of it. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 07:20:01

Oh and the banks don't do that at all. And they can just create money out of thin air and to get it I have to sell my time for eternity. That's much better than Bitcoin. 
At least they can't switch me off in Bitcoin. 
Speculating in Bitcoins means nothing, it's just another asset for now, but if enough people get shafted enough and opt out of current system entirely then you would end up with much more honest and fair system. Where a small group of people don't own everything.

@_date: 2018-04-26 09:07:22
Because the uptrend has to resume. It is a busy day of the week, we've had a day or two down now and about 10% to 20% DD which is normal. Just time and the price is right to spur buying. 
There might be another attempt at a push down, but I'd rather be buying here than selling, that's for sure. So would most people I think. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 05:33:57
And I must say, I've been going through these brokers to try find a second and third one so I'm not exposed to just one and they are crap. All of them are terrible. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:44:15
I'll argue that if the equities crash you're going to lose banks. Deutsche first because they're in deep shit. Now with all the OTC derivative exposure the top 5 banks have, if one goes, they all go. 
And banks can do bail-in's in the entire western hemisphere legally. It was legalised globally 3 months after the Cyprus event. Basically your money can be confiscated at will at this point.  
So when that happens, if you start getting bank runs. Where do people go ? Where's the safest place you move assets into in a hurry ? It's probably crypto. Gold is useless. Last time we had this the US government simply confiscated it. Maybe assets in broker house will be ok. But I'd sure like some crypto in hand mainly because it's outside of the system. It's not easy to confiscate in bulk unlike money in a bank account. 
So I think it might be good for Crypto. And remember every now and then the world does change financial systems. Last one was the tally system in Europe. 
We're going into this crises with a new option. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:51:21
I just wanted to get you the local lifeline number mate, so you could phone them if you didn't like one of my posts. Maybe they'd care. I don't.

@_date: 2018-04-10 23:58:18
For time being. But the distributed ledger will change that over time. The two systems are going to live and compete together for at least 20 maybe 30 years, but in the end the idea that is Bitcoin will win. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:59:20
This is going to become a huge day, whoever is trying to keep Bitcoin down is losing the battle fast. At some point the shorts are going to be forced to cover. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:52:59
Ja, sell mate. Take that holiday. It's better for you I think. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:39:32
But I have manners. Something you're a bit short on. 
The system is disgusting, but it does have measures of value that's widely accepted. Like the USD and gold even if both are heavily manipulated. So if you're going to assign value to something you have to compare it to a standard. Doesn't make the system any less disgusting, but it is what we have until it is replaced because it collapsed under its own corruption or something better. 
I do have a bank account. So I use the corrupt system. Does that make me a hypocrite ? No it makes me someone with very limited options. Doesn't mean I don't understand how abusive that system is. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:53:43

Well, spread the word. Most people here seems to think all movements are manipulations or attempts at manipulation and that's simply not the case. These markets are small and easily moved by bigger orders. Simple. 
Of course there are attempts at manipulation as well, but they're fairly easy to spot and as long as no one panics they generally don't work.  The most obvious of those are big sell orders just above market to try drive prices down, but the moment you challenge those and take a nip out of them they disappear.

It's illegal. He can go to jail for years if you can prove it. But no one is regulating the Crypto's yet so he can basically do whatever he wants. And I guess someone would have to lodge a complaint. But it's easy to beat him. He really doesn't want to sell those Bitcoins, so just take a small nibble at his position and he cancels. As long as no one runs away form the volumes he puts on offer, which hasn't happened this whole morning. We're through a major level and Europe is about to wake up and see it...

Until I discovered this message board I had no idea the Bitcoin world was in this state. Seems like everyone who hasn't made money in the last 2 minutes is suicidal. You lot should try forex. You wait a week for a 0.5% move at 50:1.

@_date: 2018-04-15 11:19:28
Not really. We have the very real prospect of a US market crash 1929 style and a dollar hyper inflation. 
It might even be a conservative target if people give up on the current system en mass. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:45:35
Cash doesn't grow 2000% a year. In fact from the moment you receive it inflation starts eroding its value. FIAT currencies have a 100% failure rate. They all fail eventually. So is FIAT safer than Bitcoin? Absolutely not. 
The best approach is obviously to have both. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:53:53
I don't think Trump will cause it, he'll get blamed, but it's the Fed that will cause it. All they have to do is taper QE and raise interest rates. What di they do right after Trumps election ? 
As for crashes. Some people panic, but not everyone, we know that we have a crises every 10 years or so, same with the Crypto's, they also have crash cycles. So know when to be heavy and know when to be light. Now is heavy time. Crypto's are off 75% to 85% depending on which one it is. That's how you buy the Lamborghini. In most cases they have to gain anything from 200% to 600% just to get to previous highs, never mind new highs. 
Same way you trade equities, just much, much faster cycles till it matures. Is it realistic in a financial collapse ? We will see, the way to trade them is to keep a lot of cash in hand for crashes, so if it does crash as well you buy more, if it doesn't crash well then you're in anyway and gain anyway. 
You just need a robust strategy. Don't do leverage, keep cash in hand, by when there's blood in the streets, like right now.

Monday : Everyone is pissed from Sunday BBQ, need coffee...
Tuesday: Everyone still got the Monday blues, trying but not too hard . Looking at the charts
Wednesday: Feeling better, put in some orders. See how it goes.
Thursday: Holy crap, haven't made any money this week. Buy some shit.
Friday : Half day. Take the profit by lunch, hit the bar.
Saturday: Ugh, Fridays sucks. Hair of the dog, 10 am beer.  BBQ !
Sunday: Hair of the dog, 10 am beer. BBQ !

I don't have to wait days for money to arrive and there's no chance of confiscation by either government.

Ja, last year by this time we were already past the previous parabolic high. This year we still have to go 300% just to get there. We're behind. ..

@_date: 2018-04-28 08:52:01
Yes it would, look it's very simple. All the leverage does is give you more money. to trade. A $10k position short at 5:1 will give you exactly the same losses as a $10k position at 1:1. 
A $10k position is $10k regardless of  your leverage and will incur the same loss or profit at 5:1, 3:1 or 1:1. $10k is $10k.  
The broker will margin call you when their requirements are no longer met. So $25k position at 50% loss would be -$12.5. You only had $10k, so yes, account is gone.

I think you'll find a few spikes here will take you off fx forever. Just not worth the hassle. And investing for people is a pain. Suddenly they all think they own you because they gave you money. No thanks...
Crypto doesn't have a very high work load. So high income, lower risk than fx, less work. No brainer...

Short covering mate, not to lose money. In todays market's you find bots sitting there watching levels and if it is breached the bot will start closing, that hits another bots levels and so on. That's why we get flash crashes, or spikes like these.

That was very disappointing. We're starting to fall very far behind where Bitcoin was this time last year. So either we're going to have a bad year or at some point this thing is going to run like the clappers. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 06:00:17
At some point it's going to reach a maximum value, but I do expect at least a few years of crazy still. I don't know how long it will last. But a repeat of 2017 is very likely. 
So yeah I do think there will be repetition for a while, certainly $100k is possible, but of course if it did what it did last year we will see $400k by Dec. 
Which is still low compared to some of the other targets.

That's what happened last year. Likely to happen again. But guaranteed it will crash again. So when you're up enough, put some of the money aside for a crash. You only need 3 or 4 trades like that and you're buying gold by the ton. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:30:57
Only an idiot will agree with that sentiment. There's a lot less manipulation here than you and everybody else thinks. As I pointed out to someone else, sometimes people just buy shit. Or sell shit. 
TA is worthless, but not because of manipulation. It's worthless because it comes from an era where people read charts with pencils and rulers. This is the computer age, computers aren't meant to stare at screens, they're meant to crunch numbers and do high volumes of repetitive tasks over and over and over. None of that involves a friggen line on a screen.

Because I know what I'm doing. My last purchases were easter week-end. While everyone else is crying in their beer and there is gnashing of teeth and wailing in streets I am buying. 
I am up. Not down on my longs. 
It's very simple. The market went parabolic. You get out, you wait for the crash, then you buy. It's been 4 months since the start of the crash. We have higher lows. We're testing major resistance. Yeah there's going to be a fight here. But basically it's time for the next move up. If nothing else. 
There might be a little more downside. It is frustrating. But it is definitely not the end of the world.

Well, I bought over that easter move and I am well up and holding. Unless you're a prophet it's impossible to predict where the bottom is. 
It's cheap, it has a history of recovering from crashes. It's been 4 months already since the start of the crash. Last year this time it also took off after the last crash. 
It's just time.

@_date: 2018-04-14 03:54:05
Because some of us, myself included have written hundreds if not thousands of them. All the exchanges have REST API's. Anybody who is half professional and has money will have at least some form of automation going, wether it be semi-manual batch orders or fully automated systems. Something like 90% of exchange volumes globally is automated. You'll be very hard pressed to find professional people still sitting there punching in orders. They simply punch in parameters and the machines take it from there.  
@_date: 2018-04-28 02:50:58
That's the most cockeyed logic I've seen in years.
Gold miners don't mine slower or less when the price is low. Too expensive to be at anything but peak production. They simply hoard the gold till they can get a better price.
Similiarly a Bitcoin miner doesn't have to sell. They can also hold for a better price.

Same arguments were true for CHF and what happened to it ? Lost 50% of its value in 1 tick somewhere in the last two years. Not even the Bitcoin crashes are that severe. And it's not something you read in a book. It's not history. It happened in our current time frame and financial systems. 
Meanwhile both Russia and China are starting gold backed systems including oil for gold. You better start thinking about it. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:36:12

Still having it. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:00:17
Bit more than that. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:30:53
Have you looked at it on a chart ? It could carry on for months, but last time this happened it took out the last highs in less than a year. It's already been 4 months since the move down started, momentum is fading for shorts, in fact we couldn't get to $6000 again. So if history repeats itself we should start heading up now and take out $20k before the end of the year. Because that's what happened last time.
So no it's not coming out of the ass, it's just looking at what's happened before and thus is the most likely to happen again.

@_date: 2018-04-28 01:17:30
Exposure is exposure. The margin is simply how much money you have to open the trade.  So in your example you have either $50 000 or $20 000 to trade. $10 000 x 5 leverage or $10 000 x 2 leverage.
How much of that you use \(your exposure\) determines your profits or losses. The temptation is always to put down a bigger position, so you only have $10k of your own funds, but you can put down $25k \(this is your exposure\) on a position and incur profits and losses of the $25k position, not the $10k you have.
You have to be extremely careful with margin on Crypto's. These things lose up to 50&amp; or gain up to 100&amp; in a few hours. So lets say you chose to go 5:1 and put down $25 000 on a short and Bitcoin doubles. You'll lose your account and then some. In fact it will be a loss of \-$12 500 and you only have a $10 000 account.
The correct use of margin is actually to reduce broker or third party exposure. So instead of depositing $10 000 with your broker, you only deposit $2000. But with the margin you still have $10 000 to trade. That way if the broker folds you still have 80&amp; of your money left. If your position gets into trouble you can bail yourself temporarily and remove the money again when the crises is over.  This reduces the amount of time your money is exposed to a third party's risk.
Hope that helps and made it a bit clearer.

Nope. Last part of 2017 was a mania phase. You should expect a bit of tranquility after a move like that and the consequent crash. Last time this happened to Bitcoin it took over a year to make new highs. We're only 4 months or so into this. It will start moving up and gain momentum as time goes by, buy don't expect fireworks until we start making new highs again.

Man - I'm not sure if Bitcoin alone is the answer. We don't know what Bitcoin is going to do in a crash.
You need some PM stocks, some actual PM's in a vault, not a bank. Some Crypto's and a bunch of cash and booze. 
So the idea is get into the crypto's for this next leg up and then convert some of that to other asset classes to get a good distribution of assets.

I'm doing quite nice from my Bitcoin ownership thank you. No matter how you want to project your view, you can not tell me that a network this size has no intrinsic value. It's got huge value. If you hold a dollar all it does is lose value. Lost 90% of it's value since 1950. There's no dividend on it and the interest doesn't even begin to cover the inflationary losses and third party risk if you put it in a bank. So how does a dollar have intrinsic value ? It doesn't. Less than Bitcoin by a mile. Yet you're quite happy to hold dollars right ?

If the US is forced onto the gold standard, which is becoming ever more likely, there's some estimates floating around that the $ ounce price of gold could be as much as $53 000 an ounce. And I promise you it's not going to be gold's value that changed. 
The dollar is just a printed piece of paper and its value is a perceived value. When that perception changes it will happen quickly. 
The world is very rapidly moving away from dollar dominance. We have no idea what it's going to do to the dollar, but it's not going to be anything positive. We're likely to have rapid changes in the dollar value in the next few years. 
I'd rather be in Bitcoin than the dollar. In fact I am.

Man, I did it fully automated for a long time. Ive coded hundreds of systems for it. Ran some very sophisticated systems written in JAVA using Oanda's API. The main problem is you never have enough money for it. I estimate I'd need at least $2 mil to make it work at a level where I could happily live of it mainly because the volatility is so low. You don't get the constant value changes you get here. So it would have to sit and putter around for a few years before you can really rely on it for income. 
But here if you're awake you can make that in a few months. So there's really no point in even bothering with forex again. 
And of course Oanda stopped offering their JAVA API and I just wasn't going to recode all of that again. Third time they do this to me. So I just stopped, transferred all my funds into Crypto. 
You just can't pull these kind of figures you get here out of fx.

I said dollar weaker. Crypto in USD terms stronger. 
I actually have no idea what effect this yuan/oil/gold trade is going to have. But it is a game changer. Gold for oil. Will have to see how that pans out. Last 2 people who tried it are dead. But China is a different story all together. Can't imagine it's going to be good for the dollar. 
A correlation between markets and crypto's are far from established. Bitcoin managed to crash 75% while the equities hang around record gains. 
You do know in 2008 the banks almost shut down? Came to within a hour or two of a total shut down. Now there's 7 or 8 times more debt in the system than then. If the US markets crash or one of the top banks fail, like DB, the ATM's will stop working for at least a period of time.  You'd really like to own crypto's then...

On forex for example you have 20 000 to 40 000 ticks per pair per day, so if you trade say 30 pairs you'd have roughly 1 000 000 value changes per day to profit from. 
And you are staring at a line ? 
In crypto's you have over 1000 instruments x ticks per day. Go do the math.

@_date: 2018-04-15 11:57:20
People use support and resistance to set orders. So in this case since the last high was $8 200 or so and it held it's just obvious to put buy orders above it or stops for shorts above it.
Markets work like this, they sprint from consolidation to consolidation. Also a week-end, so thin markets. Levels getting hit. Just how it works

Markets are so broken, so openly manipulated, taking traditional inflation positions possibly won't work. 
Point is if the dollars comes off, with the yuan/oil/gold trade and/or inflation Crypto's will skyrocket in dollar terms. People see that they're going to storm over. 
You can't even keep money in a bank. It can be confiscated at will now in the entire western hemisphere for a bail in, as they did in Cyprus. That was a practice run to see how it will go and it went really well.

I think we've established at this point that you can't read markets. Might want to update buy those orders. Support my positions a bit more.... 
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:36:26
No, but it is the natural start of one after a 70% crash. It's exactly what you'd expect to see as people aggressively start to turn their positions around. First they have to buy to cover the shorts and then they have to buy the new position. Of course it's going to cause spikes like this. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:39:58

@_date: 2018-04-20 13:59:26
Not really. Look it's very simple. The idea of a 8 hour sleep is new. Literally nobody did that for most of humanity's existence. What's far more normal is 2 or 4 hour sessions. In the middle ages for example it was quite normal to go to your mates house for 00:00 drinks.

Dollars role as a reserve currency is about to end. And I've had this inflation debate a few times now here. I just have to go buy a small bag of crisps to see the inflation. You'll be lucky if there's 5 pieces in there. We're on the cusp of 1930's type event. A global hyper-inflationary depression. 
There is a ton of ways ja, and none of them are coming close to what the crypto's are doing. How much is gold up in the last 3 years and how much are the crypto's up in dollar terms ?

@_date: 2018-04-08 08:22:00
That's complex. You'd have to do exactly all the things you have to do with a sophisticated bot. Call a list of orders, modify them, design the interface.  To code something like that is a lot of work. 
Bitfinex (who do batch orders) has done some of that for you so they can get the revenue from the trades, but if you want more you'd probably have to pay for it or do it yourself. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:40:39
The one thing I don't see people mentioning here is that the current price is just a natural conclusion to a parabolic move. Bitcoin's third. 85% drop from the high is to be expected, which is at $3000. So Bitcoin is holding up well. 
Every single time it took out the previous high after such a move it was a 1000% or 2000% plus gain, so next target is actually $200 000 to $400 000 or so.  
It might take a while to get going but this is definitely where you want to be buying a wide spread of crypto's. I think the lows are in, just a question of time now before the up trend resumes...
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:04:11

A Lambo is the most useless car I can think off. 
In fact I was in Singapore and some dude was driving a Ferrari, you can hear it miles away. So he pulls off at the light, gets to second gear, has to stop for the next light. I heard that car go about 5 traffic lights, he never got over second gear. Totally and utterly pointless. 
Where I am you can't get over 80km/h in the entire country, just water buffaloes and scooters. So if I ever bought one I'd wall mount it. Just what you have to do if you make it in Crypto's I guess.

Only reason Bitcoin is something now are the speculators. Without them driving the price it still be at 10 cents and obscure. Speculation is a necessary part of the process.

Look up, "sort by."...
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:31:44
I think we're through, low volume and all, will see 7500 today...
See what the Asians do this morning. They're all going to wake up and see the long term trend line broken.

Three days ago everybody was suicidal and McAfee was going to eat his dick. Two days ago everyone was ordering Lambo's and space suits for the moon. McAfee's dick was safe again. 
And well....we're back to where we were three days ago. Crypto's are volatile. Just how it works. That's why we're all here. 
In another 24 or 36 hours or so it's Lambo and moon time again. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:43:41
Exodus. I like it. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:15:35
Figure it out.

I'm just below my all time equity highs. The DD is only in Bitcoin. It won't last long. Hour or two at most.

You can't block youtube ads, it's part of the video content. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:10:34
Don't know why someone would post this 3 minutes ago. Bit out dated. Past $9k already. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:13:10
We will get there soon. Someone was desperately trying to keep a lid on the price and failed miserably. Throwing in up to 6000 BTC sell side and kept on being forced to step it back. All the way from 7060 to where we are now and I see the activity has stopped. So hopefully this will force people like that to swing around long side. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:47:32
Funnily enough we do get sky high prices all the time. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:39:28
USD or whatever the standard ends up being. Might even be gold way things are going. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:27:42
This is like taking a run up to kick harder. Next time we approach $8400 it's going to be with momentum. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:28:08
At least the volumes are back...
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:25:41
Didn't really expect $9.2k to come up this week-end
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:32:32
Drink your coffee. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:16:41
Yes, but the $20k high was up a 2000% on the previous years high. If we follow the same pattern its going to be $400k a year from when we take out $20k. So basically I'm saying we could have spikes which takes us higher faster than your target.

It is in effect a gambling addiction, if you're good at it its awesome, if you're bad at it its hell on earth. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:28:51
I think back to $9 800 today. $9 400 is gone. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:54:02
Yah on Bitfinex, this guy has been at it all morning, throws thousands into the market, then he cancels when it doesn't work. You can see it's one trader as all the large orders cancel at once. That was by far not his biggest attempt. Normal is 2000. But that image I loaded is 9000 total offers. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:04:43
Some people. It's very obviously 8461.76
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:54:59
Doesn't really matter where it goes to, as long as it keeps doing this. Buying now will be about 10%, maybe even 20% in 12 - 36 hours. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 07:23:29
Cancelling. Maybe. Depends on how this move goes...
@_date: 2018-04-22 09:18:57
It's 9.2 k. Zoom out a bit and you'll see why. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:22:08
Sit on them. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:23:40
I hope so. Like the .com bubble which gave us  Google, Facebook, Uber etc, yeah I really want a piece of the Bitcoin bubble when the trend resume. Today. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:05:22
Well, what about losses? Surely if a profit is taxable a loss is deductible. 
I'll ask again, but my mates are oil workers and they don't pay a cent on that (oil) income, mainly because of absence. US is unique in its tax views anyway. Most countries have non resident rules. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:33:27
I think this is Bitcoins current pain...self inflicted of course, but I would guess there's a whole pile of very cautious people out there now. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 07:06:45
Frantically dialing Lambo centre....
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:02:17
Heck of a stick you got there. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:21:32
Split your account mate, HUDL some and keep some cash so you can take your chances when you see them. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:47:48
Doubt it. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:26:47
Don't think you quite understand how this works. If Bitcoin doesn't go nothing goes. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:51:49
Something like that, but once we're through there's nothing till the ATH. We'll get to $20k awfully fast. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:35:55
I sort them by dollar value/volume traded, you quickly see where the money is. If it's actively being traded people are interested in them and you need the interest for prices to move. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:30:20
Definitely wasn't luck.
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:05:18
Yeah hell it's going to be boring, I think you should sell everything.
@_date: 2018-04-29 07:47:09
I never said I'm dreaming of 5 BTC, that was someone else's post. I just commented. Read retard, read.
I don't care what you call me. I have the balls to put down 2 calls for 2 weeks in advance, and I've already traded them. You're still sitting there with your buy every \-$50 bucks below $6500. Farking useless. That's what you are. Can't even read.
What's your call. Let's see it. 14 days from now. What is it going to be ? 
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:46:49
I don't agree, look Bitcoin has to reach a maximum value at some point and the HODL crowd will release their reserves, this is the point at which Bitcoin becomes money.
We have 1 maybe 2 of these parabolic moves left. 
But part of it is the HODL crowd moving into something else, most likely other crypto's. 
How far is it away ? Years. Two maybe three. Till then just work it as it is.  
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:09:27
Merrican's have been pushing it for days already. Expect more of the same. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:13:53
Are you farking stupid or something ? We are just starting the moves off the lows, 1 month behind schedule, probably 500% below where should already be, you can see the momentum and you think this is where we're going to go correct ? There's no correction for a month or two mate. This is explosive growth time. Bitcoin is about to unleash its inner Kraken. People will speak about this summer for years to come. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:21:05
Expert eh ? Must be legit.

And just for a bit of encouragement. Onassis used to sell cigarettes from a wheelbarrow. He became the richest man in the world.

You think the manipulation is only in Crypto's? 
It's everywhere. Everything is rigged. Everything is manipulated.

I don't get this new money thing. All it takes is for old money not to sell. It's not a ponzi, it doesn't need a constant supply of new money. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:55:41
Here comes the Asians, we'll see  $9k today.
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:17:04
I'm wondering how big this day is going to be ? I think it's going to be big. $9200 perhaps ? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:41:18
I think it's already happening. Just the initial phase now, the momentum will build. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:45:17
Of course. Think about the Saudi princes who were arrested for "corruption" last year. What if even one of those guys decided to stash their wealth in Crypto's. The alts can't even absorb one of them. It has to be Bitcoin because it has the highest market cap. So a dominant position can lead to price increases.
