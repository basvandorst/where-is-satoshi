They didn't make enough revenue to stay afloat I think

So in actuality, it is not anonymous then?  I'm all for having a government backed digital currency, as it makes for more liquid transactions, but I don't know how they are going to be able deal with cyber hackers and people that somehow lose access or brick their hardware.  I believe that might be some if the reason that this fell through, as the government/mint chip would have to take on a whole bunch of liabilities, or only be able to market this to the most tech savy or tech competent people.

Mines better 
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:55:34
I think they justify that as a "burn in period" to ensure that the miners work, not exactly ethical, but people are still buying from them, so why would they do otherwise?

Iceland actually has a pretty good technological infrastructure, along with cheap power produced by geothermal energy that they have access to.  Auroracoin had a somewhat decent chance at experimental adoption, as their population is relatively small at 300k+, and relatively well educated as their school system is pretty good.  They also were toying with adopting the canadian loon or the euro to replace their currency (kroot I believe).  Auroracoin as it is now is not the best way to distribute the coin, and I also believe that the creator was simply serving his/her self interest in creating it, but Iceland would be a pretty good place to try experimentally integrate crypto currency into the population, provided it has the support of the people and the government.  As it stands now, if aurora coin stays the same price and market cap (which it probably won't), it could potentially inject an  $80,000,000 into a relatively small population.

I have some questions,
1. Where are you based?
2. Why can we trust you?
3. How long does the sticker last, how many years is it guaranteed from fading?
4. Do you have a name or reputation on Bitcointalk?
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:19:05
Ok let's pool together and lowball them at 5 million sqtoshis each!
@_date: 2014-04-19 04:01:42
I feel as though that would be an extra layer of regulation by the canadian mint, with not much of a benefit necessarily for them.  If it works the way the post seems to suggest, wouldn't it be very easy to launder money through this system?

We already went to the moon in 1969, gotta aim for something higher.

I would argue that gold and Bitcoin are tokens

Casascius coins
@_date: 2013-10-15 00:53:35
So....like the euro?  Or the ECD?

The bot will comment and verify that you got the tip, also you have to accept it before it shows up in your account balance.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:37:21
Maybe they are jealous that they didn't get tipped...
@_date: 2013-10-29 18:27:31
Yes, but I didn't want to offend.
@_date: 2013-03-30 19:50:37
thank you!
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:06:34
To be fair, they do have more people!

I think that a government like China, Cuba or NK would have enough power to create their own government based alt coin, with government run miners.

I spent a summer in Beijing, and most bars I went had a different atmosphere then this- they were the same size, but had more of a different vibe.

If mBTC becomes the default currency, how will the network handle all these microtransactions?
@_date: 2013-08-16 18:40:25
Local bitcoins
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:45:12
The Hardware Wallets have to be relatively cheap too, or it might discourage newer people from jumping on.
@_date: 2013-03-31 00:51:10
Less overhead on producing currency, and less fear of counterfeit bills?  The government could also modify the protocol so that they could track transactions, which would be beneficial for a government that wants to keep track of its people...

wait I thought capital gains was 15%

Better to buy stock in satoshi dice than gamble on it
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:30:13
As bitcoin increases in value, the minimum transaction fee might be worth more in value, making smaller scale transactions more expensive to those making them; why couldn't other cryptocoins fill this void?
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:29:54
I would also argue the fact that our educational system doesn't have mandatory financial management classes back in high school may have played a role.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:19:07
I invested in Satoshi dice...unfortunately it wasn't the stock!
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:11:05
You could also offer to get a part time job to prove your confidence in the investment.

IDK man I lost 7 rolls in a row @ 50% on the martingale system...bad times.
@_date: 2013-03-17 02:00:51
I won 2 out of 10 times using the martingale system...suffice to say I have no more bitcoins :P
edit: 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:57:44
I feel like that would violate one of the fundamental mechanics of bitcoin :P

It is infintenately divisible, so the deflation aspect can be addressed if it becomes a problem.

If they act as BTC to fiat converters, they could still get some of the market share.
@_date: 2013-07-05 00:12:52
Interesting concept thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:10:09
Can anyone explain what happened for this transaction here?  Basically ate up the whole transaction in fees, and that was from a whole bunch of faucet clicks :(
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:46:26
It's more like things they need to know...for example, the driver's license test is supposed to make sure you have the rudimentary skills necessary to drive, but not many people like taking it.  Much in the same way, an educational course on how to manage your finances would help make sure you don't wreck yourself financially from predatory loans and the like.
