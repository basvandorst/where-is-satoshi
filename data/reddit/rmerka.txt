Let’s take the last 9 years and revisit that scenario.  I’d say it’s pretty much destroyed fiat and gold.  It’s easy to look at volatility in the short term and poo poo BTC but so for it’s done pretty good. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 12:49:50
Either find an OTC trade if it’s really large to avoid slippage or stick to P2P as bitcoin was intended to be.  localbitcoins may be a shit show but there are other options like Paxful and promising new ones on the horizon like localcoinswap.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:31:33
Well it’s volatile like any emerging market, but it has nearly a decade of growth that’s undeniable.  Literally millions of people globally are interested in it, it’s borderless, it’s not centrally controlled, you can control you’re funds completely without permission from your bank or government, the list could be very long.  You can choose to ignore it and you’ll likely be fine.  It may not be for you.  It might just be a trend like that wacky internet thing.  In the end you have to make your own choices.  Either you believe in the freedom that crypto currency brings or you prefer to be controlled by your bank.  Your choice.  Peace ✌️

When it happens slowly over time most people just complain and take their lumps.  Like the frog in the hot water analogy.  Inflation is a quiet hidden tax on the masses.  If it was sudden shock it would be quite devastating for the world as the USD is still held widely around the world along with bonds (treasury notes).  It’s one thing for a normal country to go haywire like Venezuela but for a major player like the USA, China, UK, Russia etc it would be bad.
@_date: 2018-08-07 18:50:01
TLDR: They don’t want it mineable so in other words government controlled, issued, and this devalued.

@_date: 2018-05-26 21:58:18
I get that.  But I only see the fiat currencies declining in value steadily until one day they reach the break/reset point.  The USD last reset in early 70s and has been on a steady decline ever since.  The Euro has been declining since inception and is still too young to hit a reset.  They are good for the immediate utility of spending but the have lost the attribute of “store of value” due to immense Government debts and need for these government’s to keep interest rates low so they don’t default.  So stable or just predictably declining?
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:29:42
I’m sorry you’re so butthurt about something.  Have no fucking idea what it is but you’re obviously upset.
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:19:27
Absolutely, it’s not a binary choice of you want the money or believe in the tech and value to society.  Both can happen.
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:20:04
Stable in relation to each other but all slowly and  steadily losing value in relation to actual goods and services.
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:31:48
I don’t disagree with a lot of what you’re saying but there’s an inherent unfairness in inflationary money is it takes a while for the money to trickle down to the little people.  Meanwhile the banks and elites get to use the new money while it still has value.  That is a BIG if on the wages but your savings are screwed at such meager interest rates.  Biggest problem I have is real inflation rates are being gamed by phony statistics that the feds put out to try and keep interest rates low at the same time. They win and we get hosed.

They control your money, you may think it’s yours but it’s only an unsecured loan to the bank and can easily be seized without any due process.
A decade of growth most definitely means something, it’s no guarantee of the future but it can be a good indicator.
There’s no guarantees in life bud, even your beloved Berkshire Hathaway could go under with little or no warning, just ask the folks over at Bear Stearns...
For someone who’s essentially written off a technology they don’t understand you sure seem to still have a lot of interest in it...
The value is in the network and the fact that is a decentralized and secure medium of exchange.  The argument your making that it doesn’t produce anything is fallacious.  Cellphones don’t produce anything either according to your logic yet they are useful and valuable.  Sure there is a much more popular vehicle for this in terms of fiat currency but it can most certainly fail you as well.  There are endless examples of this, the USD is no exception.  It has lost nearly 100% of it’s value in last century so as a store of value it’s a complete failure, much like your attempt to disparage something you obviously don’t understand.
IMO the elimination of governments controlling their citizens via the financial system is something the world (mostly those living under oppressed and corrupt governments) is something the world desperately needs.

I don’t agree with that at all.  Socialism as it’s generally thought of always relies on central authority to enforce “equality”. We’re not equal and we never ever ever will be.  We can have equal rights and protections but we are inherently unequal creatures, unless you believe of course that natural selection is a hoax.  I’m not trying to get into a political argument, but trying to glorify a philosophy of equality by combining vastly different philosophies and shoving the words together like the base of all societies is socialism is just crap to me.
Bitcoin is about as apolitical as it gets in terms of left vs. right.  It has nothing to do with socialism, equality, libertarianism, etc.  It’s simply about taking back control of money by making it peer to peer.  It’s been corrupted by over mining, exchanges, blah, blah but so what.  It’s essentially still just peer to peer cash.

For the most part, exactly as they do with precious metals.  Paper traded.  Only theres no alternative exchanges to set real buy sell prices like there is with crypto so they succeed with massive manipulation in regard to the metals.

Regardless, same amount of BTC mined on avg every 10 min no matter what.  But honestly even that should make no difference as the total amount forever is known.  In a rational market this would all be baked in to the price already.  But this market is being driven by irrationality.

Not necessarily, imagine you are a whale about to buy a large sum OTC to prevent slippage.  If you already had a large holding you could drop a bit to cause a flash crash and let the day traders do the rest.  A day or two later execute the OTC trade even a few points over market price.  It’s a possibility.
