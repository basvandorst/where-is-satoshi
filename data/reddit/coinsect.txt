No problems. If you have any more questions, please feel free to use the contact form on the site and let us know. Hope to see you trading in the marketplace.

For buyers and sellers, we have a dispute system which becomes active after 48 hours of the trade being started (the amount of time it can take for money to clear to someone's bank). We then intervene and ask for proof of payment so we can decide which party is not being truthful. If the buyer is found to have not paid, the trade is cancelled and re-listed. If the seller receives money and does not acknowledge it, and the buyer can prove they paid, we release the coins to the buyer.

 – That’s a really good question. We are a fully registered Australian business, founded and run by real people. We link our social media profiles, as well as even these reddit posts, so people can connect the dots of legitimacy.
We also show a record of past completed trades in the marketplace as a way of displaying a transparent trail of activity.
The reason CoinSect was originally created was to solve the problems that people face when dealing with exchanges – one of them being trust and legitimacy.
We’d be more than happy to answer any other questions you have, and would love you to start listing and try it out for yourself.
We’re not going anywhere.

 - We will be implementing Peercoin and Namecoin in the very near future.

 - To create a listing in the marketplace, you do need to deposit your coins first. Once your coins are confirmed, you have total control over them. When you create a listing, we automatically hold them securely in escrow while they are on the marketplace. When a buyer purchases them, you are in full control of when to release the coins out of escrow to the buyer. You will never lose your coins.
 - No one from Reddit has bought coins from CoinSect yet. Unsure why this thread was downvoted.

 - Spot on. You transfer your money to the sellers bank, while we hold their coins in escrow to make sure the sale is successful for both parties.
