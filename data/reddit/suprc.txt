Do you have a source for that?
I could only find a (not so reliable) source which said that roughly $560 million were printed every day, where a big percentage of those were to replace old bills. I also assume we're talking about both physical and digital created money here, or is that included in the term "printed"?

I *think* it removes a lot of legal issues if your wife/husband suddenly dies. So I would guess it's mostly about commitment and insurance.

I don't think LN will be the success that many hoped it would be, I expect the affect will be similar to the SegWit implementation. I also think Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin in the next 6 months and if that happens I believe it will be really though for Bitcoin to compete against third generation blockchains.
