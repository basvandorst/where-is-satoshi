What about tipping via email? Cc in changetip?

I'd like to be able to tip via email (by cc to changetip). Any chance of adding that in the future?

I can't ever imagine it being very secure. At best it is only as secure as the ability to impersonate someone on the least secure site you use it on.

Same thoughts here. If it's anything like last year, we're in for a wild ride

Perhaps the US is selling the bitcoins they seized from illegal activities like silk road. Apparently they have something like $25 million worth.

Nobody is getting a million dollars. The entire project has only ever received a few thousand - very little if you consider the man hours needed to make this. 
If there's more money, more people can afford to focus on it and still eat.

Tipping has changed the mood.

At least with NAB, it might be expensive, but for that you can trust that it will actually work. Going to a conference in India, a certain UK bank charged me 20 pounds for sending the money, and an extra charge to cover any extra fees. Then when I got there (to India), I discovered the money had never come through at all, and I had to pay. When I got back to the UK, I went to the bank. They insisted I must have filled out the form wrongly. So I asked to see the form... they made me come back another day and after a lot of wasted time, it became apparent they'd completely lost the form.
Of course, if more people used Bitcoin, it would cost virtually nothing, you could send it instantly from your mobile, it would be no paperwork at all, and you'd have a guarantee the transaction had gone through...

It's an interesting time but sovereign states are more than a mint. Immigration, tax, roads, schools, hospitals, social security, laws keeping us safe from criminals...

A better coin.
