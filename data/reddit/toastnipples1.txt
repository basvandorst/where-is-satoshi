I'm not savvy enough to trace a wallet to an identity IRL either, but I am savvy enough to know to take anything the SPLC says with a huge pink boulder of Himalayan rock salt.

You realize saying something like that is the equivalent of running around downtown with a sandwich board that says, "Don't take me seriously, I'm a political hack."

Well consider that rapid movement won't get him too excited, so he's liable to have some staying power.

"Buying near the ATH is very risky, and while it can be correct/profitable, it puts you on the wrong footing. You need to buy low and sell high to make money."
Oh shit! 
Spread the word boys. It's that simple!

"TA has undeniably been proven to work, and create profits, when applied correctly."
no. 
Really loving the "when applied correctly" qualifier setting up unfalsifiability

If we had bad news, some negative change in real use case/value, a dip wouldn't bother me. 
That's why other dips haven't bothered me and I've been hodling since jan 2014. 
Irrationality bothers me. And irrationality is king right now. 
If some idiots setting up bots based on Fibonacci figures are more important to the price than the real value, something is horrifically wrong.

I got locked out once and it took me about 2 emails and 3 days to get back full functionality. 
Sucks about what happened to you though.

Good news galore, yet the speculators who control the price are still operating on their bullshit metrics. 
Crypto is dead until these people are taken out of the equation.

I'm finally starting to see actual red, and it sucks. I never put in enough to ruin me or even influence my lifestyle if it goes 0. 
Stay strong amigo.

The price dropping isn't some big conspiracy. People are frightened and fleeing. Like the last time BTC got big mainstream exposure (late 2013), people jumped on, boosted the price, and the stagnation that followed was epic and long lasting because those who had been burned were skeptical about coming back. This time that skepticism is going to be much more widespread. Bitcoin has, in the culture, become synonymous with crash, failure, irrationality. It's the end.
Only way I'm able to stay sane through this is to psychologically treat my BTC 'investment' as a 100% loss. 
Don't know what level of insanity I'd be at right now if I hadn't been able to convince myself of that in a moment of clarity. 
That being said, I'm still HODLing my &gt;20 BTC because I'm a sucker for small bits of hope.

so much good news yet the price keeps on droppin, droppin, droppin 
irrational market 
i'm hodling a lot of BTC but we are nowhere near where we need to be until valid reasons, not technical analysis bots with their fibonacci magic bullsh** dictate the price. 
I guess if you're a potential buyer that is encouraging as it indicates you can still early adopt. 
F*** this market though. Seriously.
