mtgox can't handle the volume.
the populace can't contain themselves.
Bitcoin suffers. 
Bitcoin is looking for real and meaningful progress not speculative action.

Even if bitcoin were to dominate the planet and somehow represent the wealth of the entire planet then the illusive and theoretical Mr 25% could not be anything like the House of Rothschild.
First of all the House of Rothschild is valuated around ~$500T/USD so first trillionaire thing is out the window and you can call the House of Rothschild "Mr. 50%" because the earth is valuated at $1Q/USD (quadrillion($1.4Q with interest (because we borrowed it from them)))
Anywho Unless "Mr. 25%" was a representative of the House of Rothschild (scary thought) then, and only then, could the theoretical Mr. 25% have any sort of effect on society as the House of Rothschild. 
thank you for hearing my humble opinion.

unit price of silver is low. 
unit price of bitcoin gold and platinum is high.
silver is the poor man's gold. 
who cares if it's useless! " I BELIEVE" lol...
Its not useless, its got "voodoo".
Silver wards away bacteria and virus, hence the "silver" ware. 
Old timey values fall by the way side and high tec voodoo steps in on sunny days.
point is, it's useful while it's there, like bitcoin.
Anywho welcome to the club sis boom rah careful, hackers can steel your bit coin as fast as your silver can be pilfered by a cat burglar, if not faster.

If BFL ships our orders before difficulty exceeds 30mil I think it could be an amazing investment.
10 bitcoin at $40 a share is a great investment.
But I feel like the offer BFL has now is horribly thought out.

Now in the news folks like Hugo Rifkind who interviewed on Inside Story a debate hosted by Al J. are saying "the value of Bitcoin has been been bouncing around wildly [since original issuance.]"
Especially in regards to the DDoS attacks on site MTGOX wednesday and the market action which followed.
Because MTGOX controls 80% or so of the Bitcoin public trading Bitcoin quickly inflated to $140 from $115 and then returned quickly there after.
I do not believe there ever was a drop in value because I knew that MTGOX was down and value would be artificially inflated by the temporary scarcity and then alleviated when MTGOX returned.
Folks like Hugo Rifkind spoke of the event like the value of the Bitcoin had faltered and the intrinsic value of the currency had dropped.
On the contrary the currency had run into NO integral issues.
The currency was fine and steady in its presentation (as always).

My opinion is that since there's a Rothschild on the Board of Trustees then facebook prolly might wait until you've finished your independent application and then after your finished grinning about your accomplishment change the site to deny your new bitcoin application.
Why? just a hunch you might say...

Fear is the mind killer.
I spoke with some folks about bitcoin, friends and family. These folks could go on tv and seem normal and as a whole i feel like represent a fair demographic of people in USA, white,black,latino.
the whole concept of currency is highly misunderstood. Even 4 year graduates and upper middle class adults couldn't express a full understanding of what a currency is/what our currency is/or of the types of currencies which have existed in the past. *beads*(my favorite). usually this subject matter is way over the heads of the average american and they usually respond one of two ways: unfortunately they often say "[Bitcoin] will end with a bust" or "[you] will get busted for using it." I doubt either.
I feel as if when I show people Bitcoin that I'm showing them a path to sovereignty, the key to the freedom, thier wildest dreams, but they shrug at it and go back to being what they are, fiat people.  
It is said people can not handle the responsibilities of being sovereign. I do not believe those who claim to hold sovereignty to be able to handle it either. 
I do believe that Bitcoin gives us, the global community a chance to get it right. 
right now its like looking at a piece of the future. It's out of context. 
Eat Breath Sleep Bitcoin.

If it's not considered currency then how can it be taxed? which is it folks? trust your instinct.

a personalized form of checks and balances. 
Any financial code and or law relating to crimes you can do with money, (making purchases of and or illicit/ly) 
with the help of a few nifty tactics
can be rebalanced at the wim of the bitcoin holder.
we all talk as if governments really hold the power, we are the government and we obviously bow to a higher power and we know it but we refuse to look it in the eye and call it what it is. 
we are debt slaves and the bitcoin frees our shackles. 
fiat pyramid casino ponzi ransom war slaves
and bit coin is the only thing that makes sense in this twisted world.

I doubt bitcoin tax dodging has to do with regulation of the currency itself.

I feel as if author addresses extremity in success celebration and suggests to fringe to hedge exclamation.
but there is a middle ground a path of humble expression of happiness and fortuity. fortuitousness comes in sweet spots much like in the electronic performance devices.  
I feel as if author warns the vocal fringe not to derelict the movement like Tiger Woods his career.

I will not attest to the cause or motives to the attacks on Bitcoin trading network  because I had nothing to do with it.
I did witness it though.
Now in the news folks like Hugo Rifkind who interviewed on Inside Story a debate hosted by Al J. are saying "the value of Bitcoin has been been bouncing around wildly [since original issuance.]"
Especially in regards to the DDoS attacks on site MTGOX wednesday and the market action which followed.
Because MTGOX controls 80% or so of the Bitcoin public trading Bitcoin quickly inflated to $140 from $115 and then returned quickly there after.
I do not believe there ever was a drop in value because I knew that MTGOX was down and value would be artificially inflated by the temporary scarcity and then alleviated when MTGOX returned.
Folks like Hugo Rifkind spoke of the event like the value of the Bitcoin had faltered and the intrinsic value of the currency had dropped.
On the contrary the currency had run into NO integral issues.
The currency was fine and steady in its presentation (as always).
Now, Availability of Bitcoin has to do with usage of the currency and that is a user issue.
The value of the coin did not really enjoy a sustained heightening due to lack of availability and it returned to it's rightful value as a climbing currency/commodity at the pace at which the market allows naturally and harmoniously.
Hey movie buffs,
Remember in the latest bond how the hacker dude listed his schemes to bond and he said he had manipulated currencies, well Bitcoin is really wide open to hacker manipulation as if we didn't already know that.
But let me just finish by saying
No one in the media community really expressed my thoughts on the subject.
I thought that I had not seen any media personnel eloquently put what happened to the Bitcoin market value during and after the DDoS attack on the MTGOX Bitcoin trading site in those concepts so I thought I would try.
God Bless Us Every One.
