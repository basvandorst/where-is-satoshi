Someone should make a Bitcoin meme of that 'this guy forks' and Photoshop the Bitcoin symbol over it

When I move to warmer climates I got a nice old boxster just for the convertible. Enjoy!! Best decision. Money means nothing, get enough to survive then enjoy your life!

Thanks for the explanation! Got a trezor on the way but might try a desktop wallet until it arrives. Does coinbase charge a fee to transfer between wallets?

What the euro did for Europe, Bitcoin could do for the world.

Feckers catch you for everything haha. Is there a more efficient method of growing then buying on coinbase then transferring to hard wallet. Maybe a exchange you can send direct ? Still researching ! Ty!

Censorship of any kind goes against the open source principals that make crypto so appealing. Aside from scaling it's probably the biggest red flag of bitcoin to date
