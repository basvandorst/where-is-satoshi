Bitfinex had about $38M, and about 24K BTC margin funding outstanding. That's about $52M worth totally. Plus an unknown amount of BTC and USD that was not margined. Considering 120K BTC ( $70M+) was stolen, it looks pretty fucking dire for people (like me), who lent both BTC &amp; USD. 
The best would be if some outside investors would bail out Bitfinex customers with fresh money, in exchange for equity in the company.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:34:26
I did some quick calculations, and to me Bitfinex's annual revenue looks more like $20M. This was assuming the published volume figures (about 10M BTC) need to be multiplied by 2 (buyer and seller), assuming a very generous BTC price of $600, and an average commission rate of 0.15%. The swaps don't bring in much, maybe 1 million. Interest gained on their USD balances, $5M tops. 
That BFXCoin scheme could work if they a) came up with a credible wallet security, and b) BTC price would skyrocket, offsetting their losses in volume and customer funds. Without an injection of funds from outside and/or BitGo absorbing a part of the hit, things look bleak, though.
The delta between their advertised security and their actual security was huge. Even with people like me, who have had a very positive view of the company, they now have a huge mountain to climb. They are/were very good with UI design, bringing in constant improvements etc. Unfortunately this professionalism did not extend to wallet security.

In Europe it is possible (depending on your bank) to send money for free from one country to other. Banks do not consider those zero fee transactions spam, but apparently bitcoin is different.

This is the area, belonging to Ukraine, occupied and controlled by Russian government and military. I doubt their initiative will make much of a splash there, but it is surely a good way to try to gain publicity and legitimacy for the illegal, self-proclaimed "Donetsk People's Republic".

Add me to your list of shills. 9 days and 100K+ BFX tokens. I think people are being overly emotional and overreacting. Especially people selling their tokens at 30% face value, will likely regret it later. 
If Bitfinex bought their own tokens (moral hazard, I know), they would soon be out of the jungle. At $20-30M, the loss becomes much more manageable and opens them other alternatives.

It is nice they have *"multiple access controls, mantraps, guards and surveillance system"* in three continents. However, when a need arises to move coins from deep cold storage, they need to inform people holding the keys. This was supposedly Bitfinex's downfall, as they used an API for that, and for changing withdraw limits. A more low-tech solution would actually have been more secure, such as communicating via Skype (or rather [Zyptonite]( face-to-face. I don't know how Xapo handles the 3/5 multisig, but usually there's a weak spot somewhere.

Still, it was not too much to ask for, to keep a human in the loop. Now they likely had everything automated via an API, BitGo at the other end just blindly robosigning.

As far as I know, only venture capitalists have been able to invest in BTC exchanges. If the tokens can be converted to shares in iFinex, that could be potentially an interesting product for ordinary investors. Requires transparency from Bfx, though.
What I secretly hope is, that an investor such as Li Ka-shing (investor in BitPay) would jump in at the opportunity, and make the customers whole in exchange for a stake in the company.

If they manage to convince their customers about their security, some volume will come back. Even some of those who withdrew today, might rethink.
Before the hack, Bitfinex was a great place to trade. Regaining customer conficence would, IMO, require them to be more open about the hack, their financial situation and their plan forward. 
One possibility/opportunity would be to convert BFX tokens to equity in iFinex with a good rate. This would incentivize the clients, give them a reason to stay and trade. Even better would be to given them a choice between making them whole, and equity.

When GUYS decide they've had enough, one way to do the transition is to declare, 'All notes issued by our central bank, will be exchanged to a new currency'. So, if you had e.g. lots of Italian euro notes, those would be converted to new liras, and you could lose some value overnight.
Similarly, if X decides to leave, it is unlikely the Bundesbank will convert euros issued by e.g. the Central Bank of Greece into new Deutschmarks.
By 'leaving' I mean quitting the euro, not necessarily quitting as a member of the EU.

Let's say I shorted the 100 BTC at $1150. I will set an order to buy back those 100 BTC, if the market hits $1250. This will limit my loss, hence it is called "stop loss order". 
Triggering stop loss orders means somebody with lots of money pushes the market upwards, with an intention  to get those dormant orders to the market.
So let's say the guy buys enough bitcoins so that the market rises to $1250. There my stop loss order to buy 100 BTC will automatically enter the market. When lots of orders are triggered, lots of buys enter the market, pushing the price higher. He can the sell his coins to me and others, at a profit.
I already deleted my reply because I thought the others already did a good job in explaining the mechanism.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:44:56
A decision was made to pump up the price, to trigger all stop loss orders. Orderbooks were probably thinner than usual, as everybody was waiting for the SEC announcement. Well played.

I hope the letter was just posturing, and the exchanges will call the post-split winner bitcoin, whichever party comes out on top. Otherwise there is a risk of bitcoin brand value taking a potentially fatal hit.
From this POV it is a bit odd that e.g. Bitfinex signed without reservations, even though they stand to lose big if the unlimited comes out on top, but the industry calls it something else than bitcoin. An altcoin exchange like Poloniex might even benefit from the suicide of bitcoin with its developers, miners &amp; exchanges.

Good thinking, though a few months of lower volatility convinces neither a statistician nor a SEC bureaucrat. Moreover, that ETF moonshot itself would kick the volatility off the charts in a way the Chinese speculators couldn't.

Having said that, PBOC and other central banks are fighting against windmills here. Bitcoin is on the way to becoming a new asset class, with or without the Chinese.
Strangely enough, the PBOC created perfect conditions for Chinese capital flight. As btc is now cheaper in China, they get paid to move money out of China.

@_date: 2017-04-24 12:04:15


I am going to argue just that. A centralized exchange is better from privacy POV, because the volume stays hidden in the exchange. The officials could request info, but for that they would need to suspect there's an account. Contrast this to a decentralized setup, where the officials see the client's full activity from his bank account, which is subject to routine monitoring anyway. 
Decentralized is better from security POV, centralized from privacy POV.
Still, trading at a centralized exchange that is registered *in your country*, is bad from privacy POV. The U.S. is somewhat a special case, because it both monitors its own exchanges (Coinbase, Gemini), and also actively goes after U.S. citizens' info abroad. If I were a U.S. citizen, I would consider an offshore company.

IF they learnt their lesson regarding security, after paying this $70M tuition fee, they could potentially be stronger than before. Seeing how much volume Poloniex generates, I kinda wish Bitfinex would introduce more alts - Monero at least.

Bitfinex does not have your money, the hacker(s) do. The situation is more like somebody steals 36.067% of the contents of your wallet, which you left inside your mommy's car. Your mommy tells she will pay you back in small installments, if you promise to be patient. She has already paid you two installments, and has offered you other options, such as getting out of trouble with 14.1% total loss (BFX token at 0.6), or converting that lost money into an ownership in family business. That could actually bring you net profit over time.
You, of course, have the option of being a whiny bitch, and recruiting a neighborhood bully to "talk" with your mom. But she still does not have your money (the hackers do), and the bully takes a heavy fee. Financially this is the worst option for you, but it may give you some emotional satisfaction, depending on your level of butthurt.

The best location for mining would be a cold climate country with dirt cheap electricity. Good infrastructure, but low wages. India only has low wages. Apparently China is as good as it gets.

My country (in Northern Europe) had police investigate OneCoin, but they could not do anything, as no laws were broken. OneCoin is basically selling an 'educational package'.
