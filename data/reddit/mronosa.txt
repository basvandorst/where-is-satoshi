Yay! This post is relevant again!

I like this idea. I have used video games to explain Bitcoin before, though. I said, "You know how in sci fi games, everyone in the entire Galaxy use credits as their currency? Bitcoin is like that. A global currency that mostly everyone can use."

I have a Samsung Gear S2. How do I use Bitcoin to buy a better smartwatch?

On the plus side, your explanation was spot on. I tend to either over explain it or under explain it

I am not really into EA, personally. Not my type.

You determine what you offer as the transfer fee. A higher fee means you're more likely to make the next block. So, they probably offered double the going rate to be sure to get in.

Transfer fees are determined by size of cake?

I suppose a better question might be this: how exactly does a transfer get executed? Clearly, higher rates mean faster transfers, but why?

Ah but you see... The calculator will also hold it's value. Because for some reason, 20 year old technology is still worth €50 even today!

I came here to suggest the same thing. Many wallets default to different measurements, so a quick conversation on screen would be handy.

Storing your private keys on a physical cold storage wallet is the best way to make sure your coins are under your protection. It's the least likely way to get tricked out of your coins (but be [careful as it has happened before](
If you leave your coins on an exchange... they will probably be fine. They will likely be even safer there than if you managed your coins yourself unless you are very, very careful and take extra measures to backup your private keys securely.
But, if there is a huge hack or if the exchanges disappear, then you will have no way to get your coins back, because they hold the private keys. It has happened before in the early days of crypto.

[This video]( will help explain the risk in a simple to understand way. Plus it has cats, so that's a win in and of itself.

Did it work out? You should be about $100 richer right now. Here's hoping!

Yes. And this isn't the first time the twins tried and failed to get this done. This would be a huge step for crypto in general. ETFs are huge in the investing world, plus it's a stamp of approval from a financially stable standpoint. The twins have put lots and lots of time and money into this. Once it's finally approved, the value will skyrocket!  
Chapter 15 of __Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond by Jack Tatar, Chris Burniske__ explains the importants really well.

Well, I give it money and it stays safe until I need it back. Seems traditional to me.

The seed word list is commonly known. In fact, their mobile wallet already has this feature. 
It's not hiding the words that gives it strength. It's the number of words. The total combination of all the words is... humongous.

I agree with your points. And I do not think modern banks are inherently a scam. However, I do see that Bitcoin provides a way to store money safely without the need for banks. If someone feels fractional reserve banking and the like is ludicrous, Bitcoin is a valid alternative, which is nice.
