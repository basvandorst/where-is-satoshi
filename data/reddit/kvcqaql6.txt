You mean alternative perspectives, not alternate perspectives.

Clearly. The number of people lining up to pay tax on crypto gains is astonishing.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:03:21
That 2 week rule is BS that keeps on being repeated. Your transaction could stay in the mempool forever. Maybe someone out there keeps on rebroadcasting your it. Your options are: (i) wait indefinitely; (ii) RBF; (iii) CPFP; or (iv) double-spend. I chose option (iv) recently. The specifics of your situation will guide your choice.

Me too. I like using BIP38 encrypted paper wallets. I think that they are secure. I like having more direct control over my coins. It has been nice to claim fork coins easily.
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:14:57
Oh course. Sensible comment! Others don't seem to understand that demand will respond to increased availability.
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:35:09
What the hell are you talking about? It's almost completely steady! Sure zoom out to the turbulence about a month ago but there's nothing much happening now. What the fuck is wrong with you?
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:46:05
Silly guy. I feel sorry for him though. Hosting crypto takes vigilance.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:23:24
Bither allows sweeping of BCD now? It didn't yesterday. I'll check again now.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:31:03
Has anyone tried this yet? Why is the file size so large?
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:39:20
It sure is. Segwit is great for hot wallets. For cold storage (a fair few coins sitting unmoved for years), there's no problem with using legacy addresses.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:55:54
What will happen? You won't be able to create a transaction without inputs that equal the outputs plus the miner's fee. Is that what you're asking?
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:49:30
I just don't believe you.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:41:48
How about a link to a silent animated gif instead of stupid Twitter.
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:37:08
The fuck are you taking about? The mempool had been steady for near on a week now. Check Johoe's stats you wanker.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:37:27
Aaaaand... The post is removed.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:06:36
Coinb.in might fit the bill for you.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:39:01
Well, I stand corrected. Have an upvote! Bither and Bitpie combo works now for BCD.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:04:49
GAS uses a different protocol to BTC. Because of this, but cannot be moved into a BTC wallet. You need a wallet that is designed to handle GAS. NEON Wallet for Windows, Mac or Linux will probably fit the bill for you.
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:06:46
Paper wallet! Use paper wallets! Complete, transparent control over your keys. Claim all forks.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:36:11
I don't think that it's difficult. For those that would like to try using a paper wallet, this is a useful guide:
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:06:07
Coinbase have truckloads of cash. They're not orchestrating a rise in transaction costs to stay afloat. Take a breath.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:36:00
I see two recent deposits to your address have been confirmed. Geez, overreact a bit?
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:15:40
Exactly! The mempool has been steady for near on a week now.
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:38:03
There is bitcore.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:51:35
The same thing happened to me. I double-spent and blockchain.info still reports the superseded transaction. It's no big deal but I do wonder why.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:27:59
Oh, is there an easier way? I don't have much experience with Linux.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:42:59
Why do people pay off student loans for their sons and daughters? Can't they pay their own debts?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:02:49
I hope that he didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:07:53
Last sentence: Cryptocurrency indeed will change the world, but Bitcoin may not see at.
What the fuck is this guy trying to say?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:03:29
Why do you care?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:23:18
If exchanges loan out bitcoin, is it possible that they will start to offer interest on your holdings with them?
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:57:51
I followed the link and the table is accurate.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:47:16
He keeps asking people. It comes off as a bit rude. I guess that he's asking because you're trading in hundreds of dollars in bitcoin instead of much larger amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:08:29
Total dick move! You owe her the 100 mBTC that she bought from you, OP.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:19:42
Do you save money by sending to Segwit addresses or from them?
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:25:41
ING seems fine.
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:23:50
I dunno what that guy is on about. What a strange comnent. It's a bit early for integrating LN yet. Segwit, though, can be done.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:21:27
Yeah, there's a surprising eagerness to contribute to government revenue from bitcoin redditors. I think that they are actually resentful of big gains and like to see successful investors hand over a big chunk of change "for the common good", in which they see themselves benefiting.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:16:29
Why would they but bitcoin to short it later? To short, you sell first and then buy. (Usually, sell borrowed instrument and buy to replace it.) It doesn't make sense to buy now to short bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:19:01
Wrong! Bitcoin's current price is not over $19k. NEXT!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:27:18
If you want to but this with bitcoin but you've already read it, send it to me!
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:10:23
Exactly. So the latest increase in demand that has driven prices up is not caused by speculators looking to short bitcoin, right? Buying is the last thing they do, preferably after prices have dropped.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:25:45
Here's a link to the latest chart. The money supply has grown little since 2013.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:54:32
Not as harsh as I thought.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:30:26
I would buy a 1980s car with zero miles for its original price!
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:22:22
Yeah, frigging around with the fees and transferring portions back into fiat would be a big nuisance.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:29:16
What's your strategy?
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:24:51
I held on to just over half of my coins. Bitcoin had grown to be such a large portion of my savings that I was overdue for rebalancing. Maybe I don't have the nerve to be all in at this time. I recall the value of my bitcoin portfolio evaporating after the run up in late 2013. I couldn't bear to see it happen again, albeit at the risk of sacrificing some serious gains if the exchange rate continues to improve.
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:38:30
Yes, I had this happen to me. It was really annoying! The low-fee transaction was still lingering on some nodes after a fortnight. I was able to create and broadcast a doublespend using Electrum. The new, higher-fee transaction was accepted into a block almost immediately. Blockchain.info is schizophrenic about the transaction, though. It recognizes the transaction when you search for it using the transaction ID. It won't acknowledge it in the balance of the receiving address though, presumably because it conflicts with the "first-seen", low-fee transaction. Get with the program already, Blockchain.info, if it's in the blockchain it counts! Anyway, the persistence of that low-fee transacting was really annoying. I'll never know who the jerk was that kept broadcasting it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:41:11
Geez, that show looks like garbage.

That's not what the graphic here is showing.

I don't think that's how Google works any more.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:10:34
Isn't this obvious? What's wrong with this guy?
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:54:44
Retain the private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:45:25
What's your goal? This guide showed up earlier for using coinb.in: 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:00:28
You know that it's easy to avoid taxation on bitcoin gains, right? You know that tying addresses to real identities with reasonable certainty can be very difficult? You know that you can create a new address or collections of addresses at any time?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:17:59
HitBTC and Bitfinex
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:33:08
Some of those shitcoins have done alright.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:11:12
That website doesn't work.
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:39:26
Damn, I hadn't even thought of that.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:52:39
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:11:24
Reminds me of Boris Grischenko.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:04:45
There is no valid proof. The scammer's receiving addresses could actually be controlled by OP and there's no way to prove that they aren't.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:15:22
This dope then sent his btc back to the same address that he just shared with the scam website. Silly. Silly. Silly.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:04:44
It's not convincing to anyone. How can he prove that he doesn't control the receiving addresses? He can't.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:06:22
You can't prove bitcoin loss.
@_date: 2018-03-10 08:00:31
Fraudulent credit transactions are reversed. Vendor loses. It's different.
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:42:04
A fin? I'll forgive typos in the comments but for fuck's sake, please check your title posts.
@_date: 2018-03-10 07:59:02
He can't. The receiving addresses could be under his control. Prove they aren't!
