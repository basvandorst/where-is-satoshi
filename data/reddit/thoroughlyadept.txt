Did I say anything regarding this? All I said was that the withdrawals were temporarily down. What are you telling me this for?

Mixin 3 is the minimum amount they you should use I believe, therefore the default yes. There isn't a defined limit to the # of mixin a user can use per transaction, they can use a mixin of even 1,000 and more if they want as well.

Or BTC-E, doesn't matter the exchange. As long as your identity is tied to the bitcoin -&gt; fiat transaction, you can bet your bottom dollar that the police will be coming after you.

They were temporarily down.

Tumble the coins and do what, receive other people's tainted coins in the process? Tumbling/using mixers is only good for small amounts of coins at a time, use large amounts and there's a high chance you'll get your own coins back(ruining the entire point of tumbling and making it much easier for anyone tracking you).

Not true. For example, as of right now, there may be potential clients for a system that "finds" people on the blockchain, such as what Chainanaylsis partly accomplished. I mean, who wouldn't want to find out the identities of people behind bitcoin addresses? Especially if they scammed someone ; reward.

I'm not sure where trolling comes into this. I'm talking about the coins technology, not attitudes of some of it's members. Attitude of a few people has nothing to do with a coin's success, it is open-source. That's like saying Linux has stuck up members, and because of that it's going to fail. 
Also, some critics of Cryotonote ring up Bloat in their accusations. Here's the problem, Satoshi himself even envisioned that most of the full nodes will become run by miners, so regular users wont have to download the full blockchain. That goes for Bitcoin and cryptonote currencies, thus, the blockchain and bloat is almost a non-subject. It's useless to even bring that up as a "fault", becuase most users wont be downloading the blockchain, making the issue of bloat almost irrelevant.

Damn well? If you mean it works like a leaking pike with layers of ducktape over it, sure.

Almost irrelevant. Contrary to what some fanatic daytraders say, Darkcoin still uses coinjoin and the anonymity it offers in security(Masternode network)/privacy of transactions is sub-par to what's offered by Cryptonote/Zerocash. It shouldn't even be a contender in the "anonymous coin race".

You go right  ahead and do that, then cash out through Coinbase or Circle, you'll be sure to hear the police knocking on your doors soon enough.

Such a thing is only possible if the mixin is say, 2. It's "impossible" if you use a mixin of say 10, or 50. 
The situation of a users co-operation with deanonymizing is mostly theoretical however(It's like asking anyone who ever received a tainted 1 dollar USD bill to name the person who gave it to them, in order to catch the culprit who tainted it in the first place.  Pretty inaccuate method). I personally, do not see the appeal of Zerocash, yes it's anonymous, but "too anonymous", to it's own detriment. These are cryptocurrencies were dealing with, not centralized fiat, so you still need some transparency.
