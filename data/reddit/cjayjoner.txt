Yeah if it would ever verify my identity I have uploaded 19x, wtf is going on hurry up.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:17:38
Super interesting.

Didnt he go to jail for not verifying something to do with someone using his service for silk road? Not too envious of this guy tbh.

WhT else is there to talk about aside from bitcoin and programming it’s so interesting.

Course regulation will come just a question of how long...very exciting stuff! Wish Coinbase would verify my identity it’s been a week!
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:00:36
The funniest thing ever.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:05:44
Why not maybe? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:29:15
I think so. Not sure, there’s a documentary on amazon prime about Bitcoin with a segment on him.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:06:46
That’s just bitcoin right? Not alt coin?

Sentiment over, now it’s bearish, wait back to bullish.

Considering how all the time share sales are for puerto Vallarta I’d assume they’d have touristy type stuff there...
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:41:47
Good let it drop so we can buy.

I just switched to circle k coffee and saving cup for $1 refills I feel very savvy at this point with financial decisions.

Response to bot quote made it seem like not to associate malice with ignorant actions seemed counter intuitive . 
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:47:24
But it always moves...
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:27:57
Just my thoughts. I try not to assume. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:57:55
Obv a cold wallet never an exchange but keep in mind if you haven’t spent 1k or more I wouldn’t bother 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:24:14
So ignorance is bliss? And being negligent is acceptable? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:22:33
Oh really ? Did qrs get on board with fks then campaigned to skas to get denied by hdh. When people use industry jargon to sound cool...ugh. I get it’s reddit but wat the fuj r u saying

I have a French press. I’m making progress! Z
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:55:57
Just my point of view seems just as valid as a response to anyone else.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:42:25
I would have to be dead or incapacitated to not buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:42:27
Lol they say it maybe inc speed by 1sec which solves no real issue...
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:37:53
Better info on Reddit anyways. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:53:29
