Actually, you are being bullish if you borrow fiat. If you are borrowing BTC, you are usually bearish because you are trying to short. Let's say you have 1BTC. If you sell it outright at 4000 USD, if the price goes down to 3900, you can buy your 1BTC back at 3900 and have 100 USD extra. If you do a short, you can sell 4BTC at 16000 USD and when it goes down to 3900, you would buy back the 4BTC, pay back the loan and you would still have your 1BTC and profit 400USD. My examples do not include the fees that incur with these transactions, but you would still profit if the price went down.

Here is an example of a recent flash crash.
This happened on GDAX though, which does not offer margin trading.
Another risk you face in margin lending, is the same risk involved in keeping your coins on the exchange. Last year, I lost BTC and USDT (Tether) when Bitfinex got hacked and they made everyone take a socialized loss. An exchange can also be shut down, such as the case of BTC-E recently. There are also several examples of exchanges becoming insolvent and shutting their doors. (ie Mt Gox, Cryptsy, several others.)

The basic concept is this. Let us say that you have enough to buy 1 BTC. If you buy the 1BTC outright and the price goes up $100.00USD and you sell, you profited $100. Now let's say that you bought on margin instead. (went long.) With the USD you borrowed, you can now buy 4BTC. When the price goes up by 100.00 per BTC, and you close your position, you now profited $400USD rather than just the $100USD. Of course, if the price went down $100.00 you would lose 4X as much with a long position on Bitfinex..

I think Slush pool and probably F2pool are good bets. However, my suggestion to rent hash will probably end up making you loose BTC. If you don't already have your own ASIC, you should probably just have a cool off period for a while. You may also consider lending your BTC on Poloniex. You won't get the S2X, since Poloniex policy is to give the forked coins to the lendee. (At least that is how it went with the Bitcoin Cash Fork.) However, people were trying to exploit this before the Bitcoin Cash fork and the lenders were getting compensated with 5% per day. (Poloniex didn't sign the NYA, from what I understand, so they probably will be supporting the original chain.)

Having your BTC stored with any method where you are in full control of your private keys is good. Your hardware wallet is probably ideal, since the vendor is likely to eventually come up with an easy method to split your coins. I am just hoping this "fork" plays out just like Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited. Only difference with this S2x fork is that they made an "agreement" and are signaling. Plus they have a definite target block on when it will actually commence,  so the miners may be more emboldened to actually go through with the fork.

AFAIK, there is no strong replay protection for the impending fork implemented by either side. So if that situation remains the same, splitting the coins is going to be tricky. If you want to be guaranteed acquiring coins on the proper chain, the safest way is to mine them with a pool that will absolutely be mining on the chain you want. These fresh coins cannot be replayed. Don't have a miner or want to spend a premium on rented hash? Best wait until everything gets sorted out.

It's down. Probably expired SSL ticket, so CloudFlare won't let anyone through.

They probably have not even submitted the transaction to the bitcoin network yet, since they are experiencing a 12 hour delay. Unfortunately, you will have to hurry up and wait. Hope you can get your coins back.

How long ago did you do the transaction? Coinbase is experiencing delays of up to 12 hours for withdrawals at the moment.

Coinbase usually gives you the opportunity to withdraw your Bitcoins when they close your account.
