Wasn't it in the 700's last December? Or was that the year before?

As long as I can continue to buy Amazon gift cards through gyft for bitcoin, the end point of purchase is irrelevant to me. It would slightly simplify things, but by refusing bitcoin, amazon is enabling the gyft bitcoin space to succeed.

You're right. I'm not seeing this in the blockchain. I sent from coinbase, it is saying complete, so it has to have verifications, no? I'm wondering if I fat fingered something.

What if I wanted someone to go pay my electricity bill and deliver me the payment receipt? Would this be viable?
