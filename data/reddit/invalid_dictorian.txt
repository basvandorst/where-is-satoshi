Cheap or the most expensive bitcoin out there? Because since you can't get it out, it's whatever price / 0 BTC. So infinite cost.

Hey Buddy, hang in there.
I lost a huge chunk of of cash a few years ago in the stock market from a bad investment. About $450,000. I'm still here and working really hard to earn it back. The world is not over and I thanked my wife for being supportive and not to blame me, even though it was my greed that caused it.
You stay fit, happy, and strong. Remember that there's more to life than money, and many things to enjoy.

This may prevent selling by existing holders, but if potential buyers knows they can't sell (after buying), then it will also prevent them from buying.

First rule of winning the lottery is to tell no one.
Hardest part is to not brag about it.
OP is here to brag about it. Big idiot. Chances are some here will recognize him. That's where things go down hill.
