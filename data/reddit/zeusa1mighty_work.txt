Valid point.  Truly anonymous would never be connected to your personal information to begin with.  Even a mixing site could keep records of your purchases.

Wow this is crazy.  Isn't this the 3rd time?  Seems like maybe a complete IT restructuring is called for here...

How about caps?  Anything caps?  Or for instance, one question is about Joshua building something in the desert.  But it has multiple names.  Or the swords and spears - I've heard two different names used.  and as for the celebrations, the only thing I can get even close to is birthdays, but it never says they are bad, just that a lot of people think there is a negative connotation to them. 
I love this idea, I just think it needs a little more structure, a set of rules like "All words in lower case.  Each answer is one word.  Everything is singular" or something like that.

Well, there's no way to really implement it at the bitcoin level.  You can't just create bitcoins out of thin air like the bank can with dollars.  What you could do is issue promissory notes that can be redeemed at your institution for bitcoins, and in that way introduce fractional reserve banking, but that relies on trust in your institution.

Me either... I think I have all the answers, but when I type them in, the public key doesn't match what was provided...
**Edit** Also, how do we know case?  What version of the bible should we be using?  King James?  NIV?

But if it can't be proven that OP owns the second address, doesn't that anonymize the coins?

Plus, accepting bitcoin is like accepting cash.  Cash is used for lots of illicit deals, but that doesn't mean that those who accept it are illicit.  What a horrible conclusion to draw.
