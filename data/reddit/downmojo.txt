It's sad that America has come to a point where people can create new businesses that allow people to exchange money for their time?

Good writeup. Personally I don't see what value they have over other news that is readily available for free though.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:57:27
Newsweek knows what they did.

And the easiest to get people into and encourage the most rapid innovation.

So the second account is denominated in BTC, do you buy the coins from yourself with your first account?
How does the first account denominated in dollars avoid fluctuations? Constant interaction with the second account?
Some are saying purchases under $600 don't need to be recorded. This would make it a much smaller problem.

Consider starting with one miner also.

I wonder if we actually could pool together to buy the cheapest island that could be claimed independent....

I love the patriot one!

It looks great ilcreations! Might consider changing some wording, maybe pending instead of unconfirmed because that's terminology banks use now.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:23:41
Seriously? Take a step back for a minute.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:43:11
Lol yes probably. I'm trying to practice taking a step back every now and then so I can notice such things. When you get too deep, your perception becomes narrow.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:46:30
Man can dream. As we've seen today before our own eyes, miracles do happen. ;)
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:30:36
I would be very excited to use a system like this. Retailers could probably even use existing receipt printers. I hope this thread gets a lot of attention!
@_date: 2014-02-23 01:07:22
What is going on here...
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:22:03
You were the first to break the news of the bitcoin minecraft merger buyout.
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:47:58
Haha no doubt. If it all goes down in flames at least we can tell our grand kids we were there. :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:03:02
Sure thing, Leah.
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:25:40
He is using the recent other news about alipay and other chinese money transmitters to emphasize that the current rumor of a ban is not fake.
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:54:11
Sounds likely. Don't let it know that we know yet though!
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:03:07
That's how I felt. But we didn't I guess?
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:23:25
Just want to commemorate the occasion by posting here. I was there when he came to us when we called upon him. Do you remember what you were doing when it happened? Because I will forever.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:53:02
That would be like PETA being the entire board of directors for McDonalds

Let's start a lunch collection and fund his meals for life. Any trusted members want to start an escrow?

Scrypt adaptive-n in vertcoin :)

Props on quick guess of cigars. Of course the answer was "Isreal, what?"
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:55:17
pic of your friends sister or it didn't happen
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:49:11
They hatin'... Caught you.
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:03:15
Two years ago it would have been crazy for this to happen. Very awesome, casinos are a good place to put bitcoin dispensers :)
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:56:48
You scammed a scammer into sending you btc? Very cool.
Reminds me of the people that play along with the scams and teach them bad spelling and grammar.

Streaming Netflix at 4k would only take 10 hours/day to get to 2 terrabytes at 15Mbps right? 
What if they aren't abusers and they just watch Netflix all day?
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:23:27
= What variable? Florida has almost 2x population of Greece
@_date: 2015-08-10 04:50:01
The decentralized reddit discussed before where you subscribe to moderators of your choosing sounds really great right now.
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:49:52
bitcasino.io is where it's at. Silly to not pay an affiliate fee even if someone says your the worst site ever, they're still driving their traffic to you...
@_date: 2015-09-19 20:06:11
Maybe a credit union or your specific bank. Closing my Regions account was hell.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:16:25
Hell yes, bring your bicycle! I hope you show up at my this year lol
