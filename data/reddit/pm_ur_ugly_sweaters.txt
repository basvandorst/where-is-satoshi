You can but up to .00000001. You don’t have to buy anywhere close to a whole one 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:42:19
No memes on the front page yet? Come on, we need to do better than this 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:38:27
This is the kind of quality post we needed last time we hit 11k. We would have held it there if we did
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:14:27
I've got my 20k meme ready, lets get there tonight
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:14:33
“From Scratch”. Step 1. Hey buy this service that I’m totally not being paid to advertise. Step 2. Wait for next video 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:09:22
When in doubt, zoom it out 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:52:15
Hold it! 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:51:15
1BTC sellingfor rough $11,000 in the US. More expensive in other places 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:49:53
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:24:51
I know, right? So catchy. Happy 12k!
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:12:20
Hello Hop on the train! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:25:52
Overstock.com is the biggest that accepts right now. Papa Johns gave its franchisee’s the option recently I believe as well 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:46:14
Low quality shit post
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:42:35
Back up! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:09:02
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:37:04
What gif do we post in 20 minutes at 11k? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:22
Aw he mad
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:34:36
There’s still time! This is just the beginning!
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:46:29
You can buy up to .0000001
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:37:20
You can legitimately cash out and transfer money directly to your back account right this second. You know nothing and you hate it. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:02:20
Papa Johns allowed for their franchisee's to accept recently, right? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:36:16
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:49
Not possible like that. Read up before being bitter
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:42:50
Top of all, let’s get more people in and bring it to 10k! 12k by year end 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:34:47
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:23:37
Hope you’re prepared for sob stories in your inbox of why people need you to send them ‘just one BTC to cover moms bills’ 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:00
Check Coinbase. Easiest way. Your funds won’t be available for about seven days but it’ll buy them at today’s price
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:30:25
Didn't know about that sub, thanks for the tip! I posted it over there as well.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:51:52
It’s only 9k now, still time. Or you could still put in $100
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:22:11
Damn this dude saw the future on GDAX 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:34:18
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:35:34
This guy must have come from the comment section of a Yahoo news article or something. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:43:39
That was weak. Come on, let’s see a real drop. 1k or nothin 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:36:29
I sold around 7k, bought back in at 6600. Not a big gain, but a gain none the less. Staying in now 
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:24:44
Yup. Correcting right now 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:32:33
You can buy things with it. Overstock, Steam, Lamborghini dealerships. It would take you a 5 second google search to negate any point you were trying to make. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:40:03
You can buy any amount. Bitcoin is divisible by 100,000,000
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:36:08
Welcome and congrats!
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:30:23
The people against memes really underestimate the power of them. Memes helped us get a president elected, I think they can be a positive force here too 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:55:44
Yeah, I've never carried a balance over on any card. I'm amazed they haven't really caught on to this, being that it is practically a money-transfer. Good for us!
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:37:34
I legitimately only check yahoo to read the comments on bitcoin articles. Good source of entertainment there. Just a bunch of old and angry people that keep yelling ‘tulips’ and ‘buy my farts’. I’d like to send all of those people a letter once a month, every month, reminding them how high the price of bitcoin is going. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:47:41
One more small bounce! Come on! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:03:47
What, did you come from the comment section of a Yahoo News article? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:33:53
$11000 in gdax within the hour 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:47:29
GDAX has stats for volume in 24 hours. Currently at 18,247
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:38:52
Welcome and congrats!
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:43:57
What is this spam comment from multiple accounts? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:08:36
Holy fuck, lets break 11,000 tonight ladies and gents
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:01:43
Not saying it hasn’t, but sometimes the mobile app has an error on startup where it’ll display that number for a couple seconds before correcting to the actual amount.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:17:11
You know nothing and you’re mad about it 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:14:36
You could sell on Coinbase or gdax right now 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:20:14
Yeah, just carry over the balance every month and when BTC is at the moon, paying the interest wont even matter because it'll be pocket change /s
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:11:00
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:05:10
We discussed the Overstock and possible Amazon situation, if we were mining effectively, I could see us using to buy as well
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:19:31
That's what I used at first. Anyone new, I push toward that as well. They wouldn't understand gdax 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:04:35
Coinbase.com. Buy and sell bitcoin. Deposits right to your bank account, bud. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:32:03
The good times never end! What a night
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:04:55
Damn I called it 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:12:56
Yeah, I guess thats true. As long as the fees from purchasing BTC are less than the price of an airline ticket, you're saving money on flights you would have already had to pay for
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:45:40
Nice original comment! You must have come from a Yahoo News article! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:01:00
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:06:15
Beautiful! Get this to the front page of Reddit STAT!
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:09:52
Usually with these kinds of cards, I think theres a delay of 8+ weeks before the miles are finally transferred through. I'd get in contact with the CC company for a better answer though, I'm sure.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:37:05
The mad man did it 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:32:34
I’d estimate over tree fiddy
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:48:17
So close...
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:19:19
I put $550 in today. Thinking of doing more already. Is this what addiction feels like? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:04:08
Alright, alright. I bought in. I'm here for the ride.
First read about it my freshman year of college. Coins were around $10. Better late than never, I guess. Good luck everyone!
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:15:31
This is it! To the mooooooon!
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:38:40
Thank you for this, I didn't know about this one. Got into Coinbase for the first time a week ago
