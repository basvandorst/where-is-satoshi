Yeah this is how I feel, the tech layers needed for proper mass adoption aren't in place yet and people rushing in with zero knowledge are just trying to get rich quick and their first 30% dip is going to be brutal enough to scare them off. I've taken to telling people I've never heard of it when they ask, until it's more useful and straight forward it's not worth trying to convince people. If someone does the research themselves and then approaches me I'll have a chat.

Anyone know of any good podcasts that focus solely on Bitcoin and the Crypto sphere? Not really interested in traditional financial opinions on it personally but I'd love to dial in a credible and focused weekly discussion about crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:12:08
Short-term, sure. But I'm quite happy to see they are entering the space. We should all be elated when news like this comes out no matter how slow the rollout is. The more competition there is within the bitcoin ecosystem the better!
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:50:26
Wow that was one of the cringiest segments I've ever seen. My HS videography crew has had better discussions about bitcoin on the morning news.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:57:42
Same, this shit is absurd.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:15:46
Great vid, anyone who is involved in crypto at any level should watch this. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:34:08
For anyone who has been into this for a while I think this meme is completely backwards.

Dude has no idea. You can tell he just memorized a bunch of shit to say haha.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:53:43
IMO we're going to forget this even happened in a few days and we'll have forgotten bcash even exists by summer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:22:51
Brilliant! Well done!
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:32:21
Mastering Bitcoin makes a great Christmas gift!!
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:52:55
Is there a word for what this dude is doing? He's literally just trying to use the bitcoin name in his own coin's name in order to gain attention from people who don't know any better. There's a company doing the same thing with the term "blockchain" and their stock is way up for absolutely no reason, they used to be biotech or something. It's scummy shit but is there a word for it? Because if there is it should be much more commonly used so we can call vile bullshit like this out more directly.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:01:26
Don't expect cryptocurrencies to solve problems that generally are not created by currencies to begin with. Bitcoin is just the beginning and the bedrock of what the new financial landscape will look like. The power is in the hands of developers to build on top of this improved currency and I'm sure more than a few are imagining and even working right now on ways we could solve problems like wealth inequality. To suggest Bitcoin should solve wealth inequality as a feature would be like suggesting the internet should have solved all diplomatic issues around the world just by virtue of making it easier to communicate. It's not a magic bullet, but we're 2,000x better off trying to solve the world's most complex problems with it.

What a cunt lol wtf does he want people to talk about? The weather?
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:43:47
Thanks for typing this up!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:03
Thank you Andreas!
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:24:33
The level of ignorance towards the most basic and fundamental aspects of Bitcoin from people being paid to talk about it on TV lately would be shocking if it weren't so God damn commonplace now days in our society.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:57:07
Does gain money = moving it into USD and my bank account? Do I report on my hodlings in cold storage or on exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:06:13
I'd bet it's mostly astroturfing. When I saw the price down yesterday I was too busy living the fuck out of my life to come in here and calm the FUD. I did manage to fit a buy in though ;)
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:28:53
They gonna have to learn what is what somehow.
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:12:33
Kind of makes you wonder who is making these memes doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:10:21
Yeah after seeing the value balance out around $1200 today I can hardly see how we can assume much of the run up was ETF related at all... 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:38:17
@_date: 2017-03-11 12:56:19
Uh yeah? You're being for real? The end result that the system is being gamed is the same, how does it being imperceptible make it better for you? 
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:14:58
This seems prophetic to me, thank you for thinking this out. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:12:20
Hell yeah that was tremendously stated.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:21:49
Soo uh, probably stupid question but how do I get my BCH without losing my BTC from a hardware wallet? I don't really care if I make anything on it, just don't want to be holding it frankly.
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:57:03
Trezor, good call I just searched it and found they have a [claim Bcash tool]( Thanks!
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:48:46
This shit is so thinly veiled hard to believe they are serious with this lol

@_date: 2019-04-11 11:19:25
The number of genuinely smart and talented tech folks who STILL haven't even read the white paper is way too high in my experience.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:38:02
Is that really a civil war though? Miners vs. Users? Seems more like the miners are attacking/exploiting bitcoin considering their alternative would eliminate the decentralized nature of bitcoin which is the only reason it has value at all. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:20:32


  
Haha! In what scenario is, "take it at face value," **ever** good advice? You really think it's a good idea for people to just refer to one source of information on any topic? What an utter shit comment. Please read the message yourself and take it at face value meaning please unsubscribe and stop commenting here.
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:29:49
What exactly is there a civil war over? 
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:16:13
Any compromise that would do away with the decentralized nature of bitcoin, like the BU hard fork, should be rejected at face value though. For me that is plainly the only reason this currency has any value at all.
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:04:05
The bitcoin.com message is a joke, it doesn't deserve anything short of mockery. You don't explicitly tell people what subreddits to follow and not follow, that sort of rhetoric deserves nothing BUT mockery. 
  
BU sacrifices the decentralized aspect of bitcoin and is therefore also a total joke and deserves nothing but ridicule. It's true that we need cooperation, we need the miners to come off this bullshit and get real. Without it's decentralized nature this currency is worthless to all parties involved.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:58:27
I really do believe that's the case just from a few people I know personally who invested @ like $18k against my advice. They all just wanted to jump on the train and get rich quick. Before it hit those heights they were talking the same shit they are now and yet they still bought it. It is fools and their money all the way down around here. Join the team and stop generating baseless FUD you dumb fucks, you're only hurting yourself.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:42:34
This is legitimately *the* headline of the year.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:44:08
Yes, that is exactly what I was trying to communicate to someone last night. We've known for a long time how much potential there is in blockchain technology. There's no need to rehash that or dispute it at this point. But the reality is Bitcoin is the deepest and most comprehensive use of it by far and it also stands to have the biggest impact on the world. I'd say these people are morons if it weren't so obvious that they are concern trolls.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:42:00
You talk about, "intelligent buyers", as if you are one and yet you fully understand and recognize the potential in thing 1 while being willfully ignorant of the greater potential in thing 2. There are many implementations of blockchain on the horizon, we've all known that since 2009, Bitcoin is the simply the one with the greatest potential.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:05:13
If I suspend my disbelief for a moment it's really touching how much you care about us. You're the one coming around here spouting absolute non-sense and then getting incensed over perfectly reasonable responses. No one cares what your investment habits are, I certainly didn't ask. I wish you nothing but the best.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:46:45
Yeah yea... that changes nothing about bcash being completely centralized from a mining perspective. If anyone else would like to educate themselves as to why what both of these users are saying isn't true at all, fire up this podcast and start around 5:50...  
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:04:59
I understand and feel your impulse to lay this out myself but stop explaining it to them. You don't have to explain it to us, we get it and we're right there with you. Make your moves in silence just like they do. Let them think we're gonna get over what they've done to our families. All you're doing is giving them talking points for their next shill campaign. Wish our generation would just shut up and stop sharing every single thought online. Have a good one friend.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:29:11
Bitcoin has just as much potential as the blockchain technology it is built on, if not more.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:26:55
Your point is illogical. Bitcoin is by far the most thorough implementation of the blockchain to date and without a doubt the only reason the SEC is even aware of blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:38:40
They've had major impacts, just look at Trump. You're just a person on the internet too. Speak out irl as much as you possibly can but posting it here is just troll food. They can't crawl and index your opinions on the street like they can a Reddit comment.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:02:07
I reckon that's what is happening right now honestly. The most recent group of manipulators overestimated the impact they could have and are doubling down to try and save their shirts.
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:10:52
Yeah but not all crypto is bitcoin either. Frankly if you don't see that you probably never will, your world view isn't the same as ours. This isn't about making a quick buck, it's an ideology. It's valuable because it's decentralized and the higher the price goes and the more businesses that accept it the more the consensus grows around that ideology.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:04:10
lmao so much cringe
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:14:49
No doubt, thx for the thoughtful exchange. I really am right there with ya ✊
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:36:10
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:21:02
Those people have gone from very vocal when the topic comes up to very quiet in my experience even through the recent dip.
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:14:08
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:00:00
Not to mention they run it in the same news cycle as the "bitcoin is a fraud" article, is it a fraud or is it  funding North Korea? Surely it can't be both lol. All the fact that North Korea may be using it does is further legitimize bitcoin as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:52:51
bcash misses the point entirely by being centralized. it literally has no purpose and it is plainly a financial circle jerk.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:03:51
Articles like this are how you know bitcoin is winning.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:16:29
The LN testnet already has more nodes than bcash. That's not even to mention how 92% of bcash blocks are mined by only 2 miners which is the real problem with it and when considered highlights the false equivalence you are creating.
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:09:29
Where is the precedent for a crypto ETF to pass now? Wasn't the reason the SEC turned down the last ETF mainly because bitcoin is unregulated?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:41:39
It makes no sense how upset you are over what I've said here. Why do you care what others do with their money?
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:01:05
Yeah it's true, can't teach someone who doesn't want to learn. Best of luck to you in learning those lessons.

so many things a person can become in this world and he chose to be this lmao
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:18:40
You remind me of the person who got me into bitcoin (not your specific details but just the passion you have for the community). I'm right there with you brother, btc or bust.
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:56:07
Though there are real people who have bought bitcoin and are really bitter (I know 3) it's hard for me to believe the people who spend time here being bitter are genuine. What normal person has time to sit around bashing something with no incentive to do so?
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:32:34
This is exactly the kind of book I've been wanting to read about Bitcoin!

Dedicates his identity and subsequent wealth to centralizing it.  
  
What a guy!
@_date: 2017-05-20 04:38:31
I'm doing this, thanks for your hard work! 
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:54:32
This article is so pointless and I agree with what you're saying completely but one thing I have a hard time understanding still is once btc eclipses fiat currencies how do we even measure the value? What will be the equivalent of a $19.99 price tag in btc?
@_date: 2017-05-03 01:49:42
We get that you don't get it lol
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:57:27

Lmfao at your hypocrisy.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:11:10
Pointing out blatant incompetence is hard saying 'my way or it's wrong'.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:04:34
Yeah but at that point what is the purpose of bitcoin? It's brilliant because it's decentralized. Once it's not decentralized everyone will go right back to the banks.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:48:02
Give it time, a drop like this just means we're at the start of the next run up. Look at some charts, recent trends have been very repetitious. I predicted a drop to the $2100 range yesterday, now we're going to bounce back and come back well clear of $3k. Have faith in the tech, maybe read the white paper again :)
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:33:01
100%. Coinbase gets exposed and then what tho?
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:42:05
Based on what?
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:09:08
Does this aspect of bitcoin not actually afford us a unique opportunity to rethink the way we talk about value? There has got to be a better way than what we have now. Perhaps bitcoin will be the end of $19.99 sale prices?
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:40:09
Get this shit out of here
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:40:59
This drop seems just about right to me based on recent trends. Just sit tight and wait for the run up :)
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:43:48
Centralized Bitcoin ≠ Bitcoin.  
  
What is so hard for these miners to understand about that? They are already making an absurd amount of money in this industry, why on earth are they so dead set on destroying the most valuable property of the asset that has made them?
