There are likely better ways to grow your existing investment if that's all you are looking to do, consider loaning your coins out somewhere like poloniex,btcpop,btcjam etc though this does expose you to risk. 
You may also want to consider some of the trading algo options out there if you are really looking to invest in something on top of your btc holdings to facilitate growth.  traderdaddy is quite interesting, only requiring you to purchase a small sum of rubycoin to use(though it only trades on bittrex atm), cryptotrader allows you to build your own bots or purchase from a market (like mt4/5). Google will have lots of answers - These options will require your coins to be kept on an exchange and involves actively trading your coins be aware/weigh the risks associated with that.

KMD looks like it has a lot of potential between BarterDex, and the Dpow system, I was interested in GNT as a blender user but not really sure what the future usage will look like for that so backing off for now. Dash has been pretty good to me in the past as well.

I couldn't agree with this more - the cost of electricity combined with the noise and heat (no one ever talks about the heat) generated by mining rigs makes it pointless, then factor in outages and potential h/w failure its better to just buy.
Are you mining with a gpu rig or running out of your desktop? I've been contemplating getting into Monero but wasn't sure it would be worth while on a single or SLI gpu setup.
