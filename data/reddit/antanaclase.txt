What does the cardboard stand for here?

I'm interested in your reasoning on that one. Since you hit close to the target, what exactly made you think :
1) It would correct at 1020+?
2) It would break the 950 resistance, yet stop around around 920? (which was actually a bit lower but hey, noone's Nostradamus)

This is material law, while the class action issue comes down to procedure.
What I mean is, the fact you can't go for a class action against them (according to their EULA) is a different issue from whether the fact they withheld money is legal.
A court would (if the EULA class action exclusion is deemed legal) simply say that you can still ask for a recognition of your rights (such as getting your money back) before the arbitration court, and thus those rights are not voided.
tldr: Difference between material and procedural rights

I really hope you don't end up managing my money in a bank.

Other than your own desire, what do you have to back this up?

Based on history, I'd rather wager a crash will come in the next few days/weeks. The last time BTC went up so quick (and it was way less than this time) it crashed 50% of its value in a few hours. Check the 2years chart on [bitcoinity]( the increase in the last few days is crazy.
[Google trends]( shows the interest in BTC (which was probably the main factor in the increase) is drawing less new interest. I'd guess the 1000$ step will raise the curve again, but then... BTC usually lags a few days behind, because people need time to be able to purchase BTC. So yeah, my bet is people who hoped they could make quick money by investing now (and thus driving up the price) will be way less, and most will take their earnings.
Let's face it, "real world" BTC adoption didn't follow the curve AT ALL those last days. Most people are not buying because they hope to be able to spend it at Starbucks, they buy because they speculate on it. This it the best root for a bubble burst at some point.
If you have a counter example where such a steep curve didn't end in a crash, I'm interested. The Dotcom bubble is a fairly good example imo. The fact it's new doesn't mean it doesn't fit the usual market rules.

Disregarding whether it climbs back up or not, investing all your savings in such a volatile market is plain stupid.

You didn't counter any of my points, just said "you're stupid gtfo". I'm interested if you have counter examples and come with an open mind. Show me I'm wrong, I'll gladly admit it.
What's happening right now kinda goes my way tho.

God, how blind are people. Do you think people are all about being nice Anonymous and fighting the big bad State? This is the reasoning of either a 12 years old or Ron Paul. 
State regulation can sometimes be a bother, but this is also an element of the country's crime fight. If people are able to move money freely after smuggling weapons, drugs or trafficking humans we most likely have an issue. Believing said regulations are only there to annoy you is incredibly selfish and disregarding that people are actually suffering. 
Not suffering like "Omg my Internet freedomz" but like "if I don't sell my body to any bidder, I get hit/tortured tonight and my family back in my home country is at risk of getting killed". 
Sure, this is not the prefect deterrent, but being unable to trace that kind of money is actually a big deal.

While I can't really give you a reason why, BTCe tends to close the gap when the market is going downwards, and the opposite happens when it goes upwards.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:36:54
Don't play dumb, you're not making yourself a favor...
I'm not implying anything, I'm clearly stating that those regulations are in place for a reason, most of which I'm 99% you are not even aware of, and thus can't judge of their actual validity.
And I'll repeat, you are just like a 12 year old telling their parents "why do you pay taxes? Keeping money is better!" The fact is seems like a good idea when thought from a selfish point of view still doesn't make it a valid position. Mainly because you aren't alone in the world, and other people are also part of the society and thus deserve to be heard/taken care of as much as you do.

Yeah, because as many people didn't know Iran existed as for bitcoin.

To be clear:
[This is the text to be voted on](
The title of this article is very sensationnalist: 
- This is still to be voted.
- What's to be voted is NOT for BTC to be deemed a legal currency.
- What's to be voted is 4 questions requiring a report from the Government where those questions are dealt with in depth.
- Those 4 questions are (roughly) the following:
- What could the Swiss financial market gain from using electronic currencies?
- What goes agaisnt considering electronic currencies as any other foreign currency?
- What regulations could be implemented to ensure the legal security of electronic currencies?
- If regulations need to be adapted, what would the changes be and how long would it take?
IF it is accepted on the vote (which is likely), the government will have to ask its administration or an expert to answer those questions.
IF it comes back with a positive report, some MP might propose a law change.
IF it is proposed, it will have to be voted on.
IF it is accepted, there'll be at least a few months until this is implemented.
All in all, the actual law change is, in the best event, a few years away.

Or simply push back the crash limit. Who knows.

I'd like to add there's another factor that'll prevent Bitcoin from going mainstream in some markets: it would be incredibly easy to launder money.
My guess is either corporations that deal with big amount transactions refuse Bitcoin because of the inherent possibility of money laundering or the states outlaws accepting Bitcoin to some extent.
Let's say you're a weapon smuggler. You have a big amount of cash coming from the black market you want to inject back into the system. What would you do?
- For a long time, you could simply deposit in a bank and it was ok. Not anymore in any developped country. They'll ask for a justification of origin for the amount of money and/or mention it to the supervision authority.
- Pay someone in cash? Let's say you buy a house, there'll either be regulations forbidding you to pay it cash or the seller would be liable for accepting such a big amount of money. This goes the same for many of the purchases involving a large sum of money.
Now what about Bitcoin?
- You can use many different ways to get your hand on some BTC starting from cash. The variety of websites offering different payment services is quite obvious.
- You have loads of Bitcoin and you now want to put it in the regular market. You decide to buy a house.
- If the seller is okay with this, you now own a 100% laundered house since you can't trace the origin of the money.
Yes, it is nice to feel anonymous and stuff, but there are other issues at stake than you wanting to buy Starbucks with your Bitcoins. 
I fell this will be the reason put forward to either limit what can be bought with BTC or detract big corporations from going for Bitcoin because of liability risks.

I'd guess it's because of this assumption:


It runs on the idea of an ever increased value of bitcoin.  It is highly possible that they see this whole thing as a big bubble or don't believe it'll ever be able to replace "real" money.
Or they think they can start a competing virtual money and manage it with their already working payment system.
My point is, you're very optimistic, that's nice, but your post is a chain of assumption.
