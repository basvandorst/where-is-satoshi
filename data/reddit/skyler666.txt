You expect us to pay for your *blog*? I’ve already wasted my time looking at it.
And, since when is ZH about posting over-used memes?

No, but srsly, I was going to buy in at $5000. Omg, I'd be living the dream right now, fuck.

Are you a US citizen? The deadline to move out your assets, if so, was last month. If you’re not, but are still a US resident, you’ll still have a lot of stress to get verified.

Didn't think of devs! I already follow ZeroHedge, and they're pretty good at breaking news for a lot already. I do find good BBG coverage, mostly from individuals, recommend this [fellow here](

Arbitrary round numbers won’t save this

How is that considered confirmed?

Oh dang it, on the other hand, it took me less than an hour to wire money to GDAX today. *$20 allowance to the moon!* /s
