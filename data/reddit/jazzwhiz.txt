Shy of changing from PoW to PoS or something, or changing the hashing algorithm, every asic produced will continue to operate for the foreseeable future. That combined with the fact that the price is on a tear means that the number of asic's will continue to increase and, as such, the total electricity costs will continue to increase.

The problem is a bit more complicated than that. As the price goes up, more people buy mining equipment. Once a person has bought mining equipment it is usually economically viable to keep it on and the difficulty adjusts. Yes, some of the mining might switching to BCH or something else, but the machines won't ever be shut off.

I think that that provision ("Provided the programs are easy to use") is a major one that is not to be overlooked. Developing good commercial grade software for a completely novel concept (everything crypto is still fairly novel, and LN is even newer) is slow, painful, and expensive.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:58:01
Yes. It takes one master private key and uses a different formula to derive the corresponding private keys for each coin. Ledger doesn't have a huge amount of memory (a downside of using a secure chip) so you can't install more than about five different apps (one app per crypto) on the ledger at once. You still have access to all the coins because they are all derived from the same master private key. The different apps just allow you to interact with the different coins. So you can send ltc to your ledger, delete the ltc app from your ledger, reinstall it, and your ltc are still there.

People have various complicated living will plans to share their private keys upon their death. None of them are trustless though. A standard option is to do something like this: split up your key into several parts. Distribute some of these parts to several different people. Explain to them how it all works and who gets what when you die. Of course it is still up to them to split it correctly when you die. The problem is that they could conspire against you and put the key together while you are still alive and take all of your money.

In any case, all transactions will always have fees. To understand the current fee situation it is generally a good idea to ignore recommended fee algorithms as they are often incorrect. I suggest checking a mempool. One with pretty graphs can be found [here](

I was there. I had put some money in, an amount that if I lost it I was completely okay with whatever education I got out of it. By the time of the crashes they had already appreciated a bit so I already didn't care.
I remember breaking $1000 was pretty mind blowing in a "this thing actually could work." Even after the crashes I still believed that it could work.
Breaking $10k was not nearly as exciting as $1k IMO.
In terms of mass adoption over the last few years the number of "bitcoin is a bubble/scam/etc." articles hasn't really increased or decreased, but the number of "those people saying bitcoin is a bubble don't know what they're talking about" has increased.

Implementing segwit and verifying that the code works takes a bit of effort. Since exchanges pass the fees on to customers and most people don't have a huge choice of exchanges, there isn't a huge incentive to implement it yet. Write to your favorite exchange though and let them know if it is important to you.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:05:34
Good for not investing more than you can afford to lose.
One of the main motivations to move off an exchange is to ensure that they don't screw you. This can happen either accidentally via a hack or maliciously. Read up on Mt. Gox if you're wondering if this is hypothetical or not.
If you don't care about that then leave them on the exchange. Exchanges are easier to handle.
That said, I do recommend moving them off an exchange to a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor. There are many good videos describing how to set one of these guys up.
In the meantime, while your coins are on an exchange, make sure you enable 2FA as accounts without 2FA do get hacked. Also, SMS 2FA is pretty much worthless so don't waste your time with that.

Continuous automatic buying is always a good idea.

Remember that trying to time the market almost never works. If you believe that BTC will increase in value the best thing to do is to buy in at regular intervals.
Also keep in mind that transferring fiat to an exchange usually takes at minimum several days.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:40:45
Remember that for every transaction you make there is someone on the other side who thinks that s/he just made a great a deal. Also keep in mind that the most experienced traders are making the majority of the trades. Unless you are an expert in these things, the person on the other end of the trade probably is better at it than you are. Finally, there are many bots out there trying to exactly identify peaks and dips using all kinds of data. Eyeballing the curve is probably not going to be as accurate as those.
Continuous automated investing is usually the best strategy where you buy in with a fixed amount of fiat every so often. Ignoring the price actually tends to result in more profits that trying to time the market.

Focus on the first figure. x axis is time. y axis is the number of transactions that have been submitted to the network\* and have not yet been put into a block. When this goes up, more transactions are added. When it suddenly drops down, a block has been mined. 
This figure further breaks it down by the size of the fee associated with each transaction. The units are sat/byte. One sat is 1e-8 of a BTC. One transactions is typically ~200-250 bytes or so. If the blocks aren't eating away at the color that corresponds to your transaction, it won't get mined. You can also see the last time your transaction was mined. You can change the time scale along the top of the page.
\* ...and received by this particular node. Not all mempools will be the same, but they should be fairly representative.

Every little down tick is a mined block of transactions. On the 24 hour graph (at the time I'm writing this) it is mostly only the blue (140-200) and some of the gray (100-140) transactions that are getting processed (or anything above those obviously).

As mentioned, it is common for mempools to drop transactions after two weeks. Be careful though because those transactions can still be resubmitted to the mempool, although I'm not sure why someone would do that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:16:51
The number of transactions is a little bit lower than the peak in May (although it may still be rising now), the size in bytes is higher. Since it is the size that corresponds to the number of blocks or how long it will take to eat it up, that is probably the slightly more relevant number. Plus now there are transactions in the 300-500 bin while in May it was mostly just the 200-300 bin. On top of that, the price was ten times lower then than now, so the fees are more than ten times higher than the last time the network was clogged.

The answer is different for everyone. Just because it is right for you does not mean that it is right for everyone. Some people's eyes turn to dollar signs (bitcoin signs?) when they see the percent returns. "I can certainly afford to convert all of my assets to crypto and make a bunch of money." But then when sending money to exchanges and getting it back out takes about a week on each end and bills suddenly arise, and maybe the price takes a tumble, now that person could be in real trouble.
My two main pieces of advice on how to give financial advice are: 1) Don't assume other people are in the same financial situation as you are and 2) for the love of god, remember that past performance is not indicative of future behavior.

Altcoins are always sketchy. With small enough market caps pump and dumps are common.
Also, remember that timing any market (bitcoin, iota, apple, s&amp;p 500, etc.) is extremely difficult. If you believe that BTC is going to go up, buy it. Ideally you will buy in at regular intervals once a week or whatever.

One thing to keep in mind about bitcoin fees is that they are pretty much independent of the amount you are transferring. It is a bit more complicated than that, but it is still basically true. So the fee would be the same(ish) if you are transferring $1 or $1M. This is because the fees are charged based on "how much data does it take to describe the transaction" which is more or less independent of the amount of the transaction. This can be compared to the fees we are used to with credit cards, pay pal, western union, etc. which are based on "how much can we get away with charging."
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:23:21
The problem is that they need to be continuously hiring. Their growth rate has been ridiculous. Once they realized they needed to hire they were already behind the curve. If their growth steadied out they could have caught up.
The other thing to keep in mind is that current employees are a part of both the hiring and the training process which means there is an additional lag until you get the increased productivity.

Everyone who "made it big" by buying in years ago took a huge risk. BTC has been near an ATH for much of its life. Plus, the risk that the house of cards would come tumbling down was higher back then than it is now. Then mt gox nearly destroyed the whole thing. Now there are many decent (ish) exchanges and wallets, plus more hardware wallets so everything is more stable.
Yes there are people who made a lot of money, but many of those people also got into alts and lost lots of it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:31:53
Remember that fees continue to provide for the network. Even though the number of transactions per block is fixed, things like LN will batch transactions keeping the price up.
Plus if miners stop mining the difficulty adjustment will (eventually) fix it.

You can transfer coins from anywhere to anywhere. Any crypto account, whether a hardware wallet, paper wallet, software wallet, or even an account on an exchange will provide an option to receive crypto or to send it.
For example, if you have bitcoin on your ledger and want to send it to me, I get a "receive" address from mine and send it to you. You then click on the send button, put in my address, and select how many bitcoins you want to send to me. After confirming the transaction on your ledger, the transaction is submitted to the network and then (eventually) confirmed.

Diversification is always a good idea. Some fiat, some crypto, some stocks, some bonds. For crypto, I would suggest some diversification there as well. That said, many alts are out right scams, some are probably scams, and some may well become scammy regardless of potentially good intentions. The top market cap coins are probably not too scammy (because it gets hard to manipulate that many billions).
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:42:13

I would suggest investing in things you understand. For example, if you understand cars and the difference between different car companies then investing in a car company might be a good idea. Similarly, if you understand crypto and the differences among all the different cryptos then it might be a good idea to invest.
Asking people on r/bitcoin "what crypto should I invest in" is a bit silly. If you asked the same thing on ether's or ltc's or any of the other ones they would probably be able to provide good reasons to invest in those cryptos.
Do your own research, it is your money.

People have been manipulating the bitcoin market for some time. Lately it has grown large enough that it is difficult to manipulate and people have been focusing on manipulating alts. There are still some shady things that happen in BTC, but it has been smaller and rarer.
I don't think that just because there is a futures market the ability to manipulate the market will magically increase. I suspect that most of the adventurous wall streeters have been involved in crypto trading for some time now, so there won't be a massive amount of additional capital to throw around.

Coinbase and GDAX let you transfer assets instantly and for free between them. They are owned by the same people. The coins aren't actually transferred. Basically, they just keep a huge amount of coins in cold storage and move some to hot storage as they are needed. Then they keep a record of how many coins you have and do all the trading that way until you say that you want to send your coins elsewhere, then they pull them out of storage. This is called off chain transactions.

Yeah, you can perform as many transactions as you like with many different coins using ledger. Note that if you want to use more than ~5 different coins with ledger you have to uninstall apps. The coins are still secure.
At its core a ledger is just there to remember your private key. Then when you install an app it uses generic algorithms to convert that key into addresses and to sign transactions. You can perform those actions as many times as you want and you can even remove the software that does it because the private key is still the same.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:07:54

Block 2.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:26:42
There are two competing concerns here that can be basically described as: security vs. access.
If you save your private key in your email then access is easy but security is low. If you write it on a piece of paper and put it in 6 nested safes and don't write down any combination anywhere, it is very secure, but there is a decent chance that you will forget the combination to one of the safes (and really, at some point it may just be easier to memorize your private key).
It is important to strike a balance here. Typically you take a hardware wallet and then separately store the 24 words somewhere else minimizing the risk that both will be compromised.
It is also probably a good idea to keep some amount of your assets in colder storage and others in easier to access warmer storage.

If you buy a ledger (I have one) and you save your recovery seed, and everything related to ledger catches on fire (the company, the software on your computer, the ledger nano in your pocket, etc.) you can still plug the recovery seed into software to convert it to your private key. Ledger's website explains how to do this and points you to external options that you can use online (not super recommended) or you can download them and use them offline (better, but still shouldn't do this unless ledger+fire).

Difficulty adjustments aren't forks, they are a part of the bitcoin protocol.
The idea is that we want blocks to happen every 10 minutes. If there are lots of miners then blocks will be found faster than that. Every so often bitcoin automatically adjusts how hard it is to find a block. If blocks are being found too fast then the adjustment will make it harder and vice-versa.
Since the massive increase in price lately the number of miners have increased quite a bit, so the rate of finding blocks has increased beyond what it should. See [here]( for a chart of this. The BTC row shows the average number of blocks found per hour over the last 3 hours, 6 hours, etc. This number should be 6. Since it has been 7-10 the difficulty adjustment will make finding blocks more difficult to correct this.

I don't know about sending from coinbase, but I have definitely successfully sent from gdax to segwit multiple times without a problem.

It only depends on where it being sent from.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:38:20
You're probably right. Either that or off chain transactions (within coinbase/gdax for example).
I'm just showing how you can see how full the network is and how crazy high the fees are.
Plus, there is no guarantee that a transaction will go through. The mempool could stay this full for the next few months. A number of things are happening. Obviously the amount of media coverage is increasing, people are downloading the apps (coinbase is a top app in both stores). Moreover, whatever futures bring, they will certainly come along with additional volume one way or another. And then there is Christmas. Just as we saw what may have been a Thanksgiving bump, we may see an additional Christmas bump. Finally, coinbase will be releasing BCH January 1, and I suspect that a large percentage of those will be quickly converted to BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:32:04
Their concern was that the volatility is so high, transaction speeds are slow, and fees are high. Because of this if someone paid for a game, by the time the transaction was confirmed there may well have not been enough coins which would require a follow up transaction and more fees. Plus the coins couldn't be easily refunded without adding on additional fees.

The difficult adjustment is based entirely on the rate at which blocks are mined. If that rate is faster than six per hour the difficult increases, if it is slower then it decreases.
I mentioned volume and price because those things affect mining rates, but there are other things too, for example bitcoin cash has a large effect. If it is more profitable to mine something else many miners will leave to the other coin which will slow down the bitcoin rate.
The full "marketplace" of hash power so to speak is rather more complicated than people could have initially anticipated. That said, at the moment, the price of bitcoin is the largest effect on the amount of mining power. Because of this miner have flowed to bitcoin which will lead to a difficult adjustment.
The difficulty will adjust so that the rate is just right. Because difficulty is only adjusted every so often there could be a problem when miners then leave for bitcoin cash and then there aren't enough miners and we will have to wait for the next difficult adjustment. So we will see a block rate reduction due to the difficulty adjustment and then subsequently due to some of the miners leaving.
Bitcoin cash does a continuous difficulty adjustment - that is they adjust the difficulty every block, which is something that I think they have (eventually) gotten quite right.

It isn't the worst thing to leave them on an exchange. Make sure you use 2FA (don't use SMS 2FA ever).

To be fair, most of those problems could happen with crypto as well. For example, crypto loans will likely emerge at some point. We already have some crytpo etf type things, not to mention the clusterfuck that is tether.
The real example currently, though, is ethereum, which I see as a big problem with the argument you've presented. People fucked up and other people decided that it was too big of a fuck up to allow so they reverted to pre-fuck-up. In a lot of ways that decision to revert was similar to a bail out.

GDAX batches transactions, so as they are sending you your coins they send out a bunch of other coins too to cut down on costs. You can search for your address though and see your transaction even before it is confirmed. GDAX usually sends out transactions within an hour or so and they pay pretty high fees so it should be confirmed quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:55:12
Right. There are always fees to send bitcoins on chain. Coinbase has decided (for now anyway) to eat the fee sending from GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:53:51
Ah, I see.
So typically you want to use a different address for every transaction. If you are going to send me coin I give you address A that I control and if someone else is going to send me coin I give them address B that I also control.
There is no way to just "merge" two addresses. You could instead use the same address for everything, but that is generally discouraged.

A) The number of new BTC being "minted" or mined is dropping. Mining the last bitcoin will happen sometime in 2140, but since the rate falls off with time, it doesn't matter exactly when. For comparison the first bitcoins were mined in 2009 and by 2013 half the bitcoins had already been mined.
See [wikipedia]( for more information.
B) Probably nothing special will happen then. The mining rate will be quite low by then anyway, so it doesn't really make that much of a difference.

I don't disagree on any single point you made. I think you missed my point though. Transaction fees are important. Since there is a lot of confusion and variability on the subject at the moment it is important to get it right in a non-biased way. Saying that a fee is $0.52 or $17 or $0.10, isn't right, but saying that it is 0.000052% or 8% isn't right either. Either one is misleading in a certain case.

Just an FYI, the DJIA is a terrible index. Use S&amp;P 500 or something like that. The difference is small, but DJIA is the sum of the value of a single share of the top 30 companies. It doesn't account for the fact that one company may have many more shares outstanding than another. The S&amp;P 500 uses 500 companies and weights the stocks by their total market capitalization. Basically the DJIA was created a long time ago because adding up numbers was easy and weighting them was too difficult for most people. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:34:57
This is the correct answer. Depending on how you are buying them, you want to minimize your fees. So if you pay 1% fee with a minimum fee of $2, and you want to convert $1000 a month, you should convert no less than $200 at a time, so convert $200 once every six days, so that over 30 days, with five converts, you have converted $1000. Adjust for your personal situation.

Actually you are incorrect. The market capitalization is the not the same as "if everyone cashed out their coins how much would it be worth?"

u/d1nny is right. You're getting ahead of yourself. Right now bitcoin is trying to compete with existing infrastructure which is largely built on both a flat and a percent fee. What really should be done is to compare when the fees are more expensive and when they are cheaper than existing options. Debit cards are essentially free-free and crypto can never compete. Credit cards are super pricey, something like $0.25+2% (numbers vary with cc company and the size of the business). In this case, if bitcoin is truly at 52c, then it is cheaper for transactions of greater than about $13.5. Of course, cc transactions usually confirm in less than about 15 seconds, and they provide consumers with various protections. Also, it is common to get some of the fees back in rewards, so the actual fees is a bit less than that. Still, this is the comparison that bitcoin should be trying to make.

It is easy to look back 20 years and pick the top performing asset over that time and say "you're such a rube for not putting a pile of money there, to feel like less of a rube you should put a pile of money in it now" which sounds great. Except that the reason the price exploded orders of magnitude is because it went from something a handful of nerds had heard of to something that has become a household name. Are there other such explosions out there? Maybe, but whether or not those happen are not correlated with whether or not the last one happened. It could take over all the currency in the world and increase in value many more orders of magnitude, or it could collapse amidst corruption, regulation, and in fighting causing its value to drop many orders of magnitude, or anything in between.

Suppose you have 10 coins in an address. If you want to give me some of them you send this message "Hi, I want to send coins from address A. Please put 8 of them in address B and 2 of them in address C." (Address B is mine and address C is a new address that belongs to you.) Then you cryptographically sign the message using your private key something only you have. It then gets verified by comparing the signature with address A.
The question then becomes, "where do you keep that private key?" Hackers are constantly checking any computer that they can get access to for something that looks like a private key. It is not recommended to ever enter this in anyway into a computer.
One option is to store it on an exchange -- basically a bank. Coinbase is the largest, but there are many other decent ones as well. Then you log in using traditional credentials (hopefully 2fa, accounts are regularly hacked) and coinbase transfers the money for you. This is easy to set up because we are used to doing things like this. The problems are that if someone gains access to your email account (and you don't have 2fa) then they can probably access your coinbase account. The other problem is that if coinbase decides to become evil and steal your funds you're screwed, if they make a mistake and all the funds are stolen from them you're screwed. They also charge additional fees to operate their service.
You can instead store the key yourself on something like a ledger or a trezor. Advantages: the above examples don't apply to you. Disadvantages: they cost some money ($50-100). The responsibility is all with you. If you fuck it up, you're toast. That said, it is pretty straightforward and there are many posts on here and youtube videos describing step by step how it works.
In practice, you configure your device, it gives you a backup list of 24 words which can be used to derive your master public key. Write this down (don't ever type it), and put it somewhere safe. Then you connect it to your computer with the available apps, or 3rd party apps, and it will generate a receive address. You then send coin to that address. You can then tell it you want to send coin to another address and it will do that. It keeps the private key on the drive and never reveals it to your computer, only the results of using that private key.

I disagree. Yes, fraud with bitcoin looks different than that with cc's, but it is certainly there and there is no safety net.
People have bitcoin stolen all the time through insecure practices. In the same way, cc information is stolen through insecure practices. In addition, when there is a problem with a cc, it can be corrected. My bank called me to ask if I was withdrawing money from an ATM in Taiwan (I have never been to Taiwan). I don't know how it happened but someone probably used a skimmer somewhere or something. Meanwhile, in the crypto world there is a virus going around that changes addresses on your clipboard to their address. Both of these are problems that can be avoided if you are careful enough, but they also happen to people from time to time. Only one of them provides a safety net. Of course, you have to pay for that safety net, and you give up some control to get it.

For those whom are new, yes, coinbase does occasionally bend and/or buckle under the load. New users are joining at an unprecedented rate. Trading is high. I'm sure that their customer service is swamped.
This has happened before and they always get their act together. Things cool off and they run smoothly. Their new users rate is something like a million per month, although it has probably been higher than that in the last week or so.
Can anyone guarantee that they aren't going to Mt Gox it up? Of course not. My point is that just because their service is partially degraded shouldn't mean that it is time to panic. Give them a bit of time.
That said, it is important to remember two things: never invest more than you can afford to lose. And get your crypto off exchanges into a hardware or paper wallet, especially if it has become a sizable amount of money. Look up ledger and trezor as they are the most popular.

A few facts that may clear things up.
1. There is a master private key from which many (far more than you will ever use) addresses can be created. In fact, it is good practice to never reuse an address.
1. The hardware wallet stores the private key on the device. It is never directly revealed to the computer. What it will do is generate a new address and send that to the compute when you ask it to receive coins. When you want to send coins you tell the computer where you are sending them. It then asks for confirmation on the hardware device itself (there are little buttons). When you confirm it it then generates a transaction which says "take address A and send some coins to address B and some coins to this new address C I just created." In this way the private key is never exposed to the computer. (All of this assumes that the devices do what they say they do.)
1. If you record a receive address you can continue to receive at the address forever and you can always later send from that address using your private key once you plug your device in. Remember that transactions occur on the blockchain. If someone sends you bitcoin they will be in that address regardless of whether or not your wallet is plugged in, you are asleep, etc. To send them somewhere else you of course need the private key to authenticate that you are allowed to send those coins.
1. Don't mine for coins. It isn't going to happen. There are websites that will estimate your profits based on hashing power (how many calculations you can do per second) and electricity costs. It doesn't add up favorably.
1. If you want more coins buy them on an exchange such as coinbase. Set up a recurring buy (if your exchange doesn't have it just set a calendar reminder) to buy, $X per week/month. Trying to time the market never works in the long run (you might get it right now and then, but overall it is better to ignore the market). Don't invest more than you can lose. If you are paycheck to paycheck be sure to budget it in. Also, check the fee schedule of your exchange. They usually charge percentage fees with a minimum fee. You want to be above the minimum fee. Reduce your buy in time to stay above that minimum.
1. Remember that crypto is very much unfamiliar territory for most people. Some people will get screwed. The more you understand the less likely this is to happen to you.
1. Keep asking. If someone is a douchebag ignore them and ask someone else.

My strategy (someone tell me if this is bad) has been to keep my ledger on me and my seed on paper in my apartment. If my apartment burns down with me in it then I don't care. If it burns down with me away I still have my ledger and can transfer it somewhere safe. If someone steals my ledger/I lose it I can recover it from the seed at home. The only problem I see is if I lose my ledger and my apartment burns down at the same time. I'm willing to allow for that to be a sufficiently unlikely event that I'm probably fine.

I know that people here don't really want to hear advice from old school investment strategies, but they actually do know what they're talking about.
Trying to time the market almost never works. Ignoring the market and buying and selling on regular intervals is a better strategy. Yes, timing the market is sometimes better, but it is sometimes worse and, on average, is almost always worse. Also, remember that on every trade you are making and thinking it is a brilliant trade, someone is on the other side of the trade also thinking it is a brilliant trade. Are most of the trades being done by someone more or less knowledgeable than you? They are probably more knowledgeable than you because people who do this professionally make lots of trades and casuals make just a few. The only way to make a good trade is if it is right for you. This is where regular buying (putting in a few percent of paycheck on a weekly basis) is a great idea to zone out of all the ups and downs.

The more realistic scenario is that ISPs block all but one chain. Or they block one chain for a time, wait for price disparity within the US to appear, and profit.
And yes, people can mask the blockchain in other traffic, but most people won't.
Finally, if the internet is whitelisted (no websites are available, if you get the social media package then you get access to facebook, twitter, and snapchat, etc.), then all of the above gets even easier. I guess you could always send your transaction to people in other countries and have them put it in the mempool, but you would also have to trust that they did it and that you received coins correctly.

This probably depends on where you work. If you work in a tech place then yeah, probably everyone is crypto-ed up in some form or another. If you work in another field though, it is quite possible that you would be the only one that knows what's going on and people hear "gains gains gains" and don't understand much. In fact, from my experience, many more people than I would have anticipated don't really understand stocks and bonds, so this isn't really that surprising.

Well, the fork at 83 would only happen if a miner modified the code to allow for blocks to occur. The problem is that it could be modified to be one more 1 MB block and then require that 84 is a 2 MB block (which is what the code should have originally done), or modify 83 so that a 2 MB block could be mined thus starting the fork one block sooner.

Sending money securely over the internet costs money. This is what we have learned. Whether credit card or blockchain, someone has to spend money to ensure that it is secure. The idea of flexibility is nice. If you need the money in ten minutes, put 100 sat/b and it'll be there. If a few hours or maybe even days is okay, then do 5 sat/b. There are many cases where waiting a day or two for your money is okay.

If you get paid a large sum to address 1, and then pay your rent from address 1, yes they can see how much went in to address 1, and when it went in.
If you pay some of address 1 into address 2 and then pay from address 2, yes your land lord can trace them back. But there is no way of knowing which addresses are yours and from which ones you were paid from. If you transfer exactly your rent into address 2, you landlord can probably guess that address 1 is also yours. Also, if you do the same thing every month your land lord can probably guess which ones are yours as well.
Remember that just because anyone can see any transaction, there is no way to know which transactions are yours and which aren't. Many of all our transactions probably trace to the silk road at some point, that doesn't mean that we are doing anything illegal.

No plan like this is fool proof. There are two kinds of problems. If you have three people each with a third of the key, then if one of them dies the money's gone. If one of them doesn't like who it is supposed to go to, s/he can lock it up. So the alternative is to add more people to it. Split up the key among six people, giving each a third. But the more people you add, the more likely it is that a subset will collude against you (something that could happen in the first scenario too).

This approach can minimize tax liability actually. Assumptions: 1) asset continue to grow in value, 2) you are going to cash all of it out eventually. In the finance world everyone assumes 2 and not necessarily 1. In the bitcoin world everyone assumes 1 and not necessarily 2.
Anyway, this approach reduces the odds of you bumping into the next tax bracket. Basically, while it might seem like a good idea to take the smallest tax hit now, when you go to cash out the other part later (assuming 2 above), then the tax liability is more and may push you into a higher bracket. In addition, if you take the smaller hit now (assuming 1 above) then you are more likely to be in the short term cap gains regime with a higher tax hit.

One thing to check is your fee schedule. If there is a flat fee per transaction, you may want to wait a bit and buy a bit more all at once.
For example, coinbase has a percentage fee that turns into a flat fee below $200. So if you have $1000 to convert to BTC, it does not matter if you buy 5x$200 or 1x$1000. However, 10x$100 will result in higher fees.

Don't invest in things you don't understand. BTC is new, complicated, and unlike any other financial asset before it (which is why it has been so hard to accurately describe and regulate).
From a financial point of view it falls into the extremely risk extremely high reward category with the risk even higher than normal because exchanges are often sketchy and managing the stuff yourself is pretty tricky.
I only very carefully suggest to friends to get in on it because I don't want a friend dumping too much money in and losing it because of volatility, sketchy exchanges, or mismanaging of wallets.
Also, people only want to buy in when things are looking great for BTC. The problem is that by the time newbs get online and get approved by an exchange, it is often too late. If you want to make money on something over short time scales, you have to a) have an opinion different than the general trends, and b) be right.

The latest one is by Warren Buffett who a) doesn't call bitcoin dead, and b) makes a number of valid points. They aren't deep or interesting, but they aren't wrong either (also, it's probably a decent idea to listen to what he has to say about economics, even if you don't agree with him).

I suspect a lot of the reason it has gone up in the past is because there is a flood of news stories about btc and a lot of it is about how there's a finite number and the rate they are being produced is decreasing and FOMO hits people hard.

Sooo lots of competence?
Anyway, scientist here, NASA does tons of science and has contributed to answering some of the oldest and most important questions humans have wondered about for as long as we have existed. For example thanks to the HST, we now have a firm understanding of the universe's expected life (the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper).
