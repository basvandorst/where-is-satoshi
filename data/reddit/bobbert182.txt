No need... A checksum makes it impossible to fuck up the address. It's actually very difficult to fuck up a bitcoin transaction unless you have a virus or something 
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:48:00
I guess what I meant was that it's nearly impossible to miss-type an address. Of course double checking to see if you're sending it to the correct intended address is smart.

To each there own I guess then. I'd rather have end to end encrypted messages attached to my phone number than have clear text copies of my messages saved on the companies servers. 
Try WhatsApp if you want something different that is end to end encrypted then. Although fundamentally I do think WhatsApp is safe (I trust the crypto and I trust the guy who implemented it, Moxy), it's hard to trust Facebook.
At least Signal is open source. That's the biggest thing.

Ah, that makes sense. Look into Signal, it is a cross platform open source end to end encrypted messenger and encrypted phone application:  Private keys are stored on your phone so there is no way even the organization itself can read or store your messages.

Okay, so it doesn't have an open source license, and can not be redistributed or altered. But the main thing is that the source is freely available and can be audited.
There are plenty of different types of open source licenses, each with different requirements and restrictions on what you can do with them.
So while yes, Mycelium may not be technically open source, for the end users it's an easy way to let them know that the source is available online. And it's most certainly not closed-source.

You're explaining exactly what I'm talking about though. It's not random - it has to come from a seed of some sort. Weather that is from sound from a microphone, a date, a mac address, or user input, it's still not truly random.
It's random enough for our purposes - sure. I generally do trust random number generators, especially those used in modern cryptography. We have come a long way from the old System.Random() libraries.

If anyone had an idea that could do that right now, they would do it, and accept fiat before BTC, simply because it would make them more money and spread faster.
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:34:14
That's awesome! I'm jealous.
I have no idea what stops that from happening to be honest. Because you're right. I would think it would be easy to steal things from BitPay that way.
Maybe that make you wait for a confirmation when a transaction has less than suggested fees. You can always check on blockchain.info how long is estimated before a transaction is included in a block. Maybe if that number is too high, you must wait?
But there are times when fees are not required as well. Fees depend on a number of things, including network congestion, size of transaction (number of btc), number of input addresses, as well as number of inputs (transactions).
For instance, if I mine BTC, and get paid out daily, lets say 0.01 btc per day. After 100 days I'll have 1 BTC. If i go to spend that 1 BTC, there are 100 transactions inputting to the balance of that spending address. I think this generally requires higher fees.

But why would a retailer price an item in BTC when it's (currently, maybe not forever) such a niche market?
You don't want to price things in BTC - that was my point. The price fluctuates too much. You would be constantly changing the price of the item to match the USD price - the price everyone (again, currently) uses.
And it's not like it's difficult at checkout time to pay for X.XX USD in BTC. It's extremely easy. In fact, it's build right into the blockchain.info app. This does not help the retailer do much of anything. It's a publicity stunt.
Also, it looks like they only show 4 decimal places of BTC. What happens if the price skyrockets and you cant price an item in thousandths of a BTC? Can these switch to mBTC or uBTC?
@_date: 2014-01-16 07:05:12
My point is that it's extremely easy to get paid under the table in fiat as well as btc. So just because BTC has the property of allowing you to get paid without the government knowing about it doesn't make it "spy money".
But I do understand what you were saying in your comment.

Not true. 10 billion dollars do not need to be invested in bitcoin for the overall market cap to go up by 10 billion. The market cap is Bitcoins value * the number of BTC in circulation. Not every bitcoin was bought at the current market price.
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:51:15
Very interesting. And yes, of course no POS store is going to make anyone wait for any confirmations.
Another thing is that it's much harder to execute a double-spend when your out at a brick and mortar store. It's much easier when making purchases from your computer.

I just purchased some dice from you through Coinbase, however the transaction timed out after I had already sent the coin to the first address (1DqJKukPCBFvr6LLepMGNBiueX5v82xBNZ) transaction 
Coinbase 10 minute countdown ran out of time and generated a new address, even though I had sent the coins to the first address.
The network propagation of the transaction still seems to be at 0% which is likely why.
Are these coins lost?
Edit: By timed out, I mean the coinbase count down (2 mins 13 seconds left in the image) ran out and the page never registered the transaction. I have a screenshot of the coinbase page asking me to send coins to that address. It looks like using shared coin may have screwed me out of my coins here. The transaction didn't propagate through the network fast enough.
[Here]( is a screenshot of the transaction :(

How are we supposed to take articles seriously when the web site they are displayed on does not even render properly?
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:23:15
Yeah, I'm honestly not sure either. I've had a transaction that I "spent" go unconfirmed for days. I tried then to do a double-spend of the same inputs, but all miners won't accept a double-spend, if the inputs already have a pending transaction. So the double spend failed, and I just had to wait about 3 days total until the whole transaction was dropped. Then my coins were returned, and I could spend them again.
It is hard to perform a double spend though, for the above mentioned reason. All miners will not even consider a transactions with inputs that have already been spent, or are waiting to be confirmed. 
So what has to happen, is you have to first sign a transaction, and that transaction has to reach the merchant. And then you must immediately re-spend those inputs to another address, creating another transaction, and a double spend. And that second transaction has to propagate through the network faster than the first one, so that 50%+ of the network sees the FIRST transaction as the double spend, since the second one got there first. They will then drop the first transaction, thinking it is the second. This is extremely hard to do, and I don't think there is an algorithmic way to do it. It's all chance of network propagation speed.

What I was saying is that people will not want to price things in BTC. Why would anyone want to buy an item that is priced in BTC (currently) when the fiat price of the item could go up or down drastically in a short period of time?
It should be the other way around - until BTC is a leading, or at least decent competing, currency. The price should be set in USD, and the BTC price of it will change to represent the price of the item in USD. Making this price tag kind of useless.
Also, I'm sorry, but how is this allowing people to make purchases with bitcoin?

They could share that easily, yes. But you shouldn't be re-using addresses.
In order to use BTC safely and stay anonymous, you should never recycle an address. Always generate a new one when receiving coins, and when you spend coins, they should go to a new (never before used) change address.
You could also look into using Blockchain.info's CoinJoin mixer. It's basically free, trustless, and makes it *almost* impossible to track where a transaction comes from. On their website it's actually called SharedCoin.

I highly doubt that using a vpn to encrypt your Web traffic to hide from wifi sniffers is broken. 
Perhaps you mean that the nsa could have access to the vpn servers themselves, in which case, you're correct. But that has nothing to do with protecting your self from wifi. If you want to actually hide from the nsa while surfing you probably need to take multiple levels into your attempt such as tor over a vpn together with Javascript turned off

I agree that is a reason that they would not want to attack the blockchain, but it doesn't mean that they won't.

You're completely right. But it's not impossible for a fatal flaw to be found in the technology. There is absolutely no guarantee that it will be worth more long term than it is now.
And I acknowledge that that is also the case with fiat money. I would not advise keeping 100% fiat either. But putting 100% of your life's income into a high risk monetary experiment does not sound like the brightest idea.
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:08:04
Oh yes, you are absolutely correct. It's just that you said "Seems to be more common recently due to whatever issue blockchain.info is trying to resolve.', which I took to mean that you thought it was blockchain.info's fault that some transactions were getting stuck and not confirming. Which is not the case.

Why would miners shut down at 80% minted? That's so arbitrary. Maybe the next halving, sure. But they are not going to just stop randomly.
@_date: 2015-05-29 00:07:19
This fork is a bad example though, as it was a required fork due to a bug, which gave little to no notice.
With a planned hard fork, everyone can update their software days/weeks/months ahead of the actual fork date, so that by the time it actually happens, the majority of miners are already running a node that will switch to the new form automatically.
I believe the current planned date of the fork is to align with the next block halving, which is about a year away anyways.

They could very well just be hashing away and not verifying transactions at all.
Hashing for new BTC is different than verifying transactions. You just need to find a hash to finalize a block.

To what end though? Obviously there is a scaling issue, and it needs to be dealt with. The current state of things is not okay. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:51:42
A BU block is not invalid, if it were invalid it would have been rejected by the network. That's what consensus is. It's perfectly valid.
bitcoin.com did mine an invalid block the other month and it was rejected. This was not rejected. This is a perfectly valid block. It fits the core definition of a block, and falls within the 51% of hash powers consensus. 
Weather or not you like BU or not doesn't matter. You're just talking out of your ass here.
Edit: Ahh, redditor for 7 days. When will I learn to stop feeding the trolls.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:30:10
Totally, and I want Segwit to activate. I'm not opposed to that scaling method at all, I'm all for it. But to say there isn't a problem is just delusional. The network is grinding to a halt and we have noobs left right and centre getting transactions stuck because they don't understand how it all works. It's a huge problem for end users. Huge user experience issue. 
I don't think that the supply and demand economics are going to go away, and I don't want to have unlimited size blocks and and no fee market. I'm all for a fee market. But you can't honestly believe that everything is 'fine' right now and that bitcoin is operating optimally. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:58:09
I know that the block mined in February that was 1.1 MB was invalid.
What I was saying is that this current block is valid. He was saying all BU blocks are invalid which is incorrect.
Re-read my comment above.


@_date: 2017-03-06 19:56:56
You say it's pointless, sure. But you said it was invalid. It's not invalid. Those words mean two different things.
Edit: Also, your blocks will not be rejected by running BU. That issue with bitcoin.com was a bug, and it has been fixed, so now BU does fit within consensus. Not sure what you're talking about.
I'm not arguing for BU over segwit. Quite the opposite. I want segwit activated. But I'm just trying to let people know that you're spreading misinformation.

This. So many people I know are starting to get interested in this space, but feel like they have missed the boat. Everyone seems to think that it can't possibly go up more, but that stems from a severe lack of understanding of what this space is.
I still hear people ask "But what is it backed by? How do you know they wont just make more of them?" etc.
I wonder when they will start to jump in. There will be a tipping point where crypto becomes a normal part of everyone's investment portfolio. It's starting to happen, but there are still so many people with 0 exposure. I wonder at what point people will accept that it's not going away and jump in.
I've been telling people to just put in 1% of there savings. Just 1%. What can that hurt? It's just more diversifying at that point. And I have a feeling that 1% could easily turn into 25% for them down the road.

Your BTC are still in your original wallet then. The wallet just doesn't recognize that the BTC are there.
You need to export the private key to a different wallet and try to re-send the transaction, or re-scan the blockchain with the original wallet. Somehow you need to get the original wallet to realize the coins are not gone. Or just import that PK to a new wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:25:01
This is ridiculous. Most gold is sold on exchanges or ETFs, which are equal to off chain transactions. Not the same thing. All trading on on exchanges does not go on to the blockchain. Same thing with if/when the ETF gets approved.

We definitely pay CC/Debit fees here in Canada for each transaction. Not sure where you're from, but those companies generally don't offer their services for free...

It's pretty frigging hard to send BTC to the wrong address. They have checksums in their addresses, so you can't just screw it up while typing it (who types them manually anyways?)
The only thing would be if you had a virus and it changed the copy/paste address to a malicious one and you dind't notice.

So what happens when instead of someone spamming the blockchain, there are simply more users and regular real transactions fill up the blocks instead?
Anyone can send any transaction they want - that's the beauty of bitcoin. But we're at a point now where the protocol is getting bogged down, and we need to fix it. I guess you could hope that they attackers stop, but the longer they do it, maybe the faster the devs will push out a fix.
A stress test/attack like this should not be enough to stop people from sending transactions.

Bitcoin in it's current state is not good for small/micro transactions. Layers and abstractions will be built on top of it and eventually it will. But for now, don't send $0.50 with bitcoin.
Every blockchain has scaling issues. It's not unique to bitcoin. You can use other blockchains, but the underlying problem is the same. They all need layers and abstractions. Using LTC is a good option, but only works because LTC is magnitudes less popular than BTC. If it were popular, it would be expensive too. Same with ETH and any other coin you can think of.
@_date: 2015-04-12 21:50:38
If bitcoin ever truly does take off, it won't be in the way that your imagining it.
It will be in a way that is similar to the current banking system, just using bitcoin in the background to move large amounts of money between banks/businesses.

This has the added benefit of not having massive  unknown quantities of the money in control of one group or person.

It did when they first claimed that. Then the developers changed it and the miners supported it. That's the beauty of software, it can be changed over time.

@_date: 2015-02-09 19:05:58
This is going to be news every few months, unless bitcoin completely dies.
Even with prices going lower, technology advancement and moores law still apply.
And besides, if I had already spent the thousands of dollars on mining equipment months ago when BTC was worth more, I'm sure not going to turn the equipment off just because I'm not making as much as I thought I was. And electricity costs are not as relevant as everyone thinks, because you also have to offset the price of the equipment initially.

PCI applies to Canada too. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:12:41
... What is this subreddit coming to
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:02:58
The proof of work worked when a small number of people were mining with laptops and cpus. The mining itself is different from verifying transactions. And the fact that more people are investing more money in crazy expensive super mining computers means that it costs way more money overall in electricity and pollution than it did just last year. And it's only going to get worse.
Yes, computers get better and more efficient over time, but there will simply be more of them.
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:41:12
This is probably why s/he wants to sell...
After every large increase in price we've seen like this, even in a bull market, the price tends to drop down by about 50% of the increase. 
From there, it will either continue up, OR (likely in our bear market) go back down to where it was before.
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:35:01
Seriously, wtf? Mining is wasteful as fuck. I'm not saying I don't believe in Bitcoin, but you can't honestly make an argument that mining could be WAY more energy efficient.
And barely any money needs trucks like this. Maybe ATMs. But for the most part, we don't need trucks to move numbers from one database to another.
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:35:16
Ahh, makes sense. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:40:44
Yes, seriously. This subreddit is getting worse by the week. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 09:40:00
I think most of these people care more about BTC withdrawals.
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:09:14
That's pretty much how I feel too. I remember reading an article about a new online currency you could mine with your computer, and I didn't really understand or care enough.
But I still do think back to that day, and wish I had have just kept playing around with it, just a little longer. I was too busy drinking and wasting away the early years of university to mine BTC I guess.
@_date: 2015-02-17 08:15:11
This is a repost. So thanks for that.
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:27:13
I thought he posted it from the same account he used from the beginning? Unless someone got control of his account. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:11:18
Yup! I got a MintChip dev kit, I was gonna try to develop something for it. It's still sitting around here somewhere.
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:47:35
I was wondering the same thing. I assume they mean through a third party, like gyft.
Kind of ironic, isn't it?

How many times do we need to post the same story?
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:26:23
More money to be made pushing the price down and getting more coins. Especially if it goes up in the long run 
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:57:57
I'm not sure if he has to verify or not. He might be able to sell them without verifying, but I don't know if you can withdraw money without verifying.
Also, tell him that he should really look into paying taxes on the money he makes from selling over 100K of BTC, because the Canadian government knows about Bitcoin, and is going to ask where that money came from.
CaVirtex has a debit card withdrawl option, maybe he could get one of those? Again, don't know what you can do without being verified. Check out there website and try to find out.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:24:36
Yup, they got fucked.

@_date: 2013-11-04 20:18:30
Not that I think the value of BTC will ever go this high, but in this case, we could simply edit the source code of Bitcoin to allow people to spend even smaller fractions of their coins. Would be pretty easy to do.
@_date: 2013-03-23 07:07:03
You could lost it entirely if the market completely crashes.
But even then, I guess it's possible for it to go back up again in the future.

Who are these people?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:26:38
It's called exponential growth, price discovery, and the network effect.
And a bubble.

@_date: 2013-04-08 15:42:56
You can't really use that one as an example, as it's a default. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:30:03
But we're not talking about selling at the peaks. Although that is what I would love to do, obviously, we're talking about making money off the growing market, then cashing out, and buying back in when it stabilizes to guarantee our earnings while risking some more potential earnings.
I've already almost doubled my money in two weeks, so cashing out will still not be a bad thing, even if it goes to $400. Although obviously I would to wait until that point, It will still be nice to make some dollars and guarantee my value in BTC stays at roughly double what I paid in the beginning of the bubble, It's nice to also cash out at certain times to be safe.

@_date: 2013-10-23 21:07:49
I sold 1/3 of my coins (so one coin lol) at 200 just to get some money back on my initial investment. Still hoping to see it hit at least the peak of the last bubble in April before this one pops, but who knows.

This is my current plan. I hope LibertyBit starts allowing Interac ETransfer withdrawals soon too.

Of course this bubble is going to burst in a spectacular fashion yet again. But it's going to be a correction, and it won't last forever.

@_date: 2013-11-17 23:04:10
What? You can spend as much or as little on BTC as you want, it makes no difference.
In psycology, sure, it makes a difference. But in reality, no. You're completely wrong. It's just as easy to buy "bulk" BTC as it is to buy 0.0001 BTC.

Most people here will likely help you for free. I can answer some questions for you if you want. 
Also, offering to pay people in a Bitcoin thread with PayPal is just silly ;) 
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:41:36
Fees are optional, but most miners choose not to verify transactions that have no fees.
There have already been blocks that have had multiple BTC fees. And if Bitcoin actually takes off as a legitimate payment system, it won't take many reward halfings before fees outweigh the block reward. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:51:31
None of the SHA256 altcoins are worth anything....
@_date: 2013-05-13 09:19:37
Did you not know about your wealth during the last bubble, when 1 BTC was worth $260 at its peak? 
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:24:32
The fact of the matter is that if you tried to do this, you would wind up driving the price up by buying MASS quantities of coin...
Do you really think you could try to buy every BTC in existence and that you would not have any affect on the market? It would skyrocket so fast that you would hit $22M before you knew it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:58:14

Awesome, except SSL is no longer really considered safe...
Edit: I know this is very case-specific in the form of protecting credit card information, but still. The fact that SSL is no longer PCI compliant means that I think we should reconsider it being the "standard" for cryptographic security.

Vogogo can be a bit slow, but I've never had it take that long. I've made three deposits with them, and all have gone through in ~3-4 business days.
Although, I really do with there was a faster way for me to get money into CaVirtex.
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:17:49
Indeed. It's because Mt. Gox sucks ass. The only people buying there are people with money stuck there. Eventually that exchange won't matter.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:26:01
Yes, newer versions use a different local database
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:02:37
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:30:57
I disagree. People will spend it, little by little, even as it's rising in price, because most people will spend money when they have a lot more of it than they are used to.
Plus, the rest that they are left with will continue to grow, so just don't spend all of it. Maybe 10%.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:23:55

Download Electrum. It's a great client that does not require syncing the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:20:05
No one wants to use only satoshis. We don't want to have to pay 700 million satoshis when making a purchase. It just sounds stupid imo.
But we can keep moving the decimal places back and use different fractions for measuring BTC depending on the exchange rate to keep it looking reasonable.
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:34:38
The price just jumped again by another $5 to 133, and it took much less than 1.2 Million.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:43:47
Yes, there will be a crash. But it wont go down as far as it did before this "bubble", and it still has a ways to go I think. I wouldn't sell yet.
But good advice. Sort of.

You can choose to pay any fee you want you know.
Or, it was a programming error in someones software and someone will be upset with themselves.
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:57:27
This is actually incorrect. Maybe phycologically people think this way, but that thinking is wrong. If the price of BTC increases, sure, the shares actually cost a lot more, but the payout of the shares is also directly related to the value of BTC. So sure, as the value of BTC rises, the cost of a single share of ASICMiner also rises, but so does the payout.
@_date: 2013-09-10 06:30:35
It would still be relatively easy for a company to direct a percentage of it's income to a private address as well I would think.

Not sure about that site, but I highly doubt it. Buying BTC with credit cards is almost impossible due to the possibility of chargebacks.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:23:48
I know, that's why I included it in the comment. But that still seems insane to me. I paid a decent fee, and the transaction was almost a full bitcoin, and it still took over 48 hours.

There have been backdoors hidden in the Linux kernel that have been caught in the code review process before... So what makes you think that absolutely everything that is open-source is that much safer? Sure, the public can access the code, but everyone depends on everyone else to make sure that the open-source code is actually safe, and really good "hackers" and developers can make even unsuspicious looking code malicious.

@_date: 2013-10-22 06:22:46
I'm not saying that it would catch on to all 7 (Relatively soon to be 8) billion people, but you are forgetting that 50% of all BTC has already been mined, and many of those coins are likely lost forever. So 21 mln BTC is a high estimate for the total as well.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:13:45

OP knows that the value of Fiat is not going anywhere anytime soon, and BTC is extremely volatile, so cashing out a bit (certainly not all) is just securing his "investment". 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:11:40
That's not what he meant. Yes, we are half-way to having produces all coins that will ever exist, but he is talking about the value of a single coin.
That is exactly what this whole thing is about. No one knows the actual value of one BTC. But the market is trying to figure itself out.
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:31:21

The only way that it wont stay that way is if they figure out a way to break encryption. And if that happens, I'll be a bit more worried about other things than how valuable my BTC are.
Quantum computers though... Who knows what could happen.

It's because of their first technological feat that they can afford to be on the forefront of this second one.

Lol. By how quickly it's being adopted? It's not being adopted quickly. People are all buying on speculation that it WILL be adopted in the future.
@_date: 2013-08-19 22:44:19
Sorry to break it to you, but chances are it will not remain profitable to mine BTC at home for long. You will have to keep reinvesting in new ASICs over and over again to stay just marginally ahead of the curve, and large companies with lots of money can afford to do this much faster than you can.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:35:00

If we're going to have a backup, it should at least do something different, and not be a blatant copy. It does nothing that BTC does, so if BTC fails, so does LTC I'm afraid.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:08:30
That's pretty much it yeah. The thief uses brute force and massive dictionaries of books/poems/anything to string words together and try to guess a brain wallet. And once he guesses a correct phrase that has been used by someone, they can access their coins.
They are not seriously flawed if you are smart about generating the words. But they should not be any words that have ever been written down or digitized ever in that sequence. It should be completely random, which makes it difficult to remember.
If you're going to use a brain wallet, invest some time into remembering a COMPLETELY random string of words.
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:37:10

@_date: 2013-11-22 01:07:40
Mostly likely, no one has access to that address. There are only a few public/private key pairs that anyone has access to out of the total number of possible ones. I would say that it is EXTREMELY unlikely that anyone currently has access to whatever address he sent those coins to.
Edit: Sorry. I didn't really read the whole thing. I thought he mistyped the address and was off by a character or something.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:16:39

@_date: 2013-10-30 06:30:07
Your card will mine in MH/s for Bitcoin because Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which is much faster to calculate compared to the Scrypt hashing algorithm that Litecoin uses. Just because you have a lower hashrate does not mean you make less money.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:46:46
Hence, encryption.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:44:51

Make a backup of the wallet file, (encrypted) and store it in a couple places. Including an online cloud storage space, so you can never lose it. You should probably double encrypt the wallet file if you're putting it on something like dropbox.

@_date: 2013-11-07 02:12:06
When has it ever been not rocky?
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:52:48
Because even with ASICs running on SAH256 for millions of years, we would still not generate every hash possible. Think about it - It's going to take 100+ years for all BTC to be released, and the difficulty is going to be INSANE by that time. But they will still be hashing away.
Plus, unless all the pre-post hashes are stored in a database, it's not really that bad for passwords. You would have to brute force each time rather than using a lookup table.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:33:47

Not a mistake. It's true. Mining is pretty much not worth getting into at this point.
Wait a few months and try again.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:20:41
My only problem with this is that if I want to buy coins when it crashes, I have to put money in the exchanges right now so that I am ready for a crash. However, if I have money in an exchange right now, I am tempted to buy now as the price is still increasing, and I have no way of knowing when the "crash" will be. If it goes to $1000 and then crashes and stabilizes around $500, it's still better for me to have purchased right now.
However, waiting for a crash and stabilization is an easier way to increase your chances of turning a profit.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:16:22
Perfect! Thank you very much.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:51:39
Because it can all be done inside a local database on their servers.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:03:40
This is true, but so is the opposite. He might get 1.2 Million out of a 990K place. It's a gamble.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:16:17
I agree with you, because this is kind of a catch 22. In order for BitCoin to become "ready" for the majority of the world, it needs to be a known entity. It can not and will not be ready for legitimate use until it successfully goes through this current phase.
And this IS a phase. What is happening to BitCoin right now is the definition of something going viral. And all things that go viral go through times of EXTREMELY massive growth, and then eventually the growth slows, and sometimes halts.
But this growth/viral period is necessary for BitCoin's legitimacy. As more people find out about BitCoin, regardless of their intention or stance on it, it will become more and more "ready".
BitCoin is still discovering some of it's own potential.

Lol of course it is... But this still makes no sense. You're comparing two different things.
Eventually people are not going to be able to afford to buy a single BTC unless they are wealthy. What is the problem with that? It still makes absolutely 0 difference.
If you are buying 10 dollars worth of BTC, it doesn't matter if you buy 5 BTC or 0.005 BTC. It is still worth $10, and still has the same chance of going up or down in this crazy market.
Like I said, in psychology, sure, people want full coins. But who cares? It makes no difference.

I'm sorry, but the higher currency cap doesn't make a difference. As long as you can split the currency up to smaller and smaller amounts, it doesn't matter how many units there are.
There could be 210 million BTC valued at $50 each, or 21 million BTC at $500 each. It makes no difference.
And the confirmation times are faster with LTC yes. But if the confirmation times ever become a real issue, the beauty about Bitcoin is that it's open source, and we can change the code.

This is sort of what I'm counting on. If this is the case, it will allow the people who really do want a future for BTC (not to just make a quick buck) to "re-invest" when the prices are lower, and start using BTC as a real currency when it's not so volatile.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:12:33

All transaction fees that are paid in all transactions in a single block get paid out to the miner who solves the proof of work, on top of the current 25 btc reward. So right now, the miner who solves every block gets 25 + fees of all transactions included in that block. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:12:34
Exactly. The beauty is that you can buy back in with the money you made, and still have the same value of BTC, without risking the major loss. And you're already cashing in on your earnings.
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:06:47
The only risk is that you avoid immediately selling coins (although I would, especially in times like this) and take a risk on losing money due to price fluctuations.
Aside from that, I really so no way that accepting Bitcoin could ever turn out to be a bad decision for a company.
Unless it's a big company that requires more work and maintenance being put into supporting Bitcoin than it acually generates in revenue. Which I think is unlikely, given that it's mostly tech savvy people using Bitcoin right now that would require little teaching. Although if Bitcoin does take hold of the general population, we're going to need that to change.

@_date: 2013-09-25 20:54:21
To me, that doesn't mean that the value will go up. That just means that the profitability of mining is going to go down.
Plus, if that's the case and we know that the value is going to go up because people will make less coins mining and thus want to sell them for more money to make up for the lost profits, why wouldn't they just buy BTC in the first place instead of spending money to mine coins that are going to be worth less in the long run?
Edit: I accidentally a word.

Even long term, we don't know. We can just guess.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:42:54
I agree with you, and I do think that I could miss out on more profits by doing this. Because, say the price stabilizes in a month around $400, and I cashed out at $200. Then yes, I'm losing a ton of potential profits.
But, since I bought at $125, I have still made a decent amount of money, which I can be 100% confident in keeping by cashing out (at least a percentage) now, and buying back in whenever the market stabilizes (doesn't matter if it's higher or lower).
Say I made $600, and I cash out now. If I re-invest in BTC later, even if the price has still gone up, I still have $600 worth of BTC, just not the same number of BTC I had when I sold. It's reducing the risk.
Of course you're risking potential profits when you do this. You're also removing the risk of potential losses.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:49:13

@_date: 2013-11-09 01:02:35
MtGox and Coinbase are extremely different services. MtGox is an exchange, meaning people can buy/sell BTC at whatever value that they want to. If I have 1 BTC, I can post it "for sale" on MtGox (or any other exchange) for $600 if I want to. And then just wait for someone to buy it. That will never happen until the price of BTC is actually at $600, becase anyone buying will always buy at the lowest posted price.
Coinbase operates a bit differently. Basically, you put some money into Coinbase, and when your money clears, they will buy you as much BTC as they can with the money you gave them at the current exchange rate. You don't really have a choice in how much you pay for the BTC.
With MtGox, If the price is $340, you can put in a buy order at $335 and see if anyone accepts it by choosing to sell at $335.
MtGox is generally not considered the best exchange because it is really hard to withdraw USD from them. Also, (because of that problem) their prices are usually higher than other exchanges. But for simply buying BTC, they are fine. Another exchange you could look into using is BitStamp. That is the exchange that is generally used to determine the current value of BTC.
Secondly, if you buy X BTC today, it really doesn't matter which buying service you use. Whichever one you want should work. You can then turn around and sell those BTC on any exchange you want, or in person. Or spend them. Or throw them out. You can do whatever you want with them. It doesn't matter.
There are always people trying to manipulate the BTC market, but it seems to be getting harder and harder. That said, yes, someone with a couple million lying around could easily shake things up a little but. But this question is really difficult to answer. No one really knows when BTC will "crash", or what value it will go to when it does.

Since you're not going to lose any BTC anyways, it makes no difference. You can use the same blockchain so that you don't have to redownload everything, but just create a new wallet. It makes absolutely no difference.

He means the price is artificially inflated too high. People are valuing it at more than what some people holding it think it's worth. So they sell it. And that causes the price to go down to what people actually think it's worth.
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:51:26
Yes, but miners are doing more than just mining for new Bitcoins. They are verifying transactions in the blockchain to make sure that transactions are legitimate. Why would anyone mine if there was absolutely no reward for doing so? The fees just give people a reason to keep mining once the reward for solving a block becomes too small or all of the coins have been mined.

If the number of Bitcoin transactions keeps increases exponentially, the value of all of those fees will be quite high. In fact, the profits to be made from fees will become more profitable than the actual "free" Bitcoins long before they run out. We already have had blocks that have had miltiple BTC worth of transaction fees.
Plus, as long as the network never becomes subject to a 51% attack, the hash rate does not matter. The network will still be secure. Actually, the overall hashrate does not matter whatsoever, the security of the network is effected by the number of different pools/networks/individuals mining, and their ability to attain 51% of the processing power.

But what makes you think that LTC is going to take off? Honestly?
The only people investing in LTC are the people that feel like they missed the boat on BTC, and are hoping that LTC takes off so they can become rich on it. But honestly, what advantages does LTC have over BTC? And if you really think LTC is going to take off, then why not BBQcoin or PrimeCoin? Why do you value LTC over those other coins?
If cryptocurrencies ever do go mainstream, there will be one winner. Not two. Maybe it will be LTC. But if it is, BTC has to fail miserably. The network affect wont allow for two winners, and BTC already has a giant head start.
Also, if you claim that people will invest in LTC because it's cheaper, what happens if it is worth $100 one day? Will people stop buying it and buy BBQcoin instead because it's cheaper and they want 1 of something rather than 0.5 of something?
These coins are not real. You can't hold them, so it doesn't matter if you have fractions.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:57:39
Oh I completely agree. It's a lesson well learned. And if these coins were all in a shared wallet that only distinguishes different amounts to different users based on a lookup table in a database, then that is sad. And basically asking to get robbed.

What people often forget too is that it is possible for Bitcoin to eventually be broken down to even more than 8 decimal places if required. It would not take a ton of programming to change this, and the Bitcoin project is still in a beta - there is development going into it all the time.
This would effectively make it a non-deflationary currency, as if you needed more of it to split up between more people, you could just start using even smaller denominations of the the coin.

I'm thinking that the huge jump to $289 was one guy buying a ton of BTC up all at once. And it might sit around this price, or even drop a little bit.
But I hope it hits $300/BTC today.

I'm not worried about losing money with BitCoin, I can afford to lost what I have put in.
But I would like to buy low sell high and buy again low during big bubbles to increase my total number of BTC. THe long term plan is still holding.
Obviously I'm not going to risk all my coins in this, but some, yes.

I don't mean to highjack this thread, but I am also wondering why CaVirtex prices are so high? As far as I know it is not an issue getting money out of CaVirtex, so I can't imagine why anyone would keep buying there when it's even higher than Gox!?
Unless it's just the fact that it's pretty much Canada's only exchange, and the supply is limited so people are forced to pay a premium...

With so many accounts in queue for opening up MtGox accounts, even if huge money goes into bitcoin investing in the near future, there are still tons of individuals who want to "invest" in small amounts of BTC, that will keep the demand up and the prices up for at least a little while. Big money can invest and drop the price temporarily, which might even cause some panic selling from people who don't want to lose their "invested" money in a crash, but the demand will still outweigh the supply for a while yet. Big money investing in BTC will just generate more interest in it, and more interest will generate more people.
Don't underestimate the power of numbers. Many people making small BTC trades can effect the value of BTC more than few people making large transactions.

A transaction takes sixes confirmations, that is, six blocks, before it is completely confirmed, which generally takes about one hour. 
Many merchants will accept a transaction immediately, especially if it is small. In doing this, there is a small (generally very small) risk that the buyer could double spend the coins. But usually transactions are pretty much good to go immediately, and also certainty after one confirmation. 
And you are correct about what you said. Sending money to any address will either succeed or fail. There is no way to screw it up really unless you use an incorrect address. One thing you should never do is submit a transaction with 0 fees. Then miners can choose not to process the transaction, and it might it there unconfirmed (and unspendable) for hours

He wants to try to short the market, which is extremely difficult to do. You pretty much have to be sitting with your finger on the trigger when the bubble pops to sell, and buy again when it's low.
But humans are terrible at deciding what's low and what's high. And We also second guess ourselves a lot, and make stupid emotional decision that make timing a market difficult. Most people lost money trying. Some make it.
For the average person it's probably better to just hold.
@_date: 2013-10-13 23:18:32
I'm wondering this as well. Does it have anything to do with Canada?
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:19:21
This is very true. Both the buyer and seller win in this scenario, but people still only see the negative, thinking 'Shit. If I had have waited, I could have gotten it even cheaper'. Which is true. But is still a gamble. You might have also gotten it for more if BTC falls. And it's tough to predict.

Anyone operating a mixing service that actually keeps any record of past transactions is a complete idiot. And if they didn't a warrant would be completely useless. Unless I'm missing something?
You're also assuming that the public addresses of the mixing service are public knowledge. How is anyone supposed to know which of the addresses in a particular block are mixing addresses, or final destination addresses?
Also, mixers don't necessarily send funds in one chunk. So if your input is 0.12345 BTC, you could easily look for another transaction output with 0.12345 BTC, yes. But any decent mixer would send the coins in small chunks to eliminate this problem. They could send them in any number of chunks, eliminating this risk.

The only thing I see is them being adopted simultaneously, since adoption is just starting for bitcoin, and some people are already choosing to adopt bitcoin + altcoin because implementing one more is extremely trivial.
And one could eventually just die out over time.
Doubt it will happen, but if it does, that's how I see it happening.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:40:54
It would accelerate hyperinflation of their fiat currency, absolutely. But it would also increase the value of BTC, wich they have tons of. So their money is worth less, but BTC is worth more. Could they not use this method to keep BTC market prices high, while using the profits that they make from selling BTC at higher prices, to pay off the "debt" that they have created for themselves in their fiat currency?

You would have to edit the source code. And this is not necessarily easy because of the way integers work in a computer. There is a maximum number that can be stored in a single integer variable.
They won't ever create more bitcoins. What will happen is that if they start becoming too scarce and a satoshi is worth enough that it needs to be broken down even more, they will just add more decimal places (again, by editing the source code). This still keeps the number of BTC constant, but allows someone to spend smaller fractions of it.
This is not creating more money. Just think of it as someone allowing you to spend half a cent instead of a fully penny.

Honestly, do it for fun, but I think that even spending $10 on a USB ASIC miner (you can find them for that) you will lose money (given the current difficulty and exchange rate).
You can make more money mining Litecoins then using a USB ASIC right now. And if you really do want to get into the ASIC game for mining, I suggest watinig for a little while. Right now is a crazy time, thousands of ASICs are being shipped out to buyers that bought 6 months ago, and they are all coming online at the same time. The difficulty is going to keep going up for a few months yet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:46:46
Fucking stop asking this question. If anyone knew the answer to this, they would be rich as balls.
Of course it could go above what it is worth now. It mostly likely will. And there will most likely be a correction in the coming weeks. But no one can tell you when. No one knows.
And we can't say if we reccomend buying. I bought a bit yesterday, so I would say yes, I think it's going to continue going up for a bit. But short term, it might not. Who knows.
Most people here think that it will go up long term regardless, so buying at any time is likely smart.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:32:47
It's mostly speculation. I would say over 75%.

What would stop people from generating private BTC addresses to get paid to, and having some companies that are willing to dabble in a bit of fraud to pay a percentage out to that address? No one would know where the address originated from or who it belongs to.

It is possible to build an ASIC for Scrypt, just much more difficult. But if LiteCoin were go ever take off, of course it would happen.

I remember reading an article about Bitcoin when it was first released, and thinking that it sounded awesome. I wanted to try mining, and attempted to get a laptop I had at the time (Core 2 Duo) set up to CPU mine them.
Boy do I wish I had not have given up so quickly on figuring out how to get mining to work.
Oh well, bought for the first time in March for ~$40 and have not looked back. Although I have spent a lot of those coins, (damn you Butterfly Labs), I have still made some money of off BTC's inflation.

@_date: 2013-10-23 20:29:39
But we're not talking about selling at the peaks. Although that is what I would love to do, obviously, we're talking about making money off the growing market, then cashing out, and buying back in when it stabilizes to guarantee our earnings while risking some more potential earnings.
I've already almost doubled my money in two weeks, so cashing out will still not be a bad thing, even if it goes to $400. Although obviously I would to wait until that point, It will still be nice to make some dollars and guarantee my value in BTC stays at roughly double what I paid in the beginning of the bubble, It's nice to also cash out at certain times to be safe.

People's speculation on what they think it will be worth to someone else in the future.

I don't think you have missed it, you're still miles ahead of the majority of the world. Unless your in it for the short term, this is just the beginning. It may take a few years, but it's either gonna go sky high, or crash and burn in the next couple of years. And if it does go sky high, you're still in at a low price.
