 Bitcoin goes through same process. Some investors are in for a quick return while some are in for the long ride.

 When bitcoin goes up, there are articles that talk about how it's the future and how blockchain technology can change the world, etc.   
 
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:16:00
 I think the way is how we use it well and we must together uphold bitcoin in order to survive until the future and until the end of life later and I want the bitcoin to help and be useful for the people in this world 
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:25:12
 I think China will soon be legalizing bitcoin in the future. I realize that there are many bitcoin investors coming from China although this country does not support electronic money. Many factories to exploit bitcoin are built here. From here, I see that the Chinese government may soon be legalizing bitcoin.

  if you have already used some recovery program, tell us the name. We can only suggest you 'better' tools if we know which tools you have tried.

 It seems to me that people are bad about bitcoin simply because they do not understand it 
@_date: 2018-10-17 15:32:22
 here is local taxes only for using bitcoins and there is no information that IRS regulated taxes on bitcoin mining separately. We don't need to pay anything apart from that. US government treated bitcoin and other digital currency as a property for US federal tax purposes

 sooner or later the bank will accept cryptocurrency  
especially crypto which is related to banking or centralized 
@_date: 2018-10-13 19:03:45
 
it only shows that cyptocurrency investing is currently one of the hottest investments as if now. And lastly, this would make for a good amount of diversity in the cryptocurrency world once cryptocoins become official currencies.  
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:27:23
  China has expressed her complete unsupported for Bitcoin and more worse crypt o. Also, with USA, they'll debate over this for years and they'll never accept, not with the old head economist hating Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not only phenomenal but also one of the most amazing currencies in the world.

 Facebook is banned from all types of ads for virtual currency, including Bitcoin and ICO. This is part of a policy against fraudsters. The book will no longer accept ads that "promote misleading products or services or promote fraudulent behavior."

 Quit Bitcoin and sell at your BTC at cheap today and regret later." thats every newbies mistake. They panic sell mostly of doubting too much, others who have more experience -take risks, follow the market and sell during bull market

 If in the future any alternative currency implements the new principles of existence and sale of information

 Cryptocurrencies will face some major problems like- ban from another few countries, hacking of major exchangers and personal wallets,  
@_date: 2018-10-21 10:07:54
 They were, are and will be. And it seems to me to fight with them very difficult. The second problem is the scam ICO projects that do not pay out to both investors and bounty participants. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:27:03
 A very good thing for China. America allows the use of it but not really. They just let their citizen to do so. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 14:50:16
 The smallest of them has banned all the cipher-related ads on major platforms like Google and Facebook. Yes, that is true. Even many online advertising companies are forbidding the cryptos just because the scams are not due to bitcoin issues. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:00:27
 five years from now i think bitcoin will be the world largest crytocurrency, 2 years ago when i start buying bitcoin it is only 200-300$ but now it is 3500-4000$ in range what if in 5 years. bitcoin will be 10000-20000$ maybe of higher because bitcoin grows very fast and more people accepting bitcoin as payment. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:34:56
 yes definitely bitcoin is a new phenomenal innovation and day by day it is just growing bigger and expanding in a tremendous way and it is so helpful for daily life and according to economy of a people. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:25:35
 Bitcoin is made for Asian first and probably the first legalization will come to asia. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:17:09
 it can last up to any time while there is still user 
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:35:09
 Nothing comes close to the power of Bitcoin and I believe that bitcoin will continue to grow better and better. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 14:06:45
 Being the main concept of Bitcoin has become the basis for alternative currencies. As the first car, on the basis of which construction principles the automotive industry further developed.  
@_date: 2018-10-21 07:46:34
 If you mean the government "accepts" bitcoin in terms of legality, then sure. It has a significant effect, whether or not if it's actually going to be used for payments or for store-of-value only. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 10:08:32
 Hacking and scamming will be something that we can fix. Regulation is the only hurdle, and always will be. When we break free from this restraint, it will boom! 
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:40:47
 Maybe you have given this thought and analysis to your friend. There are many opinions, advice and perceptions and complaints about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:01:56
 while regulation it will passed to some hard requirements to comply, for bitcoin will be legit to be use. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:32:43
 We will keep promoting it no matter what trials we have experienced.We must keep up the good work until the end of our journey. �� 
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:40:29
 I think these are some of the many dramas that were created to try to destroy the bitcoin price but I think it is not very effective but it makes the bitcoin price very expensive. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:07:43
 Having fluctuations above 10% on a regular basis definitely puts it in a phase where it is not stable at all and there will be a time 
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:21:45
 Damn thats nice, so you actually started out mining instead of investing ? When you want it to drop it never does and vice versa haha. So what are you looking for now then ? To get back in the mining game or are you more looking to invest, trade and hodl for a bit ? 
@_date: 2018-11-10 21:21:10
Bitcoin is just a technology, and there is no right or wrong at all.  
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:07:35
 Bitcoin will go through such stage for a long time in the future till it overcomes all its shortcomings and becomes stable once and for all.
@_date: 2018-11-11 08:38:55
 
but the good thing is. we can actually push-back and get them deceptive revs who want to call bitcoins utility broke. to get out of their role. if they cant fix it on the martinet 
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:07:45
when it will show signs on stability before becoming stable permanently. Till then it will remain in developmental state. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:40:56
 This digital currency is not controlled or operated by any country's government. because Bitcoin is decentralized currency. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:03:41
 Bitcoin are more potential and profitable. if bitcoin get ETF approval it will  be increasing investor security. it will make more profit for investor. people are increasing their investment here. it is a very good sign for bitcoin.

 People often blame their mistakes on other things, which only exposes human weaknesses
@_date: 2018-11-05 17:40:31
  the price will not go that far, that's economic principle, and for now i really don't see a phenomenal use-case for bitcoin such as micro payments usage contracts, etc... but i am positive till come out soon 
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:21:59
 
I had experience for a year, and I understand a lot now.
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:32:37
 It seems to be very difficult because they are also affected with the government and not only that bitcoin haters are also so much that makes them more powerful and happy to destroy bitcoin prices,
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:41:03
Whites can control the bitcoin. They can heat the market in the moment. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:32:19
 Every people is hard to please, I think introducing the Bitcoin more is a great way to prove them wrong because no matter how we prove them wrong without knowing the concept, It is a very difficult thing, because they need to understand the concept first  and thats how they will understand. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 08:39:03
then they are outdated and need to be replaced. and then get those that really support bitcoin to concentrate on bitcoin main net innovation and growth. not them silly other networks
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:07:21
 
We fail to see where btc is currently and only look at what we want or expect it to be. Barely a year, BTC was $2k
@_date: 2018-11-10 21:21:14
The people who use it will have good or bad points, but the technology is not wrong. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:32:59
 Bitcoin is really hard to believe in first time you hear it because it is really possible that the digital currency will exist and will be successful. But there’s a lot of people proved that it is really existing and now huge of people depend on it. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:07:09
 A few downward slope is always expected per time, and no one is expecting BTC to shoot up to the sky in value each passing day but at this point i think the people expects a considerable state of stability; the falling rate is just too high. But at the end of the day it is a volatile currency, so expect just about anything. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:33:09
Those basher of bitcoin Obwant to say you are wrong what you think about bitcoin because in my experience bitcoin has a lot of help in my life.
