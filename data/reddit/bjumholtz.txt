The one I'm still curious about is if it is a pyramid scheme. Seriously.. the only way to get bitcoins is to mine them with computers and electricity. It isn't exactly a real representation of actual work achieved which is what fiat currency was created for.
The only thing I can think of is that when all the limited coins are mined, the work in completing the blockchain encryption will be the payoff for the 'pioneers'.. but then it will be used as fiat just like everything else, so I still don't get the point.
This is not meant to be an inflammatory comment.. I've been mining bitcoins off and on for years and have yet to see anything from it so I stopped wasting my electricity - I have experience with it but I choose not to participate anymore. I'm not jealous as much as I just shrug my shoulders at the idea that I could actually gain any wealth at it now.
If anyone can explain to me how it isn't a pyramid scheme - this article just says people think so because some people got rich; that isn't much of a reason to me since I've been familiar with bitcoin since before there was serious money to be had (i.e. pizza-age). Thank you.

Speaking as someone who has stayed on the sidelines for these very reasons you speak of (and isn't exactly an expert on this): where are all the Bitcoins Mt. Gox "lost"? Isn't Bitcoin a finite resource? And if all it takes is the means to mine them in the first place, how were they ever truly worth anything of value at all?
@_date: 2014-05-30 04:28:33
I see. The goal of bitcoin is to create a closed system fiat money that will not be valuable until it is more popular. Its current worth is merely a speculative bubble that wont pop if it is massaged correctly. These sources aren't exactly answering my question but thank you for the effort.
