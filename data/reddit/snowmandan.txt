Snowden is not selfish. He's proven that. The documentary citizenfour is a good example. He cares about the truth. The US gov has a lot of shady business in the Middle East especially the Clintons. The NSA is also rumored to be influencing other nations, even allies with the malware that was hacked. 
Once the hack gets leaked, it seems like a lot of nations will be able to match the malware with malware on their systems and will pave a trail to connect the NSA to many foreign intrusions. 
This is all speculation but Snowden is not interested in himself. He holds truth above all and it looks like a massive curtain is about to be pulled down on the show and the Clintons are the center of it.

Wikileaks tweeted the same day that they have the same documents and are planning to release them. IMO Snowden has probably been working with wikileaks and they're gonna release a huge set of leaks that paint a new picture of the US gov around the presidential debates to hit Clinton as hard as possible and draw the most attention.

I don't think a trump presidency is more destructive than Hillary. Hillary has the potential to corrupt the entire government and make it extremely difficult to fix. Trump is a selfish idiot and a bigot and has no empathy. Gary Johnson is the only candidate who's goal is compromise and honesty. Snowden also has made it clear he has no intention on returning to the US unless he gets a fair trial which is 100% out of the question with Hillary

I'd like more information on this

Please educate others 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:09:23
I mean about why bitcoin is better and how everyone gets fucked over by fraudulant bankers every day. I'm just asking as a 20 year old, please use your financial influence to educate others, in whatever way you can. This time will be critical to build the foundation of a world that's moved beyond fiat.

That is until they gain absolute full control over the global economy to the point that they have unlimited funds and continue to force peasants fight for scraps.

Look into the annotated Blockchain. I don't have all of the answers, but if you look for it, I think you'll find some interesting stuff. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:43:47
Yeah, the logo for bitfossil was found in the blockchain, so I think that was a hint. 
There have been reports of deletions and alterations from the blockchain, so to get a copy with unaltered files, you have to go to the annotated blockchain and find the link for download.
I don't think there have been any recent ones, but the whole thing began when they backed up cablegate in the blockchain. That's proven and pretty easily accessible. It is followed by instructions on how to extract files from the blockchain. After that, there are many mystery pgp encrypted files that have yet to be publicly broken.

You can verify that. I remember that being one of the initial ways to find transactions that may have keys. I don't know a ton about this, but I want to get it out to people who do. So if you do, just look into it yourself

When I look back on the election, I remember that being a turning point. I still hadn't thought Trump could do it. But then she called Pepe a white supremacist, and she declared war on 4chan. You just don't do that, look at amy Schumer she's not winning. Neither is Hillary. 4chan wins. Pepe wins. Meme magic wins. Bitcoin wins.

Because the American dollar and any other fiat currency hasn't caused any deaths.... Oh wait. Bitcoin is a better currency. Decentralized, finite, and easily exchanged. I'll see you in 5 years when one is worth $50k. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 16:37:43
Shhh he thinks mining Bitcoin is bad for planet earth, so I don't think you'll get anything of value from this guy
@_date: 2016-10-19 16:35:55
Alright man you don't know what mining Bitcoin means so I'm just gonna go with accepting that you're a troll and I already made my argument. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 15:43:55
I'm not illustrating how "profitable" Bitcoin is. I listed three characteristics of Bitcoin that makes it a more practical currency for the long run. The global leaders have built a massive bubble of debt that's just waiting for the right spark to pop it. And this election may be that spark. And Bitcoin is likely to rise from the ashes of the manipulated fiat economy. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 17:01:02
Wow you must be a pro shit posting troll because all you do is spout bullshit and nonsense without contributing to any conversation! Bye ben

No my assumption was a final hyperbolic conclusion to add emphasis. I'm not going to write a paper on how and why the global economy is highly unstable just so you can nitpick little phrases and refute them. Remember the banks in 2008? The housing stuff? The global market is remarkably similar. Deutsche bank is going through it right now.  
Bitcoin not not simply switching currencies. Countries can print however much money they want, borrow more money than there is money in circulation, and trick the population into thinking that it is still valuable. Until they fuck up and get too deep. Bitcoin is, like I said, finite, similar to gold. There is a limit to the amount of bitcoin to be "mined," giving it real, objective value. It is decentralized, giving freedom and power to the people and to the market away from the state, allowing for a more efficient economy uninhibited by absurd fees, tariffs, taxes, or regulations, based on the simple laws of supply and demand. 
I'm also not saying I'm gonna make it out Scott free, everyone loses in a global financial meltdown. But after the collapse, people will look for a more sustainable and practical currency to rebuild, and it is likely to be Bitcoin. I don't understand how anyone can look at global finances and convince themselves it is sustainable. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 16:26:51
Bitcoin isn't "only made for that." It was made as a more sustainable and practical alternative to fiat currency. Unfortunately, not many places accept btc, but if they did, it would be HELLA more convenient than using cash, credit cards, or debit cards. My bank fucking cancelled three debit cards in one month without notifying me. I have to answer retarded "security questions" every time I get access to my own money. 
Cash is used to finance drugs and pedophiles too man, illegal activity has nothing to do with this. Bitcoin is, objectively, a more practical and sustainable currency based on its characteristics AS A CURRENCY than fiat.
