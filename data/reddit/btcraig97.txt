Honestly trying to make money is more stressful than being broke to me. I stare at the graphs which is unhealthy for my money and myself
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:09:13
I think my problem is I love watching my money go up and hate it going down 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:04:16
Any tips would be helpful

how many months difference are in those pictures? they look similar, but you had to spread one out more to make them look identical

they are eerily similar. but did you spread out the months to make the look that way? because i count 15 or so months on 1st map, and 9-10 on the 2nd.

There is yearly charts showing trends throughout the years, learn that chart and hope it does the same this year 
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:47:45
If you think about it the market will probably do the same thing as last year towards the end. December really high  and January Dump. I bought in Dec 17 and I know how to get in at that point and sell at the highest I think it’ll go and buy back in after it dumped because this was an absurd mistake that I regret and it’s only 300 bucks out of your 20,000

Don’t sell. Your best best is to wait until everything gets back up to where it was. Patience is key. HODL. Unless you think it’s going to go even lower and you end up with nothing. I had $360 in tron at 23 cents and I now have $57 and have sold multiple times so I think I’m screwed on that 360. So do not sell unless you need that money locked away

You didn’t cause a crash if you didn’t sell. Plus bitcoin was super high when you bought in compared to now so you probably had less than 1 btc
