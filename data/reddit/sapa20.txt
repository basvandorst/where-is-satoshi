uh, the vast majority of bitcoins today are already concentrated in a relative very few addresses. It's also unknown how many of those high balance addresses are controlled by a single person, making things even more concentrated than is apparent from looking at the blockchain.
Even if the remaining 10 million or so coins to be minted were spread evenly among 10 million people or 100 million people, it would actually just make things more concentrated, when considering the distribution to the total users.
The hugely lopsided distribution is already there and I've not seen or heard anything that would lead me to believe that it would change.

America *OnLine*
I think he means something like back when if he were to say "I was chatting online" most people would be like "What?"
And maybe people didn't say 'online' back then, I wonder when 'online' came in to use?

You forgot to explain how anything I said was "very wrong." And then to use an obvious exception as if that somehow refutes what I was saying?  
Yes, exchanges have large balance addresses but by my count there aren't many exchanges with significant volume.     
  
   


I think it's a hindrance to the adoption of bitcoin.

Depending on the production schedule and what not, it would be awesome to decentralize the writing process between the writers and the audience by working "choose your own adventure" elements into the script, episode to episode. With the audience somehow selecting which path to take.

People seem to have a hard time understanding this.
Nobody is saying that all the people on here talking about buying bitcoins are imaginary.  But, the prices at which they have been buying are highly manipulated due to fraudulent activity.
Why and How is this?
Prices are determined by buyers and sellers, supply and demand.  When people want more of a good than is available at a given price, the price will increase to the next price at which their is someone willing to buy and someone willing to sell, this is of course basic economics and can be understood concretely by looking at the orderbooks on the exchanges.
Since Willy had unlimited funds because they were fake, he could make sure that demand routinely exceeded supply at a certain price, thus causing the price to rise, then when someone other than Willy wanted to buy some coins, he was stuck paying more because Willy had bought up/stolen the coins at the lower price levels.
Evidence of this is shown in the Willy Report, when Willy takes a break from buying, the price drops rapidly.  Because when Willy's fake buys/thefts stop, there are more sellers than buyers.

Ah yes, no more noble way to become rich, than by tricking people!

Interesting idea, or alternatively, a separate address for each option and whichever balance is highest by whenever. But, this is less of a one person one vote thing, and more whoever is willing to pay the most.

As someone said a few days ago, "Stop trying to make 'bits' happen."
It's just a lame attempt by some people who see the increasingly diminished prospects of btc to try to re-inflate a deflating bubble.

I see this mentioned a lot, "If not for these meddlesome [insert whatever] bitcoin would return to its natural growth," like it is a tree or something that grows because that's just what it does.
But what is it that makes that the case for bitcoin, why is it a given that it should grow/make you richer unless it is "being prevented from doing so by some unnatural force"?
And are these idiots you speak of not part of the natural world?

I don't know that it was borrowed from its other use. It is an abbreviation for 'binary digit,' it has a specific meaning in the computer realm. A value in a binary system, like a one or a zero. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:39:48


Exactly my point, people are promoting the idea because they imagine something like
"oh look, those bit things are cheap now, maybe I'll get get a few."
While people with actual bitcoins worth of 'bits' cheer them on, all the while thinking "suckers"
Why would they buy them cause the are 'cheap'? maybe they saw when they had a higher price, and they think wow I could get rich,  just need some more people to buy them too, I'll tell my friends, maybe even get gramma to buy some blowstamps.

Are things really that dire?  I don't know, this just seems like the natural come down of that MtGox laden cocaine trip.  
There's some kind of behavioral economics thing going on when people see it was $266 and now it's $75, omg run for the hills!  But in reality it touched 266 for a minute or two probably and was above 200 for what? all of 36 hours?


Trade btc for usd, maybe. But trading btc for whatever a seller has to sell? no.  The problem is there is not a mature economic ecosystem using bitcoin, so the seller can't cover all their expense with just btc and might need to trade some for usd.
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:39:18


Invested what?  The currency they were holding was worth pennies to the usd, and I think a fair number of them might have when their bitcoins appreciated against the usd. How many exactly? I don't know, I'm sure someone knows more about that than me.


You want to flesh out that buzz word soup(only in jest ;) ) a little more? It might lead to interesting conversation.  
I know everyone like to talk about a decentralized exchange, but what does that mean and how would it work?
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:25:48
Why is it always 'panic' sellers? Whose to say they haven't rationally and level-headedly considered the situation and their options and decided to sell?
Of course for someone to sell there must also be a buyer.
