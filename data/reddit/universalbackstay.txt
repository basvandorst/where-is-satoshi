We should make a sub for everyone that's trading. So we all can get the best of each others trades. Most of us know the elite run the bulls nd we hold the value.

Is it a great time but its not. The coin is still undervauled for sure but just don't go riskying people's money. Let them experiences for their self's, I made mistakes. Lost money. Could had gained but I never I just sat back nd watched this hole time. I'm investing in little coins to actually gain my value of my coins as of bitcoin 5k on one coin don't be daft let the rich bullrun
