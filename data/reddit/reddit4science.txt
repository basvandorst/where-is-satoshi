In theory it could be 0 satoshi or something between 0 and 1 satoshi using random chance, if you want to prevent spam

Are you scared that users are in control?
If you dislike the direction bitcoin or any cryptocurrency of your choice is heading then you can switch to one that suits you better.

Bitcoin is not associated with them. Bitcoin just happens to be a community like the others too

Not sure why you get downvoted. The project is decent.

Possibly never! Bitcoin Core is always evolving and putting it out of beta would suggest that it is a finished product.

Check out the talks from Andreas Antonopoulos on youtube.

To gain access to the lightning network, which is instant and ultra-low fee

No, feel free to enlighten me.

The japanese original says 8000.

You are soooo right! :)

Graphene, but I can't give you a precice ETA. However, we know that chip manufacturers have to get creative in 2020, since we will reach the physical limits for silicon. This might mean, we look for a different material (like graphene) or go for different solutions. 
The "easy" solution is to drastically increase the number of cores per processor and wait for software to abuse this kind of parallelization. This, however, is not a perfect solution since time-critical tasks might not benefit from such an increase in core count! (Ahmdal's law)

Nah, but I get why you are saying that. Our classical chip design is reaching it's limits and here I am giving a blanket statement that the hardware/cost in a general sense will still continue to improve. 
We can still improve performance by shifting away from silicon in the short term. The long term is harder to predict, but given the number of promising future technologies coming I am cautiously optimistic. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:06:11
In the classical sense, yes. However, we can still expect better hardware per cost on an exponential pace in all likelihood. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 10:55:29
Yes, if they can't stop it long term and stocked up on crypto en mass before.

We know what the final supply will be. Yes, it is inflationary since more coins get generate but overall deflationary since the maximum supply only decreases.

If you don't like bitcoin, don't buy any or support other projects.
I think it will become a viable payment solution in the future. Therefore for me  it is not just about gambling. If you have a different opinion, no one forces you to use bitcoin.

He says that bitcoin is not anonymous. It is only pseudo-anonymous since you can trace back all transactions on the blockchain. Therefore it is currently possible to link transaction on the bitcoin blockchain to real persons, unless you are very careful. 
This is not true for some privacy coins like monero.

If you think bitcoin is only about price, meaning it has no relevant underlying value, then put your money in stocks or fiat.
