Well idk if that's what will actually happen, but you could have CP on your computer right now and not know about it, if you're running a full node.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:21:06
Yeah, and thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:33:08
This is more awesome.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:54:01
Do you have the transaction ID for the deposit you made to the service, so that I can track the flow of the bitcoins?
You seem to be receiving $360 from an address holding over $18,870.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:34:51
Thanks. I'll look into that.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:17:44
All you have to do is be determined, and do it over and over. Do it in little segments, 5-7 characters at a time, until you get the whole thing.
Write it down until you fully remember it for a while though, and you probably shouldn't destroy your physical copies of the key until you're very very very **very** sure you can remember it.
@_date: 2015-01-29 00:08:20
Thanks! This makes much more sense.
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:46:52
Yeah, so conventional laws technically make running a full Bitcoin node illegal. Good thing you probably won't be in trouble though.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:08:16
This is most likely just for fun. I won't store any large amounts of money in this address. Most likely just a few dollars to fool around with.
Also, I still have a copy of my private key written down. I'm just testing the limits of my brain capacity.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:59:55
So there is still a single point of failure, if BitGo's keys are leaked, and the passwords are brute forced?
I realize brute forcing a password is not easy, especially with strong key derivation functions, salts, and strong passwords. Still, theoretically there is nevertheless a single point of failure, correct?
@_date: 2015-01-29 00:54:47
That's alright. I already retreived the key, but thanks for offering!
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:11:36
Hahahaha nope. I want to see that transaction ID, or at least a Bitcoin address.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:16:52
So, the first key is controlled and stored by them, the second is stored by them but encrypted and also kept on your backup, and the third is another backup key?
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:01:39
Thanks for writing that anyway. I hope someone else can use this to help them recover a key they need.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:10:01
It's JavaScript, don't worry. Runs offline too.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:58:28
Yeah. I will definitely have to do more research, especially since there is a minimum deposit...
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:44:43
I was thinking an encoded jpeg or something. There might be practical limits on the size of the message you can put in, but maybe you could put in multiple messages that could be reconstructed.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:40:58
Haha... I don't think so.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:38:10
Yeah, this is mostly for fun. I'm really just trying to test the limits of my memory.
Maybe I'll put a dollar in it and try to get it out in a few months, and maybe it'll be $1000 by that time. I'll be sure to keep a backup so I don't become the next guy who stored 7500 bitcoins on a hard drive and threw it away. ;)
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:05:05
Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:28:42
Give them to me and I'll take care of it for you.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:09:13
I have a copy of bitaddress.org.html on my computer, and I usually run that instead of the site.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:10:40
Yes, BitGo stores one key, and you need 2 keys to access your account.
Where exactly is the second key stored? It doesn't specifically state if it's on your computer, or stored by them and encrypted, I think.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:19:25
I had tried Circle, but it requires **a lot of personal information**. I trust Circle, but I don't want to have to enter all of this in to trade a prepaid AMEX gift card that isn't even linked to me.
I'm not even sure if they accept prepaid debit cards.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:28:22
I'm not planning to store more than a few dollars in my brain, don't worry.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:14:41
Any Bitcoin wallet software stores your private keys, which are used to spend your bitcoins. Your public keys are represented in a human readable form, and are more commonly known as Bitcoin addresses.
When you send money to a different address, your private keys are used to digitally sign a message saying "I'm transferring money to this address, and I have this money from this previous transaction." Other nodes can check the message, that it has been signed with that private key.
When you broadcast that message, it has to reference a previous transaction where you have received money, where the amount is greater than or equal to the amount you are trying to send. If it is more, than you can also broadcast a message sending the money back to yourself, but you can't use up half of a transaction. You need to split it up into more than one, if necessary.
Every full node records transactions, checks these messages, and makes sure that every transaction you reference when sending money has not been used before.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:51:22
Interesting, but I'm very skeptical.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:16:29
I'm shredding and burning them, don't worry.
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:28:30
GreenAddress is 2-of-2, and if you lose either of your keys, you'll have to use their special system of recovery. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:21:48
Can I maybe have a transaction ID, if that's no problem? Just curious.
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:04:57
I would do your own research, since they can cost anywhere from $50 to thousands depending on how fast they hash.
An informative page you could look at is:
I'm not that knowledgeable about mining but this seems to be a great page to look at! :)
Also, you should look into joining a mining pool to distribute mining profits between pool members since mining alone leaves your profit to chance, and distribution means you will earn bitcoin even when someone else in the pool mines a block. The website  has information on this also.
@_date: 2015-07-01 12:13:17
You'll have to buy bitcoin through an exchange or earn them through working for people that are willing to pay in bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency.
Litecoin is similar to bitcoin but not as popular and with different features.
Satoshi Nakamoto is the creator of bitcoin, but a satoshi is the smallest denomination of bitcoin. It represents 1/100,000,000 of 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-01 12:35:56
In order to make a profit, you should probably (and almost definitely) used specialized mining hardware like ASICs. If you can't afford them, I would recommend not getting into mining since the average computer can't hash fast enough to make a profit on the electricity you use. Sorry about that! :(
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:28:25
It looks like it is only in the US.
Sorry :(
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:08:04
Well as of today it's around $220, but it changes every few minutes. Check a website like coinbase.com or bitstamp.com for the current price at an exchange.
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:18:26
I don't have 1 BTC but if I did, I'd have some interesting ideas. xD
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:36:53
I'd need time, but I might come up with a list of some things other people might want you to do. Haha...
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:21:13
Sorry, I don't have a VPS. I'd like to have one though. :)
For the average person, I'm guessing they don't have one as well. It isn't a good idea to let only the people who own one have access to technologies like multisig, which can be very useful for Bitcoin security.
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:57:01
A seed by definition is a value used to create more information, in this case your private keys. Your private keys are derived from the seed, and they're always in the same order, so Electrum generates a list of possible private keys, and starts checking them until all of them are found.
Here's a simplified example:
    key1 = SHA256(seed + 1)
    key2 = SHA256(seed + 2)
    key3 = SHA256(seed + 3)
    key4 = SHA256(seed + 4)
on and on, until it's found all of them.
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:56:02
Interesting. I have heard of Coinkite before, but I wasn't sure how their multisig works. I'll look into it!
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:55:17
Yeah, I don't know. Small transactions with no fees get stuck in limbo and are never confirmed.
@_date: 2015-02-28 05:32:07
Shut up and take my money?
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:38:51
With all the "money services business" laws in the US, I could definitely believe that. I've only bought a laptop charger so far with money from Coinbase, so they can have that information. But most likely, all they know is it was sent to Gyft. That's hardly useful.
@_date: 2015-02-22 14:54:40
I don't think these count. This is all one transaction with multiple 1 satoshi outputs. I'm talking about the transaction total, so it would have to be to one address only.
@_date: 2015-02-21 13:12:02
Thanks. This is useful, but hosted multisig where a third party holds one key is very helpful. Handling multiple keys on one device, or in some cases, multiple devices, doesn't offer the level of security that other types of multisig systems do where more than one party is in control. (like escrow, and as mentioned before, services like BitGo).
@_date: 2015-02-21 13:31:16
GreenAddress justs seems confusing to me in general. Sure it might be simple to use, but I don't really understand how it works, so I don't feel comfortable using it.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:46:43
Oh ok, thanks. I haven't really used GreenAddress much so I must've missed this.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:18:40
How do you set up the 2-of-3? Just curious, and I haven't seen it. I actually like their 2FA since they support Google authenticator, which is anonymous.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:17:42
Yes, I believe so, since the other 2 keys were generated from the same seed.
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:25:32
Yeah it is, but the point is the line went from being near completely flat to spiking up and what you would call 'normal' for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:30:12
Copay is designed for multisig wallets between multiple people. I'm referring to the type of multisig designed for individuals to secure *their* and only their funds.
BitGo is an example of this, and has 3 keys. The first key is controlled by them, and is used by them to cosign transactions that are not flagged as fraudulent by their systems. The second is stored by them, but encrypted, so they do not have access to it. This key is also stored on backup paper, along with the third which is fully controlled by you and only intended as a backup.
However, BitGo requires numerous details including your name, email address, and phone number, which I do not think are necessary to provide security. This is especially considering the fact that with access to this information, no thieves can steal any money without another key, since BitGo is a 2-of-3 wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-03 02:09:49
I took the time to answer all of the free text questions. If you don't have time, that's fine.
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:53:06
I'm not *exactly* sure how it works, but it appears that recovery only works after a predetermined period of time. The default appears to be a very long 90 days as well, so I'm not sure if shortening the time period affects the security of the account. I'm not even sure how these timelocked transactions work.
I'm not claiming this is correct though, and this recovery method might be very useful, and I might be completely wrong about what it is or how it works.
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:54:39
Yes, so it still requires a phone number. I realize most of this can be acheived, but it takes extra effort to complete these extra steps, and I'm not sure it's reasonable to get a second phone just for BitGo.
@_date: 2015-02-21 13:24:18
I'm not exactly sure still, but I believe it has to do with emailing presigned transactions or something. I'm not entirely sure, so I might be completely wrong.
EDIT: The only thing I *may* know about is that recovery can take as much as 90 days, but it looks like this can be set. It's probably at the cost of security though.
You'll have to do your own research, because I have nearly no clue about the concept, let alone the process itself.
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:50:04
Wow. That's ridiculous. The only reason I'd store money in a Coinbase account honestly is to buy and sell bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:16:01
Haha yeah, but multisig would make it so that wouldn't really matter. You would only have to trust the third party if one of your keys was compromised.
@_date: 2015-02-21 13:32:33
I'm sorry, but multisig disproves any claims of this now apparently outdated statement. It's just not properly implemented yet, and doesn't allow for anonymity and security at the same time, even though it's easily possible.
If BitGo only controls one key, they don't actually have access to the money. Unlike GreenAddress, they can't prevent you from spending it, they can only deter you from spending it unless you pull out your backup sheet with another copy of your private keys.
However, in order for their services to work properly, you have to use tons of personal info which seems unnecessary to me, since they can not grant access to your funds, to anyone, not even you. You need to have access to a second key, which is encrypted, and they do not have access to it.
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:14:43
Do you have any information on how it will work? I'd like to know more if that's fine... Have a website or anything?
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:26:59
I'm not saying malware and hacking are threats to me, but they are definitely a real concern. Sure you can encrypt your private keys, but what happens if you lose your computer, or your password? You lose your bitcoins.
These are very real threats to mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, and potentially to a lot of people. Yes, you can backup your wallet files (and definitely should if you're handling private keys), but multisig is a practical solution to all of these problems.
You can forget your password, have your computer destroyed, or lose your backup key, and your money is still safe. There are almost no disadvantages to using this technology that I can think of, except for the fact that it isn't anonymous.
