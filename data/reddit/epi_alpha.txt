I would like to apologize for my ignorance in advance, but we all have to start somewhere and I'm at the beginning lol. If and when a hard fork takes place, will my current BTC stay BTC-C or would it become BTC-U or a combination of the two? I hope my question makes sense. I guess what I'm asking is will BTU take part of the blockchain/current market volume with it, or would it be a brand new start for all of the above? I'm assuming the answer is no, but I'm hoping someone with a much better understanding than myself could explain. Again, I'm sorry if this is absolutely ridiculous.

Ok, to build on this question and challenge those that point to the 40+ Bitcoin Exchanges... I live in the state of WA and all of the exchanges I've tried to use don't service my state due to bitcoin legislation. I am using Coinbase now, but would like options in case my account is closed...Not to mention the whole IRS/US Govt aspect of Coinbase.

This is such bullshit! I have been attempting to buy for the last three hours. If BTC were to suddenly skyrocket to $3500 in 10min how much do you want to bet THEN I could magically complete a transaction.

Now that I 100% agree with. You are absolutely right and thankfully as of a few days ago I now have the option to move to Gemini. Being a WA State resident it was CoinBase or nothing for quite a while, which is obviously where all of my frustrations come from, lol. Hopefully others will follow suit and they will get the message.

Really? I disagree completely. So the issue is that we consumers, CB's PAYING CUSTOMERS should adapt to their failure to implement a service that can handle the traffic and loads required of it? CB should have been continually investing their mountains of income into building and improving systems and services that are capable of handling the demand placed on them...let alone proper customer service. They know they're  and they know the rate at which BTC is growing, no excuses.
