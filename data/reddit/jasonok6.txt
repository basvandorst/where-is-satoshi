You are right as far as mobile apps are concerned, phonegap apps or other hybrid technology tend to create sluggish environments. 
Desktop apps on the other hand are a different story.  My favorite code editor, atom.io, is running on a web UI.  As is  Visual Code which I prefer for node debugging.  The mac slack app is badass.  Spotify has been really good in the past while running on a webUI.

Were you using windows?

keylogger. Never use windows for your btc wallet, never use a wallet client on a shared computer of any flavor.

My bad, looks like multibit does have password protected wallets now.  I never use that feature as I run my wallets from a truecrypt container.  Is there a chance that you had a .dat file prior to encrypting the wallet?  Who knows, sorry for your loss, that really sucks.

How many times has global internet usage doubled?  Since 1995 it has doubled roughly 7 times.  Since the 1980s it has doubled many many times.  In 1995 the internet was a household name that people knew about whether they had it or not.  Bitcoins are nowhere near that point in their life cycle, at this point the vast majority of people have no clue what a bitcoin is.  I would imagine that bitcoins are in their equivalent of the late 1980s where mainly the technological savvy are the only ones aware of them.   Unlike the internet there is a rapidly approaching finite number of bitcoins that can ever be mined.  I think it's safe to say that if bitcoins ever become a mainstream currency we will see the value relative to traditional currencies double many many more times.

The screenshot shows you using multibit in ubuntu.  Were you using multibit on windows?  Multibit doesn't support encryption of the wallet only the keys.  Is it possible that you forgot to kill your .dat files after using multibit on windows?  And by kill I don't mean deleting the files as deleted files would be the first files I would look through if I were malicious software looking for wallet files.
