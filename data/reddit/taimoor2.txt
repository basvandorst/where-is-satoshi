In many countries, carrying isn't an option. Also, saying no with a gun in your face is easier said than done. And no, they are not definitely going to kill you. Absolute villains who kill for fun are very very rare in real life. In a robbery situation, cooperate 100%. This is coming from a Pakistani who has lived in one of the most criminal cities in the world.

You sir, what we call, a moron.
If it is such a rare repost that you cannot find it, it didn't hurt anyone. Also, since you have no proof, could it not be that OP found another one of the bills in circulation? If he insists he took it, why do you insist on proving otherwise?
Troll? or have too much time on your hand? Or is it a crusade against all lies on the internet. Because if so, I have some very bad news for you.

It's illegal.
Also, it's sketchy as hell. The thing is that this functionality is built in into the bitcoin infrastructure so it is definitely a plus.

A bit background on this? Did they commit fraud or something?
@_date: 2014-01-18 07:19:30
There needs to be a balance in my opinion. An absolutely anonymous monetary system may become a problem.

OP in early 1910s:
Why I am divesting from Car stocks and why I think it has no real future?
Cars are a marvelous invention. They never die, can be faster, and don't require food and barn like a horse. In fact, I can just keep a car in a garage without a dedicated help. Still, average Joe doesn't care about it. Driving a car requires special training and application of a license. Its just too much of a hassle.
OP in early 1990s:
Why I am divesting from Internet stocks and why I think internet has no real future?
Internet has great potential. It can link people across boundaries and has unlimited potential for commerce, relationships, communication, and almost every other facet of human life. Yet, it requires a certain acumen to use. You must buy this thing called a computer which can be expensive and hard to use. I don't think average Joe six pack will ever learn how to fully use it.
Look man, we are currently going through a period of exponential wealth growth in a very large number of countries without the democratic systems in place that the western world enjoys. Leaders in Russia, China, and other less developed countries have the power to seize money of billionaires if they so desire. They NEED a medium of wealth storage and paper money or centralized money ain't it. What about illegal businesses? Switzerland and offshore accounts have been used successfully to hide this money. Now, this medium is under attack because of high degree of intervention by the government. You do know right that weed businesses CANNOT open bank accounts right now? They carry millions on their person. Do you think that is a successful and satisfactory use of their money? They need a medium of wealth storage that they have more control over. BitCoin is the only solution here that is perfectly divisible, perfectly safe, and perfectly portable. 
Secondly, the freedoms you have traditionally enjoyed are being eroded. Where you use your money, how much you have, and so on is now available to giant computers that can use them to construct a very accurate profile of you. However, this will potentially be abused by the government. US already requires major swiss banks to disclose data on an extensive scale. Where do you think all that money will go?
New technology is never designed for average Joe six pack. Average Joe Sixpack does eventually adopt every new technology. NEVER think about how a new technology will appeal to idiots on the street. Think about how it will help the rich and powerful.

VISA contract doesn't allow shop vendors to input credit card numbers. They have to physically swap the card. The facility to enter the numbers is when the reader doesn't work with the card due to damaged card or lamination or other issues. At least in singapore.

If you are so sure, why the 5 months restriction? Bitcoin was never meant to be a quick rich scheme. It WILL become something big. May be not in next 5 months but it will in our lifetime. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:22:52
Why? Is it a lie?
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:38:53
Contextualizes the Bitcoin exchange losses. Human beings are frail creatures. This kind of shit happens all the time. Don't give up on Bitcoin just because of what happened at Bitstamp.
Bitcoin only lost $5 million. This guy made off with 4 times that amount.

Look man, this is a speculative, very high risk investment. It can go to zero. It can also skyrocket and give you millions, depends on the final outcome. There is no middle ground for them. Think Facebook. A social media network is either worth several billions dollars or it's worth nothing, there is very little middle ground. 
Bitcoin CAN, and I believe WILL take off. Just look at what happens if it takes over 2% of all world transactions. At 21 million coins, what will each coin be worth? Do your own calculations.
Or it can tank. 
In investments like this, you shouldn't put any significant part of your portfolio. You were an idiot to invest $30,000 IF that is a very large part of your wealth. Don't ask others to give up on the technology.
I am also invested in Bitcoin but my net worth invested in Bitcoin is less than 1% of my total net worth. If it goes up, great! If not, it's ok. Bitcoin will have an inverse relationship with USD as well as stock market. As long as that is booming, Bitcoin will go down. Use it to hedge your portfolio.

Why not bull trap?

You are wrong. Read his comment and try to understand.
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:05:08


I thought there are 21 million coins and we can divide the coins up?
@_date: 2015-11-07 10:23:48
Never thought of it like this. However, now that you say it, it makes complete sense.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:02:16
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:26:24
Ok thank you. I don't have the technical expertise to understand the base argument. However, I have a better understanding of the issue due to your as well as @_date: 2015-11-07 07:06:53
Thank you for the detailed reply. It was really helpful.
Just one more question, "What's a full node?"
If I mine from my computer, isn't that a node?
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:32:41
Thank you! I may not have much but you earned a lifelong customer. I am impressed with your customer service. :)
@_date: 2015-11-07 10:24:38
Why do you think it is false?
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:04:31
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:01:29
How? What's the major advantage?
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:28:12
If we will only catch-up to major credit card processors in 2036, we will be way behind! The world is becoming electronic, online and digital transactions will increase several fold in the coming years!
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:01:05
Why are you being downvoted? 
What happens if you go out of business? Will I be able to retrieve my Bitcoin with the keycard?
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:03:55
Why do we need to create a hard-fork?


How will increasing the max block size that can be synced help?

I am located in singapore, head quarter of itBit.
The part about "there are plenty of ways" was both known to me and useless information since that's why I made the post. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:17:30
Thank you. I have now made an account and will use your services. It looks professional and great.
Just a small question, how will you make a profit? I will just transfer my bitcoins to you and leave them be. I am asking because I think that's why itbit is closing my account.

Visa will compensate you in case of a fraudulent transaction. Bitcoin won't. 
But that's kind of the point of Bitcoin. It's your money. No one will compensate you but no one can take it away either!

Thanks! Exactly what I was looking for!&gt; Thanks! Exactly what I was looking for!

Coinbase is only for US banks. They are asking me to verify a US bank account.
@_date: 2013-12-31 07:11:02
And that's why they know about bitcoins too!
The rich are always the first to adopt new technology. Nothing surprising here. Doesn't mean they aren't cute :-)

Let's see if someone more knowledgeable replies!
