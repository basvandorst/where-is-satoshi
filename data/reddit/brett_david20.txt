Ledger mainly for the eth I was holding

I have a new phone and new lap top , so reinstalled the ledger like new on my new lap top and the bitpay app on new phone ,  I purchased a while a go the crypto and completely forgot about it till now when I got my new devices , so stupid of me I know , I wrote to both ledger and bitpay and no response ! I am willing to accept the loss as a valuable lesson but have to be sure first by asking

When and if I decide to buy again I will indeed do that , thanks

If there is a next time I will consider something like that , appreciated , I’ll take the positives out of it and learn from it ! But man it’s devastating!!

Bitpay on I phone 7 was where the mass majority was and small amount on ledger nano ,

Sadly not , I have a problem and have to put every on paper otherwise I forget after a period of time 
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:56:38
Because  with bitpay I need the seed to allow the back up to happen and also with my ledger I need a password to open it , unless there is another way I am unaware of

I totally agree , but again it’s my fault for not being responsible enough , 
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:29:38
That the thing it’s definitely gone , I moved house and I am sure it was lost in the move , irresponsible of me and a lesson to be learnt , how ever I want to know if there is still a way around it ? As stupid as the question sounds ?
