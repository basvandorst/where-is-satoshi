I would prefer not to give my personnel information to a 3rd party.  I don't trust Gyft to be able to secure my information.

I don't believe there are any paid shills, just a bunch of butt hurt trolls, that got bored with 4chan.  They have nothing better to do than to put down those that are following what they believe.  Look how much effort they put into trolling scientology.

When the banking system crashes and the government is no longer able to pay social security, the average american will be sorry they didn't buy into Bitcoin now at $330 a BTC.  It is time Americans started doing for themselves what the government will be incapable of doing in the near future.

If he gets scared away by your helpful posts then you have done well.  Not everyone is yet ready to be their own bank.  Until one is truly ready to be one's own bank, one will never take security seriously enough.
edit. - Think about how much you pay in fees, the cost of a Trezor is not much to pay for that piece of mind.

The free market will respond in its natural state.  Once the state fails, the vacuum left behind will be filled by the free market.  Those that are unable to contribute to society will be left behind.
