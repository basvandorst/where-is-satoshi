This is good for bitcoin.

I'm wondering how trust is established with OB. On ebay there is a review system. How do I know that a seller wont screw me over or give me a hassle if there is a shipping issue?

Hopefully there isn't too much demand this time. They might delay another 2 years
@_date: 2018-09-08 22:14:54
And yet BTC has gained over 100,000% since 2012 until now. I don't even know what the percentage would be if i went back to 2010.

They can move all their funds for 3 cents with segwit if they wait 2 hours according to this site

It's a sell signal until it's common knowledge

The coin of reddit.

This is exactly it. My employer was about to invest in Bitcoin. After i sent her a detailed tutorial on how to secure her Bitcoin I never heard her talk about it again. People don't want to invest in something if they are not sure they can keep that money safe.

Do you not understand what a blooper reel is?
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:01:41
Yeah i was able to withdrawal last night. I just figured BTC-e was opened up again.
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:32:59
They have a [money pyramid]( on their home page. They aren't even hiding it.

He didn't, he ate up all the sell orders.
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:43:46
I have been staring at bitcoinwisdom all year.
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:55:45
People may be downvoting, but it's true. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:44:04
How do you work out taxes when all your money is stored as bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:43:15
There are now from people hoping it will happen again. At the time there were very few sellers. and buying 40 bitcoins ate up the entire book.
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:41:01
Pretty much me waking up this morning. Thank god for my stop loss.
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:24:31
Or maybe he has invested in the coin and is very aware of it :P
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:07:10
All I know is I more than doubled my holdings. Lets leave it at that.

That's why i shorted. But i am longterm bull. this will pass in a month or so.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:36:53
This would solve so much. this subreddit was known for being a somewhat nasty place even before recent problems. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:47:39
Have you ever dreamed in blockchain? I swam the memepool. I have been to Satoshi and back.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:46:20
Well if you have something better to read before bed I would like to hear about it.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:00:58
Each bitcoin transaction requires you pay a single fee. So spending it all only costs you a small fee regardless of how many inputs an address has.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:14:54
That's correct, if you send this bitcoin to one address that isn't many bytes. If you sent it to many you would have to pay extra for that. You don't have to pay money for past transactions, that's what the blockchain is for.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:33:17
It looks like he is still buying
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:10:24
For me the challenge of buying bitcoin is the fees. Everywhere wants 3-5% it seems. Is there a place i can buy and skip the markup?
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:24:25
Just tried [elementary]( and am loving it. It's the first distro that i can visually stand.
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:50:53
Yeah i have used circle. But i get dinged once for their fee and a second time for the conversion from cad to usd by my bank. I would love to spend my btc, but getting more of it is too expensive.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:45:09
As an official wallet inspector, please pm me your words so that I can verify that your wallet is in fact backed up.
^ This is just a joke/test, please do not do this.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:54:54
Well first of all, "closed source bitcoin" is not a thing. You have used closed source wallets. You trust them because so far, nobody has had their money stolen by the creator. But if you trust enough closed source wallets, you will get scammed eventually. An open source project will be audited by very smart people around the globe and discredited if a flaw is found.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:58:08
Would you use bitcoin if it wasn't open source?
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:54:30
You're a big guy
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:54:35
He didn't endorse it, it's banned there. They are interested in blockchain tech only.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:43:43
You mean the guy who thought the interet was just a fad?
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:11:46
I guess we will agree to disagree. Given how many scams exist in the crypto space, you cannot be too careful! Everybody want's your coins, and there are so many newbs ready to throw their money around. It's a scammers dream. Closed source goes against the spirit of bitcoin which is why I feel strongly about it. 
Oh, and I just created a closed source wallet I would like you to beta test for me ;)
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:51:39
Not with that attitude!
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:12:38
So you are suggesting that the volume is valid trades?
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:33:31
Because your place accepts BTC everywhere and mine doesn't. Meaning I can't use BTC the way it was intended.
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:17:24
I am very interested in bitcoin. I rarely google it.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:25:31
So people should use Bitcoin P2P. But the one place you can do that is a secret. Got it.

You might want to check recent litecoin prices. You will be pleasantly surprised.
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:20:58
After reading your thoughts I am curious why you are spending time in the Bitcoin subreddit. Why waste your time talking about something you don't see a future in?
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:57:34
Are you saying Bitcoin is like Napster?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:49:28
