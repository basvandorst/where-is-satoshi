My e-mail account has a different password then everything else. I don't think they hacked my e-mail. And if they did, why did they not just delete the MtGox e-mail?

What are you going to do with the rest of your funds? You could set up a legit business.

If you think outside the box this could work out. I just sent you a PM OP.

How can they just block your store. If they did that in my country to my legit business they would be in big trouble.  
It happened a couple of years ago with some "adult entertainment" businesses that got their bank accounts closed because the banks did not want to be associated with them. The "adult entertainment" companies sued and won the case since the business is totally legit.

Got the same e-mail. I don't use that username on any other site. I made my Gox account 2 years ago and never logged in after verifying my account. My guess Gox got hacked.

Well actually. [In Europe it is]( So I would reccomend every European company that is denied service by Paypal hire a lawyer.

That you can only chat with a certain amount of funds on your account. Which was a good thing to keep the trolls out when they first introduced it.
