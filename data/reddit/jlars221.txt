Also make an inheritance plan for the bitcoin so you can pass it on if you ever need to! I used the book [Cryptoasset inheritance planning]( to make mine. So glad you were able to inherit his bitcoin though and sorry for your loss.

Unless he had an inheritance plan for his bitcoin...
I can’t believe how many of us haven’t made one yet. I used the book [Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning]( to make a plan should something happen to me. It was easy and more of us should be doing it!

This is one of the reasons it bugs me that so many of us aren’t making inheritance plans! I FINALLY made one this spring using the book [Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning](  It was actually pretty easy and I’m relieved to have it done.

The new technology can be really hard for non-tech people. My parents have no clue. I created an inheritance plan so that if something happens to me my crypto won’t go with me. I used [Cryptoasset inheritance planning]( to figure out what to do because I didn’t know where to start with explaining it to my fam.

5 years ago terrible advertisements seemed like a crazy idea. 
So did terrible advertising in 1980. 
Invest in terrible advertising...��

Exactly. It is pretty messed up though how many of us aren’t doing anything about our crypto if something happens to us. I finally created an inheritance plan but took me forever to get around to it. It’s not even about the loss in general because like you said it’s divisible, it was more about my family not getting it.

Can’t wait for this or Andreas’ Mastering Ethereum! Mastering Bitcoin was also awesome.

I have the same socks. We must be crypto “sole” mates. ��
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:38:16
Agreed. I think Andreas’ books are the best way to understand crypto in an overarching way.

It’s in his Internet of Money Volume 2 book, in the Currency Wars chapter. If you have his book check to see which talk that is from to find the video. I don’t have my copy with me right now or I’d tell you.

He’s so good! Do you know where he was for this one?
@_date: 2018-11-02 13:29:02
Hadn’t seen this one before. So good!!! Have you checked andreas out on patreon? There’s a pretty good group chat there where you can ask questions. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:41:17
Haven’t read that one. I’ll check it out. I also think for anyone who has crypto that you should read [cryptoasset inheritance planning]( so you don’t lose what you have. The security tips in it are really useful.

Dude you need to check out andreas’ patreon page. He does streaming question and answer sessions where he actually answers our questions.

This reminds me of that chapter in andreas’ book the internet of Money about bubble boy and the sewer rat! Such a good one!
