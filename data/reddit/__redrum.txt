I would go from XRP to BTC (or even back into LTC) on 1/7.  There's a rumor that Coinbase/GDAX will list XRP around 1/8.
This is a risky play though, you could loose half your funds pretty quick if coinbase comes out denying the rumor.
Edit: Also keep an eye out for other coinbase rumors.  Coinbase will be adding a handful of alts early 2018, and each will be an oportunity to double that $500 if you get it early enough.  But certainly high risk.

Spaming? You can't do it forever, BTC would eventually crash completely.   You'd wonder if BCH weren't corelating so well, price wise, with BTC, if the spam would have stopped.  But I would guess, the lower fees and transaction count has more to do with exchanges (hopefully coinbase) batching TXs.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:23:54
There were more buyers for Tether than there were sellers this causes the price to go up.  This will happen at downturns.  When the price of BTC shoots up tethers go down to $0.98 or so.

Ethereum has all that and by market cap is about half BTC’s value.  But bitcoin has better brand recognition and wider adoption.  If fees can be solved, quickly, bitcoin may keep that value.  Otherwise this wild ride will be even more exciting.

You only pay taxes on gains.  Do you not under stand how this works, redditor for 6 weeks?
So, as a simple example, you buy bitcoin at $100.  The price of bitcoin goes up to $200.  You buy a $20 pizza.  Because you bought in at $100, you are essentially getting the pizza for $10.  The government will want $1.50.  So you get a $20 pizza for $11.50.

Go slow if you can, and at the very least do lots.  For example send 1BTC to GDAX, sell, get it confirmed into your bank account, before giving GDAX control of the next BTC.
Make sure and pay the taxes :(


I haven't cashed out anywhere near this size, but my advice is based on what I've read here.  If coinbase decides to review your $100,000 transaction because it's triggered money laundering level limits, they don't have the staffing to do it quickly.

I don't believe that addresses the possibility of miners mining their own spam transactions.  As mining has become more centralized, this has become possible.

By the time you get fully to Fiat, the vunerability will be patched.  And if this was a real concern, now would be the worst time to run your crypto through multiple exchanges.

Reddit doesn't deny new users from commenting to or or 99.9% of the other sections.  It's just subreddits that receive high levels of spam and targeted manipulation.  There are people that pay to have the crypto subreddits blanketed with posts about their latest bestest new crypto currency and how everyone should buy some.  This costs a few thousand dollars.  Then if 1 in 100 buy in, they make hundreds of thousands of dollars.


Being new means you may or may not be a paid shill here to advertise about your latest coin, or maybe you are here to tell us about how Tether will end all of crypto currency and kill babies too.


It's more like running a background check and/or verifying identity before allowing you to board.  If you've been on reddit a while and have a track record, you are much more likely to be a real person.

It's harder to do with Bitcoin, but post all over reddit about your new crypto currency call "BestCoin" and about how it's the best, then dump it for a huge profit.
After you've been using reddit for a while it will be easier to see.  In the next month or so, you will see a bunch of posts about how Tether is a huge scam that will ruin bitcoin.

I assume it’s BS but would stage my withdraws to be safe.  Maybe the DEA is freezing really large amounts that aren’t backed up by trades on the exchange.  May an audit is reauired over a certain dollar amount and it takes a fee weeks because of how busy coinbase is.  Just paranoid caution.

It's your source, Bitfinex’ed.  He clearly doesn't understand tethers and the roll they play in the greater bitcoin ecosystem.  Arbitrage is most easilly carried out with tethers.  And GDAX doesn't support them.  So to carry out arbitrage with GDAX you need to involve bank wire transfers.  Difficult to do with a bot.   Also GDAX has a lot of retail traders, ready to buy bitcoin at GDAX without checking the bitfinex price first.

You are mixing up buying and selling.   A stop-sell occurs when the price drops below the trigger.  A stop-buy occurs with the price rises above the trigger.
You may want to use a limit order for what you are trying to do instead of a stop order.  So if you want to buy when the price drops to 1000, set a limit price and amount and the buy trade will execute when the price drops to your limit price.

Roger is publicly, vocally, on CNBC as anti bitcoin.  With CNBC calling him "Bitcoin Jesus".   
And with transactions at an all time high in volume and cost, he told everyone to transfer their coins back to the exchange so they could panic sell.  Meanwhile telling wall street that insider trading is a non-crime.
And that's what he's doing publicly.  All's he has to do is be supportive of BCH without trying to crash the rest of crypto, and we all do well, but he has to cut the goose open to see where the golden eggs are coming from.

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:36
You can only bring forward $3000 in losses, per year.   But to better explain it, say you bought 1 BTC over the summer a 4000, then traded it for 1 BCH now.  BTC is at 16000, now roughly, so you make 12000 in profit, that you decide to reinvest in BCH now, and buy 3.  In January, BCH drops back down to 1200, unlikely, but certainly could happen.  So now you panic and sell for 3600.
You've lost $400 in  this miss-adventure, but owe $3000  (25% of 12,000) in short term capitol gains.  On the bright side, you have $3000 you can deduct in 2018.  And another in 2019, and the remainder can be deducted in 2020.

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:31:08
1. All bitcoin is stored in the blockchain.  Wallets simply store keys to the coins.  A wallet like a ledger nano s has a key phrase that can be used to recreate the wallet on a new device.  Never store the pass phrase and the wallet in the same place and you are safe from a house fire.  Browse around if you are interested.  If you are planning on holding more than $1000 in coins you should buy one.
2. Don't mess with paper wallets until you have a better understanding of BTC.  They are really for advanced users.
Also for the first few months, stay on the exchange.  If you see profits and want to sell or you panic and want to sell (almost always a mistake, but some people learn the hard way).   You will have a lot easier time selling from the exchange, than you will from the wallet.  In a panic sell situation, it takes hours and hours to get coins back on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:32:12

I would suggest a Stop order on GDAX instead of an outright sale.  Figure at support level, that way if the futures markets pump the price instead of dropping it, you don't lose out.

A change in fee structure would be interesting and may give you an edge.  A flat rate trade fee might be worthwhile. Or simply a ceiling on fee per trade.  Also, maybe a fee to pull orders from the book.  Want to place and remove a 300 coin wall?  Well pulling it is going to cost 0.25%.
Next it would be nice to have multiple trades active on the same coin.  When one executes, the other order gets cancelled.  Simply having a stop order and a limit order at the same time would be useful.

As far as downvoting exchange shilling, that's gonna happen.  Post a thread saying Bittrex customer service is ignoring you and you have my sympathy.

A bunch of new people bought into bitcoin in December, and they listened to us and put it on a hardware wallet instead of holding on an exchange, this pumped fees up, the high fees where a really easy shill point, and now those same noobs are paying $50 to get the coins back on the exchange and sold ASAP.  
We probably shouldn't tell people to buy and flood the network.  Suppose it makes better holders out of them.

Some of it is pretty clever too.  When Coinbase fucked up this week there was a flood of threads posting about moving your coins to Gemini or Binance or where ever to send a message to coinbase.

Stop orders are going to cost taker fees of 0.25%.  The free trades are "post-only" limit orders.  To get funds into GDAX use the Deposit button, and select Coinbase wallet as source.
Honestly though start small and learn GDAX before making huge plays like this.  Send 0.1 BTC over and spend a couple weeks trading and learning GDAX.  That way your tax exposure won't be crazy while you're learning.

Coinbase doesn't really have a USD wallet like GDAX does.  At least by default.  So selling BTC means you are selling into your associated bank or paypal account.  Paypal is pretty quick, minutes, if not immediately.
I believe you can request a USD wallet, and if you did, the money should hit that wallet in seconds.

Yes, it was an adderal manifesto, and seemed to center around the majority of tether transfers between a small number of wallets owned by various exchanges.  It would appear to ignore the fact arbitrage is the most likely explanation for the transfers.

Can they bank wire you $10K daily, easily without issue, then you can make $1000 a day.  The trick would be keeping cash in rotation.  Figure 30-50K.  Then you both buy one coin on GDAX and sell one coin on bitthumb at the same time.
Honestly, at this point just holding is more profitable.   How far have you gotten with this scheme?  I can't get level 2 verified on bithumb, my passport just expired.  And linking a US bank account may be difficult.

How many times were the coins moved after you mined them?  If they went from mining to your one wallet address, then from there to coinbase (or where ever you cashed them), then it's easy to show the history of the coins.
If the coins have been all over creation, including a tumbler, then it won't be that easy.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:25:24
If you really think this was just a disagreement about block size, you miss-read things.
Segwit2x was a play for control over the source code underlying bitcoin.  The bitmain syndicate wants control of both the source and the hardware.  
Imagine if the bitcoin source was changed to require mining hardware to have a bitmain patented process to mine coins.  Bitmain would effectively control all mining hardware.  They almost do now.
Blocksize was just the sticking point the bitmain syndicate found to attempt to take the source from core.

A group of miner could confirm their own transactions.  Literally paying themselves.   It would cost them a little money in the short term in missed fees, but at this point, with people paying $50 for a transaction, there's even a profit motive.  
It's a bit of a conspiracy theory, but if it ever happened, it's happening now, and I assume advance blockchain analysis would show it.
This block is weird, you do see quite a few &lt;$1 transactions. Along with a lot of 20s through 50s.

The games are stupid, and should be dropped, agreed, but the name Bitcoin Cash was deliberately chosen to confuse people new to crypto.  Bitcoin Cash proponents want the name bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-23 02:13:55
Don't diversify into BCH, go into Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero and Ripple.  Ethereum is the 2nd and will likely take the top spot should BCH manage to topple BTC.
BCH cannot take the top spot from BTC without a lot of investors loosing big in bitcoin.  BCH will be associated with that crash.

Give it a few days the fees should come down.  Also the fees are per transaction, not percentage based, so accumulate a few hundred worth before transfering.

Fees aren’t static, they change over time.  With all the attention bitcoin is getting since shooting past 10k the network has been very busy.  But certainly things will calm down enough to transmit bitcoins for under $33.  Likely under $10 before long.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:53:53
Local bitcoins would know about and have a record of the transaction.  Especially if it's over $10k.  The IRS will eventually get access to those records.  Is minimum security prison worth $5000 in profits?

FIFO is already a thing, and it cuts deep.  If you are in this boat thought you can afford the taxes.  My worry would be paying capitol gains this year FIFO then loosing those gains next year in a full collapse.

When you short, generally, you borrow and immediately sell bitcoin.  While shorting, you hold the cash.  Then when you decide to close the position, you buy the bitcoin back and return the borrowed amount.  The buyback is where your lost money (or gained it), so that’s where your cash went.

I wasn't presenting proof, I was simply asking why those transactions were chosen for inclusion in the block when they were well below the average tx price.  Do you have a reasonable explanation that isn't miner charity?

This is how transactions work.  If you have 1BTC in a wallet and send your friend 0.1 BTC the transaction will send 1 BTC split too two addresses.  Your friend will receive 0.1 BTC and you will send yourself 0.9BTC.
Most wallets generate a new address for you to receive the 0.9 in as a security feature, but not all wallets do this.
If we're looking for suspect transactions look at the first few in this block, not sure why $0.57 fees get you into a block with $50 fees, but it could be just as innocent:

It's really hard to tell honest discussion from shilling.  Like all political discussions not everyone here is having an honest discussion.  Most of us remember our last bitcoin transaction being well under $10 so when people talk about $150 transaction fees, we assume they are lying.  But the average TX cost the past week is pretty high.

You're not making any sense, and your post is difficult to read.  To start, use paragraphs.  
To start a new paragraph, like this, hit enter twice.  Also we have a quaint little custom where we use a CAPITOL letter at the start of each sentence.
These two little things help you really get your thought across to the reader.
With that out of the way.  I believe you are discussing price correlations between crypto currencies.  If this is a new concept to you, you really shouldn't be day trading.  
Most crypto coins are traded paired with BTC.  For example you can buy LTC with BTC, and you can buy LTC with USD.  Because of this, and with local arbitrage between trading pairs, the price of BTC falling is linked to a change in LTC.
Edit: Also you can discuss this topic over in if you want.  But put a little effort into readability first.

It's possible coinbase didn't have a BCH inventory going into last night, and their purchases were the reason for the run up.   But the BTC dump to 14,001 was clear market manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:06:11
Arbitrage is difficult to make work,  It can take a couple hours to move a bitcoin from one exchange to the other, and it that time a $700 price movement is nothing.  The trick would be to have $17000 on Gemini and a bitcoin on GDAX.  Then when the price looks the best, sell the coin on GDAX and buy another on Gemini.   Then send the cash to Gemini and the Coin to GDAX.
So you have $34,000 spread between the two exchanges just to make $700.  And then Uncle Sam wants $200 of that.  You'd make more playing dips with that much coin.
Another option would be looking for arbitrage oportunity between crypto coins that transfer quickly.  But those all have bots play them.

Not all exchanges are created equal.  Don't put thousands of dollars on an exchange in Hongcong that might close tomorrow.  Coinbase is US base and fairly well trusted.  As you are getting your feet wet, you are perfectly safe holding there.  Just plan on getting into a ledger nano S as you accumulate more coin.  By February plan on being off coinbase.


Paper wallets and a Ledger Nano S are really two different things.  Paper wallet are a really simple low tech way to store bitcoin, but they really aren't for new users.  They are very secure, but easy to lose or mess up.
Hardware wallets are both very secure and friendly to new users.  The paper here is just the written down pass phrase that you can use to recover the wallet if it is lost or destroyed, or you lose the pin.  The trick is to store it in a different place so that you can never lose both the ledger nano s and the paper.

So you don’t know what you are talking about, let me help you understand why.  Visa handles about 24,000 transactions per second.  So with a 10 minute block rate that’s 14,400,000 transactions per block.  The current 1mb blocks fit about 3000 transactions.  So each 10 minute block would be 4.8GB, and a day that would be more than half a terrebyte.  Node storage issues is where you settled, but imagine a pool trying to pass those huge blocks around.  You’d need a data center just to mine much less run a node.

I don't want regulation, I want coinbase to ensure trading is fair.  And if someone goes and deliberately dumps the price from 17k to 14k to try and crash the coin everyone is investing in, I want coinbase to use the TOS to fuck that trader.  
That took millions, coinbase should have a hold on those funds for 90 or 180 or 360 days while they investigate the manipulation.

Visa/MC/Discover/American Express are getting 2-4% of a LOT of transactions.  That means a lot of what you buy is inflated 2-4% to account for that.  I don't see BTC fixing this in the near term, but some existing or upcoming crypto may.

Exchange trading only.  That's why BCH is 700ish on Kraken and over $1000 on Bittrex.  When the floodgates open it's over.  If it was possible transact starting on Aug 1, BCH might have had a chance.  It have started around $30 most people would have held and it would have slowly risen in value.  As it is now, it's too valuable to hold.  We are in the pump phase of a pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:33:38
We did just set an interesting pattern with this fork.  Most people who dumped the new BCH coin bought BTC.  This increased the value of BTC while decreasing the value of BCH.   We managed about a 20% increase.  Add to that, also a dump of the new coin for an extra 10-20%.

I usually have a stop loss in place for my "trading" funds, but if it's too tight it always gets hit on a small dip.   So I usually have it much lower, like at 8200 now for 9900.   I did lose a little profit stopping out on May 16th when we dropped from 8200 down to 6600 and I stopped out at 6800.  But I bought back in 7200 on the way up, so not a huge loss.

It's the trading fees, that are going up, not the Fiat-&gt;Crypto fees.  And while they seem tiny, at first, day trading BTC and staying in the black isn't easy.  Now it's a good bit harder.  Used to be If I bought BTC at 10,000, I wouldn't make money until about 10,034 (0.17% fees for last month).  Now I don't make money until $10,100, ($50 for the buy and $50 for the sale).  If I trade with about 1 BTC, I will likely make it into the second tier, but no longer worth it to day trade.  Tier 2, would be $10,070 before I make money.  So even at tier 2 fees double.    
And coinbase went and chased off all the little fish that fed the larger traders.  Doesn't matter if the fees are lower if only the pros are left.

Usually you can sell BTC over market value.  And if you are buying stuff on Amazon anyways, it's a no brainer.
But, I haven't done this, once you send the coins, you have no control over where they end up.  And coinbase is funny about it's coins showing up on darker internet sites.

In order to buy in while holding a sell wall, they will have to buy their own coins.  I understand the desire to see a conspiracy when a sell wall is holding up your profits, but I want to hear a working conspiracy that actually makes money doing this.
Even shorting doesn’t really explain it.  Since you have plenty of coins to cover a short.
Maybe arbitrage?  To ensure you can buy cheaper coins on gdax to replace coins you are selling for more on bitfinex?

BTC and BCH use the same mining hardware and are competing for miners.  Miners are required for transactions to work.  BCH was designed to adjust difficulty more quickly than BTC and this lead to wild osculations in mining profitability between the two coins, and when ever a BTC user is complaining about transactions taking too long or fees being to high, BCH is generally to blame.

But a simple examination of publicly available information shows they are solvent.  Their exchange is doing about 1 billion a day in trades ($1,134,358,773 today).

If you are really worried about tether, don't hold on bitfinex or poloniex, and put stop order in place on your favorite exchange.  A stop order on GDAX at $5200 would get you well below support levels and protect you from a news/FUD based crash.

It's was all shilling, rbtc was pushing this narrative as part of their shill campaign last week.  Clearly don't put your life savings into tether, but tethers will not implode bringing down Bitcoin with it.
Bitfinex had their banking shut down by US regulators.  The company that owns bitfinex replaced that banking with tethers and they are keeping their banking secret to avoid further trouble with US regulators.  It is a little shady, because of this.  But it's not on the edge of imploding.  Bitfinex is making a billion a year in trading fees alone, and they are not having solvency issues.

Yes, likely at $10,000 or $9,990, back down to even $7500.   Or it could be $12,000 down to $9500.  But so far, people aggressively buy the dip.   If you want to time to market, drop a stop order in at $9800 when the price gets over $9900.  Then be prepared to reload for the march back up.

You have to take shilling with a huge grain of salt.  The bigblockers believe that Tethers are created out of thin air to prop up the price of BTC.  They hope that Tethers will collapse and bring down BTC so that BCH can become the one true bitcoin. 
But ifinex, the company that issues tethers is getting a small percentage of a billion dollars in transactions every day. They will make more this year in trading fees than all the tethers issued.
More than likely ifinex is taking in cash reserves for each tether and investing them in some way.  Could be anything from treasury bonds to funding margin trading on bitfinex.  And this is why ifinex is a bit close lipped about it.

Ifinex inc is running the largest exchange by volume.  If everyone is going to trust them to hold BTC, BCH, ETC, LTC and a couple dozen other currencies, they have to trust tethers.
Tether, assuming it does actually have 1 to 1 reserves, is actually very useful.  It's a crypto without volitility.  Currently that takes a centralized coin.  
Bitfinex crashing would have issues well beyond tether holders.  So, why FUD tethers?

Hold with the majority of your stack.  Day trade with 25% for as long as it takes to learn you are not a day trader.
See which stack grows faster.   Also keep in mind that in this market a monkey throwing his feces at a laptop with GDAX up could make money.  The real trick is to make more money trading (or at least lower your risk) than you could simply make holding.  Especially after taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:37:46
The price is on a train to $10,000.  Everyone knows that the price will hit $10,000 this year, so they feel safe buying in now, and making a nice %10-15 profit.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:23:58
Great, now move it over to coinbase-pro and set up a stop loss sale if the price drops under 8000.  As the price moves up pull stop price up staying about 15-20% under so it will only hit on a price collapse.  Then when the bull finally runs out of steam, you will have cash to rebuy the bottom.

He’s likely just guessing but it’s the opposite of a flash crash.  As the price rises the shorts go red and are forced to buy to cover their position.  More buyers push the price up.  This causes more short sellers to go red and bang the price explodes up.  The arbitrage bots pull up sites like coinbase that dont allow margin trades.

Dude,  At worst I was 10% net worth in.  But at the top I could have pulled 6 figures out of the market, and it all fell away.   Long term, 5 years or so, you will see that 10K mark, and likely before the end of the year.   
If I was in your shoes it would be tempting to sell today, and place limit buy orders in between $3500-$4500 to rebuy the next dip.  Then you will automatically catch the next dip.  Or heck put a stop order in at $4800.   If it executes rebuy the next dip.
Though if that money can ride for a couple years, you will see 10k again.

Crypto is very hard to day trade.  Also leave your 401k alone and simply put $100 a week in or a couple hundred a month.  And hold for long term.  This simplifies taxes too.
As for the people that do daytrade it is exclusively on exchanges.  Coinbase/GDAX is a good place to get your feet wet.  But unless you have a lot of trading experience, just buy and hold.  In 5-10 years it will either be through the roof or gone.

The nice thing about being a currency in addition to being a speculative instrument, is that you have buyers that don't care about the price.  Someone buying $500 in bitcoin to bet on a football game doesn't care if he's buying 0.1 bitcoin or 10.0 bitcoin as long as when he cashes out after his win it is for about $1000.

It will restore a new instance of the wallet with the coins safely inside.  So if you initialize a ledger nano s, saving the passphrase, then put 1 BTC in the nano.  It is safe.  You could destroy the nano with a blowtorch, then buy a new nano S put the passphrase in and you would still have your coin.
Coins aren't really stored in wallets.  They're stored in the blockchain, and as long as the passphrase is safe, and never on the internet, your coins are safe.

You could, for example, park your bitcoin stack on an exchange like poloniex, and loan it out at an interest rate that, overtime, adds up to about 10% a year.  Add that to the value that bitcoin naturally grows anyway, and it's a great deal.
But... you have to trust Poloniex for long term to make it worthwhile, and bitcoin exchanges are a bit fly-by-night for most people to park their coin in.
Your coin is used by margin traders to multiply their gains/losses.   Poloniex will liquidate their position to protect your coin, but in a serious flash crash, you could still take a loss.  Not sure what poloniex does in this case.

Well what do you do, and I know this is a crazy "what if" that could never happen scenario.  But what if bitcoin is tangled in a political battle between two groups both supporting different forks, and there is no clear consesus on which fork is **the** bitcoin?  If you decided on hash power then the bitmain syndicate wins by default.   If you chose based on market cap, then it will be expensive, for both sides.  Deepest pockets likely win.
It's concerning, and the hyperbolic talk here doesn't help.

Crypto is very hard to day trade.  Also leave your 401k alone and simply put $100 a week in or a couple hundred a month.  And hold for long term.  This simplifies taxes too.
As for the people that do daytrade it is exclusively on exchanges.  Coinbase/GDAX is a good place to get your feet wet.  But unless you have a lot of trading experience, just buy and hold.  In 5-10 years it will either be through the roof or gone.

With the upcoming fork and bitmain diverting hash power to support segwit2x, that sounds like a risky move.  BCH may not survive the year.  It is the coin that won’t die, but bitmain is the reason BCH keeps ticking.  Can bitmain prop up two coins?

It would basically be a BTC tether.  The point could be much cheaper transaction cost and higher transaction speed.  It would have to be issued in the same way USDT is.  I could for example issue 1 RedRumCoin for every BTC you give me.  At any time you want I would give you the BTC back for the RedRumCoin.

You need to be able to release FUD on a major news outlet.  Otherwise bitcoin will mysteriously go up 20% as soon as you open your order.  The Russians and the Chinese have this down pretty well, you might just hop on the back of their FUD if you can catch it quickly.

This fork is a bit more contentious then the last, but if we are lucky it will go about the same.  Do you already own BTC?  Over $1000? (Don't answer, it's a rhetorical question).  If so, go on Amazon, buy a ledger nano s, and be prepared to pull your BTC off coinbase by November 1.
If less, then ride through November with some popcorn.  If you want, put your BTC in the IOS bread wallet, or it's android or PC equivilant.

So basically buy high and sell low?  Have you tried this with real money?  Bitcoin moves much too quickly to trade based off a weekly MA.  A bitcoin move can be over in 20 minutes.
Edit: So, at no point during the last year  does the 26 week moving average go down.  Even the lows in September were still much higher than the prices from 26 weeks earlier that they were replacing.  So there's never a sell trigger (720 days since last sell trigger).  And OP has discovered another way to fool himself in back testing.  The algorithm that only trades once a year might as well be holding.

Bitcoin is a new unique combination of currency and speculative instrument.  It may turn out to be internet beanie babies that no one will want in 10 years.  That's unlikely, but a real possibility.  Anyone putting more that they can afford to lose into BTC is asking for trouble.
Speculation is behind all of bitcoin's current growth.  There's no denying that.   But bitcoin's use also as a currency is what keeps bitcoin going.
There are buyers out their for bitcoin that don't care if $500=1BTC or 0.1BTC as long as they can place a $500 bet on the next football game, and cash out about $1000 if they win.  Same thing with the darknets.  Darknet buyer don't care about the price of bitcoin as long as they can buy $100 worth.
This even extends to the Broader crypto market.  There are people out there that want IOTA or Ripple, or NEO, and need to buy bitcoin first as most of these currencies are traded against bitcoin.  Once again, these buyers don't care about the price of one bitcoin, as long as it's stable enough for them to buy their altcoin.
This means there's always someone willing to buy bitcoin, no matter the price.  And this helps keep the price up whereever the speculators push it.

If you do end up selling don’t forget about taxes.  If I were you I would start selling in small amounts and pay down any credit card debt or student/auto loans.

Coinbase provides a wallet as part of your account.  They have said that if you have bitcoin in that wallet durring the segwit2x fork, you will recieve both branches of the fork.
This is unusual since they really have never done this before.  Historically you would have to move your coins to your own wallet to get both.
The difference between a coinbase wallet and say a ledger nano S (hardware wallet) is that coinbase is holding the coins for you and you depend on them to provide both forks of the coins.  In your own wallet you have control.

Credit card companies get a cut of the transaction 2-3% depending on the company.  Coinbase isn’t going to eat that.  The fee is a lot cheaper if you link a bank account.  But in that case coinbase is buying at that day’s price with their cash while they wait 3-5 days for the bank to send it.
If you deposit cash, to GDAX, it’s free.  Then you can buy when the cash arrives at 0.25% or even free.

The nice thing about bitcoin is you can almost always hold back up to your entry price.  Usually just a couple days later, if not a couple weeks later.  $4900 is tough, but you will see it again before the end of the year.
Wait you did hold didn't you?  Stopping out at 4750 or 4800 and buying back in mid September would have been respectable.   But selling under $4000 would have been tough.

Where do you think BCH hash power is coming from?  Also bitmain required that mining hardware be paid for in BCH.  The emergency difficulty adjustment pulled outside miners into BCH, but that won’t work for segwit2x and bitmain may have to choose which fork to support.
BCH is a huge risk to hold through the next fork up to the coinbase distribution.  BCH held up rather well through the Gemini distribution, but new bitmain hardware delivery (paid for in BCH) helped.
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:39:46
Yes, more than likely.  If the exchange engine sees the market price as below your stop price, it will place your order.  That's why it's important to set a stop limit.  A flash crash is much less likely on GDAX with margin disabled.  But when it did happen, ETH sold for pennies.
So the stop price is the trigger and the stop limit is the minimum amount you will allow a sale.
@_date: 2017-10-05 03:09:46
So when bitcoin forked to become bitcoin and bch, you didn't get extra bitcoins.  You got your current coins, and a copy of your current coins as BCH.  You knew this by paying attention to bitcoin related news.  In my case the ledger software knew how to access both coins and gave me a way to transfer them.  So even if I hadn't been paying attention, I would have noticed the new "Bitcoin Cash" option when I next opened the wallet.  Once the new BCH network stabilized, I was able transfer them to an exchange and trade them for more bitcoin.

The ledger is *generally* safe in both of those cases, if you are careful.  The keys are stored in the nano, so a virus never has access to them.  When you do a transaction, it must be confirmed on the nano.  Make sure the address and the amount on the Nano match where and what you intend to send, and a virus can't steal your coins.
As far as loss, when you set up the wallet, you are give a list of key words.  Write those down, and put them somewhere safe, and you can restore a lost or stolen wallet.  Just don't lose both the keys words and the wallet and you are safe.  For example if you have a house fire and both are in a desk drawer, you could lose both.

Fear Uncertainty and Doubt.  It’s generally rumors or even real news around bit coin that causes the price to drop.  The drop is generally more than you would expect outside of the normal ups and downs.  For example, the russian central bank suggest the might ban russian bitcoin exchanges last week.  Then the next day putin said they should not interfere with crypto currencies.  So someone really well connect in russia shorted bitcoin just before the news.  Or maybe they just sold and rebought just after the news, and sold again when putin called the banks off.

Speculation is behind all of bitcoin's current growth.  There's no denying that.   But bitcoin's use also as a currency is what keeps bitcoin going.
There are buyers out their for bitcoin that don't care if $500=1BTC or 0.1BTC as long as they can place a $500 bet on the next football game, and cash out about $1000 if they win.  Same thing with the darknets.  Darknet buyer don't care about the price of bitcoin as long as they can buy $100 worth.
This even extends to the Broader crypto market.  There are people out there that want IOTA or Ripple, or NEO, and need to buy bitcoin first as most of these currencies are traded against bitcoin.  Once again, these buyers don't care about the price of one bitcoin, as long as it's stable enough for them to buy their altcoin.
This means there's always someone willing to buy bitcoin, no matter the price.  And this helps keep the price up whereever the speculators push it.

It lets you sell when the price goes down to the stop price  or buy when the price goes up to the stop price.
Notice this is the opposite of limit orders.  On limit orders you buy when the price goes down to your limit.  And sell shen the price goes up to your limit.
You can use stop orders as a safety net that protects you if the price falls through the floor.  Make sure and use the advanced option and set the stop limit a half a percent or so below your stop sell.  That’s the minimum you sell for on a stop trigger.

Take the political talk here and in with a grain of salt.   Coinbase hasn't sold any 2x coins yet, and if they support 2x, it won't be until mid-November.  If you don't use Coinbase, do it because you have better options in Europe.
The trick to 2x is to have your coins safe in a wallet you control before the fork.  If you're serious about bitcoin, buy a ledger nano s to hold your coins in November.

Say you buy at 3000, and the price moves up to 4100.  As the price moves up you keep a stop order $100 below the price and it is at 4000, and china does something and the price falls to 3800.  Your stop triggered at 4000 and you owe taxes on $1000.  You decided to buy back in at $3800 and now have slightly more BTC.  This is not a taxable event.  At least thats my understanding.  If the price goes up to 4800, and you sell for another $1000 a coin proffit, that’s another taxable event.

You borrow 10btc and sell it imediately for cash.  At some point in the future you have to pay back the 10btc.  So you will have to buy it again and pay it back.   So if BTC is $6000 at the start, you are holding $60,000.  2 days later BTC is $5000.  You buy 10btc and return it. The buyback cost $50,000.  So you just made $10,000.
Say the price skyrockets to $10,000 instead, you now only have $60,000 but need $100,000 so now you have to find $40,000.
It’s slightly more complicated since you also owe interest on the borrowed amount, but that’s basically it.

The segwit2x codebase has been taken from the original developers and placed in a new repository.  It started as a scalling debate and turned into a fight for control of bitcoin source.

What type of investor are you, short term or long term.  For short, BTC/EUR is now up at 3600, so when you asked, the answer was buy, but now who knows.  September is over, and hopefully the Chinese drama is done.  So the price should creep back up towards 4000(Euro). 
If you are long term start buying in weekly.  If you are short, come up with a trading plan and follow it.  For example enter when 1 hour RSI is below 30 and the price is stablish, and sell when 1 hour RSI is over 70.  Daytrading Cryptos is not for people new to investing.

That's more than a reddit comment, but basically bitcoin needs to scale to allow more transactions.  2x is a larger blocksize to fit more transactions.  And segwit is a way of grouping transactions.
The Chinese bitmain mining sydicate (prefers 2x because it's simpler, but it gives them more control over the future of bitcoin, see there I've already gone political.  
Segwit is preferred by bitcoin core (and the software developers.  A compromised was reached in spring called the NYA.  Basically no hard fork would occur and both Segwit and 2x would be put in place.  Segwit in August and 2x in November.
But the bitmain mining syndicate hard forked bitcoin cash August 1st anyways.  So there's no reason to add 2x at this point.
Can't help with NEO, I mostly stick to BTC, ETH and LTC.

Bitfinex is letting people reassemble BT1 and BT2 back into BTC.  This allows for arbitrage that effectivle means that the value of BT1 + BT2 = BTC.
Durring the previous fork this was not true, and BCH did not steal its value from BTC.  Now that is unavoidable.   The one good thing about the BCH fork was that it was free money.  Given that bitmain was propping up the BCH value intially it was a free gift at their expense.
This time bitfinex is forcing a balance.

Reading the bitfinex login banner this morning, it seemed like you could split 1 BTC, into 1 BT1 and 1 BT2.  It also seemed to state the opposite was possible.  You could take 1 BT1 and 1 BT2 and turn it back into 1 BTC.
Has anyone done this?   Is there a cost associated?  A couple times today I've noticed that the cost of 1 BT1 + 1 BT2 was around $100 different than the cost of 1 BTC.  This leads to arbitrage opportunities within a single exchange.
But it is locking the value to the cost of 1 BTC.  The BCH fork was more valuable post fork than prefork.  But this time BT2 must steal it's value from BT1.  So no free money with the upcoming fork.

Bitcoins you own now currently and coins bought today will be both bitcoin and bitcoin-segwit2x after the hardfork.  That’s why it’s called a fork.  The one bitcoin will become two, each with it’s own rules.
If the fork even occurs, you could end up with a bitcoin worth $4300, and a bitcoin-segwit2x worth $500.  This is what happened with the last fork.
The concern with coinbase is after the fork.  People believe that coinbase will only sell the new bitcoin-segwit2x after the November fork.

Coinbase hasn't said the would support the new bitcoin gold, but your bitcoin will be fine.   Bitcoin Gold (BTG) won't be worth much, but it's free money.
If you want to get access to BTG you need to transfer your funds to a wallet for which you have the keys.
The next fork is in November.  Coinbase has said they will provide access to both forks.  Once again you'd be better off in your own wallet.  But you won't lose your prefork bitcoin in either case on coinbase.

Well google it and get back to us, don't post off the top of your head like you know what you are talking about.  Takes 2 minutes.
Here, see how easy that was.

So does BTC hold it's value across a recession? Currently it seems to jump wildly in price based on nothing more than a tweet, but in the future it's possible.
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:23:01
Perhaps someone is trying to use obvious viral marketing in a scheme to short BTC on Jan 3, but it's so clumsy it will fall flat.

A surplus missile silo would make a much better lair.  And I would use cats calculating the next coin on legal pads to save on electricity.
But the hydroelectric setup would allow for sharks with frickin lasers.

Who thought this was a good idea?  Bitcoin had a terrible 2018, you want to cause a run on the exchanges to start off 2019?  Are some whales with money to throw at viral marketing shorting BTC at the start of the year?


Really?  This is the first year that I've heard of it, and a quick google didn't turn anything up from 2017.  Help me understand, am I missing the joke?  Is this an troll?

The difficulty to mine a bitcoin isn’t constant.  It changes to ensure that a bitcoin is mined every 10 minutes.  If half the miners stop working the next bitcoin will take about 20 minutes to find, and the difficulty algorythm starts lowering the difficulty until it takes 10 minutes again.

I don't.  The only coins I have in an exchange are the ones I'm currently trading.  But trying to line everyone up to withdraw on the same day is stupid.


You are an troll.  They're always on about the White paper and Satoshi's vision.  But I'm completely against this idiodic idea.  If you want *your* coins off the exchange, fine, pull them, but don't try to line up a day pretending this happens every year.

Eth went from around 9 at xmas to over 400.  You could turn 500 into 20k but 200k would take a time machine or a working crystal ball.

For tax purposes assume the IRS knows everthing and you won't get in trouble, but confiscation of coins you hold in wallet isn't realistic.   Not when it's so easy to "forget" the password.

I remember posting 666 here with the title “the end is near”.  But no one had a sense of humor.  I remember high 2s low 3s as my first purchase.

Is that before or after two exchanges turn out to actually have a partial reserve, go under, and the BTC prices crashes to nothing?
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:40:10
Well at least you helped bail all those people trading Eth on margin.
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:35:05
Don’t blindly follow idiots posting bullshit on reddit.  Someone big is shorting BTC on 1/3, and they have spun up viral marketting to make a run on BTC sound like a good idea.
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:26:49
It was margin traders losing value and having their margin positions sold off at market value. First it happens to one, likely one of the larger margin traders, and the selloff, lowers the market price just enough to hit the next weakest, then the next...and so on... And the price falls to 10 cents and everyone trading ETH on margin at GDAX learns an important lesson about cryptocurency markets...

It’s clearly a bull market.  Buying now and putting a stoploss in place 10-15% below market is a bet I’d take.
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:33:05
This is idiotic.  When MtGox failed to meet withdraw demand, the price of  BTC crashed for two years.  2018 wasn’t bad enough now you want to completly crash crypto.

It's some stupid scheme that start's with an obvious provable lie.

The nice thing about crypto is putting 5K in at the right time can turn into 30k.  But it can just as easily turn 30k into 5k.  I went 10% in and that turned into porche money if not lambo money at the end of 2017 then back to Civic money. 10-25% of networth is the most you should really do.  Do you have it on an exchange with a stop order in place at $6495?
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:24:26
So... how is the crypto insured?

So did you participate in this fictional event last year?
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:25:42
Currently crypto is a crazy high volatility speculation.  If you have more money in it than you can afford to lose you are already doing crypto wrong.  But if you were stupid enough to invest more than you could lose, then your only choice is to leave it on the exchange with an active stop loss order that leaves you with some money.
On the other hand the risk of bitcoin losing value because of a news event is 1000 time more likely than the executives of a US based company, running off with billions of investors money.
After all that, I’m not saying you should leave your money on the exchange.  I’m simply calling you out for lying.  This space is toxic enough with honest discussion.  If you can’t make your point without lying then you don’t have a point.

 How would taxes work.  You would owe taxes on capitol gains and if you are regularly depositing and withdrawing how would you even calculate the tax.
As a paypal alternative this isnt a concern but with 10k in at the start of the year and 14k now, thats enough to interest the IRS.
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:42:31
Why are the mods supporting this silly plan?  Controlling your own keys is a great idea assuming you know what you are doing,but planning a syncronized withdraw is not smart.  The fees will be higher for everyone and if one or two of the sketchier exchanges are running a partial reserve then it could start a real run on BTC and a price collapse.  Was 2018 not bad enough?  Is someone shorting BTC on 1/3?
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:32:55
This is why they segregate between hot and cold wallets.  If the cold wallets get hacked, all bets are off. But that's not easy to pull off.  The hot wallet doesn't contain enough crypto to bankrupt the exchange.  And Binance is making huge profits off their volume.
This is a profitable business, and they learn from every hack.  And smarter people than a couple consipiracy theorists on the internet have thought this through.
