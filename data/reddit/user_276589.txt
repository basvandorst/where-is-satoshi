thanks, ill continue to read
what it comes down to for me at the moment is the question:  
can you trace a certain transaction to me if i used a vpn when it took place? i disclosed my personal information when buying the bitcoins, and i sent them to my wallet, but.
i understand there will be traces linking my buy of bitcoins and my wallet i used at that time.  
i do not understand wether u therefor also can link another transaction from that same wallet to someone else, i would think not because each transaction has this unique address, in no way can you trace that back to me (if i hide my ip)(?)

Can i move my btc from one wallet (electrum) to another like wasabi securely?

\- I buy btc with my personal info - receive the btc with a "dirty wallet", Electrum  
\- Exchange btc to monero @ changelly - receive the monero with mymonero wallet  
\- Exchange monero to btc @ [xmr.to]( \- receive the final btc with a "clean wallet", Electrum - which i only use for this purpose
This sound correct for anonymity?

Yeah thats what im thinking, without really knowing much lol.
So KYC is basically when you buy btc and provide personal information/bank accounts i guess (english isnt main language)

This sounds interesting.
So it wont matter if i give my personal information when buying xmr because when i exchange it to btc the transaction wont be traceable because of how xmr works?

Monero is another cryptocurrency? Is it more anonymous or how would that help?

Buying monero and exchanging for btc sounds like a plan. Im not planning on cashing it out

Im only planning to use cryptocurrency to pay for vpn. Im not planning on making money or to buy any kind of big amount.
Just having a wallet with as clean as possible btc for vpn monthly payments
