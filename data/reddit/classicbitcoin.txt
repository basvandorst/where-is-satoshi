This is a big event for Bitcoin, max block size should be increased to make room for demand.
@_date: 2016-04-03 16:02:32
Why are no posts allowed that claim Blockstream controls core development?

If blocks weren't crippled users wouldn't have to "research fees".  If there's free block size space then transactions will all just confirm with a minimal fee, no research necessary.  
Are you trying to bring new users onboard or make bitcoin an elitist currency like a black card credit card lol? 
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:47:49
Right, but support by fee is in the process of being phased in.  During this phasing fees would remain small, but number of fees would increase with tx count and cover for lower to no block reward.  Even with low number of transactions Bitcoin would still work today with no block reward, just there would be less miners and tx fees would be slightly higher, although this would pay for itself by having less inflation.  If you think about it, block reward is a fee paid by all bitcoin holders.

There are solutions like thin blocks to help lower bandwidth usage.   But a few nodes limiting bandwidth is not nearly as big a problem as blocking the majority of users transactions until they pay a higher fee (encroaching on extortion).  We don't have a problem with transactions being relayed, we have a problem with them being confirmed.  Therefore the solution is to raise the block size.  If we do have a problem with transactions being relayed, nodes can decide to relay only transactions paying a high enough fee, and thus weeding out what the network can't handle.  Miners will have an incentive to setup nodes to relay themselves the higher fee transactions.  The incentives are all in place for bitcoin to work perfectly, but an artificial block size limit messes that up.  Layer 2 scaling solutions like segwit and lightning network also mess up the incentives.

If you'd like to limit yourself there!
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:19:18
New money coming in-- time to increase the block size!
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:15:55
But since most transactions would occur on the lightning network it would greatly lower the proportion of tx fees to the value of the network they support.  So the amount of money going into securing the network via mining would be much less than is needed to actually secure the network.

Also these things can be built as alt-coins, as bitcoin has a clear direction that it's set on not involving other solutions like segwit (check satoshi's whitepaper).  It's like HTML still exists in its original for while JavaScript and html5 are built for those who wish to use them.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:08:48
Those of us who were here before blockstream remember when it did work they way we wanted it, as it was designed that way!
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:16:47
Segwit involves a scenario where you give with one hand and take with the other.
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:14:57
Your argument sounds backwards.  
Anyone sending/receiving bitcoin can see that their transaction is either costly or slow to send.  They are competing for a set number of transaction slots.  1mb max block size means limited transactions.  The obvious solution is to increase the block size.  
As you say, don't let anyone fool you!

I realize in the present that a corporation is trying to take over the bitcoin network that was built for the people to protect them from large banking institutions.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:54:50
I don't want to lock my funds up on a lightning hub and be subject to whatever fees they require.  Fees going to miners is essential for the incentive structure to work. Without that bitcoin is nothing.  
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:01:26
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:34:28
Ok, but then we should certainly not limit the transactions/blocksize... that'd be like limiting the number of websites on the internet.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:51:39
With segwit, blocks size is effectively raised one-time, which doesn't help long-term.  That's the hand that gives something.
The other hand, which takes, is that segwit paves the way for the lightning network, which is a way for private (banking) institutions to setup a hub where they collect transaction fees.  You see, bitcoin works because anyone can mine transactions and no one company control which transactions go through.  With lightning hubs, you are subject to the poplar hubs' fee structure.  
Another thing segwit does is complicate the software.  Bitcoin's beauty is in its simplicity, and now that the world is waking up to its greatness there is a movement to complicate it and destroy its incentive structure.  
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:10:35
Do you remember a few years ago when there was no wait time, only a bit it you sent with 0 fee?  Good old days before the blockstream takeover.  If you want to save bitcoin we need to increase the block size and assert the community's control over the protocol.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:55:53
Because anyone can come in and mine transactions that other miners are ignoring.  It's what makes bitcoin decentralized.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:59:03
Bitcoin is simple.  Anyone with mining hardware can process transactions for anyone else and collect a reward for it.  Anyone can run a node and relay transactions around the network. 
 It's only when you start limiting the number of transactions that can be mined and setting up a centralized system where people can transact instead that things start to get complicated. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:12:58
Or an educated decision if they want to support larger or crippled blocks.  It's a no brainer if you've witnessed the uncrowded and free(dom) network of the past.

Why is my glass of lemonade overflowing, it's only 10% juice!
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:18:57
Lol!  This network is fully crippled.  Let's raise the block size already.
@_date: 2016-01-22 17:08:01
Cool! Wish it would allow ios 7
@_date: 2016-03-29 12:52:15
Less juice or water, yes. But glass size is strictly volume of liquid. Glass size = block size, period.
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:17:03
Think for yourselves people.  Don't trust anyone on the internet.  Especially the self proclaimed VP of Marketing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-07 15:53:35
Bitcoin has worked fine for years til it pushed the 1mb limit, which was meant to be raised according to early writings.  The basic concept is simple, and there's actually incentive for one particular company to profit from the network not handling more than 1mb of transactions, so that may be part of the push for any add-on to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-30 04:34:21
Yes! And I think that one was modified multiple times to keep up with ever increasing fees! :'D
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:52:41
Segwit merged into bitcoin /s
@_date: 2017-01-29 14:33:02
Wasn't there a similar ad a few years ago comparing the $5 Western Union fee to Bitcoin's $0.01 fee?
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:44:16
...Or you could support bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-11 04:24:18
Thought it said polymer bitcoin  **nodes**. Lol.
Also 
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:42:21
Those ideologies happen to be those of Satoshi Nakamoto.  Anyone reading should check out the whitepaper.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:22:25
Bill should most importantly have common sense and recognize that blocks are full and their size be increased.

Congrats!  Any chance you'll do a batch of Grade B / dark robust?  I'd definitely order some :)
