Huh? Could you explain that one? I'd have said it's more like they want a bigger bucket because their itty-bitty one keeps overflowing and it's trivially easy for other people to fill it up with crap so the bucket can't be used for its intended purpose. How is the system supposed to "keep a block clean"? What does a "clean" block mean?

Do people not get that segwit actually makes blocks larger? No space is being saved - incompatible client software is just tricked into thinking the transaction is smaller than it actually is, and compatible clients can see the hidden signatures and weights that data differently when calculating fees. It's not a compression method.

Segwit is a transaction type on the BTC chain. It allows you to create larger blocks by moving the signatures (witness) to the end of the transaction which makes the transaction ID non-malleable. It's basically BTC as long as the miners support segwit.

But since BTC is just a store of value, isn't that a good thing? It'll take spam transactions (or "transactions") off the chain. That'll free up blocks for...

I'm afraid not, no. Mining doesn't work like that.
I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that larger merchants will start doing deals with the larger mining pools to favor their transactions over any attempt to double-spend, making transactions faster since they have reduced risk of double-spends faster but introducing an uncomfortable level of hierarchy into the system.

As far as I can see, the difficulties increasing the transaction frequency that the system can handle are inherent to the network being a trustless system that needs to account for transmission time of solutions through the network - the longer a solution takes to be propagated through the network the greater chance of conflicting solutions and also the greater the advantage that the node that found the previous solution has in finding the next one (because it is able to start looking for the next solution right away). If there was a way to eliminate that advantage then block confirmation times could be brought down to something approaching the time it takes for solutions to propagate through the network.
My first thought was that any block solution must include transactions with a timestamp greater than the previous solution timestamp plus a value greater than the time taken for solutions to propagate through the network - ensuring that all nodes would be able to start searching for the next solution at (broadly) the same time. Unfortunately it would be hilariously easy to fake a post-dated transaction to beat this rule.  
I freely allow that there's almost definitely factors that I've failed to take into account and/or gotten wrong but my read is that while the speed of block propagation affects mining the transaction frequency will continue to be bound by the speed of the Internet itself.
@_date: 2014-01-12 08:49:52
There's no "we" when it comes to mining. There is no meta-awareness in the network itself unless you count when the block difficulty is adjusted, at which point the only variables are the current difficulty and the total time taken to solve 2016 blocks. Every individual actor in the mining network is solving a block that includes a transaction awarding them 25 BTC for solving it. 
The genius and the limitation of the bitcoin network is that every action by every actor benefits them at the time when they make it. The network assumes that every actor will behave selfishly and is designed to make the selfish action by the individual also the correct action to benefit the network at that point in time. Much like every other system based on short-term self interest (including most economic systems), it has a problem with consolidation of resources that isn't simple to resolve.
Mining pools arose to solve a problem with the concept of mining - namely that when there are enough miners in the system it isn't rewarding for an individual to mine over a realistic time frame. It might turn out that building a p2p-pool-like infrastructure into the bitcoin protocol itself could fix this issue - I'm not in a position to say. But identifying and punishing pools that are "too large" according to some metric would require in-time knowledge of the network - which doesn't exist (mining statistics are always after the fact) and the acknowledgement of an overarching governor of the network, which is antithetical to the core tenet of the network itself.

My first thought is that it won't achieve real stability until / unless the BTC exchange rate is 100 - 1000 times what it is now so that orders that create swings are much more expensive and difficult to pull off.
My second thought is that it may never achieve that level of stability while there is no reserve bank-like entity tasked with buying and selling BTC in order to keep the currency stable - which I don't see happening unless BTC starts to become critically important to world monetary flows. At that point the UN or the World Bank might create an agency tasked with ensuring the stability of the currency. I don't see that ever happening, but if you're looking for an indication that Bitcoin has "made it" that'd be a pretty big one.

Yes it is. There are also virus's that take over the host machines resources and use them to mine.

Exactly. It's useful to think of buying mining equipment with fiat as a complicated way of buying BTC. When the exchange rate was higher it made more sense to buy mining equipment since you could eventually mine more coins with it than you could buy at the time (there is also a large degree of risk that needs to be factored in when dealing with a company like BFL, or any other miner without a proven track record of meeting deadlines).

It's a good idea in general but I don't know that it helps with this issue. The transaction limit is mainly down to the number of transactions that can be fit into a given block.

Not for nothing, but in the early days of Bitcoin a bug was exploited to create a massive number of bitcoins - more than actually existed. [The solution was to actually roll back the blockchain so the exploiting transaction could be removed]( So taking extraordinary measures because of bugs in the underlying blockchain code isn't exactly unprecedented, even if the circumstances aren't exactly the same.

True, the 3 month old currency is accepted in fewer places than the 7 year old one. Not "none" by any stretch, but less. What if that weren't the case? Is there a single reason to use BTC over BCH if you have the option to use both? With BCH, the fee is vastly less, the transaction will almost certainly get confirmed in the next block, and even at 0-conf the transaction is much more secure because it can't be overwritten by an RBF transaction (this has a material cost since merchants that accept BTC in Japan pay insurance to hedge against the chance that a transaction is invalidated. RBF - independent of the insane transaction fees and approval times - increases this risk and so increases insurance premiums).
If all you've got is "BCH support hasn't been implemented in as many places yet" I don't think that's going to hold for very long - especially with BS Core's overt contempt for business's that want to use bitcoin.

If Paypal offered a wallet service with a certain degree of insurance against wallet hacking as an account option that may indeed be game over for a lot of Bitcoin processors.

It's worth considering that Paypal may be publicly supporting Bitcoin as leverage against the credit card companies increasing their processing fees. I wouldn't expect any huge movement from Paypal.

I suspect he meant that two transactions for the same amount possibly originating from the same wallet depositing BTC into his wallet were made.

I bought a 10 dollar card at BTC872 / USD. The process was fast. Sending an email containing the payment instructions is a good idea to confirm that the email address is correct but the payment information was also on the web page itself after entering the email address so it is possible for someone to make a mistake entering their email address and still make a payment, leading to the steam code being sent to the bad email address. I'd recommend either leaving the payment details off the web page or detecting if the payment has been sent and displaying the steam code on the web page when it has.

True, though you're talking about the BTC/fiat price I think, and that is a function of the exchanges and the absence of central control.

Also, more sophisticated financial instruments and professional exchanges with tighter rules are coming online which should help to smooth the swings in both directions.

Small point: at current prices the miner will make a nice profit - according to the profitability calculator at [ assuming that the difficulty doubled each month the miner will be close to useless by March 2014 but will have mined 21.4 BTC in that time, which at current exchange rates is a nice little profit, but more saliently, at this point in time at current rates it is more cost effective to mine the coin using the miner (provided my assumptions hold true) than to buy them on an exchange. 
Whether it is a worthwhile investment is a separate question but provided somebody was bullish on bitcoin, buying the miner at that price is rational. Whether the price will stay rational over the course of the auction is another question.

The $250 peak last month was a speculative bubble that burst in part because bitcoin's utility as a currency wasn't equal to it's price. The infrastructure wasn't in place to support it and the price fluctuations were making pricing goods that are also commonly priced in fiat currency a major headache. 
The good news is that the infrastructure is now being put in place by larger, more stable players and the relative stability of BTC these past few weeks has shored up it's credibility as a medium of exchange. The next time it rises beyond 10% of it's current value I think will be because there is simply not enough coin to go around in the BTC economy and how that situation resolves will determine bitcoin's fate as a currency.

Initially read about it in an Arstechnica post when BTC was first introduced - didn't think much of it but tried CPU mining for a bit and got nowhere. Forgot about it until I read a tweet by Rick Falkvinge in March about it and decided to dip my toe in with an 8BTC purchase from BitInnovate (RIP).

It's very unlikely, but the market could use the liquidity at this point. From what I've seen the buy / sell spreads are very high.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:27:19
For a somewhat unorthodox solution you could buy a mining bond like TAT.VIRTUALMINING - at .007BTC / 1MHs you can buy the hashing equivalent of an AM Blade USB for 2.3BTC without tying up the coin in hardware.

Reportedly ASICMINER is going to be auctioning off a bunch of small (250MH) USB key miners (called Satoshis). Three of those will give you as much power as a top-end GPU miner so if you wanted to dip your toe in that'd be the way to do it. 
There's an excellent chance that there'll be a post about it in if it ever happens so stay tuned I guess.

I can personally recommend securitykiss.com - among other things they give a 50% discount for paying in BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-21 06:23:24
You may be able to buy dedicated mining hardware off eBay for way, way too much if time is a factor. Other than that your best bet is to wait for the next ASICMINER sale / auction or possibly get in on a USB miner sale (there's a minimum order of 300 units at 2BTC / unit).

Back out of the deal or ask him to prove he's legit if there are red flags. That's what escrow service are for.

From memory they used BitPay or CoinBase - if it isn't visible on the payment screen then I guess they're not offering it anymore. Bloody hell - I hope they haven't removed it as an option.

This isn't so much a worry for Bitcoin as it is a disaster for liberty and privacy and trust in government institutions. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 04:06:35
They're legit. They're Block Eruptor USB sticks from ASICMINER. They mine at 330MHs. They're available for 2BTC in batches of 300+.
@_date: 2013-06-09 04:26:18
He's not wrong. Block rewards will make mining unprofitable without significant additional rewards from transaction fees (assuming that the hashrate continues to increase more power will be required to run mining hardware even taking improvements in technology into account) that enough mining power will fall out of the network that it may leave a dominant player with enough hash power to execute a 51% attack.
Perhaps more meaningfully, if transactions haven't increased to the point where they meaningfully contribute to mining income then that would mean that growth of usage of Bitcoin hadn't eventuated from all of the investment that is taking place right now, meaning that either Bitcoin is being used as a store of wealth or that it has generally failed to break into wider use.

A pretty good life plan in general.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:21:36
They're FPGAs (programmable microchips), not ASICs. At $1000 / 800MHs the price / performance isn't worth considering.
For your requirements ASICMINER is pretty much the only game in town, and they're priced accordingly.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:31:54
If I had any faith that they meant that they were going to add value to the BTC network as opposed to find a way to exploit it, I'd feel better about that statement.

" If you complain that we ship little and that the difficulty is rising rapidly, you just don't understand how this whole BTC thing works."
The full quote doesn't paint them in any better light considering they're only one BTC mining hardware supplier of several. The partial quote just paints them as condescending assholes - and we already knew that. The full quote makes them look like idiots in the bargain.
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:59:22
A lot of mining pools and BTC stock exchanges give you the option of locking an address to an account, which is an option that I prefer since it allows you to avoid address reuse.

Nope - there are a few pubs in Sydney that accept payment in BTC but I've never been. Also I bought a Raspberry Pi from BitInnovate a few weeks ago but their site is down for maintenance today, which was a bit unfortunate.

I had a feeling that was going to happen after they'd demonstrated working hardware and Avalon had drastically increased their prices.

Got my LC recently and it's been (loudly) mining non-stop for the past three days. With the BTC price appreciation recently I may even make back what I paid for it.

Nearly had a bloody heart attack until I found out it wasn't coinjar.io. What the hell is Tradefortress? Thought I was reasonably savvy but I'd never heard of it until today.

1. Yes they do ship to Australia.
2. Nvidia GPU's are rubbish when it comes to mining. You'd be better off with a 4 year old ATI card than a Nvidia 690.
3. If you want to buy coins in Australia quickly bitinnovate.com have a fast service though they charge 7% commission. Just make sure to physically deposit the money in the bank - online transfers don't cut it.

To the best of my knowledge this weeks dividend was larger than usual because it included proceeds from an oversubscribed sale of mining hardware. Proceeds from mining alone would have been around .015 - this has been rising steadily but I would be very surprised if we saw another dividend above .03BTC/share in the next couple of weeks. In the normal share market the distributed proceeds from the sale would have been marked as a special dividend.
Of course, I could be wrong about that. I don't think there's been a definitive statement from the company so this is just speculation. Also, even at .015 / week ASICMINER shares are stupid underweight, especially considering they are one of the few business's in the BTC sharemarket with a medium to long term business plan.

Spending is still a disposal of the asset so it is a taxable event. An accountant can help you with the particulars but my read is that the capital appreciation of the portion that you sold or exchanged for goods is taxable.

I've been spending a few mBTC here and there - Humble Bundle, VPN, gift cards and some hardware purchases. Overall I've spent a few BTC over the past 6 months - less recently, but only because less buys a lot more these days.
