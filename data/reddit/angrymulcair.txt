5000 bitcoins
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:06:21
Yeah, a Bank!
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:22:47
Perhaps if **you** fucking speculators we're around, merchants wouldn't feel the need to safeguard their profits from wild price swings.
@_date: 2014-01-01 01:08:56
Yeah, put all your eggs in one basket.  
Great investment strategy, dipshit!

If nobody paid for porn, you wouldn't have any free stuff to look at.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:25:10
Yes.  
That's the same principal physical Bitcoins work off of.  
The value of the keys are directly tied to the underlying asset.
@_date: 2014-08-13 01:32:30
Different banks have different rates.
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:08:36


You've never talked to a Canadian then.  
It's the most popular payment method in Canada, with 99% of retailers accepting it.

Reward points are a scam, designed to condition the public into using Credit Cards to buy everything.
The cost of those points is built into everything you buy nowadays.  
Essentially you're just getting back your own money, minus Visa's cut.
@_date: 2014-09-14 02:29:10
Shut up!  
Your ruining the illusion!
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:27:13
Let me get this straight.  
You want them to commit a crime by lying on a Customs Declaration, just so you can evade taxes like a freeloading cunt?
I'd refuse too. People like you give Bitcoin a bad name.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:08:52
Yeah, I have access to 1000's of MAK keys as well.   
But guess what? They belong to my employer.
What this guy is doing is extremely Illegal.
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:47:48
Good luck getting your coins back, sucker
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:09:02
Fell compared to what?  
Bitcoin won't magically prevent recessions.
@_date: 2014-01-01 06:59:18
I sure hope you are still young, and don't have any real responsibilities. Because your reckless investment strategy is putting your families life at risk.

Again, learn to manage your cashflow better.  
EFT's take two days. Plan for it.
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:23:10
$1 is a fucking insult, especially considering this is for Charity.

GPL is for commies.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:22:26
So they simply kill you instead.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:22:39
You sure place a lot of faith in humanity to do the right thing.  
In reality, society would collapse if taxes were voluntary.  
Your average person is greedy and self-centered.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:26:35
Good thing the blockchain keeps a record of when the coins were moved.
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:00:48


That's because the Bank charges the merchant those fees instead, which is built into the cost of every product you buy.

Welcome to the Future, America!  
The world was waiting.
@_date: 2014-01-11 00:54:09
Really? Because Commercial Copyright Infringement is a pretty big deal.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:59:01
No, just people who realize there are costs to living in a Modern, free society.
People who don't pay taxes are leaches.

If you are living off the avails of your MMORPG assets, then yes, it could be considered income.
The same goes for being paid in Bitcoin.

Last time I researched this, the average transaction fee was $0.12
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:30:44
Better hope your motherboard doesn't come with bent pins.  
Bitcoin favours the merchant, every time.

"High Speed"
@_date: 2014-08-13 01:53:49
The reason EFT's take so long is the Banks collect a large batch of transactions throughout the business day, then submit them for overnight settlement.  
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:35:06
LOL  
Ok bro
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:46:11


Fuck you asswipe!  
I can guarantee you wouldn't qualify for immigration.
We only let people in who have needed skills.
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:43:13
Fat Chance.  
Nobody is going to use such a volatile currency. Hence why there is so much USD floating around these countries.
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:15:55
He drew first blood!
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:58:03
Except I can send money instantly through various systems.  
Exchanges just won't accept them due to "Fraud Risk"

@_date: 2013-12-22 17:20:58
You realize the broker charges you Interest on that right?  
You're better off buying an option contract.
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:32:00
At least he used it for something, unlike 98% of the community that hoards them until another bubble pops.
