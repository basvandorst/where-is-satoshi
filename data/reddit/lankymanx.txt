i would be happy if i only just bought 1 or 2 damit, i cant believe this.
every tom dick and harry is making mining more difficult now
@_date: 2019-08-23 13:40:28
Oh okay, I've seen that before ... Why is it doing that though?
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:45:02
I used those as real examples yes just to clarify ot show what i am doing,
i will regenerate or re-install bitcoin core again .
I am just trying to understand this private key crap, i really dont understand the purpose of it.
 **If you put your wallet.dat in a new machine/install, you will see your  whole wallet**   (got this part, yes)
**but not this part , not sure what u mean by IF and in the first place (i am just asking) what is the purpose of the keys , do i need them... -&gt;.** If you put that private key - which is not a master key -  into a new machine/install, you will just see/have access to the utxo(s)  associated with that one address (37Tn1...). 
also do i need to worry about bitcoin upgrades or some crap and then when i do this and my wallet.dat is all of a sudden not recognized.
Thing is i am currently storing bitcoin on an exchange so i am not sure it is a good idea.
I dont know a better alternative.

It  is a train wreck, apologize for the shitty post.
I am using windows not linux so that link doesnt really apply to me, and yes i did good that but the thing is some articles talk about items which may not even apply to me which i what i am questioning now.
I also want to make absolutely sure i dont miss anything and also with all the scamming out there how the hell would i know if and what posts are legit.
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:43:24
I am basically trying to figure out what the hell i am supposed to backup or keep in case the computer i am using that has the bitcoin core wallet just decides to not turn on or the hard drive crashes or whatever.
I plan to use it for my bitcoin storage only have it offline mainly.
I used those address in my post as a real example but they are not my addresses or keys i will be using of course - it was for illustration purposes for my post.
So yes i still dont clearly know what i am supposed to backup or keep in case there is some stupid unknown with my bitcoin core wallet or i can not get to it because of a computer issue, be it hard disk drive or whatever.
Do i need my wallet.dat and is that all i need?
Do i need private keys ?
I thought that if i had an issue , i would just re-setup and download the blockchain for the bitcoin core wallet on a new machine for example.... and then copy over the wallet.dat file....
Thats all i thought i need.... so not sure exactly why or if i need my private keys?
First off i choose this method of storing my bitcoin because i dont seem to want to buy a nano ledger x or s , that seems like a pain if something goes wrong with it, like a button doesn work or it doesnt come on or just something stupid.
 The PC method for me seems easier and free.

I hear my wife being grumpy
@_date: 2019-08-23 06:39:35
In my case , if you mean 1 hour, it's more like 1 day because it takes ages to synch the wallet. 
Thanks for the clarity.
At least I know now about the wallet.dat being all I need.
I thought u needed something else to prove the wallet.dat is yours or something else around being a me to initiate a send or receive on the wallet.dat.
I also hope to god that somehow something doesn't wonky and there is some BTC core update and then my wallet.dat doesn't work because it's legacy and blah blah blah....I had so much bkshit with these other shit coins that turns out to be scams and some just dead stupid projects.
@_date: 2019-08-23 13:37:13
Is this a required upgrade by or for bitcoin?
Old wallet.dat file will be compatible, I'm assuming a new Bitcoin core will be released.
@_date: 2019-08-22 15:07:47
Interesting, I downloaded the Electrum Wallet for mobile and I am asked to choose between two types of 2FA securities  for my wallet namely segwit and legacy - it goes on to talk about other websites that may not support segwit. 
So I don't understand what they are talking about since I am only inclined to use the Electrum wallet on my phone. Not understanding what other websites have to do with it.
Does anybody know ?
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:45:34
I will check it out , sometimes it's just good to watch stuff even if we think we know the story, we might surprise ourself. I'll look for what you are saying 30 times the money blah blah blah
@_date: 2019-08-21 17:03:16
Oh okay , so basically i should just do a dumpprivkey {my receive address} and then save that somewhere safe in a text file encrypted or whatever right?
Along with my wallet.dat file.
Do i need to save anything else?
What happens if bitcoin core gets updated to a new version , say 2 years from now, then is my wallet.dat file still valid?
Am i supposed to do a regular bitcoin core wallet check and have it installed as and when it gets updated and then of course re-backup the wallet.dat file again...
And lastly again, do i need to key my private keys  or just leave them?
or do i just do what everybody does and Install these other 3rd party wallets ?
or buy a hardware wallet....
i just thought this way is free and easier.
@_date: 2019-08-22 15:19:53
I have almost 3 coins , so I assume using a PC would be okay for my scenario. I plan to leave my machine offline mostly . I am avoiding using the exchange .
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:09:45
greedy and jealousy thats all i can add for now.
If the rich kids or parents who are rich want to mine then let them. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:06:29
So what is the next price taget ?

so freeking confusing, there is bitcoin-core-0.14.0/  but now what the f is   i mean this looks like a completely different variant.
it took me ages to download the block chain, i never want to do it again. I thought this BIP was 148 or something, what the hell is 91, man i dont understand what the hell to do now its not explained very well.
I have upgraded my Core to 0.14.2 and now this unknown block version download message is gone.
I still dont understand what i am supposed to do?
I thought by the 21st of July and 1st August funky stuff was supposed to happen, and i was just advised to be fulled synched with 130 gigs of block chain before this hapens and to use the proper bitcoin core wallet - bitcoin-core-0.14.x ?? is this right?
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:12:59
i agree the response is great , but i still dont understand the plan of action i need to be taking here.
I have bitcoin core 0.14.2 installed and i have the entire chain downloaded and i have this stupid warning message.
I am a casual miner of bitcoin/altcoin so what the hell?
Im confused what to do.
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:05:26
I dont get this, so i have installed Bitcoin Core 0.14.2 is that it?
I previously had 0.14.0 and downloaded the entire blockchain which took ages!
With this warning message, what am i supposed to do now? I still dont follow even after reading most of the comments below.
I read "Apatomoose" comment but i still dont understand the plan of action  i need to take in order to be with the majority rules/crowd/support for the network.
I am a casual miner of alt coin which in turn switch in to bitcoin. Please somebody explain to me what i need to follow or do here as i am not sure?
I have decided to cleanly re-install windows 7 on another machine and installed 0.14.2 and re-download the whole chain again , probably the most dumb idea... i dont know what the hell to do.
What i would love to understand is why miners or anybody would even want to bother with Segwit BIP xyz in the first place because for me, although i have not used it to pay for stuff yet but only send from one wallet to another, transactions are still way faster than VISA or SWIFT  so what the hell is the big idea?
So in saying that ,  as a casual miner,  do i signal? and how? 
do i just ignore this warning, are we saying this will eventually disapear?
Are we missing a boat when the whole BIP thing is done? 
i am really not understanding here.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:03:09
So to be safe i should leave my 0.04291441 BTCbitcoins in my Bitcoin core wallet 0.14.2 and not even transfer them to an exchange ?
If i understand you , i can mine but then not with stuff like nicehashminer?  because that pays every weeks or 2 in to your bitcoin address? Do i need to install "  instead?  and if yes, do i need to re-download the block chain again? gees thats a pain if i do
