GDAX/Coinbase doesn't collect any fees when you withdraw from their platform, but they don't pay the mining fee for you. You pay that to the Bitcoin network when you withdraw. That's what I was replying to in your original comment:


They didn't pay extra in fees. You did.

You pay Bitcoin mining fees when you transfer coin off of Coinbase/GDAX - not them.

I stand corrected! That's actually pretty amazing - I didn't know GDAX paid mining fees!

If you are making 200 a month mining, you should be reporting that now - not when you cash out.

This is almost correct - but there's even more to it than that...
Every time a transaction takes place, it has inputs and outputs. The outputs, which are now associated with a new address, are called "unspent transaction outputs", or UTXOs: 
An address's balance is actually the sum of its UTXOs. Because the UTXOs are what are actually stored on the blockchain.
So when you send a new transaction, it is actually a collection of UTXOs being sent - and these UTXOs might be in multiple addresses.
This means that a transaction from 20 different addresses can actually add up to a lot more than 20 inputs. Which means a larger overall size, and therefore larger fees.
So over time, if you end up with lots of little UTXOs, fees increase, because it requires additional blockchain space to consolidate them.
One of the risks of this design is "dust" - UTXOs that are so small that the fee to send them is more than the value of the UTXO itself.
