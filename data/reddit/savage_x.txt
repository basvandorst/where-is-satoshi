Not to mention, we do not even know how many BFX tokens were issued. We all assume it was $72m face value worth because that is the amount of the hack. They could have cut deals with large holders to give them more as an incentive, or they could have created a bunch of extra for themselves. I mean, these tokens are just sitting in their backend database where an employee can run a SQL statement to add 100 million tokens to someone's account. These things need to be on a publicly verifiable blockchain because right now this is not a "crypto" token at all, its a corporate database token.

Well, we have no idea how many tokens they even issued. I am not against the idea per say, but Bfx has given us so little information about these tokens that it is ludicrous to try to figure out their worth. As was mentioned above - it takes "faith" in their value, which generally isn't a very good investment strategy.

Developing these kinds of networks takes a while. It sucks, but there is real, actual code behind them:
They are definitely coming, just still in alpha phase. My understanding is that there are still protocol updates that need to be made to Bitcoin in order to support Lightning networks. Because of this, the first live lightning network may be on another blockchain.

They also have a bit problem here too - if they sell 36% of their customer's ETH/LTC to try to socialize those losses, they will completely crash those markets. This means they end up with even less BTC to repay those customers with.

The interesting thing about these tokens is that they essentially allow for a take over avenue from a competitor. Say OKCoin wanted to take over Bitfinex. If they were buying these coins at say 10 cents on the dollar, then they could at some point step in and offer to take over Bitfinex, repay all debts and make everyone whole. Except that they would be paying largely themselves if they managed to buy up a lot of tokens.

Its one step in the process though right. Now that Overstock has BTC in hand, it will be much easier for them to use that to purchase products wholesale for BTC.

@_date: 2014-01-17 21:15:08
No. Its infinitely divisible so the price itself is not a barrier to increasing the amount of transactions that the currency can support.
It might even increase the number of transactions because the currency would increase in value, giving existing holders to liquidate it.

Of course that is true, but in the long run, miners want to maximize their profits, so if they are doing something that is bad for the network users, they are hurting themselves. Of course, if there were a hard fork with two coins, we'd see real quick what the true market evaluation was for all players.
I think the vast majority of miners really do not want to be in charge of protocol level decisions. They would prefer to do what the market decides and leave the risk and politics to others. But they just do not have that luxury.
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:58:21
Not at all. If you knew the price that Bitcoin would need to rise in order for the claims to be paid back, then it would be rather easy to figure a price for the Gox claims that would be more profitable than the subsequent rise in Bitcoin's price. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:16:00
I had thought about this before, but it is entirely possible that politics drives mining costs to be a negative reward situation. Obviously the $13M would be completely offset by mining rewards in a sensible system like our current environment. 
Lets say an entity was controlling power blocking Segwit and it cost $10M (for easier math). Assume they are making a small profit with their mining investments though and it is not really actually losing them money. If they were willing to actually *pay* $10M in losses to block Segwit, they could gradually increase their hashpower by something like 10x with the intent to operate at a loss in order to achieve their political goals. This would affect the entire market, forcing other miners without political motivations to stop operating and increasing their share of mining market even more.
Some conclusions:
* A miner with some capital, political motivations and the right connections could very easily block Segwit for basically any amount of time.
* A 95% threshold for any controversial protocol change is completely unrealistic.
* Who benefits from this situation? People selling mining hardware. Previously these hardware creators were often the biggest miners. Now they might make more money selling the hardware to politically motivated entities. This would make for an "interest" shift in the Bitcoin mining dynamics.

From what I understand, shapeshift just uses Polo (and possibly other exchanges) behind the scenes make transactions. Its not really decentralized, it just doesn't require KYC.
The value of ETH the coin is definitely a bit of an enigma. I hold some just because I think that eventually the network will encompass a lot of economic activity and that generally conveys value to the underlying currency, but really who knows. In terms of actual usage, Ethereum does about 50k transactions per day and is really the only other blockchain out there seeing significant real usage. The are a couple dozen use cases for the network that look like they might be viable, but most are in POC stages. The primary use case right now for the network is asset tokens. *Lots* of startup companies raising funds, and also some that are trying to figure out how to issue tokens backed by actual assets (gold, company shares, dollars, bitcoins, etc). Basically the use cases that colored coins, bitshares, Nxt, and counterparty were trying to implement have largely moved to the Ethereum network and taken off in a significant way. With all these various tokens on the network then, state channels for decentralize exchanges become more interesting.
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:27:47
Yup, in a potential fork situation, you want to have control of the coins on both forks and not be reliant on an exchange to make decisions or assume they are competent enough to allow you to withdraw from both forks.

The miners control the hashrate behind the protocol, but in a potential fork situation, they will attempt to switch hashrate to the most profitable fork, so the market price a coin is going for will end up being the determining factor in the success of the fork.

Rootstock is simply going to keep 20% of the contract execution fee for themselves. IMO, that will limit their appeal over something like the Ethereum network, which will also eventually have a relay for Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:56:22
1. Moving payments off chain results in fewer transactions, leading to less velocity and lower BTC price. People are that treating BTC as an "investment" are not happy about this. The price may not drop all that much, but its fundamental prospects for growth are basically nil if the network is capped out.
2. IMO there is some risk that by pushing transactions off chain, you are losing some of the network effects and first mover advantage that Bitcoin has. Now users have to adopt new things in order to use sidechains...what if they just decide to move do a different currency instead?
3. If Bitcoin is just the settlement layer behind the scenes, then it is relatively easy to replace or supplement with something else. Why not use LTC for your settlement network, or GoldmanSachsCoin, or SWIFT? Sidechain operators could just chose the network with the cheapest miners, or the network where they have additional monetization opportunities. The power to decide these things is almost completely removed from the end users and we no longer have a very decentralized system.
3. The sidechain idea is popular in the corporate world because they have ideas on how to monetize those types of sidechains in ways that they cannot do with Bitcoin on chain. Sidechains *could* be done in a decentralized way, but they could also be done in centralized ways. This isn't something that is likely to benefit end users. I think one of the biggest worries is that users won't really have a choice - Bitcoin on-chain will be such a disaster that any scaling solution will have to be adopted, even if it is taking advantage of users. The fact that on-chain could be scaled up to allow for more choice but is not leaves a lot of questions to be asked about whether there is a conflict of interest taking place. Sidechains as an optional thing would be cool, sidechains as a mandatory thing is going to be met with resistance.

This is also the use case I am most excited about for Lightning networks. 
Talking about altcoin implementations, I think the Ethereum network will probably have some basic implementation in place prior to even Litecoin. There are already some decentralized token exchanges on the network that are technically functional but not very practical due to the low levels of liquidity and the difficulty of doing real-time order matching on the blockchain. These kinds of state channels are a game changer. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:42:09
Well, only the first big claim has been confirmed at all (53 confirmations). Of the subsequent 20 claims, none have any confirmations. So its basically first in wins right?
Seems like this is something a miner could take advantage of by prioritizing his own transaction? Obviously in this case the amount is far too small to be practical, buy it is an interesting case.

Serious question - what exactly did you think Bitcoin was going to be? Because that is pretty much what was promised. The game theory is in place to allow disputes to be resolved through the protocol, but that certainly does not guarantee that there will not be disputes.
I'm sure we are all frustrated with the process (I know I am), but it does seem to be more or less working as intended. The network for example still churns through transactions hour after hour, day after day, securing coins from friend and foe without a problem. 
When you step back and look at all the drama and the bullshit going on, and then realize that the network is working just fine despite these very vested and adversarial actors involved in the system, its actually quite amazing.

If that much of the hashrate was in agreement, the rest of the ecosystem would likely follow it. Conversely, you will not likely get that much hashrate to agree on one direction unless the majority of the ecosystem is also in agreement.
The situation we have today is a lot more contentious than that. Unlimited has opened up a hashrate lead, but still does not have even a clear majority. Even in the very unlikely event that they proceeded to convince every non-decided miner to join over to signal in that direction, they still would not reach 75%.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:50:36


Obviously "full time" is an exaggeration. However, he very often crawls down in the mud engaging trolls in their own game. We're not internet noobs here. Everyone knows this is a pointless exercise. He certainly has the right to behave in this way, but I also have the right to think he is an idiot for doing so.

@_date: 2017-03-09 13:49:37


Yup. I've always thought this was one of Bitcoin's basic quandaries. It is difficult to for a business to monetize on-chain. Therefore companies that want to run their business based on Bitcoin will inevitably push for off-chain solutions that they can monetize. 
Given the limits in the engineering around scaling, this isn't a bad thing, but I still find it disconcerting that we are not able to push towards those limits first and then look towards off-chain solutions.
And as an aside, if you look at a network like Ethereum, they can much more easily monetize via smart contracts on-chain. Market forces will then likely push the protocol to pursue more on-chain scaling solutions as a result. In many ways, this seems very appealing. I think it will lead to even more complex governance issues down the road though as many businesses may be advocating protocol level changes much more directly.

Maybe we as a community need to come to the realiziation that governance is required and we need better processes in place to discuss, debate, and vote on the issues at stake. We need to stop being naive about the nature of the problem. Decentralization does not mean that hard decisions can be avoided. Everyone hates politics, but it is inevitable. We are talking about BILLIONS of dollars at stake here where people's life savings and careers are involved. As the network grows in size and importance, these hurdles become more challenging to tackle.
There will be issues that we will never reach a "consensus" on. Its a fact. Making political decisions is a lot harder than coming to a consensus around blockchain transactions.
Its time for the Bitcoin community to grow up, and face these issues in a mature manner rather than squabbling, banning, censoring, backbiting and all the other shit that is going on these days.

How do you think we can improve the environment and culture? Open source code projects are important (not just Bitcoin, many others as well) and improving the situation could literally help make the world a better place.
The cypherpunk space in particularly seems pretty harsh. Mostly by design of course - challenging ideas, people, and code is the name of the game. A lot of the core devs regularly engage in trolling and aggressive behavior on social media. I even find this comment somewhat ironic because I've seen you do this as well. I'm sure that the blowback on highly involved devs is far, far worse than you guys dish out, but much of this current culture stems from the precedents you set. It seems like it will be hard to sustain quality devs long term in the current state.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:40:38
Sounds like a conspiracy theory o.0
I'd maintain that the truth is simpler. Bitmain sells ASICs as their primary business. An environment where there is contention between miners that causes an increase in sales for ASICs is good business. They are the arms dealer in a war. They want to prolong this war.

Government bonds are designed specifically as an investment vehicle though - with a rate of interest that provides a consistent rate of return.
Bitcoin is a currency - its not anything like that. If its use as a currency does not grow, it is not likely to make for a great investment vehicle.

Which is ironic because this isn't Bitcoin. Smells like R3's Corda, but they don't really give enough details in the article to know for sure.
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:12:28
To me, what you are describing here sounds more like a ponzi-scheme than an investment vehicle. Now granted, you can say the same thing about most currencies - they have value because people believe they have value. However, the most successful and stable currencies are the ones that are used the most.
Bitcoin in its current state is certainly not useless or valueless - I'm definitely not trying to say the sky is falling or anything. In my mind though, when I am evaluating it for potential returns, I see much less potential being realized if all it is used for is people buying and holding it and hoping it will go up in value. That will make for something very unstable, and with limited appeal.
We need a global digital currency. Obviously there are a lot of challenges around that, but if Bitcoin is not going to actually deliver that, then I fear that a large amount of its value is going to be transferred to wherever that is provided. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 14:31:11
We were talking about having a thick user base. Bitcoin as an investment vehicle doesn't really make sense if no one is using it for any other reason.

Yeah, I don't think there are any easy or good answers there, its ugly. Mistakes were made. Foundation devs are on the DAO's curator list. The DAO code was audited and signed off on by a huge number of respected devs. 20% of the DAO tokens were purchased from the genesis block. The contract is in the "too big to fail" territory and presents an existential risk for the network.
Its not like the funds have just been spent already either. They are isolated and trapped in a child DAO for a month and cannot be spent. So unlike many hacks, it is very possible to do something with those funds - which is going to make for a lot of external pressure.

They would disallow fiat transfers to and from any exchanges.
China in particular could probably take things a step further and block traffic on the bitcoin network.
It doesn't prevent the network from working of course, it just makes it difficult and impractical for normal people to use.

If Segwit were at 80%, those 16% of miners that were running BU signalling would be getting a lot more attention (either bribes or attacks, or both). I'm not sure we can draw conclusions that those people will never change their signaling.
On the other hand, signalling for Segwit is dropping while BU is reaching all time highs. We may have already seen the peak of Segwit support.

Yes it is working as designed, but this is the first time in history where we have seen a situation that could temporarily sway 50% of the hashpower off the Bitcoin network for meaningful periods of time. It is very disruptive. Its not going to kill it or anything, but it will degrade its usefulness.
I think the bigger question is if the situation will eventually turn into a losing one for BCH miners.

@_date: 2017-01-30 17:42:42
In such a situation, would it be possible for a new version of Segwit to be rolled out that would more quickly adjust the difficulty? It seems like this might be a key factor in whether the Segwit fork survives or is abandoned. If the difficulty stays in place after the fork with 25% miner hashpower, profitability of the Segwit miners would plummet. They are not likely to keep that hashpower since it would mean mining at a loss for 2 months and many would switch over to the more profitable fork.
On the other side, does the BU code include a more rapid changing of the difficulty? Because a 50-50 type scenario would also require miners on that fork to mine at a loss for a significant amount of time.
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:57:49
They are interested in capital control. They do not want people using Bitcoin to move huge amounts of capital out of (or into) the country without them knowing about it and being able to approve/disapprove it. This is central to their planned economy.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:45:43
Segwit wouldn't, but sidechains can potentially be created in very centralized ways that give thier operators a lot of control. It's a big reason why people want to push scaling on the primary chain even though that has its own set of challenges.

@_date: 2017-08-25 01:09:22
Well, the difficulty adjusts fast enough to correct and the bigger blocks allow them to process a lot of transactions even when the hashrate is on the low side. Its hardly ideal, but not going to kill the network either. On the other hand, it disrupts their biggest competitor (Bitcoin of course) which is easy to disrupt if it is running near full capacity.

Couldn't BCH traders take advantage of this now that the pattern is fairly well established. Eventually the price should somewhat stabilize, but if the inflation rate of BCH is accelerated, that price will probably be lower than it otherwise would. But that may be offset if the BTC network is being damaged to the point where people just start using BCH instead.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:42:28
They've done this type of thing before. Anyone can create an alternative system, but that doesn't mean much if they cannot get most of the rest of the world on board too.

I mean, SWIFT has obvious issues, but for most people it is still the best system until blockchains can work at scale.

Even if they want to support the BCH network, it makes sense to try to get the difficulty to drop.
I predict we are going to see a lot of shenanigans with the mining hashrate over the next couple months before things get equalized. There are people that control enough hashrate to "make things interesting". IE. collect BCH as people are dumping it, shift over a ton of miners to BCH to cause a pump, sell BCH into the pump... while shorting and then covering BTC at the same time. Then reverse everything as they shift all their miners back over to BTC.
I think we're going to get some renewed lessons on why having large portions of centrally controlled hashpower is bad.
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:17:17
Courts tend to rule more often in the "spirit" of the law, rather than the technicalities. I doubt they would rule in favor of the hacker in this case.
Your last point is interesting though. Having a court propose a hardfork and then having to persuade miners to run it in order to carry out a decision would, as you say, be unprecedented. As we move more into contracts on the blockchain, I'm sure there will be a *ton* of legal situations come up about what is legally binding, and how to carry out dispute resolutions. Its going to take a long time to work out all these details - even without the hack (and potentially subsequent ones), I think The DAO was way ahead of its time and had no idea how to pursue running a business through smart contracts.

Yup, Litecoin traffic is up significantly these days, but still only around 10% of what Bitcoin's traffic is. Ethereum has really absorbed the lion's share of transaction growth over the last year or so.

Maybe you need to do more than 5 seconds of research. And I mean that in an honest, and non-snarky way.
Who runs the contracts on the RSK platform? This is requires general computation type related resources like CPU and Memory as well as decent bandwidth requirements. This is not the kind of setup that Bitcoin miners have, and it is not something they can do for free without negatively impacting their normal mining performance.
How do you run a node on the RSK platform? Can anyone just download the open source software and run it? The answer to this is no, you have to have permission from RSK.
Those questions should be relatively basic and easy to answer. But for some reason though, its hard to get detailed information.
RSK does a great job marketing this platform to Bitcoin supporters, but they tend to leave out details that I think most of those Bitcoin supporters would disapprove of.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:28:43
I don't think Bitcoin Cash will be too negatively impacted by this given it already has a relatively low floor and only stands to gain by disrupting the Bitcoin network.
This will be tough to swallow, but I think Bitcoin will have to do its own fork to change its difficulty adjustment algorithm in order to better "compete" with BCH and future forks. I believe this would have to be a hard fork? I'm not sure.
Honestly, I don't think many people saw this kind of competition being effective. I think there is a good chance it will change the nature of blockchains going forward. If any network can be forked with a more competitive adjustment algorithm, it pretty much makes sense to do so (from an attackers point of view).

A) Ironically, Trump is very unlikely to get massive stimulus bills passed through Republican controlled senate/congress.
B) Given the fact that the US Dollar continues to gain against most foreign currencies, the financial implications of these bonds changing hands isn't likely to really make much difference. Currency gains are offsetting the drop in bond prices due to rising rates.
C) None of this is really "disturbing" in a the sky is falling type of way like the article implies. China honestly had way too much in reserves, they are using this as an opportunity to liquidate without crashing the market. I would argue that this probably is about the best case scenario for them to unwind these positions as its not something they wanted to have long term anyway.

This is what the game theory of the Bitcoin network is designed to do. Incentivize people to act in their own best interest.
This isn't a problem with the miners. This isn't a problem with the game theory. This isn't a problem with either scaling protocol upgrade. This is a problem with the code, and now that we know the problem it can be fixed. We should stop politicizing this and just get it fixed asap - it should not be connected to any of the other protocol upgrades.
Once the flaw is corrected, the politics will probably play out a bit differently, and hopefully in a more straight forward manner that allows us to more clearly move towards a consensus.

"money" is such a loaded term that everyone has a different meaning for - kind of silly to argue over that definition.
BAT is what it is. It has a use. It has value. It definitely isn't Bitcoin and isn't mean to compete with it.
For the record: I don't own BAT. I think it's overvalued and would never recommend people buy it as an investment. It is a utility coin for ads. You should only buy it if you want to spend it to show ads in the Brave browser (which btw is a pretty good product).

Ether has value if making transactions and contract executions are useful on the Ethereum blockchain. The whole idea that this is a zero sum game is a bit silly IMO. Side chains and blockchains that support smart contracts open up a massive number of opportunities that can tie these networks together so that they all build off eachother. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 23:23:38


This is probably more accurate.
@_date: 2016-02-11 07:05:50
So, by like end of 2017, we'll have some consensus around those things for the Bitcoin network? I'm teasing, but I think the time to market is a very valid point. Bitcoin is dominant primarily because it was the first coin. If Ethereum is beating it to market with smart contracts, dynamic block sizes, fast consensus times and a whole host of other features, then it certainly deserves some consideration. We shouldn't dismiss competitors simply because they are new.
And I fully agree with you that if Ethereum is even remotely successful, they will have similar governance issues that Bitcoin has. Decentralized governance is going to be hard.
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:09:24
Many people are trying to make this issue political. Its not really, its just a bug in the code that needs to be fixed. Once the flaw is fixed, the politics will change. We will no longer have miners supporting or opposing various solutions based on how it will affect their profits (this goes both ways!). Hopefully this will lead to a much more straight forward political debate that will allow us to reach a consensus faster on how to upgrade the protocol.
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:23:59

Bitcoin is also a closed loop token. You can call it a collectible or whatever you want. The network needs something (POW) and it rewards a token for it. You place value on the Bitcoin network, maybe other people don't - but the market eventually figures out what a fair price is.
Same thing for BAT, with obviously different mechanics and people will have a different way of valuing it. Having a closed loop ecosystem means you can set the incentives for it tailored for that ecosystem. In the case of BAT, you can set it up as an advertising network. The needs for that are going to be different than what you would want for say "a sound, hard money network".
@_date: 2017-04-23 01:42:17
A big part of that though was a loss of faith in the ecosystem. If it turns out that there was $600m in fraud going on through Bitfinex, we might see a repeat, but that doesn't seem like a likely scenario.

I think it depends on the nature of the crash. If it is a financial crisis ala 2008, then Bitcoin would benefit immensely. If it's more of the cyclical capitalism recession where money rotates out of securities, then I think it's less clear and Bitcoin could go down. Fiat interest rates are usually higher in this situation and people don't mind parking cash in low risk markets with a garunteed return.

It was at least better than Mt. Gox, and better than what I initially expected.

How exactly do you "exchange some bitcoin for PayPal"? Like what service do you use?
It doesn't surprise me that they would try to limit these kinds of interactions. Paypal tries to allow for chargebacks and dispute resolution of payments.

My proof would be that is how the BFX tokens I got worked, lol.
It was indeed highly suspicious and there was very little transparency in how it was handled. We do not even know for instance how many BFX tokens they really created, how many were converted to equity, etc. The entire operation could have been handled on a blockchain somewhere with complete transparency, but they chose not to take that route.

The problem is not any one group. Its that there is not a clear majority consensus by any group - devs, miners, exchanges, on any upgrade path. Let alone 95% consensus - which is crazy talk.
We are essentially trying to achieve consensus on social media which is just silly and impossible. Now, a hard fork would probably force the market to achieve consensus very quickly, but for various reasons, that is a method of last resort.
But think about say a US presidential election like we just had. If we asked everyone to "signal" before hand who the next president should be and try to achieve 95% consensus before swearing them in, we would never have gotten anywhere. Many people didn't really like either candidate and probably would have even chosen the status quo if that was an option!
I know this is a very unpopular opinion, but a hard fork is the fast way to move forward. The price for being wrong in such a case is high, so there are a lot of risks, but there are ways to mitigate those. I believe that as a community, we need to prepare better and be able to navigate a fork. The market can make these choices far far better than trying to achieve consensus on social media.

You are wrong because Bitcoin is designed specifically to defend itself against things like "oligarchs useing their outsized influence" against the network.  Thats not what this is. In this case, the protocol itself is flawed to incentivize bad behavior by vested actors on the network. That is bad, but its not the end of the world, we just need to fix the incentives to not give rewards to people using shortcuts to mine empty blocks.
You don't have to like what Jihan has done, but he is just playing by the rules that we created. He found a loop hole that we need to fix. This isn't the first time someone found a flaw in the Bitcoin code, and it certainly will not be the last time.

@_date: 2016-09-26 16:22:43
Yes. However I think there is a basic tradeoff we are looking at here with respect to how decentralized the network is, and how far it can scale. We do not need to be able to run every node on a raspberry pi in order to be "decentralized enough" either.
It is my understanding that the long term goal with proof of stake and sharding is to allow a variety of hardware configurations to operate as nodes on the network. 
I think it is a fair question to float though - how many different parties do we need to be involved in the network in order for it to be decentralized enough to operate securely? IMO, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have too few at the moment at under 10k nodes. And each network is more likely to see a reduced number of nodes moving forward until scaling issues start to get resolved.

The DAO is really the top failure of all time? I mean, the hype surrounding the DAO was astronomical and it failed to live up to any of that, and it also bruised quite a few reputations throughout the Ethereum community. However, the Ethereum price is right around where it was when the DAO launched and all the coins were returned on the ETH chain (and most were even returned on the ETC chain). 
Seems like some serious recency bias going on there.

The attacks were actually timed to coincide with other events. They started right when the dev conference kicked off last week. They actually had stopped for a while, but then kicked off again yesterday right as an ICO was taking place on the network. I think it is pretty safe to say that the attacks very much meant to inflict harm on the ecosystem.

Depends on what you define as "serious" :)
An organization launched a $5.5m ICO on the network yesterday while it was under attack and met their target funding numbers within the first minute of the start of the sale. Thats fairly serious to me, but obviously pales in comparison to a lot of financial scenarios.
The network was obviously not ready to handle the likes of The DAO though, and will take some time to handle more complex and higher value contracts.

@_date: 2016-09-26 14:44:13
From a technology and economic point of view, I find these events interesting.
Yes, the attack surface of the Ethereum network is larger than that of Bitcoin. It has more features and is adding more code at a higher rate of change that puts it at some risk. Its basically a necessity for the network to go through this process as there is a lot of work left in order for it to get where it needs to be. In its current state, the network has limited value and would not be able to fulfill its potential. They are still looking at many updates to the protocol including PoS and Sharding. Its a high risk scenario.
At the same time, the economics play a part in determing what kind of attacks the network will be facing. If the network was worth $100k USD, we wouldn't be seeing an attack on it that costs $5k+ per day to maintain. As the value of the network grows, so does the potential resources of an attacker because the payoffs are bigger. A Billion dollar value network brings more sophisticated attacks. These are attacks that the network absolutely has to be able to withstand in order to succeed. Its the "if it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger scenario"... if hackers can't kill a Billion dollar Ethereum network, then it is probably worth more than that. But there is only one way to find out if that is true.
@_date: 2016-09-26 14:52:26


Those hardly classify as "server-class" hardware. My two desktops and two laptops can easily handle that kind of requirement.
Of course, it is a higher requirement than Bitcoin nodes. But its interesting that despite all the problems with Ethereum nodes this week, there are still more of them running than there are Bitcoin nodes (5k vs. 7k)

This has been happening for a few months now. It gives some perspective as to the Chinese currency valuation though. Their currency value is declining *despite* the fact that they are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to prop it up. Many people were accusing China of manipulating their own currency downward, but it appears that was mainly market forces and they are actually making a big effort to keep it from falling further.
I think all the speculation about how this impacts the US Fed is a bit overblown though. Selling treasuries should result in a weaker dollar, which generally helps the US economy by allowing exports to be more competitive. It might result in some inflation, but the Fed would probably welcome that after years of not getting any despite all the QE. At this point they would love an excuse to bump up interest rates a bit since it gives them more leverage in the future.
Also, I don't see this having much of an impact on Bitcoin. Zerohedge likes to blow these types of things way out of  proportion.
@_date: 2016-10-30 19:38:43


I think that really is the problem though. 
1. We do not know how to scale a system that maintains those properties.
2. Most proposed second layer systems do not adhere to those properties so that they can scale better.
3. Second layer systems do not benefit very well from the existing network effects that Bitcoin has established, so they are hard to get off the ground.

You are right, an important distinction. It is the compiler that would need to be changed.
Solidity could get an update, but it wouldn't be supported by the network unless their was a compiler update.
@_date: 2016-10-05 21:53:44
This is not a new problem though. We have computer code running most of the world's entire information systems and most of it is far more vulnerable to these types of attacks. The difference is that much of that code is hidden whereas code on the Ethereum network is visible. This seems very scary of course, but open source, always on networks have proven very effective in the past at creating systems that end up being highly resistant to attacks. 
Bitcoin is probably the best example of this. The vast majority of people never thought that Bitcoin would work when it first came out - putting everyone's money on a network that everyone can access??? Complete madness.. all it takes is one hacker to come by and find a vulnerability and steal everything.
The DoS attacks that Ethereum is experiencing now... that is what it takes to play in this game, Bitcoin has endured those for years and come out stronger because of them. Ethereum will have to go through that same kind of hardening process, and of course, there is risk involved in that process. It doesn't happen over night, it takes years of work to prove out a network such as this. Its very fair to say that Ethereum still has a *lot* to prove. Its probably fair to say that the tokens are overvalued and that may warrant a short. However, I also think these challenges can be overcome in the long run.

The article touches on this, but I agree in that the applications are what will drive adoption more and more. Users can use a CC to make a payment via a service like Circle. The application then provides a service and keeps the Bitcoin.

I read at one point that they were going to take 20% of all the network fees (this was in an interview that RSK gave). But I have heard since then that this is no longer the case and I can't see any recent information to this effect.
There seems to be a number of details missing about who exactly is collecting fees on the network and how that is decided. As we know, incentives are important in the future behavior of the network and it is important that they are transparent and fair.

The DAO is securing $140m worth of crypto. If I am a member there, I absolutely want that on the secure primary blockchain, not some side chain.
The (presumed) goal of the DAO is to build IoT backbone infrastructure. That also needs a high level of security, and ideally would be secured on the main blockchain.
Scalability is obviously a big issue in order for these things to succeed. Its a bit of a chicken and egg problem though - if no one is able to build a blockchain that needs to scale, then the effort likely will not be made to make it scale.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:08:46
Its definitely steep. I suspect they are trying to do some price framing here so they can reduce the fees later and hope it looks like a better deal.
I could see in a more mature and stable market, the fees would be minimal for something like this, but it may take a while to get there.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:41:50
You give your Bitcoin to this company - RSK labs. They give you a token in exchange. Then you can use those tokens to run contracts, and pay RSK labs the fees.
Oh yeah, there may be other fees that go to a select group of other companies to get through the federated gateways on and off the sidechain too.

Seriously. I know that maximilists view this with some trepidation, but IMO this is necessary in order to compete with fiat. Finance needs a way to hedge large positions. Formerly, the only way to hedge a Bitcoin position was with Fiat. It is now becoming more possible to do that with ETH since it largely trades in opposition to Bitcoin. The amount of volume on the ETH/BTC trading pair is crazy and growing at a ridiculous rate. IMO that is a very positive thing for crypto in general including Bitcoin.

If you look at it from a different point of view... 
Bitcoin wants to be a store of value. Ethereum wants to do smart contracts. Although there are obviously a lot of similarities, they are not trying to do the same thing, and their goals require different types of networks. So many people think of this as a zero sum game where everyone is always competing and there can be only one winner.
Ethereum is simply not trying to be the same kind of "store of value" network that Bitcoin is. We have that already - why do the same thing again? People seem to have in their minds that the blockchain should be used for "X". In reality, it has many uses, and different networks will be able to support use cases in varying ways. Lets push the entire industry forward, there is room for more than one blockchain.

It was intended to be an investment vehicle focused on funding Ethereum startup companies. Peak value was around $250m. Someone discovered a vulnerability in the contract that managed the funds and drained about a third of the Ether to a child DAO. Chaos ensued as the vulnerability became public and all the Ether was removed (most by a "whitehat" group to try to protect the remaining funds) . Proceed until yesterday when they implemented a hard fork to put all the original DAO funds into a withdraw contract that allowed all the token holders to retrieve their original funds.
It was like Ethereum's version of Mt.Gox, but instead of losing all the money and going through years of lawsuits, they hardforked the blockchain to just give everyone their Ether back and sacrificed some ideals in the process.

If the network is only for investors, then it is a ponzi scheme. It has to have utility beyond that in order for there to be long term value. It has some value now, but it could potentially have a lot more value if it can be scaled up.

Any way to the estimate how many transactions are going through AB?

Last big run we went from 7k to 19k in 3-4 weeks.

Just because the node is pruned doesn't mean its not fully validated.

I'd already read the stack exchange stuff. I guess I do not understand why people think this is an issue.
Ethereum processes a lot of data due to its nature. That's what makes it interesting :)
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:22:11
My pruned chain is like 15GB right now, so even though the amount of data passing through the network is higher, it's not really a big deal unless you have really slow internet speeds.

Problem is basically all the major exchanges struggle through the busy days. Scaling up to that level of demand is not a trivial process and each time they improve their system, the bar gets raised to a higher level as a bunch more people pile in.

Fair enough. I don't presume to be able to attach a fair value to any of these networks. If you think that the marketcap situation will flip for a while though, it seems like you mistimed your trade.

That would be the smart thing to do. They both have roles to play and are good hedges against each other. You just don't get many up votes that way ��
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:14:57
Is this a bad thing?
Seems like this is the best way to allow for innovation to push ahead at full steam. One of those networks will end up working the best, and the world will be a better place for it. Don't fear the fork.

Inverse correlation would be bad though - stock market goes up 7% on average every year... you don't want the inverse of that!
Non-correlated is much better.

Well, we never needed those did we?

Actually, I kind of think I would find that valuable. The community still ultimately decides the value of the forked chain. If a government body creates a fork to meet a regulatory guideline, then we would all get to vote on whether we want to follow that guideline. Regional issues aside, I think it is highly likely that the government finds it has a lot less support for this type of thing than it thinks it does. It would not take many high profile fork failures for government to completely rethink how they approach financial regulation.

If you say so. I mean, there are over 30k Ethereum nodes online right now and one of them runs on my PC which doesn't have a meaningful impact on me.
I have no problem with the approach Bitcoin is taking too. Its great to have a system that can run on Raspberry Pis. Its optimized for basic payment transactions, which is the biggest use case. Makes sense to have specialized systems.
And of course we have hundreds of Bitcoin clones, so we have that use case pretty well covered. Ethereum does something different. It makes different engineering trade offs so it can meet different use cases. There are a lot of use cases we need for blockchain to solve, one network isn't going to make sense. And we'll eventually need many more than just Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Theory: Institutions are scrambling to get in ahead of the traditional brokerage's launch (Fidelity, Ameritrade, Etrade) so they can dump on the next wave of retail investors to enter the space.

I think it's likely that there will by many blockchains to help fill niches, but due to the nature of network effects, it seems pretty likely that there will be one dominant token used as a currency (SoV, MoE, UoA) - and most of the value will accrue to that chain. You can have a ton of utility blockchains that provide lots of services, but also don't have significant valuations.
I think it is worth noting that in this scenario of one dominant chain, that this is primarily a social construct. People will believe it has value because other people believe it has value. People will use it as a unit of account, because it is what everyone else is already familiar with and understands. There are obviously technical qualities for these networks, and we spend a lot of time debating them, but at the end of the day Bitcoin is open source code, anyone can fork it and the state of the ledger at any time. The real value comes from the social construct we build. In this respect, I think this is primarily a two horse race at this point between Bitcoin and Ethereum - I don't see any other existing networks that I think can really challenge right now. It's so early though, and obviously a lot can happen.

Now there are 5 :) Wings is still only about a third of the value of The DAO at its peak.

On chain transactions are IMO the best metric and I agree that the network effect is the most important thing to measure. You discount those on Ethereum because they involved token transactions too, but I disagree with this because the token transactions still capture the network effect that is happening.
Bitcoin still has an advantage in this area, but Ethereum is catching up quite fast. Its also not a directly comparable metric because of the technical details of the networks. Bitcoin can have larger transactions involving multiple inputs/outputs, while Ethereum can have transactions that involve running contracts that are more complex than a simple transaction. 
On the whole though, I think it is a metric where you can look at the trends and draw some conclusions about how the network effects are shaping up.

It could become the new currency of the world because it does things better than gold/fiat. That does not mean it will - there are a lot more factors at play. Like the fact that pretty much all the most powerful people in the world would stand to lose from a Bitcoin standard currency.
You have to realize that Krugman is essentially a politician specializing in economics. His views are going to be skewed greatly by his politics, and his politics are telling him that Bitcoin will never be allowed to become the standard currency - its merits are not really a big consideration for him.

First of all, let me say that I love your naivete. Sincerely.
The cynic in me though says that whenever the non-abused are in the majority and "in power", an abuser takes power and by definition, that immediately changes since all those innocents are now "abused". 
Take 1000 people, all it takes is one asshole. And that asshole always exists.

To play devil's advocate here. 
So we are using money to resolve disputes? Whoever has the most money is right, everyone else is wrong. Some variation of that kind of system is certainly in affect for most capitalist driven economies, but is that really what we should be shooting for?

Here is where the fundamental disconnect is. Bitcoin is not designed to provide a tool for a government to manage the economy. While the government can potentially do positive things for citizens of a country, they are typically not positive for the holders of the currency that is being used as a tool to manipulate the economy.
Bitcoin is not good for central governments. It is good for holders/users of the currency. If you want to argue which is more beneficial to society as a whole, that is where the huge controversy lies.
