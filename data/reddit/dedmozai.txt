CBOE Saw Its Highest-Ever Bitcoin Futures Volumes Yesterday Available market data shows that CBOE saw its highest-ever volume for bitcoin futures since it first debuted the contracts back in December. 18,210 contacts for the May futures were traded, along with 703 for the June contract and 87 for the July contract. No volume was reported for the exchange's August-dated contract.
CBOE Options Institute senior instructor Kevin Davitt, in a social media video posted on Thursday, said that "[the] average daily volume (ADV) runs about 6,600 in XBT Bitcoin Futures. Yesterday's volume was nearly three times ADV."
He went on to explain: "Yesterday was the highest daily volume for bitcoin futures since their introduction here at CBOE nearly five months ago. The lead month May futures traded 18,210 contracts, and across the term structure a total of 19,000 bitcoin futures traded here yesterday. The previous high-volume session was January 17 with just less than 15,500 contracts traded."
