What do you mean? I'm sure it's easier for big companies to get verified vs normal people.

I cannot believe this shit is sitting at  in the front page of this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:16:29
Not saying it is.

You're the one that needs to check it.

Holy crap it's you again. I had an argument with you with another account about this exact same issue of putting so much attention to accounts age. Seems like you haven't changed. Oh and I'm going to block you (again) so I won't see your retarded answer to this so don't even bother.

You can't be serious. That graph is obviously glitched... It doesn't look like that to me. And it doesn't take much to realize that sharp drop is impossible.

And yet there was people the other day saying HBO would move the price a lot with their $250,000 purchase.

Some keyword(s) triggered the filter. And no, the timestamp doesn't update, and that's actually one of the reasons I hate this auto remove crap, it buries your comment.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:16:48
You don't get any notification that your comments are *automodded*. Did you manually check every single comment?
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:46:12
Your post was automatically removed by the AutoMod and put in queue for a moderator do manually review it. The moderator chose to accept your comment.
The bot did nothing wrong.

Why the fuck is he sweeping the fund on every transaction received? Half the fucking money is being spent on fees, is he retarded or someone else has the private key?
