1. How are people gonna provide proof that a business is "brown" before adding them to the list?
2. If we fork and continue to use the regular network the other network (with coinvalidation) will get momentum IF they get support from the government. This will lead to policies for companies that want to use bitcoins. Means that they have to use the brown network or get fined for using the forked one.
3. If point 2 happens the forked network will be almost completly isolated. We will land there where we started: Bitcoins not beeing accepted anywhere and a value of 1 BTC=1~5 USD.
4. Again if point 2 and 3 happens the government will use coinvalidation as means to tax people and block people's money who dont want to get taxed. If you dont want to lose your bitcoins create a wallet, validate it and transfer your bitcoins to it. After that pay taxes.
THAT will be the main argument and goal of coinvalidation! To make bitcoin users pay taxes. And THAT is a good thing!
PROBLEM is that this has potential to monetize on bitcoins by enforcing fees, licences, policies and so on... Or just outright controlling the currency just like the USD.
What im trying to say: forking and brownlisting coinvalidation wont solve this problem.

I think I kinda miswrote my post. What I mean is that my buying and selling is gonna get myself so little with my current capital thats its not worth it. Dont get me wrong I believe in bitcoin and it to succeed! But no way in hell im gonna use it as a currency while its juming up and down like that.

Yes they wont be able to control it but they also dont need to if only they get the majority of bitcoin users on their system. Then they can tax them, control the transfer fees and so on.
Its the same problem with the copyright and net neutrality. Of course there always be some people defying the system but the most wont care. 
Be it NSA, TransatlanticPartnership or years of prison for downloading one song. Our goal should be preventing them from taking control not just say: Fuck this! Im using another service! And if they get it to im moving to another one.
At some point you run out of redlistfree services and what then?

Russia had a really bad experience with a pyramid/ponzi scheme in the past with almost everyone in the country involved. Cant blame them.

Good thought. Maybe I got greedy. Maybe I got scared. I dont know. I will definitely buy some again once the price drops or I get some more money I can afford to lose.

Im aware of the fact thats its gonna rise but im bailing out anyway. It was fun the past week researching and learning and so on but I dont believe that the return I will get from my max. 100€ investment is worth my time and nerves.

Dont sweat it! I only just joined 3 days ago on the bitcoin train. But in the case something unforeseen happens to it I already bought some litecoins. They seem like the next successor to bitcoin and would skyrocket if bitcoin falls. If not then I didnt lost much.

Yeah maybe... but did you read the recent news of coin validation and the coin redlist?
If dollar is gonna crash do you believe the government will just sit by and do nothing? There is a big chance that atleast the USGOV is already working towards the aquiring of Bitcoin and making sure that they will have control over by redlisting and greenlisting certain coins.
By that they will have control over it just like over the dollar. And when they have it they can manipulate the price like they want.
Atleast thats the picture on the horizon. I have NO idea whats the propability of that scenario is.

Just read the thread about using altcoins to bypass tainting your bitcoins and keeping them clean. I believe this can be a good solution! Lets just hope that other altcoins wont get valifucked, too.

Yes but if you divide BTC in red and green and let only the green run through YOUR systems then you are in CONTROL and thus BTC gets centralised. Thats the threat. And if your suspicions are right and the dollars crashes this might be the scenario.
