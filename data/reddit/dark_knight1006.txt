From what I have heard, read and researched about the lightning Network, it was all about reducing the transaction times the transaction fees and increasing the privacy. What this guy is saying right here is that the lightning network will take our Bitcoin , convert it into IOU's and that will be the end of it. We can take our bitcoin back but it will be worthless because no one will accept it since it can only be used as IOU's. Which sounds stupid to me. It wont be worthless. If I traveled to Japan from USA and carried 10k USD with me, I would get it exchanged to Yen and buy/transact using Yen. That doesn't mean my USD is worthless just because Japan uses Yen as their currency. And I think it is the same with BTC. You can keep your BTC, but when you transact, you send it as IOU's. You are still getting the worth of your BTC. I am only talking in a business perspective. Someone can weigh in with their thoughts on the other aspects also.

I am in the same boat. A friend told me to buy $10 worth of BTC when it was just launched. I was like "man I am not wasting 1 buck on anything like that". And I still beat myself over it.

So darn tired of these articles. Its like Fiat doesnt take any resources to print or electronic payment methods don't use any resources at all (plastic, personnel, buikdings, computers, servers, electricity etc)

Short term rate (&lt;1y) will be whatever your income tax rate is. Long term rate (&gt;1y) is 15%. Add to it whatever your state income tax is.
I am totally with you on the tax going towards illegals and lazy. But at the same time, it sucks to get hit by the IRS because then they want what you owe+the interest+the penalty.

Not sure if this is a joke or reality.

+1. It has gone from $7XXX last week to $11XXX just now. Its fuckn scary. The correction will come, hopefully its not too bad and blows up in our face.

Yeah rub more salt on my wounds. Lol. I was getting my masters degree at that time while working part time. So every dollar saved was helpful. Well.. maybe I should have "not saved" just $10. Oh well.

Yes sir! I actually realized all this when BTC crashed to $1800 a few months ago. And recently after my 2 purchases, it went up to $7800 and dipped to $5600ish after the BCH crap. I bought in a little more. So yes, I am HODLing !

You can possibly sell someone your BTC and have them give you cash or transfer money to your bank account? Lets say you are in LA, it should be easy enough to find someone local there that you can sell BTC too and they can give you cash or load it all up on a prepaid debit card for you?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:43:23
HODLing here too. I dont think BTC is going anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:51:22
I kicked myself twice. Once for not investing $10 in 2010 when a friend told me to. And then earlier this year for not buying it at $1800 . I ended up buying some when it was at $4k and then at the last dip. Plan on HODLing and if it rises up and up I can gradually start helping people in need. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:58:33
Depends on how you look at either. I invested in both and BTC has been given a much better ROI- to the point where I am regretting not investing $10 in BTC in 2010.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:51:36
I am pretty sure it is treated as capital gains after you cash out. Lets say you bought 1 BTC at $100 and now its at $7000. If you haven't cashed out, then you still have 1BTC and nothing in $$. But as soon as you cash out, you will be paying taxes on it. I have been reading on it and the best advise I saw was to not cash out before you have held the investment for an year. Because at the stroke of 1y, the taxation rate is 15%. 
P.S this only applies to the USA. Not sure how taxation works in other nations for captial gains/investments.

As much as I have wanted to trade for profit myself, I have learnt to HODL- if you have all the time in the day to keep trading, do it by all means. But in my case, I can't take out the time to do it. The logic that I learnt was- lets say I bought 1BTC when it was $1000 . Right now it is $2000 so I sell half of it to get my $1000. So now technically I only own 0.5 BTC. Now I can't say that it will keep rising exponentially but it has been doing pretty decent looking at the history. So at the end it will cost mw even more to replace what I sold. So if you can HODL, then that is the best way.

Lmao. We tried hockey too and got fu*ked. Can't wait for baseball season to start again. It was so damn easy.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:09:55
Yes. That is what I gathered from all my reading on it.Short term is taxed the ordinary rate which is your income tax bracket but long term it goes into a max 15% rate.
 Here is the official IRS page on investments/capital gains
Now I might be wrong on this so all and any corrections are more than welcome.
