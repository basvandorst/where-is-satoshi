But what online bank account? This is all confusing the hell out of me (clueless 18 yr old.)

Do you know what happens if they do shut me down? How do I get my money back? Also, what would you regard as large? I only need a few hundred $.

I asked him if I can use the banks transfer features, and what on. And he said no dealing in bitcoin, I think he just means nothing to do with it at all. Which is bullshit to me, I don't think that's within their control to that extent, is it?

Well I meant regarding purchasing them, not selling things like they mentioned. You'll let me cook tacos, I don't think it's really fair if you tell me I can't use Gouda cheese just because.

On the real though, how the fuck did me thanking someone for their time in the military get down voted??
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:48:54
So I fucked up? 
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:02:37
I guess so :/

Oh, and thank you for your service :)

*(I would open the other bank first) *(talk to the other bank first)? Sorry this all just has me pretty pissed off, I just opened the account today.

The only banks I have in my area are Wells Fargo, First Interstate, and bank of Jackson hole (local obviously). Is it easy to open an account online with CU? I chose WF because I'm only 17 and they still let me open a checking account.

But if not then I need checking account, correct?
