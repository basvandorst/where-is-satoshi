If I invest in Doge I can never lose money as one Doge always equals one Doge.
@_date: 2018-05-27 04:49:39
So you know his private key.

It's only volatile because it's still a niche. When crypto is adopted it will stabilize. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 06:39:52
So was the argument that you shouldn't buy Bitcoin because it's volatile.
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:33:06
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:48:47
Money is a fair bit more popular though.
@_date: 2018-10-10 03:21:12
@_date: 2018-10-20 05:52:01
That's what they bought at.

This isn't capitalism, it's government.

I'll spend my BTC when fiat doesn't exist anymore.
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:20:36
I hope you're joking.
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:19:26
1 Doge = 1 Doge*
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:24:41
OpenStreetMap anybody?
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:20:37
I'm sorry if I misunderstood but you have no problem with the government robbing someone because they are unable to pay tribute to their rulers.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:01:06
It's nuts but once a week you can withdraw smaller amounts 
@_date: 2018-03-17 04:07:51
Murder isn't murder because I wouldn't have been murdered if I was somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:58:10
You make a great point. Why do we need criminal law?
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:46:03
I don't. My alts tanked worse than my Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:06:40
The post directly above directly contests your point. And this link should show how amazing Medicare is. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 07:00:29
Do we really need prisons?
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:47:36
You know , like your house and children.
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:38:36
Does this mean 1 Doge != 1 Doge anymore. Blasphemy!
@_date: 2018-03-02 03:48:38
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:54:20
But has anybody really been changed by a punishment. Punishments just don't stop people from commiting more crimes.
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:27:48
He didn't pay for the electricity though.
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:42:44
Taxation is theft.
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:25:12
You'd best go over to r/cryptocurrency for that. Nobody in there right mind would mine Bitcoin with a gpu.
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:19:11
Behind on your taxes; the IRS steals your house and everything you have. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:57:26
RedditCoin perhaps?
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:35:29

@_date: 2018-02-23 08:28:48

Step 2) Sell it for Monero and tell the irs you never had it when you're a millionaire in 10 years.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:17:28

@_date: 2018-03-02 13:01:21
But how am I going to stock up on shitcoins with Bitstamp.
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:23:38
However; my money goes to things like welfare that incentives laziness and bombing civilians in the Middle-East.
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:57:13
Do you really think that's all the btc he had.
@_date: 2018-04-22 03:31:57

@_date: 2018-02-27 09:01:56
It being comparable to an Xbox One only demonstrates his points.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:07:23
It involved a furious attack on his monitor after opening coinmarketcap a couple months ago.
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:16:45
