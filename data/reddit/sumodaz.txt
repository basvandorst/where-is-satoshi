We don't really expect to see many payments in Bitcoin. My disappointment at the lack of adoption of Bitcoin in the UK is one of the reasons for adopting the currency on our site. 
The thinking behind it is that we lead by example, it's more about supporting Bitcoin than boosting our sales.

We cover a lot of towns and villages (especially in the North of England) unfortunately not so many cities at the moment. We are hoping to get some investment soon to help us expand across the country super fast.

Thanks for the support. It really is about supporting local traders. You'd be surprised how much cheaper it can be to shop locally though.. its a real myth (conspiracy: spread by supermarkets?) that its more expensive. This is a price comparison we did last year in our local area;  We are hoping to add some kind of price comparison to the site at some point but first the plan is to keep expanding to cover the rest of the UK.

With the great response we have had - maybe?

Are you using Firefox? we just had a 'I can't believe we didn't notice that' moment when we came to check all browsers (after your message) and it has stopped working in Firefox. :-/

Thanks for pointing out that problem, works now.

Ha, yeah we were just about to upload the new look site when we noticed a big increase in traffic coming from Reddit. Anyway - we are holding off until things quieten down later tonight as we don't want any downtime whilst the site is so popular.
edit: grammar

As owner of the site and fellow Redditor, i'm really happy to see you picked on on this, thanks it's really great to see some support. The site is getting a much needed face lift later on today, just maybe, it will be the greatest site in the world afterwards? :) It took a long time to get the idea across to the shops but were getting a few signed up every day now so hopefully we will be in your area soon. Anyway, have a gold for your love!
