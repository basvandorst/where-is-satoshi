Only the people who want to.


Generally, maybe. Some of the worst places I've seen have been private as well.
I see both corporations and government as tools. The tools only work as well as the people using them. There is nothing inherently broken about either because we can change the way either one works. But, if the people want any say in how dark and shady a corporation can be, they need a way to investigate and hold them accountable. Yes, by force, otherwise many things will stay in the dark forever.

Interesting, but how do you plan on getting rid of an entity that is many times more powerful than anything that could challenge it? What I'm saying is you can't do it unless you control it, and believe it or not, there is a way.
Local and state politicians are not as bought off as federal politicians. We still have most of our ability to choose who gets in office on local levels. With simple grassroots organizing, we can defeat any local politician who is against getting money out of politics. When we have two thirds of the states on board, we call for a constitutional convention. Congress has no control over whether or not we can do that.
We propose an amendment for public financing of elections, restricting money given to politicians, and revoke corporate personhood because a large corporation currently has all the rights of a human but none of the responsibility (small ones are oppressed). Now the loudest voice to a politician is a vote, and not money, and we've erected a wall between corporation and state (or big money and state), just like the wall between church and state. Please don't mistake this for me hating the rich.
I'm not saying you're wrong about polycentric law, I'm just a realist and it's obvious that potentially good ideas like that are just too far removed from society's mindset that it isn't going to happen any time soon. What *is* going to happen soon is that states are going to begin calling for this amendment. Indeed, they've already started. There are many groups in favor of it. Personally, I am a part of [Wolf PAC.](
At least check it out. We've got an amendment written up and everything and we are trying damn hard to make money in politics the biggest issue in every local election, because it *is* the biggest issue.

When it comes to politics the money can drown out votes, and it does. Do you think bribery should be legal? Giving person X cash in exchange for favors that have a conflict of interest with person X's line of work is bribery and wouldn't be allowed in any organization that gives the slightest fuck about itself. The government is not the free market, and should have different rules designed to keep corrupting influences as far away as possible, and the current state of the nation is caused by not keeping those influences away.
You should agree, because if you really want to change the way things work in D.C., *first you have to gain control over it*. Right now, whoever has the most cash to throw has the most control over over the policies that affect *all* of us. The banks will continue to bend every rule against us, the private sector war machine will continue to soak up our tax dollars, and our congressmen and presidents will continue to respond to the highest bidder as long it's legal to buy them off.
As for your question


Well, first, any law is legal by definition. Maybe you meant to ask how they can constitutionally create a limit. Well, I just skimmed the constitution and I see nothing that implies that you can't limit money given to politicians and regulators. Could you point it out?
Sure, the first amendment says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. But what does that mean? Is money speech? The current supreme court seems to think so. However, if they make a law saying that people can give as much as they want to politicians, isn't that effectively abridging the freedom of speech of poorer people who now have no ability to reach their representatives? Isn't the only fair (and constitutional) option here to restrict donations so that nobody's voice is drowned out (abridged)?

There aren't really any hacks going on. Nobody's bitcoins are at any more risk than normal. There's just an issue with someone attacking new transactions by making minor changes, and the exchanges are losing track of where all their coins are because of it. I guess if an exchange (Gox) can't find all the coins then maybe people will be out of money, but otherwise everyone's safe.

I thought it was how the tax money is used that determines how effective taxation is. A little tax + a lot of corruption isn't *too* bad, whereas a lot of tax + very little corruption can actually be good for the average wealth.

@_date: 2014-04-01 13:52:29
People need to stop thinking they can change the government when they have lost all control of it. Disobedience won't do shit, you'll just get demonized and thrown away. Violence won't do shit because they've got space lasers pointed at the forehead of any internal uprising. The only way I see to gain control of the government is to stop the sale of the politicians to the highest bidder.
There are movements growing right now that are trying to get 2/3 of the states to call for a constitutional convention (bypassing congress) , to pass an amendment that will ban money from influencing our elections. Money has anti-democratic and unconstitutional effects when combined with power.
We've reached a point where our votes no longer count because our candidates have already been chosen by an initial, hidden election where only the biggest sellouts succeed.
I'm quite libertarian myself, but I feel like many are putting their ideology before critical thinking when they say people *should* have the freedom to buy our politicians. Even worse is when you claim that actions should be stopped if they hurt other people while at the same time believing that people should be able to *buy our politicians*. That doesn't hurt anybody? Please.

Because when you keep your coins on Coinbase, they have the private key which means they own and control the coins. When you generate a new address in an offline wallet, it creates a public-private key pair that you now own and control. Whoever has the private key has the coins. You usually never see the private key, but it's there.

That's simply untrue. Price going up is not equal to more volatility. Volatility is related to the market cap. The lower it is, the less money it takes to change the price a lot. There are ways to calculate the volatility over long periods of time and those numbers clearly show volatility is dropping. I'm sorry, I'm not into the math so much so I can't link you to any such number, so I suggest you search for yourself. It's a fact that volatility has been going down as market cap increases.
On this note, did you know that before a company like Facebook or Twitter goes public it experiences fluctuations just like this? This is angel investor type shit that the public is seeing first hand for once in their lives, so obviously people are confused and scared by the volatility because they've never seen anything like it before. Volatility doesn't stop anything from becoming successful and stable.

Selling something that is usually free isn't a scam. It's low, and douchey, but it's not a scam because the guy put in a little work, combined some (yes, free) programs, and sold the product of their work. It's simply not a scam. But this is entirely beside the point, because didn't say selling Ubuntu is a scam, he said the software being sold is compromised and doesn't produce truly random keys, allowing the seller to steal bitcoins. He said that without knowing anything about the software. Whether or not it's true doesn't matter, because he doesn't know, and he lied by acting like he DOES know it's a scam.
It takes a real idiot to need to make up things about someone when you can just criticize them truthfully. It's like when Republicans try to say Obama is bringing Sharia law or trying to take our guns. It's factually false, and it makes them look like fucktards because they're completely missing the real injustices this administration is committing. looks like a fucktard because he couldn't even criticize the Ubuntu seller without making up some stupid bullshit.

No he isn't. **He has many times more claims proven wrong than he has claims that were proven right.** Knowing that trend, it follows that the rest of his claims are most likely false as well.
He makes an absurd amount of claims, and the ones he gets right he brags and brags and brags about. It's easy to forget about everything he was wrong about that he never mentions again. It's a simple psychological bias, but I forget the name of it.
The big thing is this: How am I supposed to be able to use him as a news source if he doesn't have a good history of being right? (Good = 80%-90% of the time) Yeah, he can be right about a lot of things, but the problem is **I can't know if he's right or wrong about ANYTHING until after the proof is out.** The only thing I know is that he is wrong more than he is right. Don't believe me? There are plenty of youtube videos FULL of his failed predictions. It's not that hard to compare his failures to his successes.
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:04:18
You know why he's been right about a lot of things? Because he makes SO MANY FUCKING CLAIMS. Sure he can spout things he's been right about for days, **but he could spout things he's been wrong about until the heat death of the universe.**

Surely it can't be all that matters. We still haven't resolved whether or not the gini index and health of a nation is merely correlation or causation. Maybe it's not that one causes the other. Maybe they are both correlated because they both have a similar cause. I'd argue that it's simply the amount of power that the middle class has over their government. When the middle class rules, the upper class is forced to invest rather than store their cash due to investment incentives. This creates a larger middle class, small lower class, more benefits for that larger middle class, and therefore a healthier country.
I don't think I ever implied that redistributing wealth would make(cause) a healthier country, so you really didn't need to whip out that godly Internet trump card so fast.

Some major companies seem not to be? You mean like damage control? A company would have to be stupid to not accept cash from the NSA in exchange for backdoors. Companies are designed to make money any way they can, and that includes pretending to be a victim.
Sure, there are some actual victims, but I highly doubt Apple is one of them.

Are you familiar with Rockefeller's tactics of taking over the oil industry? He certainly didn't please people, but he still dominated the economy without anyone able to stop him, even after he was hated. I'm sure your free market would work wonderfully if companies didn't keep secrets and the population cared to be informed, but companies do, and the people don't. We elect representatives to watch for things like what Rockefeller did, and to stop it, because we aren't in a utopia where the public has the ability to know everything about every company, and people certainly can't just spend their money somewhere elsewhere when the only options available are just as bad or nonexistent.

Start at the bottom. Get city/state legislatures to support a constitutional convention. Need 2/3 of the states to do so. Then take away their ability to receive massive amounts of money, publicly fund elections, revoke corporate personhood, etc etc. Have massive amounts of debate to fine-tune everything so that we've got another wall between the state and power/money. Only then will I vote for a president.
We're actually getting somewhere with this plan. One group is

Sweden is good. Netherlands is damn impressive. When an informed population has control over their government, the result is quite libertarian. Sure, the government "robs" you of a bunch of money, but many more people have the freedom to pursue what they love because the money they voted to give the government comes right back to them in ways much better than they would have been able to do on their own.

You're right, I'm sorry I ever doubted my Apple overlords. They would never do anything to appease shortsighted shareholders.


That difference doesn't have anything to do with a company's bottom line.
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:24:38
I don't know why you're trying to hold me to hard facts when there are none other than past examples. I have reason to doubt that they are innocent because they are an amoral entity required to please their shareholders in any way feasible. More money equals happy shareholders. It's simply a good business move to sell user security to the government, especially if you believe it will remain a secret. But it didn't, and now every company is acting like they are *sooo* upset about it even though many of them are getting paid for it.
With the way things are going, with all the bribing and corruption and spying etc, it makes sense to look at these revelations as the tip of the iceberg. This is a cleptocracy, where if you don't bribe the most then you get shit on by the other criminals fighting for their share of the legislation. That's why I wouldn't be surprised if Apple actually *pushed* for something like this just for some extra cash. The most successful companies are the ones who know how to play ball in this giant mess of gangsters running the establishment, and Apple is right there in the middle of the fight.
I think it's naive to believe Apple is merely a victim of the NSA. Sure, they might be a victim to some surveillance because the NSA is in *everyone's* data, but that in no way means they are completely innocent in their dealings with the NSA.

Not me. I'm just in favor of freedom of information and anonymity to bring a balance of power between governments and people. I can't say I hate government when there are obviously some successful governments, notably in northern Europe. The difference is their lack of corruption. For a libertarian society, see Somalia.
