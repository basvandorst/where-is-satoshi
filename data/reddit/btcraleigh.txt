No, this is highly illegal and will put you in jail for several years. Plus moneypak has very tight limits. They would likely shut down the accounts and freeze the funds before you were able to withdrawal. Try to find a different method for whatever you're trying to do.

This happened to me before. I've been selling coins to coinbase since they started. One day they started canceling all my orders. I contacted support and after some back and forth they white listed my account. Everything has been smooth since then.

The beauty of Bitcoin is that it is universal. So while we can compare it to USD for value, it can be converted to any countries dollar. This is what gives it such tremendous value.

Well I do think if you increased the bounty three or four fold you might spark some interest. Otherwise, there are 500+ btc bounties out there currently.
Best of luck getting your coin back!

I'm pretty sure their support will reopen on Monday. Rest assured it will get taken care of then.

This is why I picked up a Cryobit. They are great for cold storage and can withstand fire to an extent. But I keep mine is a fireproof safe just to be on the safe side. No pun intended...
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:01:55
10% bounty, you have got to be kidding. People lose thousands of coins and offer 50% bounties in hopes of their return. 4.2 BTC isn't going to be worth anyone's time. 
And the other half of the bounty going to a "organization" of your choosing. The whole thing seems sketchy if you ask me.
@_date: 2014-10-17 16:00:54
Yeah, met these guys at Cryptolina and they truly are a top notch company.
@_date: 2014-08-15 03:02:02
Unfortuantely not. I spoke with a supervisor and he seems to think Bitcoin takes 24-48 hours to process. They will not help me at all. At this point I'll just count it a loss.

Started trading at $4/coin several years ago. I remember selling thousands of coins at $30 and hundreds more at $125.   I don't regret my decision though. I still made a large sum of money and did quite well for the time frame. 
Currently, I still have triple digits of coins and plan on never selling out. I spend them occasionally and keep the bulk in cold storage for the long term. We will be at the moon within a few years.

Exactly. I'm glad I was able to spend my coins as this helps bring them where they are today. As an early investor,  I have made a nice sum from bitcoins which has given me a head start. Now I am still sitting on triple digits in coins and look forward to the growth in the future. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 14:02:58
A bit of a misleading title, yeah. I'd say they "lost" my bitcoin. You hit the head on the nail though. I am simply trying to say that there needs to be a better resolution service for this. There is very little support offered in these instances. I have spent several hours trying talking to dish and they have got me nowhere. Hopefully one day they will offer a support system for these circumstances.

I haven't used them recently so I can't say. I started trading with them in 2011 as they were the only domestic trader. My only other option was Mtgox.  I agree that their licensing and business might be a little bit shady.

Nice. I figured this might happen eventually after ticket sales were low. 175 for 2 days is high but I guess we can call it reasonable. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:21:07
It helps if your report them as long term capital gain instead of short term. Assuming you've owned the coins for more than 1 year. The tax break is much better for long term than short.

@_date: 2014-08-15 21:48:55
I understand what your saying. It makes sense theoretically, but unfortunately isn't the case in this instance. Last I checked the transaction had been confirmed over 90 times. It has been over 24 hours and still not on the account. My computer died at the split second where the payment was sent from my wallet, but before the checkout page confirmed the transfer. It was horrible timing.
I have been working with Robin at Coinbase to resolve the issue. The coins were moved from the wallet quickly and converted to fiat. Evidently, the payment got stuck and has to be pushed through manually. Robin is working with the lead developers at Dish to solve this issue. Nothing yet, but I think it may come through within a few days.
I imagine that within a few months, there will be an easier process to resolve these type of issues. As for now, it is quite the headache.

Conversation with Dish employee. They just keep telling me to resend the bitcoin. Just because they accept bitcoin doesn't mean their employees know anything about it:
Jannet (ID: GUI): Hi, my name is Jannet (ID: GUI). How may I help you?
 Matt: Yes I am following up on a previous issue with a bitcoin payment. There should be notes on my account if you are able to review them
 Jannet (ID: GUI): I will be happy to assist you with that.

 Jannet (ID: GUI): There is no notes on the account though.
 Jannet (ID: GUI): I apologize for the inconvenience.
 Matt: okay. i will have to start over. 
 Jannet (ID: GUI): One moment please.
 Jannet (ID: GUI): May I know if you are processing the payment through your online account?
 Matt: I paid with bitcoin
 Jannet (ID: GUI): I understand. You can use Bitcoin in making payment, However, this can be done through Online so that this will be posted on your account and can be noted.
 Matt: Correct, I made a bitcoin payment ealier and my computer died while sending. The bitcoin payment was subtracted from my wallet, but not registered on my account. I talked to a representative earlier and they told me to contact coin base. I have now talked to them and they have presented me with a transaction ID that should be able to honor the payment with.

The way Coinbase works is they give you a new address to send the payment to for every transaction. After I turned my computer and logged back on, it had already generated a new address despite the payment being sent.

Even when mining, bitcoins come from the pool's website. They are not truly virgin coins. Unless you had one of these massive Chinese facilities full of miners, solo-mining would likely not be profitable. It could take many decades before finding a block.
I don't think people would pay a premium for virgin coins. Many people already pay extra for coins on LBC, craigslist, and BTM's. Adding another premium for virgin coins just doesn't seem worth it at that point.
@_date: 2014-07-13 13:23:58
I was looking into this and read somewhere that they will implement it in September.  For some reason i originally thought it was July. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:21:41
Ugh didn't realize that. Sorry. Credit cards and bitcoin is not a good combo.
@_date: 2014-09-26 17:50:54
How about if you took a snack machine or something similar and loaded it with prepaid bitcoin cards. Since this would not be connected to the network to process monetary transactions, would you need a money transmitters license? Prices could still be adjusted remotely by the operator as the market swings.

Similar situation last year. I made a buy order and later found out it was requested from a temporary bank account # and not my current one. Of course the order was denied. I tried placing another order and instantly cancelled. I contacted support and they had blacklisted my account. After some explaining, they put me on the whitelist again and I've been trading ever since.
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:42:13
Nope. The past is the past. Nothing I can do to change it now so no sense in regretting it.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:28:41
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:21:46
I just sent them an email as well. If enough people show interest, they might implement the feature. Bitcoin could get a little viral attention as well. Email them here:
@_date: 2014-08-15 03:15:32
I doubt anything will come of it. Even with the transaction ID, Dish has no way to look it up or credit the account. I stopped using Coinbase months ago because of their antics. This is just reinforcement to that decision.

They will start accepting Bitcoin as payment in September. I have Dish and haven't had any issues with them. We have to get extremely heavy rain for there to be any breakup in the signal. Of course everyone is different depending on your view to the southern sky. If there are tree branches in the way, you will notice some issues in reception.

Possibly. But the $200 ticket charge has me on the fence. Seems a bit steep if you ask me. Especially when we are trying to educate the masses about bitcoin. I will likely end up going though. Maybe Draper will tell me how much his dad paid for 30k coins ;)

I was on the phone with Dish adjusting my services last week. With the conclusion of the call, I asked the rep when they would be accepting bitcoin. She became very confused and pulled up her payment system as if I was going to make a payment over the phone. She said she didn't see an option for bitcoin payment. I don't think she had ever heard of it. SMH
Word is that they will be accepting it in September. Just try to be patient.

@_date: 2014-08-15 21:51:58
I agree. They should have a few employees who are knowledgeable about Bitcoin and can work through these issues. I've talked the three different employees at Dish and all of them said blockchain.info is blocked on their company computers. They don't even have the resources to solve the problem.

I think btc-e will do the same thing. But there are some limits to it and what-not. For instance, you cannot deposit more than your point-of-sale limit. I believe btc-e processes it as a refund to the card so I'm not sure its 100% legitimate.

Nope, not working for us either. I have less than a penny in my account and account can't be closed with an active balance. The fraction of a cent, however, does not meet the minimum amount to be withdrawn so I can't do anything. I'm stuck.

Agreed! Looking forward to tomorrow.
