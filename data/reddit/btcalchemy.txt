I could only do in country for now. I am checking Patriot Act info to see about doing this overseas, after all we are a global BTC community.

MTgox Mark Karpeles was apparently one of the arresting agents. The irony and the conspiracy...

I am an independent jeweler in Virginia and i've been accepting bitcoin for 2 years now--with no issues and best of all no fees. I haven't had many take me up on it but it's definitely something I will continue--anyone wanna buy a diamond :)?

Unless they can shoot you all the way from Eastern Europe or Nigeria I'd say youre pretty safe.

Anytime you use the word "revolution" when talking about government you're bound to get some negative attention. Bitcoin is innovation and technological progress, and maybe it will overthrow currency as we know it but that day is not today.

I have to echo the sentiments below.  You made a bad mistake, bitcoin isn't the problem. Look at it this way, you paid to learn a life lesson. If you take anything away, let it be this: treat investments like going to Vegas; never play with money you'll ever miss. Doesn't mean you have to lose faith in BTC. I have made and lost money on dogecoin, btc, etc. 
Sorry youre having a rough time. Sell the coins, pay your bills and chalk it up to a loss, I doubt it will be your first or last, it's just life

Yeah, it's a novelty item and more expensive.  We do have 1oz silver bars, sealed for less than 10% over spot.

I own a jewelry store and have been in business for 15 years. I sell ceritifed diamonds and can do custom rings in any metal.  PM me, you can also check out bitcoinalchemy.com, I am one of the owners there as well.
I accept bitcoin in my store and USPS express mail is covered under my jewelers mutual insurance up to $50000.  
I am US based in Hampton, Virginia.

Any other suggestions from the community would be appreciated. For instance, do you think a standard price per gram chart would be helpful?

Seems to be another "older" naysayer who only has faith in what he knows-from 30 years ago.  He probably said "that internet thing will never take off" too.
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:28:32
no, i actually spend my bitcoin.  I have never held in hopes of a high payoff though I did get lucky when it went to $1200. I had mined a bunch and at the time there weren't as many places to spend. I still buy and still use them, I am hoping that the speculators dump and leave or decide to spend coin, that's how success will be measured for crypto.
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:05:36
I like all metals but I think you're right.  In my experience silver has been the best ROI. I still like btc but it can't hurt to have some metals-  the coin of the realm for thousands of years.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:58:23

I'm sure youv'e heard this before...the ultimate success of bitcoin is it's widespread adoption--people need to start spending it on condoms and coffee, then the future is more certain and secure.
That said, i'm holding.
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:15:39
Proof that people will buy anything they think they can make money on.
@_date: 2014-08-16 19:57:31
No, not really. Some repairs and silver bars so far.  I do out it in my advertising and get a lot of folks asking "what's Bitcoin?"
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:33:40
It's not only easier for you, it saves the 2-3% the merchant pays for the transaction--a fee we have to pay a portion of no matter if you, the consumer, reverses it or not. Might not seem like a lot but over the course of a fiscal year 3% of your bottom line adds up to a lot. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 01:30:22
Yes and he bought his dress with my bitcoin.

I linked the site in one post and made another for people to comment on.  If you don't like it, move on.
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:22:32
They have to spend all that money on something.  It certainly isn't going towards filling orders.
@_date: 2014-08-26 15:57:29
It truly depends on what you have. On gold bars you get 92% on recognized material i.e. JM, Credit Suisse, Englehard. If they are secondary market, (sunshine mint, etc) we pay 90%. If you have scrap the rate is directly affected by the weight, with at least 1 ounce of metal we pay 80-85% of market price, for lower amounts it might only be 60% (that is the minimum payout).. Please let me know what you have and if you'd like to send it to us.  My email is john

You got me, well done. The spam police (You) 1 The company just starting out-0. 2 posts and 1 reply do not constitute spam or even a pattern, just getting the word out.
I read some if your other posts, you
Like to troll and you have a particularly nasty disposition.  That's not passive aggressive, just a true fact that makes you look bad.
@_date: 2014-08-26 00:54:37
Jewelry, scrap, gold and silver coins, diamonds. All can be converted and we will pay out in BTC.  I put up a link asking if there was interest in this sort of thing (and got a lot of positive responses), so we added it to the site as it is something I do in my daily business anyhow. Turn around is 24-48 hours from time of receipt.
BONUS: First 5 to use this service and actually send and sell their items AND mention this reddit link will get 10% more BTC added to the payout. No catches, if you come in at $200 you get $220 in BTC.

better have a better plan than worrying about bitcoins.  Silver, gold and survival.

My website only accepts bitcoin for metals, bitcoinalchemy.com. We have had a lot of inquiries, but not many orders yet. I agree that we need to offer the things people need, but more importantly we need to offer a reason to use bitcoin OVER other methods of payment. Right now you can google and buy anything with dollars and as you point out, people are usually willing to enter in all kinds of personal info to get free crap. I think the most successful merchants will, for the time being, offer to take all forms of currency, at least until more people understand and begin to adopt btc. We built our business on only bitcoin and we are striving to make it successful by only taking bitcoin as payment. If we cannot get buyers to order our product we cannot sustain the business--no matter how fervently we believe that it is the currency of the future.
I know that we sell the same quality goods that you can buy from other vendors with dollars. I am hoping that we attract those customers that want to support a bitcoin only business model, i.e. the guys (and girls) that post on this subreddit. Good luck with your website!

Any market that targets younger men, i.e. btc enthusiasts is probably going to do best initially. When btc becomes more widely accepted and understood that will expand. I personally like some of the weird shit on fancy.com and have made several purchases there with btc.

Somebody knows, way too specific to be a coincidence.  Hope you got your stuff backed up to a paper wallet.

 I have been touched by suicide and attempts over the years from friends and family and it is never an easy thing to deal with. You make a great point in the last paragraph--when someone is in the throes of depression they simply cannot see a way out of it. That's where talking to someone can make all the difference. I once stopped and talked with a Vietnam vet outside a store raising money for the VFW. He told me of a woman that had just made eye contact and said hello to him when he was in a particularly dark place right after the war. For whatever reason he decided not to end his life, just because someone had noticed him-he'd previously felt invisible to the world. As sappy as it sounds you really never know how your actions will affect those around you, especially when it might just be a passing gesture.

Our rates are USPS actual shipping charges, thanks for looking!
If you need a particular type of less expensive shipping let us know- just want to make sure it's insured to you.
@_date: 2014-08-16 06:55:36
We already sell metals for btc, like amalgi at bitcoinalchemy.com.  My thought was more paying out btc for metals and diamonds.  People who wanted Bitcoin for their old jewelry would get paid out in btc.

We've also got rifle bullets in 2 and 10 ounce sizes and a 25 ounce 20mm round.

I have a BFL jalapeno that i'm using as a paperweight.
My script miners once made me $120/day in litecoin. Now I have 3 computers for my kids and 9 extra video cards laying around.

I don't think any government has any interest in mining but I would damn sure like that contract. 
I do think they keep very close eye on things however. There are much easier ways to take control of the chain if they wish other than mining.
