Yeah I would open source anything to do with it, MIT or GPL3 License, whatever is wanted. 
Taking 500BTC for this project is one thing, but I will toot my own horn here and say, I've been working very hard on several other open source projects. ( Primary. xmms2 ) My codes for these projects are on github.com/oneman
So if more was donated than just 500BTC it would all go towards funding my other open source work. :D

I updated kradminer.com with the following:
Open Source
The people demand it! But will they put their Bitcoin where there finger is? I will open source Krad Miner for 500BTC. All BTC above and below this amount fund my continued work on the XMMS2 project (Video) and other projects such as my network FLAC and CELT streaming programs.

Flabbergasted. Hey, I am the maker of Krad Miner. I lurk reddit, so this is pretty cool that theres some jibber jabber about something I've done on here now. Maybe you guys can give me some magic karma so when I really have a witty comment it doesn't go into the great beyond immediately.
Basically the browser based miner can be just as fast as the "native" programs, since opencl itself is all about being native, but its not quite as fast now because in javascript you can't just create a bunch of threads, its trickier. It won't be many blinks of an eye before its exactly as good. 
I'm not really sure what direction the site will go in, but anyone that mines more than a bit nickle will get paid within 24hours.

13 Years USAA customer here. Here is the reason USAA is the best bank: They don't use dark paterns and scammy stuff all over the website and in their propaganda. They answer the phone after you call from a phone you have called from before and entire your social security number and some other number and then you scream to the compuer to get a respresentative, and then after you tell them your phone password and grandma's fav kind of tea they actually talk to you. The online banking is the best because you only have to dredge up memories of your first girlfriends name and a pin number after you re-enter your username and password. If you want to wire money with USAA your going to be on the phone about an hour and pay a $30 or $40 fee assuming you don't mention bitcoin exist. Also if you spend like I spend, which is, not at all for a few weeks and then 1-4k at several places they will cut your debit card off when your trying to have a lunch and then you will call them and have to 'verify' all the crap you bought in the last 24hours and they will then tell you about how much they care and are trying to protect you.
I have accounts at two other banks mainly because when your trying to make something happen you can count one of the banks to go into total disapoint mode and friendzone your money for a while.
From a systems perspective USAA maybe the pinnacle of consumer level fiat banking. They are the best because everyone else is so bad, and everything that sucks about them is something they are pretty much driven into an evolutionary dead end on. 
Bitcoin and Bitcoin businesses can crush them on all the technicals, and somewhere over a nearby rainbow when WebRTC works, customer service too.
