There are people referring to 100 satoshi as a dorian. I'm not sure how serious they are about it…probably mostly joking.

I really don't want to in any way encourage us-vs-them mentality re: dogecoin and bitcoin, but this picture is fucking hilarious.

What does "accepting Bitcoin via Bitcoin" mean?
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:30:51
This could make it easier to follow chains of transactions, or to recognize an address in an unexpected place.

OMG THIS IS RAD AS HELL

That doesn't make it any less relevant to the subreddit, assuming it hasn't been posted before
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:01:30
So does/is bitcoin. I can't really tell what you are trying to say here.
@_date: 2014-02-16 10:44:21
How rude
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:06:00
What? “XBT” is not a new unit. It is an abbreviation meant to replace “BTC.”

"I feel as though they are so deep into the culture of doge they are deluded."
Something about that sentence cracked me up.

Sent a dollar to that protestor's address. lol
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:36:35
Yeah, it's obvious that price fluctuates with reputation and current events, but I always have wanted to see who these actual people are who - presumably - read a Verge headline and just sell all their BTC.
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:52:59
No need to be such a cunt about it.
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:38:40
Finally, someone with some sense. I can't believe people think it's like some petty issue that Apple have with bitcoin. I think it's easy to forget how young and nascent bitcoin actually is, in the grand scheme of things. Yes, it's growing and shows a lot of promise, and very well may be the future of money, but it's probably good practice to understand why people who don't spend every waking minute steeped in bitcoin news don't realize bitcoin's importance. It's a childish, knee-jerk reaction to have. That being said, I think that the strength of the community is the only hope that we have for (MAYBE) getting this changed any time soon, but to turn it into an us-v-them flame war? Come on.
Sure, Apple are (supposedly) working on their own payments system. Eventually, though, they won't be able to ignore bitcoin.
This news bums me out, too.
@_date: 2014-02-23 23:08:21

On the part of the machine, it is work. If the machine is strong enough to be making a meaningful contribution to the btc network, it is consuming a lot of energy. Something like that does not come free. When something is not free, you have worked for it.
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:14:15
To be fair, all OP was saying is that it's obvious.

That's XRP - and I am not in a position to judge whether or not Ripple is a scam, but that's another topic.

I believe this is probably an amendment to the definition, meant to accommodate colloquial use, but still, it's there.
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:06:23
I actually think I am starting to lean more towards this viewpoint.

I just mean to bring up the fact that hardly anyone seems to be talking about this.

Not to identify your own addresses, but others'

All of those things are useful services built on top of he revolutionary technology that is the internet. When it was just the arpanet, only nerds were excited. Normal people wrote it off until services like this—relevant to their interests—came into view. Them, all of the big picture stuff rides on the coat tails of the smaller stuff's success.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:31:06
If that is true, that is really fucked up.

Hahaha that is so cool.

Why are you even using Mt Gox?

Wow, I forgot Frostwire even existed. This is a really awesome concept!

When you start talking about “we” in you will only find more and more that “we” is pretty fucking fragmented—good luck with that.

Oh, cool. I am talking about recognizing addresses that occur on any site, though. Even in local files, if they're viewed in the browser.
@_date: 2014-02-03 04:21:44
"Next week"? Source? I want this app so bad so I am just wondering.
@_date: 2014-02-03 01:17:02
Saying that "an online wallet isn't very secure" is misleading. Every service is different, and it all depends on how the operation is run. Some people PREFER to have their keys 100% offline, and I can appreciate that, but there is no reason that an online wallet service cannot be run in a totally secure way. Depending on the implementation, it might require some trust on the part of the user, but that doesn't change how secure it actually is.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:39:19
This was really genuine and tongue-in-cheek. Basically the whole segment was humorously putting Bitcoin in context for his viewers. To me, it was like a roundabout way of saying, "Oh? Bitcoin can be used for crime? Trust me, Bitcoin can't even DREAM of being at the level of the institutionalized fiat crime that we already have." When he said "Baby steps, Bitcoin," you could tell he really meant it. Thanks, Jon.
@_date: 2014-04-07 04:48:02
I personally would suggest that you switch to using a Blockchain wallet in general. Buy/sell on Coinbase, but use Blockchain as a wallet. Coinbase isn't really ideal for using as a wallet. Also, they may have a native app coming out sometime through that BitStore iOS thing.
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:44:05
Do you guys have an email I can contact you at?
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:28:06
"Still"? lol did something happen?
@_date: 2014-03-19 04:07:52
I went to check if something bad had happened to bitcoin today…nope.
@_date: 2014-04-07 04:58:15
No I know, I mean it works, it's just that in my experience, there have been delays in transactions. Also, Coinbase uses something called "shared addresses," which isn't a *bad* thing, but it means that the address you receive from isn't the same address that you send from. Idk, I just prefer Blockchain. Makes me feel more in control, and I have those private keys backed up.
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:15:24
Why would you ***ever*** format a date like that?

@_date: 2014-10-09 06:56:18
why would you make it 100 satoshi instead of 1 satoshi? seems arbitrary
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:14:20
What is this in reference to? Did they just ban btc or something?
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:52:24

Is it not open source? What are you even getting at? Legit question, as I have never heard anyone say that about dogecoin before.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:53:11
What does this mean
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:41:16
Made me smile. Also, a nice graphic.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:08:53
A pretty unusual assumption..
@_date: 2013-03-27 06:37:55
The answer to your question depends very much on who you are asking...are you asking me, or are you asking silk road users? Very different answers..

I don't know why anyone would downvote him this. This is a *very* valid thing to bring up…
@_date: 2013-10-13 21:14:41


Just fyi, they are planning on adding higher stakes aervers in the future, I believe. :D
I think it's such an awesome concept. Consider that if you are, for example, a pro-level player, you don't have to wait for a tourney to roll around to make money - you can just get some coffee and sit down at a high stakes server for the night. Kick everyone's ass and pay your rent. So cool. (or get your ass kicked and cry yourself to sleep)
@_date: 2013-10-08 01:49:48
1. He's explicitly stated on his Twitter that he doesn't plan on implementing these ideas himself.
2. Yeah and "hopefully", even if posting this repository *is* incriminating for some reason, no one spreads his accounts around for them to be even *more* visible like you are.
3. Although I will say just for the record, he is 16. I hope nothing comes of this that fucks him over in any way just because he was an overzealous kid who underestimated what the US government could consider to be incriminating. (Even though clearly he is simply proposing a concept - there really shouldn't be anything wrong with that)

Valuing integrity is one thing, but assuming every random stranger on the internet HAS integrity? That's another. Just my two bitcents.
edit: I mean, if the guy has ratings in -otc, then sure, that makes sense, but I interpreted it as you making a random, wanton assumption about the guy. Anyways, perhaps I am being preachy? idk. I'm just saying that a mutual lack of trust doesn't have to be perceived as disrespect when you are complete strangers, that's all. It can even be interpreted as respect - having enough respect for the other person that you understand their concerns regarding their ability to trust you.
@_date: 2013-10-08 20:58:54
You are correct. I just don't think one should underestimate people's desire to:
1. stick it to the man, man.
and 2. Use drugs
@_date: 2013-10-08 01:47:33
That's what anyone would have said if you explained bitcoin to them before it existed…
