@_date: 2015-12-01 21:53:17
It's also about the user experience because you will always have to decide or at least know if your transaction will have the RBF flag or not. I am especially thinking of newbies (which most people are or will be). They already have to learn several new concepts like backup seeds, confirmations and confirmation times, deterministic wallets, sending bitcoins from exchanges where returned amounts won't show up in your account etc.
These are all drops into a bucket of things you have to learn. RBF is just another one which could at worst lead a newbie to being scammed at his first bitcoin purchase. This is just another thing you have to take care of when handling bitcoin and I am not seeing any great benefits.

I have another thought. Couldn't there be half nodes which only store the newest blocks and some random chunks of older blocks?
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:31:45
Sure you wouldn't have the full chain of proof like in a full node but it could still verify new blocks and relay blocks to other nodes. An SPV wallet is also able to verify transactions without storing the full blockchain. I think running a 'half node' would be better than running no node at all. It could also be a backup mode for full nodes which are running out of disc space. Is this possible?

20mb could be the hard limit but another limit like for example 8mb could be the default soft limit every miner can change.
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:11:13
20 MB blocks don't mean that all blocks will be 20 MB in size. This is the upper limit at which new transactions will start to jam. Increasing the limit will allow the increase of TXs/block to continue.

google translation for those who don't understand spanish:
Transactions for Localbitcoins exceed for the first time the billion Bolivars in Venezuela
Despite the arrests of the miners and as a result of the partial closure of operations of the main exchange SurBitcoin, the person-to-person service has had an unprecedented volume of transactions that practically double what was exchanged in December.
The Bitcoin enthusiasts who buy and sell in Venezuela are apparently not afraid of the latest news that has cast doubt on the stability of the Cryptomoneda in that country. The week that has just passed, through Localbitcoins, the largest number of transactions in its history was carried out, if they are calculated in Bolivars. 1.12 billion bolivars (approximately US $ 337,044, depending on the parallel market price) were exchanged, when the previous week (the last of January) had traded for 744 million bolivars. In fact, it is the first time that the number of operations exceeds the billion Bolivars. The number of bitcoins exchanged was 359 bitcoins, when the last week of January went hand in hand 252 bitcoins. It grows and grows.
It is striking that such a volume of operations is taking place despite the climate of uncertainty that has woven with respect to the legality of the currency in the country. Although no government official has made an official statement on the cryptonnet, during the last two weeks of January several operations were carried out to stop the mining activity. First, on January 26, four people who were mining Bitcoin were arrested in Charallave, Miranda state. Then, two days later, a Bitcoin mine was dismantled in Carabobo state, which had 11,000 teams (two people were arrested) and last week in Caracas police arrested two people for the sale of Bitcoin mining equipment through the Website Free Market.
Despite this series of arrests, at no time have been affected the buyers and sellers of the criptomoneda. In an article, Diario Bitcoin explained that the sale was still safe in Venezuela.
However, last week there was a fact that probably caused many people to migrate to Localbitcoins. Banesco, one of the most important bank, closed the account of Surbitcoin, the country's largest exchange, which prevented the exchange from trading in bolivars from February 3. Surbitcoin itself alerted its users to what was happening and recommended using the person-to-person services of Localbitcoins if they were in need of currency exchange.

Sure, it is all fake and shady but releasing a quick and dirty altcoin isn't that hard (especially with the money they have taken). Obviously it wouldn't be as advertised by them.
@_date: 2015-05-07 21:20:30
So you want to use third party payment providers like Paypal, credit cards, Ripple or another cryptocurrency to pay for thing and load them up with bigger bitcoin payments from time to time? This would be like using bitcoin to store your money and exchange them USD to pay with your credit card.
Even then the block size will become an issue if bitcoin doesn't fail. With more and more transactions the fees would need to get higher and higher while 1MB will become cheaper and cheaper.

@_date: 2015-01-22 23:04:30
Depends on the exchange and the payment options they offer. For bitcoin transactions from your own wallet you can usually choose the fee (depending on which wallet you are using). When the bitcoin transaction fee is too low it could take some time for the transaction because it has low priority but your wallet will warn you if you try.
For the fees on the exchanges it really depend on which exchange you choose and where you live. Just try it out with a small amount and you'll see. I am already registered with a dozen of exchanges because I just tried them out.

Wether it's bitcoin, stocks, gold, property or whatever, if you are doing serious investments you are typically investing for longer than a year. Things just take some time and you can't divest and reinvest your whole lifesavings every year.

Additionally, at lower prices it is easier to buy off the limited number of coins.
@_date: 2017-02-05 22:16:22
Before 2013 people didn't consider bitcoin as a serious investment and only a few people knew about it. Then we got more attention but this also started the altcoin hype because people didn't want buy in 'late'.  
Today bitcoin starts to be seen as an alternative to inflation like a modern gold pendant. When this gets more traction the demand will be huge.

You assume that there are people that buy and sell and there are people that always buy. I think it's clear that over time the second group will accumulate what they are buying. And if they don't sell the supply is smaller which results in higher prices on a free market.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:39:21
The valuation is also based on the investors expectations. This means that they think that bitcoin is undervalued.  The 'bitcoin market cap' could quickly increase in $-value. Also not all investments in these companies were made with most recent btc-prices.

Yes I've used them several times and I could always instantly withdraw the balance to my own address. The only problem I had with sofortbanking is that you cannot have more than two pending SEPA transactions at the same time from the same bank account number.

So miners and wallets which are connecting directly to the bitcoin network are unaffected?
How would a standalone wallet know if it connects to the forked blockchain or the old one? I think it would be very bad if two blockchain versions would run in parallel on a wide number of clients.

What sucks is that you need an internet connection. If you are not in your home country you would have to purchase another SIM card (extra costs, you'll get another number, your messenger might not work, you'll have to get the correct sim card type:microSIM,nanoSIM,miniSIM). Or you can eventually use an unsecured wifi.
A solution would be offline transaction signing. The cashier could request a payment via NFC or a QR-code. Then the customer has to sign it and send it back to the cashier who submits it to the network.
This would also be great for secure offline wallets. You wouldn't have to an USB flash drive to carry the transaction. I think that the flash drive is the weak point for offline wallets because it is really complex compared to a QR-code. The flash drive with it's file system, the giant memory and the usb-chip could hide and transfer much information.

It's all the same but they switched to a new altcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:21:15
There is also a tax reason. Depending on which country you live in ETFs and stocks might be treated other than foreign currencies, gold or bitcoin. Also with bitcoin you might want to pay no tax at all.
Edit: And investment funds will much more likely invest in an ETF than in bitcoin directly.

There are existing coins for this purpose and there are bitcoin services to stop the trace.

I don't understand what you could use this for. Without an QR scanner or copy &amp; paste you would have to type in the bitcoin address manually on a 12-button keyboard. You wouldn't use it in a store because it takes to long and you wouldn't use it at home because you normally have at least one internet device if you are using bitcoin.

Altcoins don't have the hodl culture. It is the same as with gold and the other precious metals. You could think that e.g. palladium should be worth much more than gold because it is scarcer and has more uses but after all people don't see it as a store of value.

You don't understand the principle. You could compile an endless list of things that could improve the safety. Every detail of every component can be improved for more safety. Nothing is ever perfect. You could start with saying that driving slower is safer. Then you would mention an additional side airbag. Much later you could mention a rubber cap on a sharp screw-end is safer when things fall apart.
Products can be designed with many targets in mind (costs, energy efficiency, design, repairability, safety, stability etc.) and it should not be the government to decide these.
Also consumers are already made aware of many risks but no one is really interested in them (Don't put that plastic bag on your head.).

Sure but when will we get there? Right now the LN adoption is low and so is the incentive to use or implement it.
edit: I'm just saying the thing won't get rolling by itself. The average bitcoin user does not have a big benefit from using the LN today. Therefore I think it's great to see established wallets getting LN functionality integrated so that you can use it with as few barriers as possible. A widely used LN-enabled wallet is another incentive for merchants to accept LN payments.

I am using SD cards because they have a much simpler interface than usb.


Electrum supports reading and creating QR codes, this would create a very good gap between the devices.
I am actually using a Raspberry Pi with a cheap small touchscreen and a card reader which is never unplugged. This is actually cheaper than a trezor but I am not using this solution to save money. I just prefer that I can easily view and verify all public and private keys.
I think that it wouldn't be good when the whole bitcoin user base would rely on one single cold storage solution.

First, it is a long time until then. Miners will 'only' earn the transaction fees then. With every transaction you can pay a fee that goes to the miner who is processing your transaction. This is how it works today. You can also choose to pay no fee or a very low fee but then it probably takes more time to confirm or the transaction won't be confirmed at all if no miner chooses to process it because there is no incentive.

This is just a possibility and it is very hard to know whether your system you are using to access thousands of services is compromised or not.

Your wallet is on a full linux system which is running a web server. The software on a hardware wallet should be reduced to the absolute minimum. Your keys are probably safe though unless your wallet gets popular.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:54:07


I'm feeling rude for destroying your project for which did create a very comprehensive documentation.


At most the attacker could request to get a transaction signed. An attacker would try to send the funds to his address. At this point the attack would rely on the user to confirm this transaction. He could check the address and the amount and then deny it. If the transaction appears without user interaction it would be highly suspicious anyway.


If you have malware on your system there could be a key logger which records your password.


The encryption doesn't help that much when the whole input and output happens on the host system. On common hardware wallets the encryption is mainly against an attacker with physical access to the device.


I'd suggest adding a hardware button so that no transaction can be signed without user interaction. A screen could help to verify the transaction. There are small touchscreen available for the raspberry pi that could be useful.
That being said, unless your wallet gets widely used a custom solution like yours will hardly be targeted by anyone. Even software wallets are not doomed to lose your coins. I kept a then small amount of bitcoin in an unencrypted wallet on my day to day pc for over 4 years. This was to have an indication if something was wrong but these coins were never moved by anyone else than me.
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:36:24

You should always assume that your host machine isn't safe because that's the motivation for using a hardware wallet.


The security of the Ledger Nano S doesn't rely on that. Each transaction is shown on the small screen and it has to be confirmed by pressing a button on the device. If some malware tries to steal your coins you would be displayed a transaction to a foreign address and then you wouldn't press the sign button.
As I understand it your hardware wallet would prevent malware from finding your private keys but it wouldn't prevent if some software would request to sign a transaction.

I'd agree with you if the tweet wasn't that hilarious.
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:58:12
There aren't really free coins, at best you'll get super small amounts. Also mining services or other investments are often scams or the returns are small or even negative. You should be very skeptical.
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:03:25
Why are there so many small outgoing transactions? Why would you do that?

"...blockchain..." at 2:14 in the video

Why are there no transactions in block 342692 and why was it mined before block 342691?

You can copy&amp;paste the blurred text.

But Breadwallet will also sync for a few minutes. I haven't used it for a month and it took about 10 minutes. I don't know what it actually did.
@_date: 2015-11-30 16:03:10
There's still an improved security because it became much harder attack bitcoin with a botnet or a big datacenter (like from google or amazon).

shitpost of the month?

Use Electrum on an offline computer. Tails is useful for this task.

This site gives out many addresses and many of them store about 10btc. You are certainly not the only victim.   
   
btcrobo.com is a huge scam.

Would you like to be a bitcoin owner?

It still costs time and energy to mine gold as a by-product. If gold was massively mined as a free (!) by-product it would mean that gold supply wouldn't be elastic anymore. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:26:08


The faucet site are not scams but you get paid really small amounts like $0.10 per hour or less. So it's a waste of time. Obviously no one want to give away money for free.  
A viable way to earn bitcoins online is to do work. If you have IT skills you might find something you can do here:

And he asks about the lack transparency. The sign fits so well at this point. Bitcoins with its public blockchain and its open protocol offers super transparency.

It is more like a seasoned equity offering.

300$, 400$, 500$, that was quick.

Is an SPV wallet working as a not-full bitcoin node?

Why don't you just try out out how bitcoin works before you invest in it?
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:25:26
Is there something like a passcode on the trezor?

It will take decades until bitcoin has 'flat' bubbles like the other assets which are all much older.
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:32:41
These huge amounts owned by the exchanges are attracting hackers and frauds. More bitcoins stolen means a worse reputation in the public. If people wouldn't store bitcoins in exchanges the headlines about hacked exchanges would not be that bad.

Because segwit is not activated yet.

Those altcoins each have their protocol, a blockchain, software and you can trade them on various exchanges. Onecoins has nothing of these, there is only a web shop were you can buy "packages" from this company.

The spread is below 0.3% on bitstamp, this is really low at the current volatility.
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:39:08
I just noticed the smaller curve...
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:33:22
Are they already running a mining farm?
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:47:15
Well, when your system is already compromised you should assume that everything you type in could get evaluated or manipulated including addresses and strong password. Every wallet is at risk then.
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:51:39
Why would they ask a potential criminal? Their moral is higher than yours.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:03:43
Why does it end specifically at 4000?
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:00:40
12^2048 is a huge number, try typing it in a calculator.

When you spend bitcoin just buy it back.

Not sure but that loan is probably getting closed before that date. Most margin trades are short term.

Their chain is worthless without users.

It is a cloud mining service but I have to admit that I haven't looked much into it.

The result is:

Bitcoin is pretty good but you could visit  to see what's popular. There's nothing wrong about getting the shitcoin experience.
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:37:04
I am expecting smaller crashes with every bubble. So eventually bitcoin will become a rather stable currency.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:30:51
Depends on the machine but I don't see the problem. Just install a wallet on your phone, you don't even need an internet connection to receive the coins.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:03:01


If a GPU mineable altcoin becomes big enough then Nvidia or AMD will be very similar to todays ASIC producers.

The confidence grows with the value of the coins.

Bitclubnetwork seems shady, so stay away (especially as a beginner). Bitcoin itself already is a good opportunity with risk involved.
I don't know about Cryptopay. They seem to be legit for purchasing bitcoins but as a wallet I would prefer an open source wallet were only you have access to the private keys and make your own backup. The backup is very important!
For example:

A good response to those comments are old articles like this one from 7 years ago.

Bitcoin mining was (and still would be) a very small market for these companies.

Bitcoin-qt can connect to a remote node. You could also run an electrum server which utilizes the full node.
