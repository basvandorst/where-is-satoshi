Well, I've never had my bitcoin hacked, so possibly, but of course any one person can have their coins "hacked" if they are careless with their private keys. Exchanges are just bigger targets because they have more coins to steal. That is one of the features of bitcoin though...I am not worth hacking because the money you would have to spend to get my bitcoin is more than what my bitcoin is worth, so...


I "do not know nothing", so then I do know something?


Put their coins on a hardware wallet and keep their private key on a [billfodl]( That is pretty secure.

I would never compare Bitcoin and Tesla.
Bitcoin is useful, decentralized, censorship-resistant, not a scam, doesn't require government subsidies to survive, is creating value, is not hemorrhaging wealth, and is not founded by a bullshit artist who recovers the spot price of his creation by tweeting ever more promises he can't keep and is obsessed with being famous and loved by everyone.
Tesla is the opposite. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:57:12
As far as I know, you cannot have trustless, censorship-resistant transactions without a blockchain. Of course, depending on your defintion of 'secure', you can have secure transactions without a blockchain, however you do still have counter-party risk. Any non-blockchain transaction is always centralized (and even many blockchains are, in fact, still centralized). 
If you want (sometimes faster,) cheap, easily scale-able transactions, centralization is the way to go. We already have that. We have had that for decades. Bitcoin offers something new. That's a reason to own it and help it grow. No other coins can do what bitcoin does *at bitcoin's current scale*.

Just remember: Do not let this guy off the hook just because he sold Mt. Gox before it tanked. He clearly knew of the security issues before he sold it to Mark Karpeles.
----From The Daily Beast----
When the prosecutors concluded their investigation into Karpeles in November, he was indicted for improper use of electronic funds and embezzling a total of over 300,000,000 yen ($2.7 million) of customer funds.
At this point in time, Karpeles’s lawyers would only say that Karpeles had made no confession to the police and that Karpeles is only guilty of sloppy accounting, mixing personal accounts and corporate accounts, not embezzlement.
Yet the documents obtained by The Daily Beast, which included correspondence between Mark Karpeles and the original founder of Mt. Gox, Jed McCaleb, suggest that Mt. Gox was plagued by problems from its earliest days, before Karpeles had even taken over the company. The Daily Beast was given internal documents including emails by a former consultant to Mt. Gox and then verified them with Karpeles’s lawyer, former employees, and sources in law enforcement.
Jed McCaleb first approached Mark about selling him Mt. Gox in January of 2011. In an email dated Jan. 18 that year, McCaleb wrote to his acquaintance Karpeles:
Hi Mark~
Please keep all this confidential I don’t want to start a panic and I’m not sure I’ll do it yet but I’m thinking I might try to sell mtgox. I just have these other projects I would like to devote more time to. Would you be interested? It could be very little up front and just a payout based on revenue or something. There is also an investment group that wants to fund mtgox. Probably around $158k. So you could most likely take it over with some cash.
Let me know
Karpeles had become interested in Bitcoin in late 2010 and saw the Mt. Gox platform as the perfect place to set up a Bitcoin exchange. In the early days of the currency, changing fiat money (real money) into bitcoins was an arduous task.
Karpeles agreed to purchase the company from McCaleb and by Feb. 3, 2011, he had signed an agreement with McCaleb to buy the firm, under some very unusual terms.
The seller (McCaleb) wrote into the contract that “the Seller is uncertain if mt.gox.com is compliant or not with any applicable U.S. code or statute, or law of any country.” And it included an article of indemnification: “The buyer agrees to indemnify Seller against any legal action that is taken against Buyer or Seller with regards to mtgox.com or anything acquired under this agreement.”
Shortly after the handover, Karpeles became aware that Mt.Gox had already been hacked at least once and was missing a substantial number of bitcoins—a total of 80,000 to be precise.
The following email on April 28, 2011, which reportedly has been submitted into evidence by both sides in the trial, was probably the beginning of Mark Karpeles’s nightmare:
From: Jed McCaleb &lt;jed
Date: 2011/04/28 22:33
To: Mark Karpeles &lt;admin
I can’t tell how big an issue it will be to be short 80k BTC (*80,000 bitcoin) if the price goes to $100 or something. That is quite a bit to owe at that point but mtgox should have made a ton of BTC (Bitcoin) getting to there. There is also still the fact that the BTC (Bitcoin) balance will probably never fall below 80k. So maybe you don’t really need to worry about it.
There are 3 solutions I have thought of:
- Slowly buy more BTC with the USD that Gox Bot has. Hopefully you would fill up the loss before the price got out of hand.
- Buy a big chunk of BTC (really just moving the BTC debt to the USD side) If BTC goes up this is a huge win. Problem is there isn’t enough BTC for sale on mtgox. Maybe you could find someone on the forum to do it.
- Get those crystal island people to invest･They have 200+ BTC so they could fill in the gap.
Maybe you could just mine it？
The Daily Beast has been trying to reach Jed McCaleb for several weeks both through his email accounts and social media accounts but he has not responded.
Kim Nilsson, a computer security expert at WizSec who has been analyzing the case for over two years, says, “Assuming the emails are genuine considering the timing, both Mark and Jed were aware of some 80,000 BTC that seem to have already been missing before the large June 2011 hack, and Jed was suggesting possible approaches to recovering from it.” The question then remains: did either of them put these plans into action—for example creating a trading bot (a software application that runs automated tasks) to cover the loss.
That is still an unresolved mystery.

Yeah, I am going a long with you on the thought experiment. Perhaps it would be easier if you told me what the amazon coin achieves that bitcoin or USD to amazon gift card does not. 
To be clear, I think gift cards are actually pretty dumb in general. They only add inefficiency by adding more transactions than are necessary. Their only use case is to appear like you are giving someone a personal gift when you are really giving them cash (cash that is actually less useful than the cash you spent to buy the gift card in the first place). 
Creating a finite amazon coin just creates volatility in the amazon market, making it harder to denominate your products in amazon coins. Amazon gift cards are pegged to the dollar. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:20:24


You probably haven't ever run a business, so this is an understandable misconception. So far...yes, the appreciation probably has outweighed the fees (almost certainly), but there is no guarantee that will continue. Businesses are pretty averse to risk (at least the smart ones are), and that's especially true for risk they have absolutely no control over. If they get paid a bitcoin, and tomorrow its worth half as much, it becomes hard to justify accepting bitcoin. They also have to pay fees to get rid of it, plus all the other hassles they have to deal with that they already mentioned. I think it is completely understandable that they suspended bitcoin purchases.

I would describe myself as full on AnCap, however, unlike most ancaps, I admit that there are certain areas of society where a government would outperform a market solution - I'm thinking most specifically in cases such as handling a global pandemic, where a state's monopoly on force allows it to be nimble in shutting down borders and quarantining the sick, and theoretically a state's ability to force people into buying pools for certain utilities may drive down the per-capita price for these goods (after all, insurance pools are basically voluntary socialisms).
I'm just a consequentialist before anything else, and I think the overheard of a government, mixed with the unavoidable incompetency that comes with large bureaucracies, makes the cons outweigh the pros. I could be wrong, but that's my opinion...tentatively.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:47:19

You could be right that a monopoly on force may be important in that it may be necessary. That is more or less the same claim that was made by (I believe) Madison in the Federalist Papers: "If men were angels, we wouldn't need government". The counterpoint: who then will run your government? Where do we find these angels? If the premise is that men are not angels, and we fear what they will do with power, then granting some men a monopoly on force is kind of the last thing you want to do. So whether or not men are angels is, at best, a red herring. 


But isn't putting someone in a cage or taking their life infringing on their rights? No doubt, there are times where putting someone in a cage or killing them is justified. The point I was trying to make is that, any time will are ok with a government putting someone in a cage, we would not be ok with a private citizen doing it. 
For example, Michael Huemer, a political philosopher summed up the problem of political authority with the following allegory:


problem. Vandals roam the village, stealing and destroying people’s property. For whatever reason, no one seems to be doing anything about the problem. So one day, you and your family convene and decide to put a stop to it. You take your guns and go out looking for the vandals. Periodically, you catch one of them, take him back to your house at gunpoint, and proceed to lock him in the basement. You provide the vandals with food so they don’t starve, but you plan to keep them locked in the basement for a few years to teach them a lesson. 










The point of the story is *not* to determine whether or not such behavior is moral or useful. It's to suss out the point that our states do, in fact, work exactly like this. Yet, if I try to work in the same way, I am categorically a criminal. I am defined as such by the very institution that acted this way first. 
Is it just a first-mover advantage? If I am the first guy to use my might to control others, it's ok? Or is it that it's ok for me to do it as long as I have the power to enforce that it is ok for me to hold the monopoly on force and not you? 
Again, I am open to the idea that, from a consequentialist perspective, maybe we tolerate a state as the lesser of two evils. That is TBD. As of right now, I am skeptical if institutionalizing violence is the way to go. I could be wrong in that skepticism.
It would be nice, however, if we could call a spade a spade: If a government is necessary, then lets admit that some slavery is moral. Taxation is, categorically, theft and it is arguably slavery (in that you are forcing someone to work for you against their will for part of the year). Drafting young men to fight your wars is definitely slavery...probably the worst kind. 
Perhaps this is all necessary for the greater good. If so, let's stop pretending freedom is always good and slavery and theft are always bad. Let's just be honest about it. 
What do you think?

If you leave them on coinbase, you don't *really* own your coins.
It's true that user error is a big problem. If you don't own much (less than $100 worth maybe), then it's probably not a big deal to leave them in coinbase. 
But what if coinbase doesn't have the liquidity that it promises? This has happened to many exchanges before. Or what if they get hacked? Or some even just slightly sophicated phisher gets access to your account?
It's just generally not a good idea to leave them on coinbase. But do whatever you want. Not my coins (And as of right now, they aren't your's either)

See "the Laffer curve". Assuming no advances are made in terms of obfuscating one's Bitcoin hodlings, there is still such a thing as an optimal tax rate, wherein taxing more actually produces less federal income.   
So if a country adopts bitcoin as its national currency, then 
A) they can no longer issue debt as easily as they can now because the lender will not have the assurance that the borrowing government can 
B) print money at will.
With printing off the table and bond issuing seriously limited, all they have left is tax, as you say. However, they cannot just tax you at 98% because they will actually bring in less revenue than they could by taxing you at 50%. This is because every dollar they tax you is a dollar that cannot be invested in some future venture that will grow the economy and provide even more tax revenue in the future.

If true, I stand corrected. I have only ever heard him suggesting that income tax on the wealthy be increased.
It matters little to my larger point that the wealthy do pay more in taxes (in both absolute dollar amounts and percentages of gross income) than poorer people do. That is the essence of a prgressive income tax system. They may, however, choose to place some of those funds in tax advantaged accounts, but these accounts are technically available to anyone. It is true, however, that some do not have the expendable income to take advantage of these accounts...and for that they get the benefit of paying far less in taxes. 
But if it were up to me, the poor would pay no taxes at all. I am that nice. And many of the poorest do pay no taxes, at least in the US. 
...and neither would the rich.

@_date: 2017-12-14 00:29:33


That's funny; I was going to say the exact same thing about you, but assumed it would be patronizing. Seems you lack that kind of tact.


I used to think the exact same system would work, then I started to understand what a blockchain is better.
First off, who will mine these tokens to keep the network decentralized? How will they get paid? Because you can't give a reward, since these tokens are to represent real world assets, then you'd need to reward them with tokens that represent property in the real world. Where will this property come from? And the same could be said of a fee (if there is no block reward); These coins aren't fungible because they each represent different properties, so fees don't work unless the owner and the buyer of the token agree to grant the miner part ownership of the token (and thus part ownership of the property and thus part ownership in its income and part responsibility for its taxes).
Beyond this, you have the issue of enforcement. What if I sell you the token to my house but I refuse to move out? You are going to need to get the police involved to have me and all my stuff forcibly removed. In that case, you are now relying on a central authority, and once you rely on a central authority throughout any part of the process, you have defeated the purpose of a block chain. You might as well just have the police run a transparent, append-only database (which is possible). 
And even beyond that...how will you get society to accept a token system as a way to verify ownership. 
And even more beyond that, imagine the security risks associated with losing ones token. That is the only way this system could even begin to make sense (it is how bitcoin works). So imagine you lose your private key to your home; you don't own your home anymore - the guy that stole it does. Maybe you are willing to accept that. Maybe you will say that there will be a service that will protect your coin title. If the latter, then its the same as keeping your coins on coinbase. 
So no, I think it is you who doesn't understand what a blockchain is and, more importantly, when it is useful, or perhaps you just haven't thought your system all the way through. 
I agree that there is a ton of inefficiency in the home selling and title transfer industry, but those inefficiencies have been solvable with traditional tech for decades now. It is the powers that be who prevent those improvements from happening. It is a huge leap to go from that to "...and blockchain will fix this". 
This is just another case of the "blockchain" buzzword being used to describe business as usual. It's just marketing to make it look like innovation.

While I am certainly not a fan of the banks, try to remember that these are centralized entities that are on the hook if they wrongly give your 400k to the wrong person. The flipside to looking at all of this is, if it were trivially easy to move out 400k from your bank account, it would be a lot easier for an identity thief to do it as well.
Maybe you are more careful about that stuff than the average person, and sure there is KYC/AML bullshit that gunks up the works, but at the end of the day there is a guy you don't know that has to make the call to release the money and his job is on the line if he fucks it up. He is, in all likelihood, trying to do his or her best to protect your money from being stolen via fraud. 
It's not an ideal system and that's what bitcoin is for, but give the world time to adapt. It's going to be like this for awhile. 
And like another poster mentioned, don't just spring this on your bank. That raises lots of red flags. Let your personal banker know ahead of time what to expect, and it'll go a lot smoother. If you don't have a personal banker, and you have the ability to move 400k or more at a time, I promise you will not have a hard time getting one.

Jon produces 50 apples a week but has to give 20 to the land owner. Sam produces 500 apples and has to give 300 of his apples to the land owner. Jon complains that he has to give nearly half his product to the land owner, and thinks that even though same gives more than half of his apples to the land owner, Jon also wants some other benefits for free. Since Sam still has more units of apples after taxes than Jon, Sam should be taxed **even more**. Sam, understandably, doesn't think this is fair.

Add to this the complete lack of consultation with the natives. It *may* be true that you coudl have seceded; I don't know. I find it doubtful. You probably could have moved west and tried to make it on your own, but the land you owned in the colonies was almost certainly to be forfeit to the jurisdiction of the new government. 


1. It just isn't true that I can move *anywhere* I want. There is a list of places I can and cannot move. 
2. I do not know how easy it is to abdicate my citizenship (especially cost free)
3. Point 2 is ultimately a red herring, imo. I own my property, yet the government insists it has jurisdiction, despite my lack of consent (again, see the allegory from Heumor -that is how it works). I do not think this is dissimilar to victim-blaming. Imagine a woman minding her own business in her home, and a rapist breaks into her house and has his way with her. When the woman complains and tries to seek justice, the authorities tell her "You know there is an awful lot of rape here. If you don't like it, you are free to move". I don't think anyone's intuitions really swing that way. The rapist had no right to be there in the first place. It is not on the woman to live in a neighborhood with no rape. It is on the rest of the society not to rape her.

First, dont keep your coins on coinbase unless they just arent worth very much. At the very least, download a wallet on your phone and transfer there (mycelium on android and breadwallet on ios are fine). If you have a little more money, order a ledger nano s or a trezor hardware wallet and store your coins there. 
The US doesnt have many fiat exchanges (exchanges that take dollars). I think that will change soon, but for now, use gdax as their fees are cheaper than coinbase, however they do not take credit cards. If I am trying to buy RIGHT NOW, I still use coinbase and accept the 3% fee or I do a debit on my checking account to lock in my price. Those fees are a small price to pay to get in sooner rather than later.

Let me bring this full circle:
Jon produces 50 apples a week but has to give 20 to the government who owns no land and, thus, has no right to these apples in the first place. Sam produces 500 apples and has to give 300 of his apples to the government. Jon complains that he has to give nearly half his product to the government, and thinks that even though Sam gives more than half of his apples to the government, Jon also wants some other benefits for free. Since Sam still has more units of apples after taxes than Jon, Jon thinks Sam should be taxed even more. Sam, understandably, doesn't think this is fair. Because there is a party calling themselves 'government' and usurping apples from innocent actors, they have created an incentive for infighting between the bystanders Jon and Sam. 
Jon and Sam should both be pissed that such a party exists in the first place, but Jon is unlikely to complain, given that he is an on-net tax consumer instead of an on-net tax producer. Jon is happy there is a party available to get their hands dirty on his behalf - he gets the benefits without accumulating any of the psychic pain of violently coercing wealth out of someone who is clearly more efficient than he is. 
To confront this, Sam decides "if you can't beat em, join em", so he starts to become friends with the government, currying favor with them through gifts of apples. The members of the government realize that they can individually get more for themselves by treating certain types of investment differently from a tax perspective, which favors Sam. This offset in income for the government is made up for through individual payments to the legislators after they have left office (they are long term greedy). So while Sam used to pay tax in the sum of 300 apples, he now has the option to invest 150 of them every month in a tax preferred investment vehicle that artificially siphons money into stocks and bonds. Jon is now, understandably, angry because he doesn't have the expendable income to participate.
This friction further creates enmity between Jon and Sam who now must compete for control of the club that is causing the friction in the first place. One seeks to increase his take home. The other seeks to increase his socialized benefits.

You do realize that the base layer of literally any coin out there is still incredibly anti-user-friendly at the moment. Are you saying that Lightning won't scale because it is hard to use? Do you know how hard it was to use the internet 20 years ago? I've run my own lightning node since almost the beginning of mainnet (I believe we were the third e-commerce site to accept lightning transactions but that's hard to prove). That wasn't long ago, and already it is orders of magnitude easier to send and receive lightning txs than it was then. Casa Hodl is already selling a device that is a node with front end software out of the box. In fact, I have never seen bitcoin innovation happen so quickly in all the time I've been a part of this scene. What is staggering to me is that people still think these altcoins have anything to offer the market besides broken promises and pipe dreams, and these are sold to people who can't really tell you what a blockchain is. 
Thinking your defense of alts is misguided is not anti-free market; were you under the impression that a free market means no one can criticize your ideas? The free market is the ability for you to tell whoever wants to listen that altcoins are awesome, allows you to go squander your money on them, and then hold the bag when they go to zero and deliver on none of their promises. The free market is our ability to laugh at you when that happens and tell you "I told you so", then take you in and say "It's ok...you didn't know but now you do. Let us show you what real progress looks like" 
Of course, others should be free to start whatever competing projects they want. And once one of those projects is able to actually compete with Bitcoin, I'll move to that one

You may be reading that assumption into my post but I neither stated that nor even meant to imply it. 
I just happen to believe that states are, by definition, the institutionalization of exploitation. So if you want to create a society where exploitation can be practiced on a very grand scale not possible otherwise, forming a state is a great way to do that, and I think history vindicates me on this point. Countries like the US and Canada are really exceptional in how little exploitation actually goes on compared to what it can be (think Iraq under Saddam or Syria under Assad). That's largely thanks to Democracy and a culture of limited government. 
That is certainly not to say that there was no exploitation until governments were created. Governments just make exploitation much easier to achieve on an industrial scale by giving one group of people a monopoly on force. Force will always be a problem though.

@_date: 2017-12-07 03:58:06
Oh don't get me wrong, I more or less agree with you here.
The point I am making is that there really is no ethical argument for government to stand on. Governments do act in ways that if a commoner acted in the same way in the same situation, it would be considered criminal and the commoner has received no less consent than the government ultimately has. In some cases, he has more. I just want to move the conversation away from saying that governments are more on traditional values of morality. They are actually antithetical to traditional values of morality - they often lie, they have to steal, and they have to murder and take slaves to function. 
I think a more productive conversation is to debate about whether the moral and financial overhead of sustaining a government is worth the benefits, which means we really do need to re-evaluate our stance on thievery and slavery as sins we have zero-tolerance for. 
Most people will relent on murder and thievery if you push their intuitions enough. For example, you give them scenarios like "Your family will die of starvation if you don't steal a loaf of bread. Is it wrong to steal the bread?" or "A man has raped your daughter and you know he did it. The jury just acquitted him on a technicality because the police obtained crucial evidence illegally. Is it ok for you to kill him?"
Most people will admit they *may* think these actions are morally justified, if not ideal. However, if you ask them if it is ever ok to take slaves, they will tell you no. But then if you ask them if it is ok to conscript men to fight in a war started by their government, they will say yes (or a great many will). What is the difference? I'd argue there isn't much of one. The same goes for central banks printing money or your counterfeiting money. Its the same thing. Or the government taxing you vs a mafia extorting you for protection money. It's the same thing. Perhaps in each case though, one is necessary and one isn't. Let's talk about that.

I think the interesting focal point that anarcho-capitalism exposes, if nothing else, is that it's only when others (either individuals or groups) start to behave like states (initiating force against peaceful people) that we begin to label them as criminal. 
Now, it could be the case that no matter what, someone IS going to act this way, so better to accept that and try to lay some ground rules for that force of nature by writing a constitution or something. I am open to that being the case, but I dont find it especially compelling. But that really is the ultimate question from a consequentialist perspective: is government worth all of the obvious bullshit it brings? And I ask that with the acknowledgement that it very well could be.

None of you understand what inflation and deflation is if you think it is about how many bitcoin or dollars are being minted. The only thing that makes a currency inflationary is: does a unit buy fewer goods than it did yesterday? If the general trend is yes, it's inflationary. If no, it's deflationary. You could pump a million bitcoins a day into existence and as long as each bitcoin is still increasing in purchasing power, it is deflationary. 
People often confuse this because the rate of minting is so highly correlated and very often causal of changes in purchasing power.

Oh, did you know you only need the first 4 letters of each word which means you only need 96 spaces for a 24 word seed? 
If you look at the BIP39 word list, you'll notice no two words share the same first 4 letters. Most modern wallets will start filling the word in for you after 3 letters. So if you have a 24 word seed, you only need one device. 
And actually if your second device isn't full, it risks warping in the fire. The tiles help reinforce the skeleton, so if you didn't fill the remaining slots with blanks, the seed is actually less safe. 
I'd recommend moving the entire seed to one device ASAP regardless of whether it's on of ours or a cryptosteel. DM me if you have questions.

Sounds like you are just looking to make fast cash though, which is fine. The problem is, its very difficult to tell which coins are going to moon and which are going to dump.

@_date: 2018-06-22 00:43:24
yes, which is why many, including have advocated destroying any tokens that sit in an old OP_CHECKSIG address via a soft fork. Or...a soft forked could be implemented to update all addresses to OP_LAMPORT protection. 
If the former were chosen, presumably everyone would have some amount of time to move their coins to a new address, but very few would have to afaik  since so few in-use addresses are OP_CHECKSIG. 
I don't think this is a very big threat, unless someone comes up with a way to do this in secret and in a short amount of time. We'd probably never know because everyone would just assume Satoshi had moved the coins.

I mean, technically, you could argue that dollars are extremely volatile to bitcoins. "Can you believe how volatile the dollar is? It just loses 10% of it's value in a single day!" That's actually true when you compare it to bitcoins. 
But I see what you mean. The only reason we say that the dollar is more stable than bitcoin is because goods are priced in dollars and dollars lose their value relative to bitcoin at about the same rate as other currencies. This encourages more hodling and creates a liquidity trap which makes pricing in bitcoin basically impossible. 
Not sure how to solve this.

Well it's 5% inflation once there are 21 million coins. But right, ther there is around 16. So it's more like 6.5% 
and %6.5 inflation hitting the market all at once isn't nothing. 
But it's not just the inflation. It's the psychology of knowing the inflation is coming. As soon as a single satoshi even moved from that address, the market would likely panic sell, creating a feedback effect of inflation far beyond a mere 5%. Bitcoin could easily flash crash to 0, as the dump would trigger a cascade of standing sell orders people set up as stop losses. This could make his coins worthless. I am not saying it would stay at zero. A lot of us with standing buy orders on the exchanges would instantly own thousands of bitcoin and become extremely wealthy (a good reason to set up buy orders of 1 bitcoin at 1 penny). This happened recently on gdax for eth. Since then, I've set up these buys just to take advantage of that occasion.

Or this post is just a bunch of wishful thinking. 
Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's going to "crash" anytime soon. And what people call a crash in bitcoin is never called a crash anywhere else. For instance, when bitcoin is up $3k in a month and it drops to only being up $1,500 over a month, people call that a crash. That's insane, especially when it recovers and then goes even higher a week later. 
But it isn't FUD to warn people who are new to bitcoin (and there are a lot of them): don't expect parabolic growth forever. Prepare yourself emotionally for the inevitable 40% correction that will almost certainly happen *at some point*. Maybe that happens after 10k. Maybe 100k. Maybe tomorrow. Just be realistic in that it probably will once all the dumb money is all in and the smart money whales who were never in for the long haul bails just to buy the dip and increase their position again. 


There is nothing so foolish as thinking the past isn't a predictor of future behavior. If it weren't, then there would be no reason to believe that bitcoin will continue to climb. But my bet is, you don't see your own selective usage of past performance to predict future performance. 
Quite honestly, I think it's pretty shameful that you treat people who issue these kinds of warnings as some sort of traitors to bitcoin "I can't believe people in r/bitcoin, of all people, dare to question the almighty bitcoin!". We aren't sitting here calling you a pumper.

I really feel like you guys just aren't considering the ramifications here. 
Right now, the market at large more or less assumes these coins are never moving. They are frozen because the key is either missing or the person who controlled the key (likely satoshi) is dead. This assumption is priced in.
If a single satoshi moves, it means that it is possible there will be a 6% influx of coins on the market. This will freak people out. Satoshi wouldn;t even need to sell a single satoshi for this to happen. Merely moving one breaks the assumption and causes a sever reaction.

Perhaps I am wrong, but if your family has the expendable income to buy a "stack" of bitcoins (not sure how many that is, but I am assuming 3 or more), then I doubt they are financially uninformed.

The fact that you would go "all in" on any stock (even one with a long history of making profit and issuing dividends, which Tesla does not have or do) tells me you don't know much about trading. It makes sense, then, that you are not really in a position to make wise valuations about the health of the company and you are buying into the hype. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:00:46
Well, if *you* are so confident in your position, then perhaps you wouldn't mind putting your money where your mouth is.
If Bitcoin's current price level is so undervalued, then here's a deal: I will sell you every Bitcoin I own for $13,600 per coin. Since the current price levels are so sustainable, and if a catastrophic crash is so unbelievable, $13,600 per coin should amount to an outrageous gain for you.
If you honestly believe your position, then take the deal. If, however, you are all bluster and no substance, then you will make excuses. You will try to weasel out, or say that you never meant crash crash.
The offer is on the table. If you're man enough to take it, let me know.
But in either case, you have been quite the entertaining troll.
Obviously, you won't take that deal for the same reason I won't take yours: why buy my bitcoins for $13,600 when you can buy them for $7,300, and why would I sell you mine for $1,000 when I can sell them for $7,300. So your offer proves nothing except your lack of maturity. 
Saying that bitcoin will not go up forever is not the same thing as saying it will not go up greatly in the near future.  You seem to have difficulty parsing the difference.

I'm not saying it won't correct, but keep this in mind. This was written by my dad's 67 year old friend who my brother and I got into bitcoin. He is a very accomplished and wealthy investor outside of the crypto space and he has very small holdings in bitcoin. I sent him a few articles on the idea that bitcoin may be a bubble. This was his response. 






We are not anywhere near that kind of mania yet. When your 67 year old bridge partner's wife starts buying bitcoin and everyone you know is trying to get it, that's when its time to maybe dump and wait for the BIG correction. 
In my world, I have a few friends who ask me about it (I'm 29), but there are still very few who are trying to get in. In fact, they all claim it's too expensive to get in right now (which is very un-bubble logic).

I think you guys are seriously misdiagnosing the situation here. Roger is a true believer. I think he really believes, not only that bitcoin will replace money, but that it needs to do it NOW, and the best way he thinks to achieve that is big blocks. 
He's not an engineer. He's not a technical guy. He just happened to be an early investor in bitcoin (taking a huge financial risk with a TON of his own money, I might add) because he really believed in teh project like a lot of us did back then (I wasn't nearly as early as Ver, but still fairly early) and still do.

@_date: 2017-11-27 02:46:16
Inflationary does not mean the supply is growing. it means each unit's value is decreasing over time. Its just that *usually* when a supply of a good is increasing it tends to lose value, but that's only if supply outpaces growth in demand. 
Common misconception and one that is understandable, but nonetheless incorrect. Bitcoin is definetely a deflationary asset and that will likely only be cemented once they can no longer be mined. 
Its also possible that bitcoins are being lost at a higher rate than they are being mined. I've even heard that as many as 20% of all mined coins are completely inaccessible due to lost keys + the 1 million coins satoshi has stashed and has not moved. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:16:48


Yes, I meant decreasing. Forgot we were talking about inflation instead of deflation. My point stands, however.  The existence of mining has nothing to do with it being inflationary or deflationary *per se*

Wrong. 
Firstly, many people do, in fact, make millions off of the stock market by analyzing past behavior: of both specific companies and the market at large. In fact, writing algorithms that trade with basically zero human input is a huge business, and most large trading firms use them.
The reason not everyone can make millions doing this is because: A) They don't have the engineering knowledge to build these algorithms. B) They don't have the capital to make them. and C) They don't have the technical knowledge to separate the wheat from the chaff in terms of knowing what variables are relevant and which are noise. 


Wrong again. 
In fact, there is an entire sub-discipline in statistics called the actuarial sciences that do exactly this and make the insurance business not only profitable, but one of the most lucrative in the world. I know; I used to work in insurance.

You aren't hearing me. It doesn't matter if Satoshi wouldn't attempt to liquidate all at once. You are assuming a rational market. Markets are not rational. It's game theory. I will panic sell merely because I know everyone else will panic sell - and BOOM - self-fulfilling prophecy. 
And Yes, it could *very* easily flash crash in this case. In fact, flash crashes happen with much less. Some whale comes in, does the math, and figures out that if he dumps X bitcoin, it will drop the price Y amount, which will trigger Z number of automated market sell orders totaling Q number of bitcoins...and on and on and on. That's how flash crashes happen. People let computers do their trading for them and they get fucked. Ask the fine people at GDAX who very generously bailed out all the morons who set up these sell orders for Ethereum a few months ago. 
I don't see how you think the possibility of a 6.5% supply dump wouldn't cause mass panic in the markets.

It's basically a mathematical certainty that at some point we will. 30% really isn't that much of a move for bitcoin and its hardly unprecedented. I wouldn't even call it rare. It probably does this once a quarter. Which is why, yes, you are right that it is incredibly dumb to do a double mortgage on your house to buy bitcoin (unless it bounces back at the same speed that it has lately). 
But I think you will need more like a &gt;75% pullback for people to get scared enough to pull out in a way thats even somewhat permanent. Most people in bitcoin already have an insanely high risk tolerance. I also think bitcoin tends to attract two kinds of investors because of it: the very good ones (who can stay in and not get emotional when things get rough) and the very uneducated ones who have never been burned (these probably haven't been trading anything very long). The latter of these are also likely the people taking the insane risks that you rightly worry about.    
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:09:24
Well actually, you are again making assumptions that are not only not true but also do not follow. 
I did not vote for trump because I did not vote for anyone because I don't vote. Had I voted, it would not have been for Trump and I have a long record of hating on him publicly (churchandstatepodcast.com).
You can also look back at my post history and find that I also have a long record of opposing BCash and S2X. 
So again, you aren't making real arguments...just leveling ad hominems *that don't even apply to me*. 
In fact, you are the problem. You are part of a growing crowd of people (on both the left and the right) that hears one sentence from someone they don't know and assumes it can understand all of the other opinions that person has. It's sort of the same fallacy you are committing in your original post (bitcoin stupidity = candidate stupidity).  No room for nuance; if I say anything good about Trump (or not even that; in my case, I fail to see a connection between Trump and bitcoin cash) then, in your mind, it must mean that I not only like Trump (despite my calling him the 'Clown King') but I am a supporter of bitcoin cash as well. 
I take your point that the same person could be duped by two different scammers (Trump and Ver/Jihan/etc), but this is such a general point that it's hardly enlightening. They are completely different disciplines of scam artistry - one technical and one social. In fact, there are very good and understandable reasons for a non-technical person to be duped by the BCH people. 
I don't know if you know much about car mechanics (I don't know much of anything in that discipline); however, if you are like me, it would be fairly easy to trick me into thinking you know a lot about engine mechanics when you actually don't. That doesn't make me stupid, it just means I don't have that specialization. Falling for Trump is really a different story entirely. 
Again...learn to argue better.        
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:06:39
Bitcoin has good fundamentals. Tesla does not. Nothing about Tesla's valuation makes any sense. It's hype. They are going to be out competed by larger companies with deeper pockets, they almost never meet their deadlines, they lose $6-700 million per quarter, they are about to lose the federal $7,500 per EV car subsidy, Elon uses Tesla to bail out his other failing businesses (Solar City) - and thus, himself, and they are constantly having to fund raise even when Musk has said on multiple occasions that they are definitely finished, thereby diluting earlier investors' shares. 
Musk is a consummate bullshit artist, and no one except a few see it. 
But maybe I am wrong. Maybe Tesla is the next bitcoin. But I'd really love to know, why is Tesla worth it's price when it has never made a dollar of profit in its over 12 years of existence?

I thought Perianne Boring gave good advice. The reason we have the massive dips is people who buy in to get rich, bail at the first sign of danger and then lose a ton of money because they don't have the staying power.
Hodling the dips is really easy for people who know the technological revolution that bitcoin is capable of. But if you do not have that knowledge or believe that, it makes it very difficult to stay in. And, ironically, its being able to stay that makes you money; not bailing when things get rough.

You people seem to forget that bitcoin can only become a viable currency by becoming a HELL of a lot more valuable first. There will only be 21,000,000 coins. For bitcoin to be used a currency, you need to stretch that supply out over hundreds of millions of people and have them be able to buy all kinds of goods with it. Right now, at the current value, there is simply not enough bitcoin supply to fulfill that function (even if there were no HODLers and everyone was using it to buy things). Once you can buy milk for a millionth of a bitcoin, then it can be used as a currency and then the price will stabilize. It has to be speculative now. Most of us are SPECULATING that the potential for bitcoin to be a world currency means that a coin WILL BE worth the equivalent of hundreds of thousands if not a million USD (in today's dollars). 
You can say we are wrong, and that bitcoin will never be used as a currency, but saying it can never be a currency because it isn't typically used as one now because it is a speculative asset is not true. It must be speculated on before it can be a currency.

Also, feature request: adding my buys for crypto is difficult because most are denominated in btc which means I need to go back and find out what the btc price was on that day and at that time and then do some calcs. Can you let me switch the value to btc then input a date and time and have the app fetch that data and make those calcs for me?

In the case of bitcoin, it's a falling safe. Sure, if you try to catch it, you'll hurt yourself a little, but you still have a safe full of money. Of course, it would be nicer to wait for it to land, then open it, but its very tough to know where it it will land.

The honest answer is: it depends.
Gold is far more profitable if you have the land rights to proven mining spots. Since those rights are hard to acquire and since finding a reliable mining location is so difficult, bitcoin is definitely more CONSISTENT money. You don't need to worry about not getting paid like you do with mining gold. 
It's really like comparing apples to oranges; some similarities, but not enough to matter in this case.

I thought Perianne Boring gave good advice. The reason we have the massive dips is people who buy in to get rich, bail at the first sign of danger and then lose a ton of money because they don't have the staying power.
Hodling the dips is really easy for people who know the technological revolution that bitcoin is capable of. But if you do not have that knowledge or believe that, it makes it very difficult to stay in. And, ironically, its being able to stay that makes you money; not bailing when things get rough.

Wouldn't your theory mean the math goes the other way. 
If 4% of wallets own 96% of the coin, but there is an avg of 5 wallets per person that owns bitcoin, then that 4% can be divided by 5, meaning .8% of the bitcoin owners own 96% of the bitcoin.
Maybe I am off.

I dont think you understand what inflation is. Bitcoin has inflation all the time. It had it today. Inflation is anytime there is a general increase in prices (in this case the price of USD) or a fall in the purchasing power (in this case, of bitcoin). It isn't just printing dollars. We call printing dollars inflation because printing dollars generally causes the purchasing power of dollars to go down (assuming there are not more goods or services produced to compensate for the increase in the money supply). But even by your definition, there is currently increases in the supply of bitcoin everyday. What do you think mining is?

Genuine question here: What is the worst case scenario if a fork occurs. Don't get me wrong, I am personally against the fork, but some of the FUD out there among anti-2Xers seems hyperbolic to me. For instance, calling this a government takeover of bitcoin (since a lot of the NYA signers must already comply with AML/KYC regs). 
It seems to me the worst case scenario is: 
Some people lose their BTC and/or 2X coins in replay attacks, thereby causing bad press for both chains and - perhaps - the 2x chain gets dubbed THE "bitcoin" instead of the legacy chain, which might cause new comers to go to the 2x chain instead of the legacy.
If that happens, sure, the corporate oligarchs might force compliance of KYC and AML on the chain, but only their 2x chain, right? They can't force that on the legacy as far as I understand. Which would create a pretty big incentive for any users who went with the 2x chain to switch back to the legacy. And it seems like node runners and miners will figure this out quickly if they haven't already. 
I just don't see how this destroys bitcoin. Seems more like a temporary division, given how little support the 2x cahin has from the users (aka the people that actually decide which chain lives and dies).
I supposed you could argue that users may have no choice if they are forced to buy coin from exchanges only running 2x, but there will be exchanges that wont.

Why do we value feeding a man? Why do we value being able to make pizzas? The problem with your explanation (and, I think, what is trying to explain) is that you can ask this question all the way down.
Why do we value feeding a man? Because life is worth continuing? Why is life worth continuing? Because it is better than dying. Why is it better than dying? I don't know...it just...is?
The moment people start believing that life is not worth living, they will stop valuing pizzas at all. Therefore, even the value of pizza (I know...crazy) is completely subjective. All value is ultimately subjective. And if you try to explain why some value is actually objective (that feeding a man is valuable), you are basing it on the assumption of some antecedent value being objective when it actually isn't.

Where do you think all of the bitcoin volume on the exchanges comes from? Clearly people have different ideas about what the right time to buy and sell is. Not everyone thinks a bitcoin today is worth more than a bitcoin tomorrow, or else there would be no volume on the exchanges to buy. This would increase the cost of bitcoin, and it would slowly put more and more pressure on hodlers to sell. Eventually it does. 
There is an awful lot of fear mongering about deflationary currencies with what are called liquidity traps. I don't find this a convincing argument, personally.

Are you familiar with the term 'inflow'? Just because the crypto market's overall market cap is 500+ billion does **not** mean that hundreds of billions of dollars have come into the space. In fact, this is the entire fear behind tether. If Tether magically produced $500,000,000 worth of imaginary value to inject in the crypto market, you could see a multiplier move the entire crypto market cap up disproportionately higher. 
For instance, if I am a whale, and I have $10,000,000 to blow on bitcoin, and I walk onto gdax and throw it all down, do you think the market cap of bitcoin will only go up by $10 mil? No, of course not. You might send the entire btc market cap up by 1 or 2% if you did that. This is why I ask if you are familiar with inflow and outflow. Do not confuse it with market cap; confusing the two makes it very easy to say, "Look, Tether is nothing compared to the overall market cap of crypto. It can't have that big of an effect". It definitely can. If $10 mil could send btc market cap up by 1 or 2%, imagine what half a billion of imaginary money could do to the market cap. 


This is **known**? Who *knows* this? I think you meant "It is theorized or suspected".

Why do you think that?


I dont think it matters much. The point is bitcoin satisfies all of the requirements of a currency, and in most way better than fiat does. 
As for the rest of your points, it seems like you could make the your ponzi case about any currency (only better). Ponzis aren't just funded by later investors. The initial investors have to believe that the profits they are taking are coming from actual performance (or be willing to take the risk they wont be the last investors if they know better). Bitcoin is, at worst, a keynesian beauty contest. There's no fraud there though. It's just value seeking value. That may be untenable, but it's certainly not a scam. There is no one cooking books or orchestrating a mass exit with all the money (except for the whales perhaps, but that's a little different). 
So, you've done an ok job of defending your point, but you still don't really understand what a ponzi scheme is. Just because an asset is rising in value because more people want it, doesn't make it a ponzi. That's just supply and demand, and as others have pointed out, there is an actual use case for bitcoin. Is gold a ponzi?
You may be right that we all end up losing our money on this, but I don't think it will be for the reasons you've outlined.
Fair point about he dividends though. Too many people view bitcoin as an investment. It's a speculation.  
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:35:31
but then you are just confirming my point: These speculators quite literally believe bitcoin will be worth less tomorrow (or in an hour or a week) than it is today (or right now), and so they sell it. That was my only point. And the harder and faster it increases in value, the more pressure there is to get rid of it before it corrects. So I stand by my point: if it really were the case that everyone just hordes it, there would be no way to buy it on the exchanges because no one would be selling.

This actually isnt even a good argument. He's essentially using the labor theory of value "You think bitcoin is worthless? But I spent all this money and electricity and computing power to mine the coin, therefore it's valuable". Truth is, bitcoin is not valuable because of those things. Bitcoin is valuable for the same reason that dollars are: people want them and will give up things to get them. It's just that bitcoins cant be made ad infinitum like dollars can. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:02:45
That's because your understanding of what a fork is (and sometimes is not) isn't complete. S2X chain does not use different UTXO format to sign transactions, which is what authorizes your release of the coins. Because of this, you can intend to only send S2X coins but because they are using the same UTXO signature, they can also send BTC coins as well. A fork just means there are conflicting protocol rules. If you don't have a different way to signature transactions using new UTXO format, then you can really fuck yourself.

Once I got to [this speech]( I said "Ok, there is no nuance here at all. I'm done." In fact, this was the speech where I got the anti-capitalist sense from. "Synthetic emotions! Fast Food! Open your eyes maaaaan! The Corporations! Advertisements are assault!"

@_date: 2017-10-04 00:10:36
really depends on the investor. Most people lost money in the stock market for the same reason they lose money in bitcoin - they have weak hands and sell on emotion as soon as things get dicey. If you have the discipline to throw money into the SP500 and not touch it, there is a chance that you *MIGHT* outperform the cash value returns on your whole life policy (that is, if it's issued by a mutual company as opposed to a public one). But SP500 returns aren't guaranteed either. They also aren't tax free. 
There is also a psychological element: 99% of people will not invest the difference. They will blow it. Some people will invest the difference. 79% of those will actually lose money when they invest it - see above. 
The truth is, most people shouldn't invest in the market. I am not saying these people shouldn't be allowed to. I make lots of money off the weak hands, both in bitcoin and the stock market. I am really libertarian when it comes to allowing people to make dumb decisions with their money. I am just saying, most people have no business investing from a discipline and knowledge perspective.

I'll ignore your snide tone and just address the points you made:


I assume your metric for measuring these things is in dollars, yes? If so, what is a dollar worth? How do you value a dollar? 
When I look up "Inherent value" on investopedia it defaults to "Intrinsic Value", and it defines it as such: 


Well there it is right there. It's still all about perception and intangibles. There is no *objective* value to anything. If it's all perception, it is not inherent. That is my entire point.

It's going to be viewed as just another way for dictatorial regimes to raise money when they go broke and skirt sanctions.  
You know why the government is accepting crypto? Because they wont take their own useless fiat! Guess what happens when they need money. They will stop accepting bitcoin and make everyone use shitcoin petro  Stop glorifying these clowns as heroes of crypto. It betrays your ignorance of the world.

I really really really thought this was bullshit, but after thinking and talking about it with a few other people, this is pretty bullish i think. 
No doubt, the "crypto" ruble is bullshit in so far as it is not actually a crypto currency and that it isn't decentralized, but it's still useful.
I'll quote the example my brother gave was as follows (see if you can poke holes):
"Japanese Bob wants to buy Russian bonds at 8% yield, as Japanese bonds pay -.5%.  Russia, understandably so, refuses to let it's bonds be denominated in anything other than Rubles."
"Current scenario - Bob sets up a Russian brokerage account (assuming he can't get his local brokerage to source the bonds due to trade sanctions) , Bob uses SWIFT, waits 3 or 4 days for it to clear, possibly routing through multiple countries. Bob then buys the bonds and holds. At some point he sells or they mature, he then has to reverse the whole thing."
"New scenario - Bob buys BTC (this could take some time for traditional funds to settle depending on method ). Bob creates an account and sends them to the Russian exchange, buys bit-rubles then buys the bonds, all on a blockchain so they settle instantly.  He then reverses the trades when he feels like it and either sells the BTC or keeps it."
You might ask why Russia doesn't just legalize the buying of bonds via BTC. The reason is that they don't want to denominate the bonds in BTC, so they have to take a ruble or a ruble equivalent. 
My next question was, why not just allow people to buy rubles with bitcoin. I don't actually know how difficult that would be, but the assumption was that perhaps it would be easier just to set up a new alt so the exchanges can easily integrate it. 
What do you think?

I am pretty annoyed with coinbase and with the others that plan on even potentially labeling S2X as bitcoin, however, I think anyone can say (even lawyers) if this is fraud or not (in the legal sense). This is such a new space. There is no precedent for anything like this. I don't think it's fraud personally. I Just think it's stupid.
And this impulse to sue them...it really is the antithesis of what bitcoin was created for - to circumvent the need for government. If you have to sue coinbase over this, then bitcoin has already failed. It would be one thing if you gave bitcoin money and they gave you nothing. It's quite another for them to define bitcoin in a way you disagree with, and you sue them over it. 
Even if you unknowinlgy bought 2X thinking it was BTC, well that's your own damn fault. Do you research.

Sort of like the argument "If you are against welfare, you must hate poor people" or "If you are against the war on drugs, then you must like drug usage" or "If you are pro-abortion, you must like murdering children."

yeah, I really cant see Nvidia just passing on this opportunity. I noted in another comment over in r/bitcoindiscussion that Nvidia is bigger, older, better name-recognition, more trust, more neutral in the space, has better supply chains and can attract better talent than bitmain ever could if they really wanted to get in on the action. 
I think they are probably just waiting to see if bitcoin is a fad before they sink a ton of capital into ASIC production. But, I think that time is coming to an end as it becomes more and more apparent that bitcoin is probably here to stay, nVidia is flush with cash, and they wont want to see this market go completely to Bitmain for being too conservative. 


if you got your news from [this article]( I think you misunderstood.  
The article is saying that bitmain is only 4 years old, whereas Nvidia is 24 years old. In 2017, bitmain made $4 bln in profit, whereas Nvidia made only $3 Billion. Bitmain has definitely not made more profit in the last 4 years than Nvidia has made in the last 24.

When people say bitcoin is not an investment, they are using the traditional definition for the word "investment" seen in the finance world, meaning "something into which you put money in the hopes of creating cash flow". Bitcoins do not produce cash flow. Most stocks do in the form of dividends. Basically, it means you can take money out of the investment without reducing your position. "Investments" (using it now in the common parlance) that do not produce cash flow are not generally called as investments; they are called "speculations" (another term that means something different in the finance world than it does to the layman). You make money from a speculation by buying a unit of some commodity in the hopes that it value will go up. You make money from an investment by buying a unit of some commodity in the hopes that it value will go up and by taking money in the form of a payment from a dividend. 
Good rule of thumb: 
Can I take value out without reducing the size (the number of units) in my position? If yes, it's an investment. If no, its a speculation. 
Stocks, part ownership in a private business: investment
bitcoin, gold, silver: speculation 
There might be a case to be made that coins like neo are an investment because they produce gas coins from your stake, thereby allowing you to sell the gas without reducing your position in neo, effectively producing cash flow.

yes, though bitcoin takes up more of my attention and money these days. I put ~80% of my investment income into bitcoin, and the other 20% in traditional stocks and bonds. That's merely by virtue of the returns I am getting. I believe bitcoin has a very bright future, and I am still young so I can afford to take the risk (up to a point, adding bitcoin to my portfolio actually decreases risk). The 20% is a hedge in case it doesn't have a bright future.

This, in my experience, is very true. When i got into trading stocks, I knew very little about finance, so I only traded what I was passionate about. I only traded video game, software, and computer components manufacturers. Its nothing compared to my bitcoin returns, but my stock portfolio averages 35% a year, and I credit this not to my trading prowess, but my deep knowledge of the industries I trade in. Because i love them, I seek out people in those industries and become friends with, and learn about what's going on before the news does. It gives me a very serious asymetric advantage over other investors in those spaces. I still pick losers sometimes, but my winners are so good, they make up for it.

Yes, that term is 'inflation'. Sure, it isn't necessarily the case that if a government prints money the cost of goods will increase, but it usually is on along enough timeline. Are you doubting this? If any complaint should be made about the graphic, it's that wages (in terms of absolute dollar amounts) have increased somewhat to account for this inflation so it isn't completely fair. 


You couldn't be more wrong on this. On July 8th, 2017, Bitcoin was $2,579. Bitcoin is up almost 200% year to date. It just seems way down because it is waaay down from December of 2017.

At this point, yes. The future value is not certain and we are still def in price discovery mode (and I imagine we will be for quite some time)


Technically true, but it's also a pedantic point to make.Thus far, the only use case of value to be demonstrated for blockchains have been tied to virtual currency (and really only bitcoin). Blockchains are totally boring and worthless tech outside that use case (and bitcoin is by far the most likely to succeed). Would you mind providing a use case to blockchains that isn't tied to a currency (not a utility token) like bitcoin?


What do you think venture capitalists do? How do you think they make their money? By investing only in companies that cash positive and proven (and thus already very expensive to buy)?


Actually, if Bitcoin can ever become a true medium of exchange, the volatility in the short term needs to ramp up a lot more. The price for a single coin needs to be much much higher. As of now, there isn't enough bitcoin to go around for it to be used as a medium of exchange at current prices. While its tough to put an exact dollar value on it (in today's dollars, of course), I would say a satoshi needs to be roughly equivalent to 1 penny if Bitcoin were to be used worldwide as a currency...but I am generalizing greatly. It could be way more or way less. It mostly depends on how many people are using it as such. The whole world? A country with a population the size of the United States?

"Dont buy a car. Buy bitcoin"
"Dont buy bananas. Buy bitcoin"
"Dont by an air conditioning unit. Buy bitcoin"
Same logic. 
Just because something decreases in value over time (almost everything), doesn't mean it's not worth buying over the asset that will (likely) increase over time. Sometimes you need the benefits of something now rather than later. Should no one buy any cell phone ever? Just buy bitcoin instead every time? 
Finally, what if bitcoin goes to zero? It could happen. Man, I'll be glad I bought that phone instead, won't I? Your argument makes no sense to people who are already very invested in bitcoin and who don't foolishly go "all in" on one asset. It's horrible risk management, and risk management is how you become fabulously wealthy.

Sorry if I mischaracterized your position. It is my experience that people who use the exact phrase "Capitalism is exploitation for profit" tend to be true believers in the dictatorship of the proletariat. I shouldn't have made that assumption.
However, I take exception to calling Socialism a "boogeyman". It is, in fact, a pretty bad way to organize your society and the empirical evidence to back this is overwhelming, imo. I could be convinced otherwise. 
Genuine question: what alternatives do you advocate? And it would probably help if we came to an agreement on definitions of capitalism and socialism (or at least acknowledge what the other person means exactly when they use those words).

I decided this interview was something worth fact checking on, so I compiled a list of some of the claims Roger made during the show and I've posted them below along with my analysis and research.  
**"I have never publicly said that Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto."** ***TRUE***
So far, this seems to be technically true. I can't find any source where he makes the claim that Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto. The best I could come up with is this tweet linking to a removed youtube video: 
**"It is true that I was arrested for selling firecrackers online."** ***PARTIALLY TRUE/PARTIALLY FALSE***
Of course, no one is disputing that he was arrested and served time (not even Ver denies this), but is it true that it was just fire-crackers. According to wikipedia and the arrest record, mixed accounts - it depends on how you are defining "explosive" and "firecracker": 


**"[as of Feb 8th, 2018,] Bitcoin Cash has performed better than Bitcoin core over the past month, 3 months, and 6 months."**  ***FALSE on two points***
False for both 1 and 6 month performance (and that is including today's BCH pump directly before he went on, so I am being generous including that):
* 1 month: BTC: -44.709%, BCH: -47.75% Best performance: BTC
* 3 month: BTC: +10.4452, BCH: +99.3701% Best performance: BCH
* 6 month: BTC: +138.5462%, BCH: +95.9735% Best performance: BTC
**"The president of the Bilderberg group is the lead investor in Blockstream"** ***SOMEWHAT TRUE***
Ver is referring to Henri de Castries, who is the current chairman of the Bilderberg group and who was the chief executive and chairman of Axa (one of the world’s biggest insurers, along with other financial interests, such as the venture capital fund AXA Strategic Ventures).
It is true that AXA Strategic Ventures did invest in blockstream, and it is also true that de Castries was CEO of AXA (AXA Strategic Ventures' parent company) at the time. However, he is no longer CEO or chairman of AXA. It's perfectly reasonable that Ver is not aware that de Castries stepped down from that position and is no longer affiliated with AXA, and so made this claim on old information that *was* true as of September of 2017, I believe. 
That being said, Castries was the CEO of AXA, which is the parent company for AXA Strategic Ventures, which is the firm that actually made the investment. To me, its a bit of a stretch to go from "The current chair of Bilderberg also happens to be the CEO of a very large insurance company that owns another company that invests in tech firms, one of which is block stream" to "The chairman of Bilderberg is the lead investor in Blockstream".
You will have to decide for yourself if Ver's claim lacks some context to be desired, but it's not completely wrong, so I am giving this a "somewhat true" rating. 
* 
* 
* 
**"Bitcoin cash is capable of scaling on chain and taking on the entire world right now with fast, cheap, and reliable transactions for everyone."** ***FALSE - but more input requested***
I don't think it takes much to point out how absurd it would be to claim that 6 billion people could transact on the BCH blockchain right now and it still be "fast, cheap, and reliable". Notice he also leaved out the "secure", but I'll be charitable and assume that is part of reliability.
If you can think of any other claims that he made worth fact checking or feel I have mischaracterized his claims or feel my responses are inaccurate/not fair, please leave a comment saying so.  
@_date: 2018-02-17 07:46:47
You need to tell us if you have the BTC you sent or if they are holding onto it until you tell them. That is going to have a decent sway over what you should do.
If you already have the coins, I would tell them nothing. They will probably close your account, but no big deal. You probably shouldn't use them in the future anyway.

Hi the offer is a 1 to 1 trade of your core coins for my 2x coins, through an atomic swap though I'm still researching how to set that up. Apparently it's not easy which is why I'm trying to find a taker first. Happy to verify my ownership of the coins (~2) if someone agrees to the trade. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:56:50
agree to disagree. I think you'd have a very difficult time in court proving that coinbase is committing any sort of fraud, especially since they are telling you publicly what they plan on doing. 
Imagine an automotive oil manufacturer splits into two companies because it was owned by 2 brothers and they disagree about the direction of the company. They both use the same name for their oil, and neither agrees to use a new one. They both insist they are the real deal. It's now basically up to the market to differentiate them. You now have brand A and Brand B. Brand A is identical to the oil produced by the company before the split. Your mechanic publicly states he intends to start using brand B, as brand b has offered him special discounts if he does. You hear this announcement, and then, when the mechanic starts using brand B, you threaten to sue him for fraud. After all, he has historically used brand A formula.

I think he is referring to flash crashes. Is there a way to catch that. yes there is. You just need to go onto gdax, deposit some money, and create some market orders at low prices. These are called stink bids. I have about $100 set to buy bitcoin if it ever dips to $10 a coin, and I have a bunch of penny bids on eth (it had a flash crash a few months ago that brought the price down to one cent so it does happen, and you can make millions if it does). You do tie up money doing this though.

Please don't listen to his comment on whole life insurance. I no longer sell, so I don't have a dog in this fight any more, but I can tell you, whole life insurance is, for most people and up to a certain death benefit amount, a very good decision. 
I can't tell you how many times I'd come try to write new term policies for people in their 60's cuz their 20 year terms were up and now they are uninsurable bc of health issues, meaning their families won't get shit when they die. 
Add to this the fact that after a long enough time, the insurance can literally pay its own premium, giving you free insurance and a line of credit to yourself. It's a concept called "Being your own banker". 
The money is also tax-free
It's not for everyone. No insurance instrument is. But whole life is def not a scam and it has its place as does term (covering temporary needs in case of death). 
Rant over.

An increasingly large number of people in retirement age have not paid off their homes. My father is one of them. This would effectively force my mother out of their house. Most people do not want to put their spouse in that situation, even if it wouldn't be catastrophic financially speaking. 
Additionally, social security is becoming less and less reliable to replace income, especially if you are below the age of 45 currently. 
I'd also note that, while buying term and investing the difference *MIGHT* make sense on paper, almost no one will do this, and even those that do, will not outperform the returns that a whole life policy *from a mutual company* will give. In fact, most people lose money when they invest in the stock market (mostly because they do not have the discipline to overcome their emotions when trading - not too different from all the weak hands in bitcoin). 
But you and I aren't fundamentally disagreeing. Like I said, it isn't for everyone. 
But it is just also true that if you buy whole life early enough in your life, it is far cheaper than term insurance over the course of you pre-60's life, and it never runs out, so if you get a non-insurable disease in your 40's you aren't completely fucked. 
The best advice for most people (especially those with a family), in my opinion, is to buy a decently sized whole life policy (about 10 times your annual salary) in your early 20's and then supplement that with term insurance throughout the rest of your life, perhaps adding more whole life as your salary increases.

It definitely is. If your tribe is doing X and you think doing X is wrong, you are creating discord in your tribe. Let's say your tribe is burying babies in post holes in order to appease the gods (as the Aztecs and Incas used to do). You see this practice, and think "well this is obviously confused behavior because God is a myth most likely, and, either way, we shouldn't be worshiping something that makes us kill our babies". However, you are chiefly concerned with promoting unity, and so you smartly choose not to raise a fuss about the baby killing. Do you think you can promote unity here and also speak your peace about the baby murder? I don't think you can. 
But maybe I misunderstand your position. I've always thought of nationalism as "I stand with my country, right or wrong." Is that not your meaning?


I doubt that his much to do with economics, except that american blue-collar workers are extremely entitled (they think they should be guaranteed a job when foreign workers are willing to work for less and do a better job). I think our economic situation could be better explained by understanding the role of the fed and our poor education system. However, I share your concern about immigrants who refuse to assimilate. This is especially true of Muslim immigrants. But the reason they don't assimilate is the same root problem that nationalism (tribalism) has. They believe stupid things about the nature of reality (that covering up women is a good thing, that Muhammad was a great leader with intense moral clarity, that apostates should be murdered) and they are completely closed off to any criticism of these ideas because they are dogma "My religion; right or wrong". Nationalism (as I understand its meaning) and Religion are just tribalism - here's how we do things and if you don't like it, we are going to be intolerant of you. 
We should be tolerant of everything except intolerance.
What is your goal with your nationalism? What would that look like in practice? Deporting all the non-whites or just voluntarily living with one's own race? Genuine question...not leading anywhere. I would actually really like to know.

admittedly, it is a bit of a marketing term, and certainly subjective. It is "One and only" in the sense that it is different from cryptosteel, but i see your point. I'll talk to my partner about changing it for the sake of clarity. 


Per the terms of the license, we do attribute them in the disclaimer section at the bottom, and we do not ever deny that we are licensing the design of the unit from them when asked publicly. 


There is clearly room in this market for both of us (and most likely others - anyone is free to do what we did, and apparently others have). We wanted to create an alternative to the cryptosteel that is more affordable and easier to use without sacrificing any build quality, and I think we've done that (and added value - outlined above). Ultimately, the market will decide. 
For those interested, I know of at least one guy working on a comparison review of ours to CS. He mentioned it on twitter [here]( if you'd like to follow up. Frankly, I think our product is just better (but I'm biased). Competition is good for a market anyway.

That logic tho...

var btcSystem;
var otherSystems;
if (bitcoin == mathematical &amp;&amp; Woz == mathematician &amp;&amp; btcNum == 21,000,000) {
     btcSystem &gt; otherSystems
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:49:21
It looks similar because we are licensing it from Cryptosteel, who placed the design under a creative commons license. 


We have no association with cryptosteel beyond using their license. We have differentiated ourselves in the following ways: 
1. Our product is made out of 316 steel which has a much higher tolerance against corrosion. 
2. Our product can take all key and seed types. With cryptosteel, they have tons of different configurations that make it confusing for new people. If you want the cryptosteel that handles all key and seed types, you'll need to shell out $200. The vast majority of people will use a mnemonic. Cryptosteel charges $100 for that one. Ours is $79.95.
3. We have adjusted the design of the tile tray to reduce the risk that tiles become mixed up in transit.
4. Our build quality is better than cryptosteel. 
5. Our tiles our lazer engraved instead of stamped, which means they dont warp and thus are much easier to install (and easier to read).  
6. If you don't like our product, we will refund you 125% and that is not a typo. We will pay you 25% more than what you paid for wasting your time with a product you don't like.
7. We accept lightning payments - and if they fail, we will still send you the product.

Would you accept "3. We have adjusted the design of the tile tray to reduce the risk that tiles become mixed up in transit."?
Would that be more fair in your opinion? I accept that you did not have this issue, but many of us had and its why we changed that part of the design. I agree I may have been overly dramtic on cryptosteel in my wording for 3 above.

We have changed it to be extra charitable and make sure there is no false advertising, even unintentionally. Although, my brother reminded me that the reason we initially chose to call it that was because, unlike cryptosteel, we have only one model to cover all key and seed types (we did this intentionally so new users wouldn't be confused when buying).

Of the many cryptosteels my brother and I have purchased in the past, the tiles rarely stay in their compartment during transit. That's **not** to say this is always the case; your mileage may vary. However, this [review from feb 2017]( confirms our experience as well as many others: "Honestly, the card was pretty useless as my tiles were all jumbled up by the time I received it." It used to be [even worse]( but I think they have improved the design a bit.
 


The way the tile tray is organized is absolutely the same (meaning, the way the letters are laid out). There are, however, some big differences when it comes to the user experience of the packaging. Unfortunately, these changes are not shown in the pictures on our site (happy to provide a pic). Unlike cryptosteel, we do not use shrink wrap to secure the tiles in place during shipment (we tried it, and it didn't work). Instead, we use a strong adhesive over the tray, and you punch holes using the perforations, creating little doors, so to speak. It's still not perfect from a UX standpoint, and we are improving the design still, but the tiles will definitely not be mixed up in transit with our product. 


We are trying *very* hard not to lie or misrepresent anything. That's why we have been very upfront here about our use of cryptosteel's license. Competition is good for the market and cryptosteel is free to ape our design improvements *which do not even fall under the license* if they want to. We have no proprietary right to them. We saw improvements could easily be made and so we made them.

False equivalence. I'm not telling him not to buy 40k of BTC. I'm telling him not to tell the whole world he owns it when he doesn't have to and doing so provides no benefit (and could provide harm) except for his ego.

Almost the entire crypto market is people falling for internet scams, ponzis, and story after story of lost keys, phished keys, and broken 2 factor.

No, it's actually you who doesn't understand all the risk surfaces. 
A. It's not obvious he bought off an exchange (though likely). However the state actors are not the primary threat I'm concerned with. 
B. It doesn't matter how good your encryption is. I've been in the space a long time and have friends a lot richer than I am. I personally know guys who hold their funds on HD wallets and it didn't matter when he woke up with a gun to his head asking him for a million dollars in BTC. 
C. It's 40k now. What will that be worth in 5 years. 
D. It's much easier to steal 40k in cryptocurrencies than it is to steal 40k in cash. 
E. Are you familiar with social engineering, like phishing scams? I don't think you really know what hacking ACTUALLY is.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:44:17
You don't understand the risk vectors. The best encryption in the world won't matter when he wakes up with a gun to his face (something that happened to a friend of a friend to the tune of $1 million in BTC). And now he's blown all plausible deniability he could have had with a 25th word protection on his HD wallet (assuming he has an HD wallet and has that setup in the first place). 20 min of OSINT and I feel confident  I know who op is in the real world. With a little more effort I could probably get an address and I'm not even a pro. 
On top of all this, we don't really know what sort of vulnerabilities are ultimately in these hd wallets.  We found one on the ledger (albeit small) and got paid the bounty. Ledger is constantly updating these but someone nefarious could find it an exploit it. 
You have to also imagine what kind of risks this presents in 10 years if a Bitcoin is worth a million dollars. There's just no upside to posting this  except for some "attaboy"s in the comments.  It's just horrible opsec.

Depends on how you set up the multisig. If you control 2 of the 3 keys (or 2 of the 2) then all they have to do is beat you up until you give it to them. If you don't have enough keys to unlock the funds then yes, they can't get to them, but neither can you, which sort of takes away from the whole idea of being your own bank. Multisig is great for escrow, and I suppose you could have a setup like green address but that doesn't protect you from $5 wrench attacks.

You don't know what country he lives in and you don't know what that country's policies on Bitcoin will look like in 10 years if/when those 10 BTC aren't worth 40k but $10,000,000. He's a huge honey pot.

@_date: 2018-12-06 05:48:32


There are actually ways to protect against that even, such as using a hardware key instead of regular mobile 2FA. But even that won't hep you in a $5 wrench attack. As long as the attacker can find out where you live, he can beat you until you open it the wallet for him. This has been my whole point. Bitcoin hodlers are especially susceptible to this kind of attack.  


He probably won't be targeted now. But again, what about in 10 years if bitcoin is worth far more? This post will still exist. And this is just the crypto we know he bought recently. If he is dropping 40k on bitcoin in one go, the odds are decent there is more. 
I guess my question is: do you think posting about how much bitcoin you own on reddit is good operational security? You may end up being right that he'll be OK. Hell, in all likelihood he will be OK. That doesn't make it smart. If I walk across a street with historically low traffic, blindfolded and with ear plugs on, I'll probably be ok, but why would I do that? Maybe I'll get some high fives for being a daredevil. This seems like about the same thing. The only upside to posting this is to get some "attaboys" in the comments. Far be it from me to tell you what your risk preferences should be. Maybe you are THAT insecure that the high fives you get in return for risking bodily harm and loss of funds (however unlikely) is worth it. Just don't be surprised if someone sees an easy payday some day in the future. Most people are absolutely horrible at hiding their identity online. OP is case in point. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:52:46
You've basically listed all the reasons why 40k in a bank account is much more secure against a $5 wrench attack than Bitcoin on a hardware wallet is. On top of this, you can probably get the cash back if you lose it this way. 
It's not an indictment against Bitcoin. It's just that a centralized system of Fiat currency does still have advantages over BTC in terms of user stupidity (such as telling everyone how much you own). You know the whole "not your keys, not your coins" thing? Yeah, that's another example of user stupidity.
