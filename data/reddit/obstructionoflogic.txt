No it's not saying that. It's talking about low effort FUD.

@_date: 2018-01-09 15:43:48

The funny part is that censorship on a sub (whether it exists or not) and coin technology are two COMPLETELY unrelated topics. They just use this a marketing tool to propel their shitcoin. The best part is that it works on some people, but there will always be stupid people to fall for propaganda.

His marketing technique is tricking people into his shitcoin. It's a shitty marketing technique but it might not be illegal. It's like Adibas© or Mike©.

This has to be a troll post

OK thanks, I guess it's possible but it depends on your power source. I have 2.5A and never run into any power problems.

Using an old wd passport and no problem like that. Where did you hear this?

If you copy it from a pc, make sure you enable txindex first

That's enough of a reason for me not to invest then lol

This is the only wallet I will ever use. The guys who run are also awesome.

Are you on Android? Eclair is coming in a few days.  Obviously only experiment with very small amounts.

I would say the best thing to do as a newbie is to familiarise yourself with the API and get comfortable with console commands. Start here:  (run as `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo`)and check all other commands. Good luck! 
PS: `tail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log` is a fun command too that shows realtime logs. Stop it with CTRL+C

This is *must* for every true btc/lnd fan.
