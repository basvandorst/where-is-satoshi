This will not be easy, one argument I can think of for companies that the contest will create visibility for them. For owners of bitcoins I can imagine that developing a better sales pitch, will lead to increased bitcoin adoption.

It looks like the exported private keys in MultiBit do not contain the incoming addresses where the bitcoins are stored. Anyone can fill in the best way to backup/restore your multibit wallet ?

Thanks for your suggestion on creating receiving addresses in bulk before backing up the wallet. Really great to see the original developer of MultiBit active in this forum helping me out.

Great project!
IMHO one feature would greatly enhance useability. Adding a web-based QR scanner to the Bitcoin address input fields.
If that QR scanner works on Android / IOS / Firefox / ... - even better !

Understand your customer, I completely agree. Having a good baseline as a generic sales pitch, will allow everyone to adjust the story to their environment. I think the goal should be to create a pitch that appeals to people that are not using Bitocin today. That's about 6 billion people.

I would like to point out that PayPal is a subsidiary of eBay. Communication at this level is planned carefully and is to strenghten the position of the company.
If PayPal is recognizing Bitcoin's value, it means that eBay is at least agreeing with this communication. It might even mean the 2 companies are planning something in this direction.
