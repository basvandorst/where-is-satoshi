@_date: 2019-07-17 22:02:56
this changed my entire investment strategy
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:54:33

@_date: 2019-07-17 22:03:45

wish we never got rid of the message functionality, and wtf if we can send to IP I'm sure we can figure out a replacement for bitcoin addresses. Like, why we can't use a decentralized ledger to sign a message that essentially attaches a unique name to an address is beyond me..

underrated comment of the day/decade... its really weird... we're definitely in the bizarro timeline...
@_date: 2019-07-03 12:11:29
well if you read the article it does say that he owns bitcoin and other coins, its billy bambrough though, so he's a bit of a tool still
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:55:22
who the hell is Asuka and why does this have any merit
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:09:59
get outta here with that wack shit. its a fucking market, people can trade how they want.
if bitcoin isn't strong enough to handle a few shorts than we got some serious issues
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:32:39
sorry but no one cares.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:39:15

totally different for many reasons
@_date: 2019-10-08 16:19:26
@_date: 2019-08-26 21:14:53
actually yes
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:23:01
naw he definitely existed I met him at a btc conference in Texas once
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:48:20
only way they can corrupt btc is getting access to satoshi's stash by straw hatting Craig Wright and tanking the market

I have a seed from a very old version of electrum, has not too much in it but how do I go about redeeming it safely?
Download the new version? Use the same version as it was created? Am I at risk?
@_date: 2019-12-28 02:39:44
this guy.. "travels"...
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:06:23
yea like wtf... he's gonna call you? that's the only legitimate reason for a phone number. The non legitimate could be 2fa spoofing etc etc
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:47:47
@_date: 2019-05-18 23:35:24
yea this is his ultimate gift of burning 1m coins, I think he was smart enough to do the math and determine that he would mine approx 1m coins before other miners jumped on board enough to secure it, making the supply effectively 20m coins
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:33:20
its not real dummy. read the thread its a photoshop 
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:22:56
TD, you need to call the RSP Investing line, and ask for International Trades. I am holding almost my entire RSP in this, I know it works. proof: 
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:41:05
then how did wright steal his 1.1 million coins?
So Satoshi has 1 million, and Kleiman also has 1.1 million?
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:16:19
This is a completely ridiculous post. There is no partnership in the works... They are simply using the cars built in web browser and visiting Binance.com...
for fuck sakes, this is journalism? I do this all the time in my Tesla car's browser... 
THIS JUST IN: APPLE, AND MICROSOFT, AND LINUX, AND ANDROID AND EVERYTHING WITH A BROWSER IS PARTNERING WITH BINANCE!
@_date: 2019-05-01 00:19:30
so Klienman's estate apparently had 1.1million bitcoins, and now wright has them? what does that even mean?
Klienman is satoshi?
@_date: 2019-05-05 04:05:13
YOU CAN. Call your bank and ask for international trades department. Then you can buy COINXBT on the Swedish NasDaq. They refer to it as Bitcoin Tracker One. It is valued in Swedish Krona, but they will do the exchange from CAD to SEK for you. The share structure is 200 shares for each Bitcoin, so in other words if you purchase 10 shares you own 10/200th's of a BTC. Every 200 shares you own is 1BTC.
I hold pretty much my entire RSP in it, which isn't much anyways, but I'm not able to use it for like another 40 years so what the hell you know? Maybe BTC will moon by then.
Also, they will have to do it from a "Bloomberg Terminal" so if they can't find the ticker you can ask them to look it up on a Bloomberg Terminal

I refuse to use segwit. I can pay a little extra on the fee, who cares. I'm not hurting anyone.
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:16:11
that would be epic
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:34:00
ugh, your math and comprehension sucks, because as far as reality is concerned, 70 million is 0.1% of 70 billion. dumbass.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:08:17
your reading comprehension skills are terrible. it says 200 000 - not 20 000, and 1000 + 1000 = 2 000.. lol

@_date: 2019-05-13 22:32:07
already exists.
