I think bitcoin will continue to increase in value but will give way to an alt as the no.1 currency and become "digital gold" as it has been described by some.
The alt market is tied to btc so if it tanks they do too, similar to how the USD was tied to actual gold. 
Given its historical ground-breaking significance I think it will always be valuable but as a commodity.

I wish she would've given a small explanation of what she is talking about before jumping into these analogies - If I was an average dude this would have confused the crap out of me

*some people want to make more lanes*
*But we're building a teleporter!!*

* Bitcoin can hit $7,941 and eventually trade higher
I love how these reputable financial institutions pull super specific figures out of their assholes to make it seem like they know what they're talking about
