well... if you wanna get *really* technical, all cars are fueled by the sun. Oil is just chemical storage of solar energy from millions of years ago.

Doesn't matter cuz GPU bitcoin mining is dead anyway. Mine altcoins if you wanna make more than you spend on electricity.

Really? YOU'RE the reason the environment is getting increasingly hostile towards bitcoin. It is pathetic, terrible, dishonest, and just fucking horrible exchanges like yours that are holding cryptocurrencies back. You're creating uncertainty and distrust in the market. I hope you feel ashamed of yourselves.


dont fucking lie to me. if you had a "heavy heart" you wouldnt close down your business to many of your customers. I hope you know that i have motivated at least 3 people to use your exchange because i was pleased with the services you provided me. but now, i am going to ask all of them to not use your exchange for anything, and everyone else i know will know NOT to use your exchange.


Read above statement. That is if you are capable of reading.


Really? you're just gonna throw every united states customer onto the ground, then rub dirt in our faces like that? You are the worst kind of people.


Oh dont worry, you wont have to thank me for my support, because you will never see it again.
