I posted earlier in this thread about lightning and I was called an idiot by some angry greedy noob who must have lost all his money buying at 19K ... 
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:35:14
much lower than that and the miner incentive disappears :)
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:24:38
Apparently he does ... also, most people have never heard of Lightning nor are they familiar with some of the innovation happening on the many feature branches of bitcoin core.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:26:54
What's your problem mate? did you mortgage your house to buy Bitcoin at 19K? Did you sign-up on reddit with your throwaway because you find it cathartic to shit other people off with your mainstream "insights" and panic? You've got an agenda, why don't you fuck off.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:33:08
me too, I bought a Bitseed V3 full node last week, this shit works
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:46:53
At what price does it become unprofitable to mine it? there is your answer, I believe it is about 7K USD.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:25:26
mine's shipping in 4 weeks... have to wait :(
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:39:19
umm wot.

You should have applied the DCA principle, a wise move for any investment no matter how speculative.

Because Chinese gov hates freedom.

No one in the wider media talks about Lightning, they just talk about bubbles and bitcoin ... Lightning is a transformative technology and its incredible exciting

He's saving fucking face after 200,000 people demanded his fucking resignation. They're not banning shit if they want to keep their jobs, you're a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:38:58
so many 1 week accounts in here right now; boo-hoo you bought above 15K, invested everything you had, and now you've come here for a whinge and you're going to kill yourself - no one held a gun against your head and told you to do that you greedy dipshits.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:28:30
LAMBOS!! lol

BTC is just responding to liquidity pressures between banks and centralised exchanges because of regulators in some countries, things will look much better in a week or two. It’s still a bull market

People love to hear stories about how investors got Zhou Tonged ...

Hi Lightcoin, just wanted to let you know that someone recently made an group on reddit if you feel like contributing to it in future
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:35:34
wouldn't that affect the miner incentive? I thought it costs 7K USD to produce one bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:54:58
and not for the reasons you think ... he likely regrets it because everyone asks him about his "Bitcoin is a fraud" statement, and he's probably sick and tired of responding to this same question he gets asked over and over.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:54:24
Lightning is coming ...

Dude, the miners are moving to Vietnam and Canada. SK is not exiting, the government is evaluating what it wants to do legislation wise with exchanges and use, push back from the public was massive in SK. If you want to see FUD, go look in the mirror.
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:01:20
Depends when you bought in, if you purchased btc earlier last year and haven’t at least got your principle investment out with a little profit into fiat it’s sensible to do so. I certainly don’t see risk mitigation as stupid in this scenario.

Do you like to eat peasant food, like a greasy sloppy cheese burger which will give you coronary heart disease in 10 years?
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:49:05
So what you’re saying is you’re a greedy investor that bought high? Perhaps try dollar cost averaging next time with your millions?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:05:11
I according to "Mr quadratic fibunachi" at the top of this discussion, that's somewhere at 100-150 USD lol.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:33:22
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:17:49
Same here, I highly recommend everyone to do this if you’re profitable. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:02:20
It's bubbles all the way up
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:31:57
Up to you?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:03:12
this comment should be at the top.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:10:48
yeah, my comment strongly indicated I thought your analysis made heaps of sense ...
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:53:06
JP Morgan comments are not causing the dip in the price.
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:03:47
So eventually miners get all the bitcoins? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:00:14
LOL did you sacrifice a goat inside a pentagram to get this insight as well?
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:20:13
Nope, if you trade one crypto for another you’re disposing of an asset; every trade is subject to capital gains and loss, as the case may be.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:18:03
funny, I was thinking the same thing about you.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:19:54

Ooh looks like someone is salty from losing money ... boohoo
If I sold now I would still have 200K of pure profit.
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:22:13
Of course it looks familiar, the human brain is great at pattern matching. If you look at the last 6 months to a year we could be in the Takeoff phase or the first sell off .... I'm really not clear on how you can conclude that this is the blow off phase as implied by your post? I honestly think it's quite meaningless. You're only attaching meaning to it because you see a pattern that it somehow matches, this is akin to spotting an image of Jesus on a piece of burned toast. Time series views of market prices have a fractal nature, the same patterns repeat themselves at a variety of time scales.
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:55:23
Ethereum price is being greatly driven by the DAOs that are built on it, when some of these startups start going belly-up within a year then the bubble will pop.
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:54:19
It's bullruns all the way down ...
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:43:38
lol, really? It's more likely to go back to nothing because of UASF, Jihan Wu, no consensus, decaying market share, the dev team, and big fucking egos.
