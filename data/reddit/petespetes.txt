They don't use the "same difference".  I believe in most cases they increase/decrease in constant decibel intervals, meaning they use a log scale.  There's no definitive quantitative unit of measurement for "volume".  Volume, perceived loudness, or whatever you want to call it is subjective.

Stocks and stock indexes are generally (correctly) graphed on log scales as well, especially for longer timeframes.

I'd like to see someone explain intelligently why bitcoin's performance when it had a market cap of &lt;$2M is at all relevant today.
@_date: 2014-08-25 05:51:35
In general, yes, they do.  Much closer to exponential than linear, at least.
@_date: 2014-08-25 07:35:21
This is one of the scariest things about bitcoin... half (or the majority even) of its proponents don't understand the most basic concepts in finance.  
  
[Here's a log graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average]( since inception showing that returns have very clearly been exponential.  Obviously there's some noise but claiming that they're closer to linear is just absurd.

Except he calls the yellow part "Average Price", which it most certainly is not.
@_date: 2014-08-21 08:01:28
Ahhh, the old "I learned a big word but I don't actually know what it means"

Right, OP is either completely misunderstanding how VAT works or just scaremongering.

I think the purpose of the ATMs is to make money.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:33:34
Even if it's not harder to receive, Bitcoin is a whole lot harder to spend.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:34:35
The Bitcoin ATM will undoubtedly give you even shittier exchange rates.  Then you have to change it back.
@_date: 2014-08-25 05:48:20
Stocks grow exponentially though.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:31:58
I guarantee you the fees of using a bitcoin ATM will be bigger than sending money in more traditional ways for anything but very small transactions.
@_date: 2014-08-25 20:48:08
LOL.  The DJIA is an index made up of 30 companies.  It can't have exponential returns if the companies only have linear returns.
  
But here's a challenge for you: show me that this index has had exponential returns while the companies it is made up of have all had linear returns, and I'll send you 10BTC.
  
Also note that the company itself doesn't have to grow exponentially forever to maintain exponential returns.  If a company doesn't grow at all and pays out a constant 5% annual dividend, your return is still exponential.  (If you can't see why, consider what happens when you reinvest the dividend in the stock.)

No, this assumes that the fair value increases almost 10x every year. It's a pipe dream.
@_date: 2014-09-05 07:01:37
if bitcoin drops to zero, it's not going to hit them hard.  losing $100 isn't a big deal.
@_date: 2015-04-20 12:35:09
You're still paying 100+VAT in the VAT country and receiving 100 in Spain. There's no scam here. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 09:44:06
Zerowing reference? 
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:06:30
this is all irrelevant until the value of the bitcoin stabilizes.
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:53:36
How bad are the fees?  I keep reading about this ATM but I haven't seen the fees explained anywhere.  I'm guessing it takes at least 3%, which makes it pretty useless for anything except exchanging small amounts of bitcoin for cash when needed.
@_date: 2013-09-02 03:51:15
So this is a fancy way of saying bitcoin is close to an all-time high, but it's not because it was even higher for two weeks in April.
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:40:43
so you lied a bunch
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:35:48
there's no privacy in this day and age.
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:42:07
bitcoin isn't a payment system.  it's a currency.  there's no reason a bitcoin credit card or payment system with all of visa's and paypal's features couldn't exist.
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:29:11
hence a 200% premium
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:33:27
I'd love to see a new reliable Canadian bitcoin exchange open up.  Unfortunately I don't think a company that's only willing to spend a few hundred bucks on security is going to accomplish that.
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:55:47
you're paying a 200% premium if you pay via bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:44:20
paypal requires taking a minute to punch in your credit card information.  bitcoin requires about 7 hours to figure out how to create a wallet and another 2 weeks to fund it.  it's quite delusional to think paypal doesn't currently win in the "fast way" category.

nice try, coinbase
