You open a channel to the network, then you have cheap transactions, and when you need to settle up, you close. Closing the channel goes to the miners, and it attracts a fee. The idea is that you would settle about as often as you would open a bank account.

Here's a simple perl script to simulate:
    perl -MYAML -E '$INIT=1000; 
    sub fn{$i=$INIT; 
    for(0..1_000_000) { 
        $i+=rand(2)-1;  
        $i&lt;0 and return "broke";
          commented out. does nothing.
        int($i*100)==$INIT*100 and return "even";
    } return "endless"} 
    for(1..10000) { $report{fn()}++ }; 
    say Dump \%report'
It takes about one minute to simulate 10000 games. The player bets 1 btc each round, and wins between -1 and +1 btc each round. A game has a maximum of 1 million rounds. "Breaking even" means hitting his starting money, accurate to two decimal places.
The results are:
Starting with 10 btc (bets 10% of worth each round)  
broke even: 37%  
gambler broke: 62%  
No resolution: 1%  
Starting with 100 btc   (bets 1% of worth each round)   
broke even: 84%  
gambler broke: 14%  
No resolution: 2%  
Starting with 1000 btc   (bets 0.1% of worth each round)  
broke even: 95%  
gambler broke: 1%  
No resolution: 4%  
So if the gambler bets less than 1% of his wealth each bet, and two decimal places is close enough, he will break even far more often than he will go broke.

3600 btc is roughly 0.03% of the total, so you would *expect* the price to drop by 0.03%. Given that volatility is more like 2% each day, it's impossible to say whether it did that or not, there's just too much noise.

Good questions
1. Worst case would be a flaw in the cryptography. All the coins could be stolen. There are other scenarios which are also bad and more likely, such as a 51% attack, mining collapse, or new regulation.
2. MtGox was the longest running exchange, and was therefore seen by many as the most reliable. When it went bankrupt it was a blow to the image of Bitcoin.
3. This is the easiest one: MtGox was an exchange for swapping fiat money for Bitcoin. It's not the Bitcoin part that needs trust, it's the fiat part. A distributed trustless exchange is possible, but it can only work for exchanging cryptocurrency with other cryptocurrency.

* verify identity

You may have read about the risk of *brainwallets*. These are particularly risky, because the encrypted version of your password is available to everyone. In fact, someone may have cracked it before you even thought of it. A 29 character password which is truly random (machine generated, [humans are bad at entropy]( should be reasonably safe for a few years.
If you're talking about a password on a wallet on your pc or on your phone, then cracking it requires that someone get a copy of your wallet first. Depending on how careful you are with your computer, getting your wallet could be hard, or very hard, and then the attacker would need to start cracking your password.

This seems to be the crux of the matter. Outcome A is breaking even, and outcome B is going broke. You won't accept any argument that "A will happen" - despite it's demonstrated increasing probability - because "only B ends the game".
Fine! It seems a contorted way to win an argument, but I will concede.  Outcome A does not force the player to stop gambling. Agreed. I propose the following correction to the title: "If you bet for long enough, you will break even (and if you keep playing beyond this, you will go broke, starve, go insane, run out of electricity, get RSI, or meet some other horrible fate where you **really** cannot continue)".

* You use US Dollars for taxes, bills and daily costs.
* You don't have a passport and don't speak another language.
* You don't have family or friends in other countries.
So quite possibly Bitcoin is not useful **for you**, but that doesn't mean it's the same for everyone. 
Furthermore, as long as it *is* useful for someone, and it's not effectively banned, it's use will grow. As long as that continues, it's value will increase. If Bitcoin's value is increasing and fiat money is decreasing, Bitcoin has a further benefit, further attraction, and further growth will ensue.

My feeling is they would have no or very little advantage.

There are two ways to answer this: "what problems could Bitcoin have?"
1. Mining Centralization
2. Energy Waste
3. Block size
4. Volatility
5. Wealth distribution
6. Transaction speed
And "what problems could Bitcoin cause?"
1. Increased online crime
2. Government impotence
All of these are complex and multifaceted issues, some involving ideologies. Any one of them is worth a dozen posts. This is just my personal ranking, based on likelihood x impact.

For the financial part of the transaction, but not for the delivery of goods/services. Since Bitcoin also doesn't allow chargebacks and escrow is a hassle, the reputation of the merchant is a very useful indicator whether you're getting your moneys worth.

Taobao Marketplace (simplified Chinese: 淘宝网; traditional Chinese: 淘寶網; pinyin: Táobǎo Wǎng) is a website for online shopping in Chinese language, similar to eBay and Amazon,[2] operated in the People's Republic of China by Alibaba Group.
Founded by Alibaba Group in May 10, 2003, Taobao Marketplace facilitates consumer-to-consumer (C2C) retail by providing a platform for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs to open online retail stores that mainly cater to consumers in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.[3]
With around 760 million product listings as of March 2013, Taobao Marketplace is one of the world’s **top 20 most visited websites** according to Alexa.[4] For the year ended March 31, 2013, the combined gross merchandise volume (GMV) of Taobao Marketplace and Tmall.com exceeded 1 trillion yuan.[5]

Most wallets won't let you attempt to double-spend, so until the 0-fee transaction is confirmed, the coins are in limbo. They are not delivered, and they are not in your wallet. Eventually your wallet will recognise that the transaction failed, and your wallet will show them as spendable again. That's when they've "bounced back"

Satoshi's wealth is estimated based on early mining on the blockchain, which shows coins minted but never moved. To still have control over those coins, he must have the private keys somewhere. While you *can* insure bitcoins (eg,  with "vault of satoshi" - backed by Lloyd's), you must move them to do this, so that rules that out. While it *is* possible that he has some personal protection, he must have paid for this without using his fortune, and it would be hard for him to protect himself from someone in his employ, as long as he has those private keys stashed somewhere.

I can see you're getting pretty excited here, which suggests you have your own emotional involvement with Bitcoin. See? Anyone can play armchair psychologist.
1. An exchange is not a Bitcoin market, it's a Bitcoin **and Fiat**.
2. Mt Gox hasn't been the largest Bitcoin exchange for six months.
3. There is nothing contradictory in saying "The Bitcoin protocol is very secure" and "owning Bitcoins is high risk".
Your emotional involvement and ego will make it difficult you accede any point, and you will try to rationalise your argument or change your position. If you are intellectually honest, you will accept these points and reexamine whether your *conclusion* has any merits. If you're still certain that it does, share your reasons.

Regression to the mean will always push you *away* from the extremes of zero or double your money. Yes, once you get to zero, you lose, and the same is not true of doubling your money, but both these outcomes become *less* likely the more times you play. I'm not arguing that there is a *guarantee* of breaking even, and I don't think is either, it's just the most likely result.

Hmm, your first paragraph seems to contradict your second. Are bitcoins worth $5 or $650 to you? Is it $5 subconsciously and $650 consciously? If you used your weighted buy price instead of your first buy price, the value would probably be negative, which would demonstrate the folly of using either. Market price, with a risk factor, is probably the most sensible.
I've made a small profit myself, and I also get the feeling that Bitcoin money feels different to other money, on account of it not being the result of hard work. I think it stems from a differential between my wealth and the social recognition I would have if I'd earned money through years of work.  On the one hand, I don't want to accept that wealth is just the result of being in the right place at the right time, but on the other hand, I don't want to take undue risk with my savings, just because it's "magic internet money".

The question of security will depend on the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem at the time. If there is another SHA-256 coin that is profitable to mine when Bitcoin halves, then there is more danger of some of the hardware being used to attack Bitcoin.

If that's the impression you got, you were using Reddit wrong. 
If you use Reddit to look for opinions that support your own preconceptions, you *will* find them. It's like rule 34, whatever crazy thing you believe, you will find someone on Reddit telling you it's true. This is also true in a wider sense.
However, if you look for someone contradicting your opinions, you will learn a lot more. Try sorting comments/submissions by "controversial", checking out the "new" posts, or listening to the "trolls". 
Here's an example; on January 7th the Bitcoin price fell 18% on the news that Taobao ("China's Ebay") would ban Bitcoin products.

Bitcoin is volatile, but it's still increasing in value at about 8% per week. Given that the Ukrainian Hryvnia has been *losing* value at about the same rate this year, buying bitcoins seems like a good idea.
I agree with , it's not my money, and Ukrainians should make their own decisions. But those who have a strong stable currency often don't realise that they're in the minority. And as long as Bitcoin is desirable to people in Ukraine (Venezuela, China, Palestine, Turkey and other countries with currency controls), it's going to keep growing in use, growing in value, and gradually stealing value away from USD, EUR and GBP

Two points I haven't seen anywhere else in the thread:
1. Economic theory tells us that inflation increases money velocity which stimulates economic growth. But is economic growth really *an end in itself*? The link between mass consumerism and environmental degradation is clear - perhaps decreased economic growth would be more sustainable?
2. Crypto-currencies are all opt-in, so they need to be attractive to *each* participant to spread. Inflationary crypto can gain value if adoption outpaces supply (like dogecoin did in January), but when it reaches saturation in its target market (and Nascar viewers isn't a new market), it will inevitably drop in value. Deflationary currencies are much more attractive to people whose own national currency is unstable. When the advantage for new adopters is intrinsic, holders of the currency don't need to engage in endless aggressive promotion to maintain their wealth.

Most likely because of the costs they have processing the donations. They don't have that minimum when they're collecting with a tin on the street.
For charities like Amnesty, the real advantage for Bitcoin is the borderless nature. Their focus is on exactly the countries with oppressive regimes where it's hard to get money in and out. Bitcoin isn't just a good way to send them money, it's a good way for them to transfer money inside their organization.

I think a useful answer would be if we could say "a mobile wallet has a 0.01% chance of being hacked per year, an online wallet is 0.05% a hardware wallet 0.001%, and cold storage 0.00001%"
Unfortunately we don't have this data, so we can't say that. It depends how good your understanding of computer security is anyway.

I created a simulation (array of 34 zeros, set a random four of them to one, repeat until they are all one) and ran it 1,000,000 times and got an average of ... 34 transactions on a compromised computer until the key card is 100% cracked (by a tool very specifically designed for this wallet). 50% of security cards would be cracked after 31 transactions on a compromised computer, and there's a 0.11% chance a card will be cracked after just 16 transactions on a compromised computer.
Interestingly, the card will sometimes ask you to decode the same letter twice, which means it takes slightly longer for an attacker to get the full code, but this also increases the chance of launching a successful attack when only 95% of the card is known.
I wish I were better at probability and could have just done the math. 
**TL;DR:** for maximum security, discard your Ledger Wallet after 12 transactions.

The scenarios range from the collapse of Bitcoin to a rapid price increase. On the one hand, miners will be losing 49% of their reward for mining, so many of them may stop mining, causing the network to become insecure. On the other hand, the supply of new bitcoins will suddenly halve, and if the demand remains constant, the price should double.
The block reward has halved once already (Dec 2012), and there was a price boom shortly afterwards. Other cryptocurrency coins have halved much more frequently without sudden changes in value.
@_date: 2017-02-20 04:31:01
I can see what they're trying to do there. I don't know much C, and I don't know if you have a style doc, which would obviate the annoying  whitespace changes - but changing a constants name from "MAX" to "OLD_MAX" is a good change (given the assumptions in their different goals).
Calling it "BLOCKSTREAM_CORE_MAX" is an unnecessarily political appeal to  conspiracy theories, but it doesn't change the size of the commit and doesn't really obfuscate the meaning. I'd be more concerned about the BU_MAX. Either way, who is going to care about "BU" in ten years? 
Maybe I'm missing something else, but I'm not seeing that as a convincing example of bad coding practices.  Thanks for the response anyway.

The polar opposite rhetoric hides the fact that more and more uses of bitcoin are being priced out, and the trend shows no signs of reversing. It's not a binary choice, it's a gradual trend.  When i started using bitcoin four years ago, it was suitable for gambling and tipping. Now it's no longer good for coffee or small donations. Gradually bigger and bigger purchases are going to be priced out. At some critical point, it could become too expensive for drug sales. By then it will be to late, an altcoin will take the crown.

It seems obvious, but it gets more complicated when the borrower is a government and that government is gone - the Greeks voted it out last year. These loans will take at least 15 years to repay. Greeks who  are only five years old now will still be repaying these loans in 2030. They are inheriting a debt for mistakes made before they were even born.
But it's obvious, you have to repay your debts! You just have to!
Haiti is broke because they've been repaying damages to French warships destroyed when Haiti won their independence in 1804. Where does it stop? Germany is repaying the Catholic Church reparations from 1803. Alsatians are excused, because Alsace was handed over to France after WWI. Turkish immigrants to Germany have to pay their share. How does any of this repayment make sense?
You have to repay your debts! 
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:02:21




*Should have paid* sounds exactly like debt. It sounds like involuntary debt in this example. The crime reduction is a *non-excludable* benefit of the lighting. In case you're not familiar with the term, it means you can't prevent someone from taking advantage of the benefit, so it inevitably leads to some free-loading. Maybe you want to call it a "gift", but in economics, it's more commonly known as the "free rider problem"




Yes, I've been talking about debt inheritance the whole time. I used the phrase "inheriting a debt" in my first comment. It's my main argument that our understanding of *debt* is at the core of the Greek problem, not governments. If you take the governments out of the equation, you still run into the same problems. 
The example of the Sudanese child was meant to help emphasise how much debt we are born with - how much we have to be thankful for. Everything we get for free at birth - public order, medical knowledge, shelter and food - was the result of someone investing more than they got back some time before we were born.






You're only talking about inheriting assets. I'm trying to get you to think about inheriting debt.
Some pieces of infrastructure, such as a dam, a highway or a space station, have such a high initial cost, that they are not profitable for a lifetime. Many of them are never profitable, but have ongoing costs (for example, an early nuclear power station, which requires ongoing security and waste containment). 
We face two options; **one**: never build things that cannot be paid for by the individuals who voluntarily contribute to them **two**: force the future residents to pay the ongoing costs of this infrastructure, whether they be immigrants or children of the former residents. Even if the infrastructure becomes obsolescent before it has repaid it's cost, as happened to many defensive fortifications throughout the centuries, it will impose costs on someone in the future.
Empire-builders throughout history believed in *two*.


sounds like government to me, but then I never said that was a bad thing.

Have you read it? I searched the book for "debt", and I didn't find anything relevant to this discussion.  The most relevant passage I found at a glance was:


questions, except that we should “wait and see” what the working
of the marketplace churns up.
And that only discusses *excludable* usage of infrastructure. Is non-excludable usage mentioned? How I should repay the builders, if a road which I don't use increases my property value? What is my debt if lighting the streets reduces crime? By being born, I have already benefited from healthcare and public order. Must I repay that? What about a Sudanese child whose mother dies in childbirth and never knows his father? Is he born with less debt than I?




Because some people have children and some infrastructure is built to last for multiple generations. Also, see chapter 8, immigration


How would it work if a population needs to renegotiate a garbage disposal contract? *Everyone* needs to completely informed? That would make such negotiations very costly! What if the contract implicitly involves unborn children in a non-financial way, for example by burying waste? Greek insolvency has closed the garbage collection in parts of Athens and is forcing residents to burn rubbish on the streets, creating pollution which will last for years. Who pays the price for that?

I don't have a fundamental problem with government being able to influence behaviour with financial incentives. The alternative seems to be the coercion by use of force. So I'm worried that widespread bitcoin adoption could actually lead to a more repressive society. 
I also don't believe individuals usually make good decisions, even when they act as markets, they tend to be lazy and fall back on emotion. Obviously current forms of government also make many bad calls, but I think increased transparency could go a long way to fixing things. 
I'm partial to Cass Sunstein's "paternalistic libertarianism" which guarantees a certain level of freedom, but uses "nudges" to make certain default options more attractive and more likely to choose a decision in society's long term interest. I don't think many libertarians here would even see that as libertarianism, because it skews free markets. 
I also think the threat of recession because of lack of lending incentives in a bitcoin dominated economy is too quickly dismissed, although I'm open to the possibility that switching the economy away from a consumption-base may have long term benefits, the transition needs to be considered, if not planned. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 05:37:43

This "Mandatory Encryption Backdoor" idea is one of the most braindead I've ever encountered, but at least it seems to explain films like Star Wars or Independence Day. 
In all the Star Wars movies, there's some kind of central weak point, and when this is gone, the whole army/battlestation collapses/explodes. At first the analogy doesn't make sense, because destroying backdoor *keys* wouldn't cause Internet services to fail. But, on the other hand, if these back doors aren't necessary for the operation of the nodes, why have them? And if they are available, why not use them? Won't this centralized security become relied on more and more? Eventually, having the keys stored centrally could become critical to the operation of any software on the network, then you have exactly the situation in Star Wars. One shot in the right place, and everything becomes inoperable.

I don't know where you got this. I don't remember making any claims about "perfect information" or "optimal decisions".  Where did you get 319 million people anyway? Is that the population of your country? Are you confusing me with someone else?
Sometimes there are clear choices which are better for the individual as well as the society. Choosing not to smoke is one such decision. I believe it should be up to the individual to decide, but that the government should make bad decisions (choosing to smoke) harder and less attractive. 
If you want to better understand this position, look up Cass Sunstein. I think there are some videos on YouTube.

Bitcoin does encourage owners to spread the word - holders and users all benefit from increased addition. Some people take it too far, becoming fanatical missionaries. That can get pretty annoying. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:02:18
The problem is that miners can:
* Allow pools to grow too large
* switch to an altcoin/fork
* keep using a hashing algorithm until the day before it's broken/obsolete
* conspire to attack the network
* conspire to increase mining rewards
This is what we are trusting them not to do when we buy 1-day old coins. This is the trust we are putting in miners now. If there were a way to buy coins that didn't have to rely on this trust, they would be more valuable.
I'm sorry, but I'm getting frustrated with this discussion, I will probably have to take a break before I start to become rude.

I'm really puzzled how you're not getting this...
If the coins are locked by the protocol, whoever owns them has a vested interest in keeping the network valuable. 
If it's the miner's own money, then he's going to protect the network. If someone is paying him in advance, they will want to know that he will protect the network, or they will buy from a miner who does guarantee to protect the network. 
Increasing the lock creates an economic incentive for miners to consider Bitcoin's strength in 18 months that doesn't exist now.
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:04:17
Miners don't have enough invested in the long-term success of Bitcoin.
I want the delay on spendability of coinbases to be slowly (over two years) increased to 18 months. That is, newly minted coins should be not be able to be moved for 18 months. This would better align the interests of miners with holders and users. Miners would use their equipment to keep the value Bitcoin up until they got to move their coins, even if keeping the value meant changing the mining algorithm.

The trick is this: the "verify new device" mail is sent in a language apparently saved with your account.

My "verify new device" emails were coming in Chinese (fuck knows why), so as soon as I clicked the link, the cookie was set to Chinese. 
So the trick is this:
Verify the new device on a different browser. Then the language cookie stays the same as it was on the homepage.

Ok, so imagine two people wanting to trade at $230 only have their money on the exchange long enough to make the deal... they deal then withdraw their money.  
Then along comes some miner wanting to sell their bitcoins immediately. But nobody trusts the exchange except one guy with $5 offering to buy 100 bitcoins at $0.05 each. Miner has to sell, so now the listed exchange price is $0.05. That means the value of everyone's bitcoins had plummeted. Not such a great idea, was it?
@_date: 2016-07-10 06:02:02
All these arguments are based on the idea of a "national economy" and the arguments crumble when a single global economy becomes possible.

It's hard to draw conclusions, the markets might make 251,800 sales each  day,  and that might be 1800 new coins, then 25 old coins that change hands 10,000 times. 
You might as well assume miners sell all their coins, since however you look at it, somebody values then higher than the market rate. Either speculators or miners - who are effectively also speculating.

Possibly, possibly not. "normal" corporations are compelled by law to act for profit. Bitcoin has been designed to facilitate transactions, which is part of the reason it's successful.

If neither the Windows nor Android (bitcoin wallet) clients mine, does it also mean that I can't get transaction fees? Does it mean that I'm not really a full node on the network?

Yes,  but they're apparently not holding all the bitcoin that they can, or they wouldn't have any fiat and would be forced to sell bitcoin, as above. If you're 100% sure that Bitcoin is only going to rise, you will have 100% of your wealth in bitcoins, and have to use it for every purchase. If you're only 90% sure, you should spend some occasionally and replace it. 
The real issue with deflation is the cost of stocking goods for sale. If the currency is always increasing in value, then your stock is always decreasing, so shops should be almost empty, and goods should only be produced moments before they are needed.

*"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"* - Upton Sinclair.
It's normal human behaviour to resist information we don't like, it's called "**confirmation bias**". No-one wants to see the bad news, and if people have the option of downvoting it to make it go away, they will take it. The best way to defend against this is to recognise that you do it too, and make an extra effort to find the bad news, and be extra-sceptical of the good news. Of course, this is especially hard when the market is crashing like it was 36 hours ago, but it's necessary if you want to make money speculating on bitcoin.

As I understand it:
**Short term:** NMC will increase in price as speculators become optimistic about its future (github had been pretty dead for a while). There are some signs this is happening now. 
**Medium term:** The patch will be carefully checked, and if accepted, new binaries will be released. People wishing to buy new names must use new binaries.
**Long term:** NMC will work as originally planned. Domains which were stolen after the exploit was found will automatically return to their original owners. Domains which were bought legitimately after the exploit was found, will have to be bought again.

I don't think the other post really answers your question. Withdrawing fiat (USD, EUR etc) from Mt Gox takes far too long, but that's not your problem, because you want buy bitcoins, and they only take an hour to withdraw. Your problem is that Mt Gox is more expensive than other exchanges (which is caused by the fiat problem).

I don't use bitstamp, but on bitcoin.de they have minimum buys becaes the fiat doesn't touch the exchange, leaving the traders to match the transactions with the orders by themselves.

Not today. Today bitcoin still has a 7 transaction-per-second limit.

I agree. I'm hoarding and spending at the same time. Anyone who believes the value will go up would do this. I know I'm going to want to buy things that can be paid for with bitcoin in the next month, so I buy bitcoin with my paycheck, spend some, and save some. Because the value is currently increasing so quickly, everything I spend it in is effectively cheaper, so I can save more.

Namecoin **is** a currency,  because it doesn't just replace DNS, it replaces *registrars*. If you register a name using bitcoin, you went through an exchange, so the price of the namecoins was important. 
I also think it's a brilliant idea (some other altcoins are too), and I think you're underselling it. Namecoin can be used for *anything* that needs to be globally unique: usernames, addresses, dictionary definitions, program namespaces, trademarks and on and on.  Even better, anything registered with Namecoin can also be cryptographically authenticated. An end to passwords, SSL Certifying Authorities, trademark disputes and more. All decentraIized!

You're still not coming through very clearly. "but some tile" ??? What kind of tiles are you thinking of? How big? Do you really think it would be easier to apply them straight to clay than to a plastic grid?

Domain name speculation was always especially risky, because a court could decide to take your domain away. Bitcoin is a bit safer in that regard.

Well, if you find it, let me know. In Dan Ariely's BGIB course I learnt about a study which says that when someone is aware they are getting advice from someone with a conflict of interest, they compensate, but the person with the conflict of interest then gives them more biased advice. 
Essentially, overcoming bias is what the scientific method is all about. It's not impossible, but what I really need is objective measurement and peer review. That obviously isn't realistic for me when I'm trying to assess a news report in Chinese as quickly as I can.
Probably the best argument I can make is my posting history. I was looking for the bad news, and found it, and I managed to sell (the small percentage I allow myself to day-trade) just before the second flash crash a few hours ago.
@_date: 2013-11-05 08:21:54
Nah, I'm still pro-government. There are simply some problems to big to solve without coercion. Cryptocurrency is inevitable, but that alone doesn't make it good.
Do libertarians here believe that Bitcoin will make taxation impossible, and consequently result in weaker government? Don't you think governments *real* power comes from its monopoly on **violence**? Money has just become a proxy for violent control in recent times. If governments lose control of money, they will go back to using violence to directly control the population, possibly with more surveillance than before.

My reading is that purchases made with Bitcoin should still pay MWST, where it would be charged in Euro. This only clarifies that when you change your bitcoins back into Euro, *you don't have to pay twice*. 
"Bitcoins seien dem Euro und jeder anderen Währung nun umsatzsteuerlich gleichgestellt" - Bitcoins and other currencies are treated equally with regard to MWST.
Also I think "consumption tax" might be a better translation than "sales tax" MWST is equivalent to GST in Australia and VAT in Britain.
I would love to hear I'm wrong, since I pay *too much* MWST

Where can we follow the results?

As well as the domain name usage for namecoin mentioned by others, it can be used for any kind of registered namespace. Trademarks, usernames (including using the private key for authentication), definitions of words, postal addresses, electoral candidates and so on ad-infinitum; anything which needs to be globally unique, and shouldn't be centralized. Because of this, it doesn't really compete with bitcoin the same way as litecoin and the others, which is possibly it's greatest strength.

There's no sewing involved, have a closer look at the pictures or google ministeck. My result is about 15cm across (the size of a CD case), so it would easily fit in a safe. I'm sure you can get 3mm tiles (the size of a ministeck pixel), but how easy are they to work with and perfectly align in a grid?

Maybe not. I've noticed a lot of atheists tend to throw out positive thinking and hypnosis, which are also faith based, but have solid evidence. Positive thinking is subtly but importantly different from magical thinking, which prayer is an example of.

Yes, I agree. It's not going to solve every financial problem, but it will solve some of them. 
It might even do slightly more harm than good - although I'm optimistic that it won't. I still think cryptocurrency is *inevitable*. It's a brilliant idea, and the cat's out of the bag.
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:28:40
Yep, I downvoted you. 
You didn't provide any *reason* why Litecoin should see better returns than Bitcoin. Also, as others have pointed out, Bitcoin is way ahead in terms of acceptance as a currency, and considering *spending* a cryptocurrency avoids capital gains tax (in some countries), returns on Bitcoin may end up better, even if Litecoin increases more in value.

The blockchain for namecoin is huge, like bitcoin. If there's caching, it's only on the local machine.

Then it would be better for you to spread the news early: Bitcoin isn't anonymous! All the information that NSA could want is easily availabe in the blockchain. Bitcoin *can* be used anonymously, but you have to know what you are doing.

I'm not ignoring the history of alt-coins, and I'm not saying that Bitcoin is going to be replaced in the near future. Five years is a pretty safe bet. 
I'm only saying that when Bitcoin dies, it will die extremely quickly. You say it matters what 1-7 billion people want, but *you're* ignoring that most wealth doesn't belong to people, it belongs to corporations. If those corporations start keeping their reserves in a AI managed portfolio of crypto-currency, it could take moments for them all to suddenly decide that they'd rather be holding more *coin than Bitcoin. The next day you wake up, and you either your savings were also AI-managed, or you're broke.

Namecoin solves a real problem and a patch has been submitted. The price is still low, so if the patch is accepted and it's rolled out, it could quickly gain in value. However the original developers seem to have disappeared, and no one has responded to the patch since it was submitted two weeks ago.
