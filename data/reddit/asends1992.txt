I see. When I for example try to use viabtc's accelerator, they say that they cannot find my transaction.
So I guess I just have to wait this out?
Is there any estimate on how long a transaction is in this limbo, before it gets cancelled?
Unless ofcourse it gets through

Can you please tell me my mistake?

Can anyone elaborate why bcash is a scam coin?
Isn't it just the old bitcoin, forked pre-segwit, with 8mb block instead of 1mb?
How can bitcoin possibly survive 1year or more, with growth, with no upgrades to the tech?
I mean if you expect this thing to continuously grow and more and more people are supposed to come in, how is that even possible when the network is as jammed as it is now?
If we got a huge surge of new people after Christmas, the entire bitcoin project would come to an absolute halt, unless you pay what? a 200$ fee per transaction.
Segwit adoption remedies it a bit, but with a lower price, you'll get more transactions.
And then you are back to this point, add on some more adoption and usage, and it will just become worse.
This is not me FUDing, this is a serious question, and I want a debate on how people see that exact problem?
It must be allowed to ask a critical question when the entire bitcoin infrastructure is heavily overloaded, and there seems to be no fix to that, in at least a year.
Are we just gonna sit idle and HODL, and wait for lightning to be the saving grace, ALOT can happen in a year?

That is actually very smart! Thanks for this!

Right, that makes more sense! Thank, I will surely do that!
