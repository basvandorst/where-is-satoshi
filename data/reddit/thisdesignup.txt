Can you get paid in bitcoin yet? Cause right now Time can at least be traded for Dollars. If anything trading Time for Coins could help crypto currency a lot.

But who would know if they printed more money. Would that be something relatively easy to keep on the down low?

What is fame worth? I guess it is worth something cause then people would want coins but it's not really worth anything if no one wanted to buy coins. It's almost like a fad right now, thriving off that fame, but even good fads do die down.

Wouldn't there still be trust in everyone else that is working with Bitcoin? What about people that don't care about the decentralized aspect. Are there potential benefits to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:33:36
What does unconfirmed mean? Is that on bitcoins end where the transactions haven't been processed yet or where the buyers haven't confirmed payment? 
If it's the former then I wonder if the 3 transactions per second limit is true. Cause if so that is about 20 hours for transactions to go through.

How would there be an "inside" for something like this? I thought the whole idea was to get rid of stuff like this, e.g. 3rd parties.

I'm not trying to say we should treat anyone in any particular way, just to give this a thought. Do we feel bad a person who loses all their money at a casino? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:20:35
One could guess though. Considering bitcoin was one of the first of it's kind I'd personally imagine new tech coming along could be a cause or maybe even too much tech. If there are too many coins then maybe money get's spread thin, not everyone can buy every coin. Although these are just ideas from someone who doesn't know much.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:01:57
But... who's gonna buy it if it costs that much? Needs more adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:43:15
Would you sell your bitcoin for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:41:10


The tech behind bitcoin? Aren't there other coins too? If this is about tech then what happens if someone ends up creating better tech behind a different "coin"? Sure there's no doubting that internet, email, computers, etc, haven't "popped" as a whole but there are plenty of business that have come and gone. For example look at AOL, they used to be huge when it came to the internet, now look at them.
I'm not saying it's gonna happen one way or the other, just trying to think of possibilities.

Overcomplicated? I am not sure what overcomplicated would be with a digital currency. Although I'd kind of expect a digital currency to be complex considering the amount of things needing to be taken into account. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:14:53
Bitcoin has a limit on how many transactions can be processed per minute. From what I've heard it's like 3 per second, artificially placed as a safety feature. At 3 per second you can only do 10,800 transaction per hour. If you watch any exchange you'll see there's way more than that happening right now and so they pile up. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:48:31
People rushing off is what makes the price go lower right? Or do I not understand that properly?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:59:49
Isn't bitcoin a bad long term investment? If it's supposed to be a currency but people are buying it to hold onto it as an investment then doesn't that go directly against it being a currency? Right now it's more short term investments but it doesn't change that there's not much "real" worth if there's little adoption/spending. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:28:59
Who says? There's tons of old tech that has gone away due to new tech. Biggest and oldest isn't necessarily a good standing if something better come along. What ever happened to AOL? They used to be one of the biggest and one of the oldest and now look at them. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:07:34
To be fair it could pop. Maybe it's more like a balloon where it can get pretty large and then pop. Who knows, nobody really. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:03:07
Then why not move to other cheaper coins that have newer tech than Bitcoin? Why Bitcoin if it's only about the tech? But maybe you are, I don't know, but then again here we both are on the bitcoin subreddit.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:00:40


Just to backup what your saying isn't this something that is, or could easily happen with bitcoin? If bitcoin prices rise then people aren't going to want to spend it on other things. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:01:29


Why would you keep buying things if your $100 is going to be worth $1000 in a year?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:55:42
Isn't claiming its gonna go up the same? Nobody truly knows what it's gonna do. Past performance doesn't even prove the future. It's all a gamble.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:40:30
The lines moving up and right are probably better than it facing up and right. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:01:11
Is that different than having a software wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:54:25
Linden dollars are only going for about $L250 per $USD so she'd only have made $1000 gross to stream her concert. She probably made more in the time it would take for someone to set it up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:59:59
What kind of chips do we want? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:52:48
lol, thats only roughly $1,000 USD. Probably a drop in the bucket for what she makes. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:31:34


Hmm, don't we already do that with banks? Why do we need to be our own banks? What happens if our personal tech breaks? We are left holding the loss. At least if a service breaks there is some possibility of getting stuff back. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:56:56
Ahhhh, been trying to buy some since it was $2300 and no system seems to be working properly or they aren't in my state. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:05:23
As someone who just signed up for Kraken and is waiting to be verified it's also slow at the moment. Although I haven't had any troubles like with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:32:23
If everyone rushes to buy then that will just raise the price wouldn't it? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:52:35
I'm really curious. Don't bitcoin miners make back there money from the bitcoins they mine? Why are there fees on top of that? It's not like other currencies have such fees. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:42:11
Just curious, if you make income from exchanging other currencies does the IRS take out taxes?
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:03:06
Are they a startup? Others in this thread have mentioned they've been around for years. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:01:01
Care to point any out? I'm not aware of them.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:00:13
Wouldn't they know if they were being attacked and let others know what was going on? All they've said is that the influx of users signing up and trying to make purchases has slowed their system down. They've mentioned nothing about an attack. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:50:55
Coinbase had and has broken features. I've tried Kraken, and Gemini with no troubles like I am having with Coinbase. Although Gemini isn't in my state so I can't actually use it sadly. Everything on Kraken as worked fine but their processing for verification is slow.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:02:31
Not the guy you asked but I can. Although I've run into plenty of other problems, not adding a card, odd glitch like pending charges when adding my bank account, and some other things. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:37:09
But doesn't that kind of go against what he said? As in people have to use it for it to be adopted but if people don't use it and hold onto it then it can't be adopted as easily.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:35:43
Especially if it's within the contract. A lot of people, myself included, have all their money in a bank. The money is still mine when I want it. Although they may have an issue if I try to take too much out at once. But the money is still mine to request. 
Having all your bitcoins in a site like Coinbase wouldn't be that much different. The main difference would be security and trust since Coinbase isn't necessarily as setup as a bank, since they are just a startup. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:34:02
If you have a potential $200,000 could you sue?

I think you are thinking of the Fine Bros. The guy in the picture is Casey Neistat and he is and was a short film videographer and now vlogger.
