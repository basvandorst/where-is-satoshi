Gyft uses BitPay, a service that immediately converts BTC to fiat. They don't hold BTC at all, just like Amazon wouldn't have to.

All of those things are true about most altcoins.
That's a straw man argument, I never said anything about legacy transaction mechanisms or "dead fiat money". 
I believe that BTC does offer *some* benefits over fiat/many popular payment processors, such as very low fees that don't scale with the amount you send and the ability for anyone with internet access to receive and send BTC, along with practically infinite divisibility.
Adoption rate is the most important factor in the success of a cryptocurrency. If no one uses it, no matter how good it is, it doesn't matter. Bitcoin is miles ahead of any other cryptocurrency in that regard, and I see no reason why it would lose that lead except for all cryptocurrencies failing, or a cryptocurrency that is better in every way than BTC appears and overcomes the huge gap in adoption and infrastructure.

I can't say anything for sure because I don't have the stats, but I'd bet that for every donation drive most of the total amount was raised from a few large donations instead of many small ones. It's just a numbers game, one person who donated a million doge would be the same as 10,000 people who donated 100. Didn't Moolah donate 20 million doge or something to the dogecar fund?
I'm definitely not arguing that it's impossible for to do something like this, just that it's unlikely. Apathy is higher because of BTC already being in the public eye, and there's no real centralized presence of power users/the foundation that could easily rally together people and direct the fundraiser/handle funds.
Also, when you consider that most people on invested their own money to get their BTC (rather than the miners/early adopters of doge), it leads to what is IMO a climate not very conducive to fundraising and stuff like that.

I agree, there's a definite trend of rabid libertarians in this subreddit. I'd say that most people don't agree with the sentiment, but there's a problem that comes with them posting. You can't really say that they shouldn't post their opinion, or hate on them for believing what they believe.
It's something most people have learned to just ignore or downvote and move on, but to an outsider/someone who isn't used to these kind of posts it would definitely be a "woah what the hell is going on in here" moment.
I've spent a lot of time on as well, and I like it there. I do think that the community there is more positive, and that people are actually extremely open to discussion about the pros and cons of dogecoin (I've made a few critical comments that I just expected to be downvoted to oblivion, but people instead upvoted me and posted some great responses to my points).
I don't really know enough to recommend any ways that might change for the better without ending up herding cats.

What I intended to say with that post is that the actual libertarian posts aren't what perpetuate the anti-bitcoin image and vibe anymore, what's more harmful to image are the people who constantly talk about how bad is and how it's full of libertarian nonsense.

@_date: 2014-04-14 20:16:21
1) The bitcoin community is much larger than the subreddit, unlike the Dogecoin community which is almost entirely on (This makes it harder to coordinate fundraisers/events)
2) Most early adopters/people with lots of Dogecoin actively use The same isn't true with 3) Dogecoin fundraising efforts are used in an attempt to gain publicity for the coin, Bitcoin is already very much in the public eye (at least compared to any other cryptocurrency) so the urgent need to do this kind of stuff isnt there

However, a few hours later (after it was cross-posted to it was upvoted so much that it is now the 4th top post of all time on and the top comments were entirely replaced with pro-dogecoin comments, and the comments that were at the top before were all downvoted to the bottom.
I visit and contribute to both and regularly, but I think the best thing to foster relations between the two would to be keeping dogecoin posts out of and vice versa.

The coin didn't start on Reddit, there was no dogecoin subreddit until ~day 3-4 of Dogecoin existing. Before that (and during the early stages of the subreddit) the community was almost all 4chan/some people from bitcointalk.
Doge started off as a find-and-replace luckycoin, it didn't offer anything new besides changed numbers/name.
I agree that is much bigger than that now, but I was calling you out specifically because people like to claim that doge was something revolutionary and special from the beginning when that wasn't the case and they more-than-likely weren't there for it.

I agree and disagree with this post.
In my experience, most of the people who you are talking about are downvoted (aggressive posts that don't contribute to this discussion). Most people who are neutral but still have opinions that make you say "Uh, okay" aren't downvoted, but I don't think someone should be for that.
I think that people like to make out as much worse than it really is, and it's happened so much that now it's ingrained "= people who are elitist to new users and delusional, angry libertarians". This is true of a small number of posts, but they're almost always downvoted. The only reason this stereotype of continues is because people outside of keep perpetuating it without actually coming to the subreddit regularly and/or get involved with the community.
The reason why is a joke isn't really because of it's because of all of the people who want it to be that way.

People waste many magnitudes more of power every single day by leaving the lights on when they leave a room than will ever be wasted with BTC mining.
Hashing wasting power is a crypto problem, not a BTC problem. There are some good ideas to use all of that power for good (the folding coin is spring to mind), but none have become that popular yet.
@_date: 2014-05-05 07:55:10
I agree that this would be a good idea, but I don't think it's likely to happen. The main reason is that most of the "big players" and early adopters of Bitcoin aren't active on the subreddit, so it's harder to gather big donations, and there's less of an urgency to do publicity things like this since Bitcoin is already pretty well-known (especially compared to every other crypto).

How much time do you actually spend in this community, and read normal news/update posts?
All I can speak for are my experiences, you may very well have experienced all of that often and if so what I'm saying probably won't matter to you.
I've been visiting this subreddit for a few years now (I remember back when people would tip bitcoin like people tip dogecoin now) and while I agree that there is a definite subgroup of people like you're talking about, most visitors are just big fans of BTC.
Most of the communities are for other cryptos/technology, but I don't know why there are political subreddits linked to a specifically non-politic coin at all.

What are you talking about? "people want a Marketplace"?
Darknet markets already exist. There is very little support (buyers and sellers) for weaponry/firearms.
How do you think that human trafficking and sex slavery would work with a DNM? There are already tons of escort/sex sites on the clearnet that take USD. "Oh man, this vendor is having a half off sale on people, I wonder if they'll ship to my address? Sure hope this isn't the FBI like every other time I've tried this!"
What's being built right now? Again, darknet markets already exist, and all of them that have any users don't allow things like heavy weaponry (most don't allow weapons in general) or CP.

It can, but it's unlikely to drop so low that mass amounts of people stop mining.

Fair enough. 
I see arguments like "Bitcoin is just a flash in the pan pump and dump" or "Bitcoiners are just trying to make a quick buck by speculating" all the time, and I like to point out the success that many startup BTC services/companies have had to show that the bitcoin ecosystem is more robust than one might think.

If you make a crypto that has 10 trillion coins mined in its first year, then 100 mined every year after that, you could make the same argument. I'm saying that the "bitcoin is more inflationary" argument doesn't tell the whole story if the supply increases by a ridiculously high amount in year one.

@_date: 2014-04-19 06:33:27
Yes, converting to fiat would lower the price in the short term, but the idea is that more people would get exposed to it as a payment system and the adoption rate would go up, making for a healthier Bitcoin economy and a likely higher price.

The problem is that almost no one who saw the race even noticed the few seconds about Doge, or if they did do so they didn't remember it now.
Every actual ad during the race got more time than the bit about Doge, and you don't expect people to magically attach onto each of those products. Why Doge?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:56:40
So, if I offered those people .5 BTC or 100 Doge (and explained how much they were both worth), they would all take the Doge then, correct?
@_date: 2014-05-12 03:19:23
99% of those were from coming to upvote the dogecar posts here.
The dogecar was a failure from an advertising perspective, people were throwing around "to the moon" and talking about huge influxes of subscribers after the race, yet the price has gone down and activity hasn't increased by a significant margin.

You think 100 billion of a currency is enough for the whole world? Bill Gates alone would hold half of that if USD was the same way.
Bitcoin is already much more successful than Doge is
Strong reddit community, non-existent outside of reddit
Fair point
Dogecoin offers no technological improvements over LTC or BTC
This would be a factor if anyone knew what Dogecoin was, BTC is actually in the public eye in that most people have heard or it once or twice, which isn't true of any altcoin at all
LTC has much higher acceptance than Doge
Potential isn't any higher than LTC or BTC, and it's hurt a lot by the issues it faces in the short-term
You also left off the biggest reason Bitcoin is ahead, which is much higher adoption and a much much much much better infrastructure.

How many? Like 10?
People who get into Doge and have no knowledge of BTC are very limited, people who get into Doge then into BTC are also very limited, and the people who get into Doge then becoming meaningfully involved with BTC in any way is extremely limited (I'd be willing to bet this is less than 50 people total so far)

@_date: 2014-02-28 17:39:37
I would guess maybe 0 people bought Dogecoin over BTC specifically because of unit bias.
Unit bias is a tired argument. While being a small factor, it isn't enough in-and-of itself to make or break a cryptocurrency.
If I offered you 100 Doge or .5 BTC, which would you take?
If you would choose the BTC, you know that unit bias is *not* by any means the largest factor that goes into your decision.

Bitcoin is extremely volatile/very risky compared to currency/government bonds, I agree.
The difference I see between the bitcoin protocol and a traditional federal authority is that there is no change possible without the agreement of a majority of the people mining. Miners directly control the outcome, and if people don't like it they're free to fork it and try to convince people to switch.
I like having lots of space as well.
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:13:47
That's very true.

It wasn't made to "prove he wasn't a noob", it was made purely as a joke, and "It was never intended to turn into a get rich quick thing" wasn't true for most people who mined it early.

It grew because there were lots of people who mined a lot of Doge in the beginning who had an incentive to see it grow. The reddit dogecoin community in the beginning was a direct result of the 4chan doge community wanting to "shill to redditors". Since then, it has grown massively beyond that, but that doesn't change the facts of how it started.
How did he prove "he wasn't a noob"? He literally took Luckycoin's code and just changed the name and block rewards. Look at this screenshot from very early on in Doge succeeded because it had a good idea (memecoin) combined with people who wanted to make money.

Overstock.com has sold over a million dollars of product in BTC, and that's just one company out of hundreds.
The bitcoin trading volume is much higher than Doge, and bitcoin payment processors (namely coinbase) have received tens of millions of dollars in VC funding.
You can't present a serious argument that Doge is in a better position here.
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:17:54
The majority of people aren't like that here, they are just people who like Bitcoin (I am very interested in the technology and I think Bitcoin would be great for filling part of the money transfer niche.
I go to and contribute to both subreddits regularly, and for some reason lots of people love to paint as a bunch of dumb libertarians who are absolute cunts to each other when that is a very small portion of posts, and those posts that are made are almost always downvoted to the bottom.
The subreddit can be serious and "anti-fun" sometimes because a lot of people are passionate about Bitcoin and have even invested money into the idea, which makes controversial opinions or shitposting about BTC feel like a more "personal" attack.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:53:10

When you send a transaction, but before it's confirmed, it's still broadcasted to the network and shows up in the other person's wallet as an unconfirmed transaction.
You can't spoof a transaction, the only way to cheat the merchant would be through a costly attack that doesn't even work 100% of the time.
If you're handling a large transaction and are worried about an attack, you can just wait the ten minutes for a confirm.

Double digits seems like a stretch to me, there's some point where all the people who missed the original train to $1000 will jump back in. Plus there's a baseline price point from people buying and transacting in BTC (think darknet), but I don't know what that would actually equate to.

In the summer of 2011 I had ~2 BTC but it was worth like $10-$30 then.

@_date: 2015-08-15 20:11:32
Most block sizes aren't likely to be anywhere near that big, and future forks are possible if issues come to be. The 1mb block limit was almost never close to being filled until the past few months, and that was mainly because of the BTC stress test/the spamming of transactions. I'd imagine the higher limits would just be for extreme future-proofing more than anything.

Slippery slope fallacy. 
There is a legitimate reason to not allow people to pay in loose pennies/change, they usually just have to roll them up first then they are free to pay with them. It's to prevent someone from doing something petty and unreasonable to someone they owe a debt to. 
Where do your freedoms stop? Can you encase each penny in a piece of shit and pay them with that? It's legal tender for a debt, after all.
@_date: 2015-04-22 05:56:23
There can be (and have been) restrictions on the way you pay the debt (all coins must be rolled, you can't take out $150 one dollar bills and fold them all into origami pigs without unfolding them all first, etc.
There is the right to refusal of anything (very common is "we don't accept over $20 bills" with pizza guys, fast food places, etc. and that's only becaise ot

That's totally different, if you made a contract with your friend to specifically return silver, then he couldn't just pay the debt with the USD equivalent unless you added that in the arrangement initially. You could be the one to take him to court for breach of contract.
You can't require people pay monetary debts back without the option of using USD. You can request someone indebted to you to pay you in pop rocks or Larry the Cable Guy mugs, but he would legally have the option to pay you back in USD instead.
The difference is the first is a specific trade (silver for silver, no USD involved) while the second involves a USD debt, which is where the legal tender/"used for all debts public and private" thing comes in.
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:18:36
Debt in this context refers to owing a debtor USD. If someone said that they were going to give you silver back after you lend them some silver, the lender isn't obligated to take your USD, because you agreed specifically on an exchange of goods for goods. The lender is free to take the USD equivalent if he wants to, take you to court over breach of contract, or just dismiss the contract altogether. 
However, he can totally legally ask for the silver that was promised in the original contract as long as that was what was agreed upon. If it goes to court, it would depend on the judge to decide whether or not the no-silver guy should have to pay out in the silver, pay out the USD equivalent, or pay out a different amount,
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:47:09
There have been laws in the past that allow businesses to request you pay in a certain way if the way you try to pay is deemed unreasonable (ex. you wheelbarrow in tens of thousands of pennies).

That's a good example of the same concept. People consistently rate things like muggings and shark attacks as more threatening to their lives than things like heart disease or a car accident, which are in reality magnitudes more likely to kill them.
It's basically your brain making an assumption based on the information you know/what sticks out to you the most, while totally disregarding the actual statistics. It's a pretty much non-conscious function of your brain,almost everyone has experienced it before and they still experience it now, including me personally. All you can do for it if you care to is research for yourself and then try to reason whether your thinking is or isn't irrational. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:32:17
I totally agree. No one will go through the pain of doing something unless the incentive for doing so is great and they have to do a certain thing in order to get the incentive.
Ordering drugs off the darknet requires BTC, so people buy/sell millions in BTC daily just from that alone because it's a very incentive-heavy area and BTC is the exclusive way to do it.

Regulation is definitely a good thing in most cases, but there is such a thing as inefficient or unnecessary regulation that does nothing but harm in the long run. For example, all of the energy-saving regulation for housing in California that was supposed to cut energy costs by as much as 80% in the 80s/90s, the savings are minimal and people use the same amount of energy as they do now. A possible reason for this is that people figure "Hey, it's energy efficient, I can run the AC/heat/other electronics even more!"

I'm not the one who has the burden of proof. If he wants to run a survey, collect the data, then control for everything except for whatever variable we agree that "bad" is, then he is perfectly free to do that. Until he has solid evidence to back up his claim, then it's not worth nothing.

Availability heuristic. Stories about the few bad cops are heavily publiclized, but no one ever reports on the hundreds of other incidents that everything went perfectly fine in. That leads the idea that cops are bad to stick out in your mind, and your brain uses what it knows (stories about bad cops) and automatically makes assumptions based off of that (all cops are bad), totally ignoring that there are ~865,000 cops working in the US and that the base rate of being "bad" for cops is unlikely to be significantly different from the base rate of being "bad" for any other common profession.

He worked at a restaurant and one of his jobs was to scrub clean the paella pans, which he did by tying them down at the beach and letting the tide naturally scrub them clean. One day he left the pans but forgot to secure them, and this story was about him telling his boss that he lost almost all of the paella pans out to sea.

Just use a ski mask or some pantyhose over your face. Works for me - totally anonymous. Works less at the DMV, just in case you get pulled over. That's another tip - tape a mirror over the image on your License. The cop will check it, get confused, and end up arresting himself.
Works every time.

Ross Ulbricht used public wifi when logging into the Silk Road admin panel, and once the feds got access to that, they could see when he was logged in. They actually caught him at a library when they saw he was online from there, and they managed it by making a distraction then rushing in before he could close his laptop, which would have encrypted his whole drive.

I sold 1 btc for $19 PayPal (wanted to bid on an eBay item but didn't even win the thing) through a forum back in 2011, it took like 20 minutes or so. If you trust the other person its not that hard in practice to go PayPal -&gt; BTC, but it gets iffy fast otherwise, especially when dealing with larger amounts on PayPal.
@_date: 2015-02-06 21:05:36
Circle is bridging that gap pretty well, it's as easy if not easier to get BTC with Circle than it is to put USD in your paypal account.

Yes, it's called cold storage.
Paper wallets are the most common, but brainwallets are awesome if you have a secure passphrase, and you can carry your BTC around in your head.

The BTC will be sent to wherever the wallet is at. Anyone can send BTC to it. If it's a coinbase wallet, it'll only appear on Coinbase for them, but they can send it to other addresses if they want to.

So what makes you think that Ebay will follow the same path?
An extremely small percentage of people know that Bitcoin exists, and an even smaller percentage would be willing to go through all of the steps to use it on an online marketplace.
I'm all for the support and adoption of Bitcoin, I think it will go down as the biggest technical revolution of the decade. However, to say that Ebay isn't going to be relevant IN A FEW YEARS is just ridiculous and pure conjecture.
