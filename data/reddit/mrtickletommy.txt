At what price do you think it could start a potential bull run? 
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:44:02
Bollocks 
All this scare mongering isn’t going to make us sell.
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:40:40
Maybe less but I have faith it will rise significantly in the years to come. Perfect time to accumulate. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:43:16
Bla bla bla 
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:33:58
If you sold I think this time next year you would be kicking yourself stupid! Would be a facepalm moment! 
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:10:49
They want to sell it at the bottom 
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:46:16
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:53:16
Think people believe it’s a gate way for big money to get onboard. Big money is already in this space and they have made their money of the people who have been rekt for the last 8 months. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:00:15
I wish!! 
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:02:18
Where did you read that? Could you provide a link please. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:04:43
I think things will pick up in September but think a bull run will happen in Feb next year ��
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:58:40
If so we will buy buy buy 
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:13:48
Yes

I was waiting for him to fall off a cliff
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:31:57
2 years away ��
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:06:00
@_date: 2019-02-24 00:45:22
I will use this gif in future...just for the points gained on a 4% rise - 800+
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:21:13
Turn screen left...looks more like a cock and bollocks 
@_date: 2019-12-14 22:11:38
Millions of dollars a day support its current value, the same input and increased scarcity will drive price. Only thing that could go against it is the coming recession
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:21:53
Risky yes, but it’s probably one of most easily accessible assets to date. I’m still bullish long term as there’s only ever going to be 21mil. It’s just still sadly an overvalued collectible at the moment. Too few have owned to many and driven the price up ridiculously, through manipulation. It will settle down and the cycle will repeat.  
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:35:04
Smug fucker ��
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:53:58
Agreed! 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:24:06
I’m sitting on the fence now 
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:54:16
We are all waiting for 2k �� what worries me is who’s buying after us to make it go up thereafter 
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:48:15
Agreed. So many people trying to play the game, screw their agendas. I’m still trying to obtain a single bitcoin through accumulation! At worst it’s going to be a limited collectible...I’m bullish...but skint 
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:37:05
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:48:18
Expect a “I told you so” video soon 
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:17:40
Why does anyone take notice of this guy, he is always wrong. He nor anyone else can predict the future!  
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:00:20
I live in the North of England so can’t speak for the south
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:22:09
I live in England and honestly think a recession is coming, big companies are making redundancies and the retail industry had its worse year since 2008. Price of utilities and food increasing and wages have been stagnant for years. People aren’t spending anymore because they have so little to spend other than on the essentials. Think this at best will be the new norm. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:17:36
I think the days of making 10x are been on gone think margin trading is the only way to make decent gains from now on in 
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:59:41
At worst it’s a limited collectible it’s going up 2019, we are just in a position we’re everyone one wants to buyer it cheaper than the last person. Many will miss the boat out of fear or greed 
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:39:35
I don’t know, but I think they will find a solution in the future. I’m only looking at this more as mid term investment myself. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:48:41
He’s a gobshite 
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:29:46
Sold a few hours ago out of fear of a drop, now I’m uneasy if I sold too soon! 
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:05:16
I think money will flow into any asset class that’s on the rise, if bitcoin ends its bear market by the end of Q1 I would be bullish - early to mid term 
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:22:34
I think it’s going to plateau this month or next, hoping to buy in more in the weeks to come. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:30:51
I honestly think if it got to 1k the world and his wife will want to purchase it demand would be to high: The whales will tempt everyone with a price that they think is financially achievable but it will never come. People are saying 500 or 1000 it’s because that’s just what they want to pay for one. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:38:29
Yeah I would agree we would all take profit and wait for a cheaper price than what we sold at. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:35:13
Can’t see that happening, it would never rebound if that was to happen. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:23:20
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:44:30
Hope not! 
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:23:27
�� or ��? 
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:49:32
More bothered about it being more wildly used as a payment option for goods and services. Price meh 
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:54:56
Fat fingers ��
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:08:59
I’m doing the same tbh, but I bet there’s a great deal of people on the sidelines waiting to buy in. 
Being the most profitable asset class since its creation and the fact we have access to make trades at the click of our phones, personally I’m confident it will rise quickly. Don’t mind if it doesn’t as I still think it will out do most investments next year. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:52:19
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:41:30
Good move ����
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:25:09
Yes I am buying now, fundamentally I’m more focused on being part of the space then the potential gains. Bitcoin goes against the grain, something I find most interesting. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:58:27
Then you win!
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:23:25
Thanks for the input! Lol. Look at 6 hourly chart and see the curvature, personally I think we will see a pump next week or the week after.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:48:22
So tempted to buy one right now but I honestly think it will get 3k or below 
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:31:05
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:40:04
They are frightened of the inevitable change of power
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:43:42
It will do the same as gold in a recession I think initially drop like other markets then plateau 
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:42:12
I would piss with excitement at those prices 
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:06:36
Can’t see that happening 
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:37:51
Do tell? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:36:30
Just don’t see it happening if it goes to 1k everyone will be buying, people are claiming its demise because they either can’t afford a full at the current price or willing to pay at its current price. Whales will make them miss the boat or buy in higher than they wanted too. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:09:26
Naughty 
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:34:00
Awesome �� 
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:24:47
Holy mother of Christ ��
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:13:47
Iv got friends who sold 2016 and thought it wouldn’t go higher, also got friends that sold late 2017! You wanna see the envy!
