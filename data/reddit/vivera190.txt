shitcoins taking a big hit today, most of them are close to 30% and 40% decrease in the last 24h, meanwhile btc dominance keeps going up (35% yesterday, almost 38% today), not bad..
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:10:58
so it was all about CBEO and the expiring futures contracts? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:31:04
oh shit, this is it guys, BTC dominance is going up (35% right now, it was around 32% yesterday) shitcoins are taking a massive hit today.

ah shit, my bad, missed that completely. Still, be patient and wait, they will eventually get confirmed.

Good! and you should encourage others to do the same :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:59:47
It's going to take a few more days before it gets confirmed. Worst case scenario, your coins don't get confirmed, but don't worry, they will go back to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:30:18
Yep, all of this, spam attack on the network, the CNBC interview today, massive FUD on social, coinbase adding bcash out of the blue, etc etc, everything is part of a well coordinated plan by Roger &amp; Co. Let's see how long it lasts, probably until people can actually start dumping their bcash on GDAX? we'll see
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:11:33
oh boy, someone has started spamming the network with +1000 Sat/b fees. 
Address: 197D9cfnEM3NwBGsmw4N99h18pkosoufkf
If you check bitcoinfees.earn, you'll see that, if it wasn't for this address, the recomendable fee would be around the 400-500 Sat/b range.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:36:12
bcash is making you drink too much kool-aid, kid. Calm down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:49:33
here we go lads: fasten your seatbelt and hodl tight!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:53:44
Most likely, the standard fee didn't go through before the spam attack on the network began. Now that it caught your tx, your transaction has joined the other 250k unconfirmed transactions. No need to email blockchain.info, they can't do anything. Just be patient and wait until it gets confirmed (could be days).
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:47:13
lol is this the new level of FUD? so scared right now haha
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:44:54
BTC has gone down around 9% in the last 24h, on the other hand, Bcash has gone down almost 18% in the last 24h..hmmm.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:15:11
a "rebroadcast" is kinda like a reminder to miners to not forget your tx, it won't get your tx confirmed faster but it'll keep it on the network for god knows how long (i've never tried it) until it gets confirmed. It would've worked after it got dropped from the mempool (not sure on this).
I recommend you to accelerate it with one of those free/paid tx accelarators. Try pool.viabtc(.)com/tools/txaccelerator/, it's free and it accepts up to 100 tx every hour (10am, 11,am, etc etc) so be ready to put your tx quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:31:42
Check here  . You're waiting next to almost 50k unconfirmed tx in the 300sat/b range + 13k tx with higher fee. I'm afraid it's gonna take a few more days. Be patient, buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:24:58
eventually in like a week or two, maybe. If it doesn't get confirmed by then, you'll get your coins back. But next time, check bitcoinfees.earn(.)com and look for the recommended fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:57:39
meh, 50k is going for the safe choice. Should've been 100k, that would make things exciting.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:02:31

do you think this is Bcash? no one is in charge of anything here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:07:31
Wait for it, it's been only a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:46:41
to be honest, i'm happy that the uptrend stopped. The sudden increase after the 10k dip wasn't a healthy recovery. For the dip to be a normal correction, the price should stay at the current level  (between 15k-12k) for a little while.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:31:09


another FUD article written by a banker.

No problem. Take care of your coins!

It will, you did good (: see you at 21k in a few days
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:40:06
They will go down eventually. This is not the first time we've seen a spam attack,  the same thing happened back in november, the backlog reached +220k unconfirmed tx, with same amounts of complaints. A week later, we got back to 40 sat/b fees. Be patient.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:57:49
i fell for the 'dead cat bounce' yesterday and bought at 14k. fuck me!! i should've hodl that fiat :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:25:10
if you sent the coins 2 weeks ago, there's a chance that: it went through, or, got rejected by the network. Either way, post the tx so we can take a look.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:27:04
Disgusting. They know once BCH/BTC trading goes live, Bcash will crash in a matter of minutes. Gotta keep Roger happy for the time being, though.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:08:55


fucking who? 
original article is from CNBC, the new hub for bcash shilling and bitcoin FUD articles.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:26:29
Mempool clearing (although, seems like 170k tx is the new norm given the massive influx of new users over the past few months?), also, it is now accepting +70 sat/b tx. Price has gone down, not bad if you ask me, some consolidation around 14k-13k makes it seems like the big correction is having a healthy recovery. And altcoins are bleeding at the moment, going down by +10%, except ripple (wtf?). All in all, rest of the day should be interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:09:13
Get ready to buy cheap coins, or you'll regret it later when we reach 21k in the next few days. You've been warned.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:36:21

I believe you only need to decrypt the file in order to get the mnemonic phrase. A bit of google and i found something that could help
1) Open json file with Notepad and copy everything.
2) Go to 
3) Paste json file from Notepad, and the password.
4) Decode
If everything worked then you should see your private keys. Now go to Electrum wallet (if you don't have it, download it), click Restore/Import keys, follow the instructions and wait for it to sync. Electrum should now generate all the addresses and transactions associated with the private keys.
Tbh, when it comes to wallet.aes.json file, the hardest part is not knowing the password, but since you have it, you only need a tool to decrypt the file. If the above didn't work, ask google, he is your friend (:
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:33:12
A 508 sat/B fee should get your tx confirmed in at least 12 hours or more I believe. Just wait until it gets confirmed by the network
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:43:49
oh yeah, bitcoin is going down, and trolls + the usual FUD show up right on cue like clockwork. Get ready boys, this is gonna be an interesting weekend.

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:18:12


do you even know how bitcoin works?
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:30:38
Looking at the chart on 'bitcoinfees.earn', there are more unconfirmed tx in the 940-1101 Sat/b range, than in the 601-930 Sat/b range. 
I guess some people just want their coins as quickly as possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:33:57
They've been bcash supporters for a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:26:30


not even close. A big dip would be around 20% - 30% decrease in the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:17:17
Most of the CNBC staff are avid Bcash supporters, nothing new here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:17:00
OK. Everything looks fine to me, the multibit wallet shows 0btc meaning that the transaction went through. Might be a synchronizing issue with your Ledger? If it wasn't, then might be the fee is extremely low, it could take forever to confirm given how saturated the network is right now (240k uncofirmed transactions). If you still don't see your coins, I would advise you to wait, sooner or later, it will get confirmed or rejected (in this case, the coins will return to the original wallet). There are ways to redeem unspent outputs, but i'm not too familiar with them.
