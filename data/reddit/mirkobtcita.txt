I think merchants don't have enough incentives to keep bitcoins instead of exchange them for FIAT as soon as they're received

eheh yea sounded a bit rude but well, just try to ask a random guy walking in the street how much cash he got with him, I think the reply would be a big fat "fuck you" too :p

Totally a greedy btc lover here :D

He meant it's a dangerous question since it's like asking someone how much cash he got at home, people kill others for 50€ so I suppose it could be life threatening to disclose how much bitcoins someone owns
