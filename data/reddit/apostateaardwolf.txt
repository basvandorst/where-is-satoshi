If they're non holders, they don't affect the BTC price. Only if those actively participating in the BTC market act on these futures could there be some small effect. Again, don't let the tail wag the dog.


Absolutely, because there is no mandate to trade BTC when they settle, so no additional demand, no additional volume, no additional volatility.
BTC futures settled in cash are simply gambling for those with big money. It's no different to me walking into a bookmakers and betting on some old nag in the 3 o'Clock at Lingfield.

Be that as it may, the network is still having to process them even if that means ditching them and not confirming them, and that's not to mention remaining 900k transactions in the 2-70 sat/b range.

Whatever support given by wikileaks (something I just acknowledged and you neatly sidestepped), that fact stands out to me as more significant than anything else.
Snowden doesn’t trust wikileaks to do the right thing when it comes to releasing data.

It's not limited to uneducated people though either, at least that's what I'm finding as my more tech savvy degree educated friends come to me to talk about bitcoin.
Most people have no exposure to economic fundamentals(which are fundamentally driven by human psychology) unless they've elected to take economics courses in higher education. Certainly in the UK at least economic principle is not taught at equivalent high school level.
To most people the idea that money only has value because people believe in it is equivalent to saying money is magic.

@_date: 2017-12-19 17:30:59
And my take on that view is this:- 
If you had been around back then and had the opportunities they had would you not have availed yourself of them? 
Do you think our parents intended for us to be up shit creek?
Would you have looked into your crystal ball and said "no, for the sake of my kids I won't play this game"?
Of course you would have done the same as them, because they thought they were doing the best for **us**. How could they have foreseen the decoupling of productivity and wage growth. How could they have foreseen the meteoric rise of student loan costs. How could they have foreseen the pumping of property markets through the boom in structured credit which ultimately popped resulting in the recession of '08?
Yes it sucks that we are the first generation for perhaps 70-100 years who are worse off than our parents, but why let the media split us into two groups and pitch us against each other?
We need them, they need us. We're family, and yet the way people speak they want to be atomised and individualised and seperated. It's shameful

Setting fees is great and all, but what the jiminy christmas is the point of setting fees low when the mempool is flooded with nearly a million low fee transactions?
You can't have failed to look at the mempool metrics, right??
The only way to get a transaction confirmed in any kind of reasonable time frame right now is to bump the fee.
I mean I know we love to have each others cocks in our mouths round here in one big cryptocurrency circle jerk, but lets not kid ourselves. 
Look at the spike in 1-2 sat/b transactions that started on November 29. 
The network is susceptible to low fee transaction spamming, this does not make our lives easier in convincing people that BTC is the future of money.

Yes and their first iteration apparently only allows you to keep BTC within their app. So buy BTC using revolut and you can do 2 things with it. 
1. Keep it in your revolut BTC account
2. Send it to other revolut users.

I’m happy to acknowledge wikileaks positive actions in assisting Snowden upon leaving the US, but if he’s had faith in wikileaks raison d’etre he’d have given them the data, not Greenwald. 
Interesting to note that wikileaks had just leaked the DNC emails a couple weeks before Snowden tweeted that.

Just put your coins into a wallet like Electrum if you're concerned.
If you're a little braver put them on an exchange which is promising to split your coins and then join in  !

Depends whether the confidence that will arise from stability outweighs the desire of those who bought in just to get their free coins to sell.

Ok they’ve clearly relented then.
Still can’t get a date out of them for when they’re adding BTC. ‘Soon’ is the cookie cutter response at the moment 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:45:19
How do you know this?

Coinbase is an exchange which you can store you coins in if you wish.
Electrum is a wallet that's independent of any exchange, its software you have on your own PC.

What is your view on the almost 90k transactions stuck in the mempool?

OK so in the CME example, where the underlying asset is *not traded* how will their btc futures contracts affect the price?
Perhaps I'm missing something.

Firstly great post, have dealt with addiction myself albeit not gambling and dealt with family addictions too.
I wanted to ask though, 80% of coin use is gambling? Where are you getting those stats?

Thanks OP.

You have to wonder if the handling of electronic vs fiat currency in Mr Robot is a taste of things to come.
We're heading towards another crash IMO, debt levels are reaching the same point as they were 10 years ago. The US is about to go through an impeachment, the UK through Brexit, Russia is doing its damndest to sow troubles across the EU.
I think this next crash will see Bitcoin confirmed as a new hedge against paper/asset losses as gold usually is in every crash

I have Electrum wallets setup already but I couldn't find anything concrete about their S2X support nor how to see an S2X balance in the application once the fork occurs.

Same question
I’m using a similar app to invest my spare change. I’d like to diversify.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:38:33
No I’m saying that we should not pander to the lowest common denominator.
Cash is used for nefarious purposes but we don’t ban cash since it has way more valid uses. Bitcoin is also used for nefarious purposes and let’s not ban it either for the same reasons.

Ok so I’ve signed up and linked my account 
Few things
1. How can I see in coinflash the transactions that will roundup?
2. Can I setup additional deposit amounts?
3. When are roundups totalled To then be made into purchases on coinbase?
4. What are your fees?
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:24:45
When you’re comparing values of currencies you get into market psychology and at that point the value of a tradeable asset is what people are willing to pay for it, it’s simply a numeric representation of their confidence in the value of that asset.
