that s a completely nonsense statement. A currency being secure does not give it inherent value, that makes no sense whatsoever.

Except for the fact that it's value isn't backed up by anything whatsoever, it's only value is perceived future value. You know, like a bubble. And bubbles all eventually burst and I see no reason why this would be an exception.

The conversation was about it being a bubble. When I say that nothing backs it up I mean that there is nothing that secures it's value or prevents it from bursting, having inherent value is just one example of something that would do that. 
The fact that bitcoin has miners verifying their transactions does not prevent it from bursting. I've said it before but it's only value is based on perceived future value, that's exactly what a bubble is.

That bill does not at all mandate that people use correct pronouns. It just adds gender identity to the prohibited grounds of discrimination. The equivalent in US law would be to make gender identity a protected class.
Here's the full act, it's not super digestible but it should give you a good idea of what the amendment actually does.
But as a Tl;dr, as long as Dr Peterson isn't assaulting them or illegally denying them housing at the same time. he can misgender people all he likes with no legal repercussions.

Can you point to where exactly in the act it does that because I've just read through the entire thing and I didn't see anything that would suggest that.

Could you point to where in the act it says that because vie read through it and I cant see that anywhere.
