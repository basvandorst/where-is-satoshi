I mean its almost like the point of bitcoin is no regulation and sometimes regulation is needed in financial institutions to prevent stuff like this.

Absolutely, but people who find legal loopholes to do immorale things are still bad people.  You can hate the player AND the game.

Exploits dont have to be illegal.  Its a government program giving coupons to poor people, which people are then exploiting by receiving far too many and selling for bitcoin.

Yeah.... thats what a loophole is.
A poorly worded law that allows exploitation, doesnt matter if its by ignorance of the legislator, its still a loophole.

No you're literally arguing that an action is amoral because its not against the law(due to an oversighy by lawmakers) that's just dumb.
There are good and bad acts, exploiting a program designed for the poor is an immoral act, even if its legal.

Then you're mentally retarded. The government takes our collective incomes and makes good shit happen with it, if you screw over the government you're just fucking with the rest of us law abiding citizens trying to make rent.

I have a bit of crypto with Jaxx.  In light of their security issues are there any safe wallets that support both btc and eth in one attractive package?

In light of their security issues, Do you have a wallet you can recommend that supports both ETH and BTC ?

This is just stupid though.  I send money the entire way across the world regularly for 2% with world remit.
By the time you buy the coins and send them and sell them, it usually works out more expensive than that.  And then how can you expect technically illiterate people to download a wallet, store their key words, browse the exchanges etc, with these other services you just receive money into your bank almost immediately, easy peasy.
