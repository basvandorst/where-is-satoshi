Regardless of whether or not you ultimately prove to be correct about the underlying issue, the *"Use your brain"* comment is illegitimate, because it can just as easily be used by people who are *not* correct and *don't* have unspoken reasoning. 
It's better to either back up your position from the beginning or simply refrain from commenting, as using *"use your brain"* simply worsens the signal to noise ratio.

Are you under the impression that if someone cant prove your theory wrong it must be right?


I have no idea. But I find it interesting that you jump from a lack of knowledge on the subject directly to an arbitrary theory with the assumption of malice.
Instead of spouting, try discussion with the relevant parties *first*. It doesn't take much effort, and you'll get much more for your time.
I have very little knowledge of the situation and yet it took me about 30 seconds to find someone *on reddit* that you can ask instead of supposing.

Or, perhaps if that's not a big enough stage, you coud try and find a community somewhere where anyone can ask a question that gets seen by many....

What doesn't hold up?
None of this can really be determined by gut feelings. These are difficult and complex questions that economists and mathematicians have been studying for a long time. It's very interesting to discuss, but simply asserting that things are one way or another is not very useful. 
I'm not saying that deflation is really a problem. I'm simply laying out the argument so that it's clearer whether the idea has been properly addressed and/or refuted.
Edit: Got submitted several times for some reason. Deletes not working reliably : /
@_date: 2011-06-03 17:31:30
That's an interesting point, but doesn't completely refute the potential problem. The argument goes not that people won't be *ANY* spending if the currency is increasing in value, but rather that they won't spend *enough* to cross a threshold to keep the the economy going.
The idea being that if the economy is like a nuclear chain reaction, below a certain threshold it's not self sustaining; above the threshold it is. (not that it's necessarily true, but that's the idea)

Are you a professional (rather than armchair) economist?
@_date: 2011-05-20 16:28:39
Sorry I should have been more clear. I mean a deflationary system would reduce liquidity in addition to reducing the risk of boom/bust. I didn't mean to say that injecting liquidity would solve the boom/bust problem.
The benefit I meant to imply was that boom/bust causes boundry expansion and creation of new markets via entropy.
It does seem to have the major negative of increasing financial inequality if there's no reliable system (laws) to correct for it.
Btw: We have exited recession (officially) whether the fed increasing the money supply had a hand in doing that is something really hard to determine IMO.
Deflation discourages liquidity/risk taking which while good from one perspective, is bad from another.
@_date: 2011-05-10 14:51:07
The real and psychological effects of deflation do seem to have significant effects on markets and how people allocate and invest their capital. What keeps the deflation that is intrinsic to Bitcoin from being a problem? 
@_date: 2011-09-09 23:55:49
It does represent an economy of sorts, which it where it get's it value.  But you have to think of the economy that it represents in the abstract for it to make much sense.
Unfortunately a lot of the economy is a feeback loop/recursive which wildly increases its volatility.
@_date: 2011-09-09 23:52:46
It's value is in its utility for trading, and it's value for trading it tied to the "bitcoin economy" 
It is effectively an economy.

But so would the liquidity brought about by inflation. I'm not saying that boom/bust feels good as it happens, but it injects entropy into the system which can be looked at as a benefit from a certain perspective.
@_date: 2011-05-18 20:02:45


I think Bitcoin's solution is to deflate (i.e. the value of individual bit coins rises) and divide (Bitcoin is divisable to at least 8 decimal places). If Deflation is ignored as a problem in itself, it can solve a money supply problem.

*"Speculation can also cause prices to deviate from their intrinsic value if speculators trade on misinformation, or if they are just plain wrong. This creates a positive feedback loop in which prices rise dramatically above the underlying value or worth of the items. This is known as an economic bubble. Such a period of increasing speculative purchasing is typically followed by one of speculative selling in which the price falls significantly, in extreme cases this may lead to crashes."* -- Wikipedia Speculation article
Furthermore speculation on a price upswing reduces "consumption" which in the case of currency, is spending. And spending is just what a new currency needs to become viable and have stable prices.
It is reckless, but there probably will be some good to come from it for the currency itself as once the bubble pops, there will be lots more people around with bitcoins that they took a loss on which will hopefully spur spending on non currency items.

The critical issue is effect on spending.
Markets where spending dries up, become unhealthy.
Deflation *can be* bad because of what it does to spending. If the greater the value of your money in the future the less incentive there is to spend it now. Likewise, the lesser the value of your money in the future, the greater the incentive to spend it now.
@_date: 2011-05-13 16:46:17

If your response to the OP on this thread is illustrative, (and I've not dug into your comment history to find out) it would seem that it's really only the people who agree with you that you spare.
I'd also contend that the 1%-ers are built through positive re-enforcement, rather than punishment. And that punishment just discourages them from posting at all.
If you eliminate a 3%-er rather than pushing them to become a 2%-er, the next 3%-er to take their place will be worse and you'll be decreasing the signal to noise ratio, and making this a worse place for all of us.
And food for thought: Do you consider yourself a 1%-er? On my scale, your rudeness takes you from what would otherwise be fairly respectable position down to a 10%-er. I'm not sure if it's true in your case, but I've noticed a relationship between rudeness or insults, and intellectual laziness as it's an effective way to avoid addressing someone's issues and getting them to shut up.
IMO you should never try to shut someone up if they are discussing with you in good faith, as that is an opportunity to educate them and/or learn from them. Furthermore being rude actually weakens your rhetorical position and makes you seem like you are resorting to rudeness because you have no other option.
TL;DR: Who are you to be police, judge, and jury of someone discussing in good faith? Your rudeness "punishments" negatively affect the rest of us who would like to have civil discussion.

Assuming the market is working correctly the current price on the exchanges takes into account the expectation of increased value in the future.

The quote is ridiculous. The price of all three is determined by what people are wiling to pay for them. All three have intrinsic utility.
Bitcoins' intrinsic utility is enforced by math and existing infrastructure, but it is somewhat self referential as it's properties are only useful in as much as it's a currency.
The dollar has at least two utilities enforced by the power of the state:
 * You can pay taxes with them.
 * US entities are required to accept them as payment of existing debt.

Be careful. Decimal separators are not universal, and it especially matters with bitcoin because 3 decimal places precision would not be uncommon.

There's plenty to be argued about with regard to publicly funded medical assistance programs, but being glib is irresponsible. If you're going to use this as an argument, please get it right.
1. You have the stats wrong. [1-in-7 had "adverse effects" from errors, and 1-in-5 of those died as a result]( which is ~ 3% vs the 17% you quoted. Off by a factor of 6.
  1.a Of the errors studied 44% were preventable, meaning the researchers are saying 66% were not preventable.
1. This is only significant with respect to Medicare when compared to the general population of patients. The general population is already at heavy risk for "adverse effect" or death from medical error.
1. Medicare patients as a population are much older than average putting them at higher risk than the general public. Comparisons would need to control for age demographic.
1. There're no "Medicare hospitals" so the same doctors and hospitals are practicing on everyone else. The only difference would be related to funding structure for medicare patients (which is the meat of any arguement IMO).
1. When discussing this with respect to changing public policy, comparison is only relevant vs an alternative, and said comparison would need to include "adverse effects" and death of those who are not covered by the alternative system.
1. [The stats we're discussing are not new enough to evaluate the new changes meant to adjust funding toward outcomes rather than treatment.](
**EDIT: Correct stats from 20% to 17%. Thanks.**
