got to respect someone who will put it all on the line to see something through like that

Wow, this is amazing. Thanks for the link!

When this whole debate began, I thought he was a software developer who hadn't studied economics and thus couldn't understand Bitcoin's most valuable properties (ie it's decentralization, security, immutability, and finite supply). 
But after watching Mike and Gavin through this tenuous divide,  I'm convinced they are both government shills trying to coopt Bitcoin into some sort centralized government controlled ledger.

I want to show some love for the BTC friendly VPN I have been using for over a year now. mullvad   : mullvad.net
1) You don't need to create an account
2) You can pay with Bitcoin
3) You can configure your own OpenVPN client, if you don't trust their VPN client, which is very nice.
Pay as you go too! :)

agreed ...
stop trying to scare people in to thinking we need to do everything another alt coin does. that's why there are alt coins. so there can be experimentation and competition.
Forking bitcoin, just to "keep up" with other alt coins seems like a risky thing to do when Bitcoin already represents 82% + of the market share of all crypto currencies.

This seems like a valuably proposal. I hope it is investigated further, by Bitcoin holders and developers.

"Back-story of me: up until a couple years ago I was a Portfolio Manager for the largest hedge fund in Colorado."
...Wow, you were a high profile sales guy for a company that sold Wall Street services? With those credentials, you must be legit PRO at crypto.
"I started watching Bitcoin early, very early in fact, and I’ve made tens of thousands of Crypto trades over the past 5 years with overall much success."
...not just early guys, "very early in fact". So early he couldn't even say the year; impressive. Damn, thousands of trades. He must keep his coins locked up on an exchange that controls his keys. That's a classic veteran move.
"Disclaimer: I’m long ETH but not BTC."
Thanks for warning us about Wall Street; we always knew they were no good tricksters. Oh and good luck going long JP Morgan coin.

I've been using Mullvad, without problems, for over a year now. I'm even on it right now!
That being said, there are probably some other good options out there. My only advice is don't use a service which requires you to create an account with your personal information. You should be able to send them Bitcoin and get an account number sent to you to use.

I should have noted that they don't specifically talk about Bitcoin. Instead he is highlighting why immutability is important.

It doesn't matter what "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong" thinks about BIP 101 . The miners and holders will decide what version of Bitcoin we are running in 5 years.
This site is somewhat helpful in seeing the ground XT has made  .
My opinion, which also doesn't matter, is that the block size will stay at 1 MB for at least another 2-3 years. Past that, I still think there is a better than 50% chance the blocksize limit won't ever move. Small transactions can be performed on altcoins / side chains. It's most important that Bitcoin stays decentralized and thus more censorship proof.
@_date: 2015-11-04 00:21:13
It's probably because the adoption of BIP 101 would make the network more centralized and thus easier to censor. Rather than many small nodes running to validate the integrity of the block chain, it would encourage fewer (more powerful) nodes.
Just as "The Empire" wanted to consolidate all galactic power underneath a single sith lord, BIP 101 advocates want to consolidate Bitcoin nodes under a few large corporations.
Somehow this seems relevant :

is exclusively for paid shills and eth pumpers.
is for those same paid shills and misguided UASF / Segwit supporters.
Once or twice a year a new group of "Bitcoin Experts" tries to hardfork the network. Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited. Bitcoin UASF. 
Bitcoin doesn't care about either sub reddit, any group of "experts" pushing for a hard fork, or this comment.
If Bitcoin doesn't care, neither should you.
Stay calm and HODL
