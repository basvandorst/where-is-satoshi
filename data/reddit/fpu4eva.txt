why not a token? you buy a token worth so many BTC through a good or service that exchanges to Bitcoin in the site so your buying tokens to buy the BTC to get around  of their acceptable use policy
I solved the issue by getting a prepaid paypal card and linking it to coinbase but still

not if the paypal money is a gift and the BTC is a gift. just sucks i have 250 bucks on paypal and want to pay sub 900 just to get some darn BTC

Cash App is by Square, its a alternative to coinbase to buy BTC, however a friend got banned from the services he was reselling coin and they got dirty somehow(go Monero) but Im thinking about getting a bank account and using Cash App instead of Localbitcoins since the walmart2walmarts sell coin at a high markup.

also let us not forget Darkcoin which is now DASH  
I remember it being used on the deep web back in the day, its almost identical to Bitcoin, but it has a built in tumbler IIRC
