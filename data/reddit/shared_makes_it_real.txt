I've never been on the bitcoin forums. I knew what would happen because I understand the tech and what is and isn't possible. I along with a bunch of other people on this sub regularly answered questions as we saw them come up. You didn't know because you didn't try to find out. You invested in something you didn't understand.

I'm going to call it before I read the article: It's a denial of service attack.
/goes to read article
Edit: called it. $80k to bring down the network temporarily doesn't seem like a big deal. The article compares the cost to a zero day but... zero day attacks are generally assumed to be attacks that give you admin access to otherwise secured systems. $80k+ to get a zero day attack that gets you into the database of a banking corporation makes sense. What's the payoff for $80k to stall the network? That's a weird comparison.

You know you're probably right. But why the fuck would I care?
Growing up "criminals" were people who were going to hurt me. But now it's 2018 and someone who smokes weed is a criminal. Someone who releases information on illegal activity of the government is a criminal. Someone who tries to create a local ISP is a criminal. Someone who tries to produce derivative works of art based on stories that have been in the public domain is a criminal.
None of these people are a threat to my safety anybody else's.
But someone who launders USD to drug cartels isn't a criminal. Someone who caused the 2008 housing crash isn't a criminal. Someone who shoots an unarmed citizen isn't a criminal. Someone who seizes cash without proof of guilt is a criminal.
Frankly? If this is the way things are going to continue then I've picked my side. Sounds like you have too. I look forward to seeing who history portrays as the bad guys.

No it cannot be forced. For all intents and purposes of a fork BCH succeeded. It proved that if there is a problem with bitcoin a fork can be launched without asking anybody for permission. The *only* failure of BCH was they forked on what the majority of nodes and miners didn't see as a problem. If lack of privacy results in issues of fungibility I expect the client developed by the core team will be altered to fix this. If not I expect there would be a fork which I would happily follow.

Has there been legislation to indicate it must be treated differently than gold? A cursory research on google indicates you only must report gold when you sell it (a taxable event). Sellers are also required to report the buyer if it's over a certain amount. But I'm not seeing anything to indicate you are legally obligated to report, say, the $200 worth of gold you purchased nor is the seller required to obtain your identification info so that they can report who it was sold to.

I'm skeptical that the commenter I responded to even has the bitcoin core client installed.
But you bring up another interesting point that so often people who come in here and complain miss: The code is open source. If you go pull the code, make the change and put in a pull request that is denied then I'll respect your complaint/disagreement/whatever because you've *sacrificed* for what you believed would make the client better. Prior to that? Your complaints are a waste of the electricity used to deliver it. Complaining is easy and everybody does it. If you want to be heard then do something difficult.

Bitcoin is already a usable currency today. You're asking how can bitcoin continue to be a usable currency. Sure, if enough people use it at the same time it gets slow and expensive. But that doesn't make it unusable any more than traffic jams make freeways unusable. If enough people decide to use some other means of payment the lanes clear up and everyone still using it is happy again. Of course everyone here would like to see bitcoin grow to support as many transactions as Visa but that isn't necessary for bitcoin to continue being a usable currency.

What someone can afford to lose is generally 5%-10% of their net worth. For someone who's 45 I'd say its closer to 5%. So yeah if she has a net worth of $2,000,000 (or rather $1,910,000~) then she didn't break the rule. But if she's got that much socked away I dunno why she's thinking she's common people.

Computers store numbers with proceeding zeros (well sort of, the actual answer is more complicated). When PCs store numbers they do it in a block of memory selected by the programmer. Generally speaking they are 4 byte or 8 byte blocks. (Smaller sizes are used where there are memory constraints.) If you enter the value of 1 and it gets stored in one of these blocks it's stored as 0 0 0 1.
I'm glossing over a lot of exceptions and other minutia that aren't relevant here.

In case anybody is wondering why there's so much negativity here, the most popular way these sites come about is essentially providing a way to get bitcoin out of stolen credit cards. Person steals card, signs up on a site like this, gets an amazon order, they make the order and send it to your house. No way to know who the thief was.
To my knowledge there's no good way to vet these sites for such issues. I'm as excited for bitcoin adoption as the next person but be responsible. If you make purchases on these sites don't whine about bitcoin being broken when the police knock on your door.

You may be aware of this but "Number of zeros" can be correct if you're talking about base-2. When you're dealing with a number that's represented in hex it's often assumed that whatever you say about it is in the context of base-2 because that's how you operate on it. The last step is to convert it to hex so a human can read it.

Bitcoin is another tool people can use to protect their wealth. People have a hard time understanding that concept so it's a tough sell. Know what isn't a tough sell? 40x gains in a year. Each boom brings in more population to this community. A percentage of that population begins to learn about the technologies and economics of bitcoin. Hard sell achieved.

This needs to be repeated ad nauseam. So many people involved seem completely unaware of the distinction. This isn't a matter of gatekeeping; asking if an ICO/Blockchain/CryptoCurrency provides any advantages over a private distributed database is a good litmus test for determining if someone is running a scam.
And for further clarification, there's plenty of space for innovation in the realm of private distributed databases. But as soon as someone attaches the term "blockchain" or "cryptocurrency" to them they're being ignorant at best and outright scammers at worst.

Processing and verifying the transactions is a pretty trivial amount of computing power. Most (read: 99.99999% or something) of the processing power is devoted to hashing a block.

@_date: 2018-05-12 20:13:02
Here ya go:
"Stop thinking of bitcoin as a physical thing. Bitcoins are just numbers on a ledger. Think back to a time when banks used paper ledgers instead of computers. You gave someone $100 and they wrote down your name and a deposit of $100. You don't own $100 anymore. You own the ability to manipulate that ledger now. You can withdraw from the ledger if you like to get your dollars back. But you could also pay someone else who has an entry on that ledger. At that point you've completely disconnected from cash and you're just agreeing that the ledger is keeping track of some abstract count. You could all call it 100 keystones if you wanted. Now think about what happens if one day everyone involved with that ledger agrees that no more keystones can be added. There are a total of 1000 keystones across all accounts. Now when someone wants a keystone they have to find a willing seller. How much is a keystone worth? It depends on one predictable measure, which is how much people trust the accuracy of the ledger. And a less predictable measure which is, how many people want in on that ledger. So you hear about these keystones when there's a hard limit of 1000 and decide since paid $1 for them and you need to put your money somewhere safe you're willing to pay $1.00 + $.20 for that service and as luck would have it, you find someone willing to sell some keystones at that price. At some point people in the next town over hear about the keystones and have been looking for something safe and know that you and some others have been paying $1.20 for them and they decide that $1.20 + $.20 is worth the security as well and they too find sellers. Keystones now have a value that is entirely independent of the cash they originally represented."

The "block" consists of a hash of the previous block, the transactions and the nonce. The nonce is there so you can try to hit the target. I have heard that sometimes they will sometime reorder the transactions but I don't know if that's common.

Good news has to be believed by people who didn't believe before to drive up the price. In 2013 too many people got burned by Mt.Gox for some positive news to make a difference in someone's mind. People's minds only started changing once the miners bumped their prices to remain profitable.
This time I think all the shitcoins have made a lot of doubters. They're all making these grand claims so whatever (real) good news claims bitcoin has are ho-hum by comparison and tainted by general skepticism.
This is why a lot of people think the halvening will be the next run up. It's the only thing that can (nearly) force the price higher and then series of doubters will start thinking they're about to miss the boat again as it continues to rise.
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:42:35
Eh. Different needs. I think they have a symbiotic relationship. Bitcoin seems like it's making spending easier at the expense of some security. Monero is more focused on the security. Atomic swaps mean people can get the best of both worlds.

That's kinda true with the way supply chains work today. OTOH if you can reimagine the supply chain not as a bunch of agnostic carriers but rather a series of people who actually purchase the product (and adding a fee for their services along the way). You can trust the carrier to deliver the product to the intended recipient because otherwise they end up with an item that isn't relevant to their effort. And you can trust a recipient to only pay for an item they have actually received.

As others have expressed, I think you're making a mistake not using a hardware wallet.
That being said, I didn't use one at first (they didn't exist when I started) so I got myself an old machine and booted up Linux. Burned a CD with a web page that could generate a public address for me. Used my phone to and grab the public address QR code and wrote down the private key and stored it in a couple different places. Every few month I would check that both keys were readable and would verify I could generate the public key. When I decided to sell some I went through the entire process again and sent $10 to the address. Then I went through the process of creating a transaction on the disconnected computer and then get the transaction off using a QR code. I did this multiple times before attempting it with my cold wallet. Finally I did it with the cold wallet and everything went fine.
I didn't lose any money, I didn't need a hardware wallet and it only took me about 20 hours total to manage it.
So yeah you might wanna reconsider a hardware wallet.

First of all:
I don't recommend doing this. Not because it can't work but because you're asking questions and I think that means you need a lot of practice with this stuff before you should "do it in prod" so to speak.
But, as you have nerd sniped me.
PGP is great and all but you're relying on software you don't fully understand. I saw an article just the other day that said something about a vulnerability in it. If we're talking &lt;$10k then PGP is probably fine. If it's more I would recommend something a little simpler and bullet proof.
XOR ciphers are easy to understand and write yourself but they have some of their own problems. First being that people can iterate through them quickly and if they have *some* idea of what the output might start with that can significantly reduce the time it takes to crack. (Say the first word of a seed from a seed list that everybody uses.) XOR ciphers work best when the correct result doesn't look different from an incorrect result. It also helps to pad the beginning with something irrelevant. You'll still need some kind of marker to indicate to yourself where the actual key starts just don't tell anybody what marker you chose. Lastly don't use the same cipher anywhere else. Combining two values produced from the same cipher can give huge clues to what the original values were.
Again, I don't recommend doing this but if you want to research and play around with it then it's a great exercise. Hell, put up bounties to see if people can crack a $10 private key.

Banks are in a bind. They're running on old (read: ancient) technology which prevents them from providing the quick response times the internet generations have come to expect.
It's not impossible for them to upgrade but some of this code is so old that nobody who wrote it in the first place is still alive. And it's in a language running on a platform most people have never touched. So it's hugely expensive because whatever method you choose (specialized consultants, reverse engineering, business rule investigations) are all very time consuming. So most banks just opt not to do it.
TSB made the mistake of thinking they could do it on the cheap.
@_date: 2018-05-02 05:44:15
Yeah a few things were causing the high fees:
1. Lots of transactions going back and forth when the price is going crazy.
2. Segwit hadn't been added.
3. Coinbase wasn't batching transactions.
The last one was almost undeniably (personal opinion: was undeniably) the cause. Of course there's something to be said for a single exchange being able to clog the network like that but it was also just bad business unless they were getting kickbacks from the miners somehow.
Anyway, on top of all of this LN is looking very promising for "cup of coffee" purchases and will be faster and cheaper. So yeah, things are going well. :D
P.S. Get a hardware wallet and get your coins off this "backwater exchange" ASAP. Or look into creating a secure cold storage wallet. Remember "If you don't control the keys you don't control your bitcoin." Don't get caught up in the next Mt.Gox  
P.P.S. My favorite use case for bitcoin these days is splitting checks. Anybody who uses Venmo is usually open to accepting bitcoin. Usually because "I wanted to get some but I didn't know how." If you're sitting right there offering to send them $20 of it most people won't even hesitate.

The hash isn't encrypted and hashing is not encryption.
What I said is that block chain has no strict technical definitions so no evaluation of your statement can be made. The "common sense" definition you gave included terms with strict technical definitions which did not match the bitcoin spec. Then you said something that is not only false but would be an odd thing to do. (I don't know that there is anything in existence which encrypts hashes as I'm not sure what the point would be)
Now that you've expanded on how you interpret the term block chain I can make an evaluation on your original statement. You're wrong.
The point is this: you have absolutely no clue what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:19:19
"Blockchain" has no strictly defined technical definition so there's no way to evaluate your statement from a technical perspective.
EDIT: I think the people downvoting me are misunderstanding what I'm saying. Bitcoin has a very technical definition (the code which enforces the protocol). I believe in the value of the decentralized nature of that protocol.
That being said when someone says "block chain" they could mean anything. I think we as a community should stop using that term because it has no technical definition. While I agree with the commenter below that there are definitions that would fit well, at this point we will never be able to get the term back. Our efforts would be much better spent avoiding it altogether.

It's important to remember that the ability to fork the project is a *good* thing. I don't care for BCH but I will adamantly defend their ability to fork the project.

That's not what most people mean when they say "blockchain" though is it?


What would be ideal for newbies is if there were no bad actors giving bad definitions of the term. But we don't live in that world. This means as soon as we say there is a definition there are dozens of definitions to choose from. Most of them coming from questionable sources or outright bad actors.

You're equating understanding something with understanding how to use it. Most people who understand how to use the internet don't understand anything about the internet. User experience can be tailored to abstract away literally any degree of complexity of the underlying functionality to target different kinds of users.

But at the end of the day they provide a solid service and need to make money from it. If they don't make money then nobody else will get the idea to start their own exchange which means coinbase would become this stagnant entity running unopposed in the U.S. market.
So I pay the fees. It's another way I see myself supporting bitcoin as a whole.

Are you under the impression that the ability for several independent partners to compare several ledgers is a new capability? Because it's not.
I've been pretty consistent about this but you're all over the place talking about economics and currencies and whatever else you can think of. All I'm trying to figure out is what recent innovation was introduced by this "blockchain" thing you keep talking about that is somehow different from bitcoin.

I'm not worried about a 51% attack because at the end of the day it's a double spend. Not a good thing obviously but it's not the end of the world. And once it happens it creates a unified incentive for everyone to make all existing mining hardware obsolete with a code change.

Actually we're not following the hype. Block chain was cool when it meant "decentralized authority ledgers".

Yeah I guess I don't understand the "wall" part. I had no problem sending transactions the last time around. For low priority payments I didn't care if it took a couple days and for the higher ones I paid a fee. If that's a "wall" I wonder how they perceive... every other system?

Dominance in terms of market cap? Hate to break it to you but ICO market caps are completely made up. Creating a token with a supply of 100 and selling one to your buddy for $1,000,000 doesn't make a $100,000,000 market cap.

Safest bet:
1. You owe the some percentage on the winnings. The total value at the time you received it.
2. Don't sell to cover it if possible. This will result in another taxable event. Or if you can calculate the taxes of the sale plus the taxes owed on the winnings do that.
3. If you do sell/spend that's another taxable event and if the value has gone up since winning the bitcoin you owe taxes on that. If it's been over a year since you've won the bitcoin the tax rate will be lower.
Inevitably someone is going to reply to my comment with "taxation is theft". Not here to argue on the merits of taxation. Just letting you know what will likely be seen as a "good faith" effort by the IRS should they audit you and discover these winnings.

There are an infinite number of places I can keep a piece of paper in my house. Even if someone was specifically looking for it I'm confident I could select a spot that would take several hours to find. Hell if you write it on one page of a certain book on a bookshelf you could probably *tell them* that's what you did and it would still take a while to find it.

The older the transaction the higher priority it gets. Sometimes the nodes clear it from memory before it gets a high enough priority to be confirmed and resubmitting will put it back.
Most of the time when I've put too small a fee resubmitting the transaction after a day or so will get it confirmed.

"What if you forget what random book it's in?"
This is an excellent risk you've identified. I can think of a few ways to mitigate it.
1. Set an obscure alert on your phone once a month reminding you to go pick up the book and find the seed.
2. If you realize you've forgotten the book that it's in spend some time trying to find it. I feel like most people could flip through all the books in their house in a few hours.
3. If you can't find it then consider it lost. Time to make a new seed.
\ can also be used if someone has unknowingly stolen or destroyed your seed.
Multiple types of backups are great! I'm not discouraging having an encrypted back up. I'm just saying don't make that your only type of backup. Use multiple backup styles to mitigate different kinds of risks. Human memory loss is something that you should protect against.

They would have to deliver this offer simultaneously to all bitcoin users and it would have to be accepted immediately. A moment later and the game theory kicks in. If people A,B,C are presented with the offer by attacker X and A, B accept C knows that X is now $20k in the hole if it doesn't work. They also know that the $10k offer doesn't expire. X wants to destroy bitcoin today, tomorrow whenever. So C counters with $10.5k.  Repeat this a few times until X has run out of money.

It is. Digital security is very complicated. Not much can be done about that.
Given all the "hacks" and data leaks we have these days I encourage everybody I know to start learning about this stuff for their own protection. The concepts you need to learn about how to identify a company with fake digital security are the same you would need to set something like this up.
If you don't have the interest then you can wait until there's enough demand for an actually secure payment system that companies pop up to manage this for you.

I'm aware it wasn't the point of my comment. The fact is that in many parts of the world you can send a text message (informally referred to as SMS) where you can't establish a TCP connection (informally referred to as "internet access") to a node in order to broadcast a transaction. In addition to that some mobile phone plans provide text messaging capabilities without providing the ability to establish TCP connections.
So whether or not SMS is being used over GSM and repackaged in SMTP over IP, pulled using POP3 or IMAP by a proprietary client at the service provider level which then delivers a push notification to a custom HTTP service running as a part of the mobile phone's core operating system and persisting the message to messages app on the recipient's smart phone is irrelevant. But your pedantry is noted.

Sorry, but I think you've hung around too many aging bankers. We don't *want* contracts that can be voided because they eat into someone's bottom line.

The problem I have is that he said it's "direct". As if those deaths wouldn't have happened without bitcoin. He also says it's a rare for a technology to be this way. Personally I don't see how he can say that when you can make the same argument about:
- The personal computer
- Windows
- The internet
- The web browser (Internet Explorer if he hadn't lost the browser wars)

If you're asking about "internet access" specifically you can send transactions using SMS. I can't tell from your comment if you were intending to ask how you can send a transaction without any network access. The answer to that is you can't. But the importance of being able to send over SMS is that those networks are more widely available and more efficient than full internet access.

As someone who's been involved since 2013 I'm using it more than ever before. All the merchants I purchase from on a regular basis don't accept it and that doesn't seem to be changing anytime soon. However, the recent change is that more people want it and it's not weird to offer to pay someone in it. Now when I need to pay someone for gas I ask if they want bitcoin. Split the check? Bitcoin. Price aside I've been *very* encouraged by the general attitudes towards bitcoin. We're on the right track in my mind.

@_date: 2018-02-20 15:45:45
You're right. I must admit I am skeptical that any proof of stake crypto will survive long term. It seems like it'll quickly result in the "landlord" problem because there's zero cost to just sitting on it and you wield tremendous power over the network for doing so. In bitcoin in order to continue being a competitive miner you have to keep building more, better, faster machines.
That being said, it's too early to say. I'm just speculating here.

I disagree. I think as they hire blockchain experts they learn every line of business they're familiar with is dramatically changed. They've always been able to rely on the fact that people can't safely store their own wealth. Think about every other service a bank offers and how it all hinges on that. Loan interest, the very life blood revenue of a bank is when they allow you to use money from other people's savings. Fractional reserve or no this requires that someone with a positive debt to balance ratio has an incentive to give the bank money. People won't pull everything of course but it will result in lower account balances which means less loans or higher interest rates but a lower bottom line regardless.
I don't think this will end all banking but for the first time in a long time the banks are going to be the ones tightening their belts.

Ultimately I don't see the point.
Every *real* feature of Cryptocurrencies has either come directly from bitcoin (segwit) or could be adopted should people decide that's the way to go (anonymous transactions). I appreciate the Litecoin, Ethereum and XMR for allowing us to learn some lessons from their efforts.
Currently which coins you buy depends entirely on the devs you trust because "the big four" can all mimic each others distinct features with very little effort.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:21:03
The private key protects against brute force access but as someone has pointed out it's vulnerable to physical access if you use a printer.
So to protect against that you encrypt the key with a passphrase which gives some additional protection against physical access.

Said another way "HODL means don't sell. Spend. Don't sell."
That's really all there is to it. Over the long term between your money being in fiat and bitcoin the latter will win. Bitcoin versus a car? A house? Financial independence? Absolutely a great exchange for most people.

I think so, and a lot of other hodlers do too apparently. We're tired of the pseudo security of the stock market and a government that steps in every time the price takes a tumble. That isn't a sustainable model. Bitcoin pull backs, and the repeated demonstration of our ability to handle it are what prove to me that we're in a healthy market.

What's your background? If you have some technical knowledge read about private key / public key signing. Read about mining and how that works.
If you aren't technical I'd start with an exchange account and small amounts. No buys or transactions greater than $10. (Or smaller depending on your budget.) Experiment with it. Buy a hardware wallet. Send some money to it. Reset the wallet and recover the seed using your secret words. Read up on common ways people have lost money with a hardware wallet and take a mental note not to do what they did.
Read the white paper even if you don't understand it.

Exactly. I feel confident that if I did get called into a courtroom over this I wouldn't be charged with a crime. There's simply too many unknowns for me to treat a fork any differently than a stock split.

1. What would the amount be? There's no monetary value associated with the forked coin until it's sold. And if we go off the first sale I, a single individual with a regular computer, could go fuck everyone right now with that logic. Go create a shit coin, create functional marketplace, sell shit coin to myself for $1,000,000. Do you and everybody else who holds owe based on that number? Of course not. Alternatively I could spam shitcoin forks for much smaller sale amounts and achieve the same goal.
2. Even if we assumed that were the case, another exploit is now you are *legally obligated* to sign up for my marketplace since it's the only one where you can trade my shitcoin. I'll take all your social security numbers now thanks.
3. Nothing about my asset changed what changed is how I can sell it. This is the same as a stock split which from my cursory research is not a taxable event.
I appreciate that IRS tax law doesn't have to make sense but this interpretation of a taxable event is so easily exploitable I can't see any way they would enforce this.
I should clarify that if you *sell* Bitcoin Cash that it is *taxable event* and your profit is *taxable income* of course. But a hard fork is not a *taxable event*.

I used turbo tax and signed up for audit protection. I made all my answers in good faith so if I did screw up at worst I expect I'll be told I owe a little more plus interest.

hodl, spend and replace, moon tier.
I used some of my btc to buy a house. Yes btc will probably go up. But I've always wanted a house. For me it was a good thing to spend money on.
I use spend and replace to split bills with friends. Most people are interested in owning a little Bitcoin but aren't about to go through a big validation process to buy $20 worth. I replace it with more Bitcoin buys.
Hodl. The ride isn't over.

My understanding is audit protection gives me some resources when working through an audit with the IRS. And yeah I'm not worried about owing more plus interest. It will be minimal compared to what I've already paid.
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:47:47
Exactly. Stock splits aren't taxable events. Neither are forks. *Selling* a forked coin *is absolutely* a taxable event.

You're wrong.
I "received" Bitcoin Cash at the moment of the fork. (My coins are in cold storage so I didn't receive anything.) What was the value of Bitcoin Cash the moment of the fork? It didn't have one. No valuation existed until it was sold for the first time.
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:01:49
If you haven't sold you don't owe anything. The people saying a fork is a taxable event don't know what they're talking about.

He's not exactly disagreeing with you. The fact that there is no public alternative (if we exclude bitcoin for a moment) creates an uncomfortable blur between government overreach into the behaviors of private companies versus the human rights of citizens.

Fiat isn't going to disappear. Hate to break it to you but the existence of bitcoin actually incentivizes "responsible" inflation. The people we are at odds with are greedy. Not stupid.

The assumption is the miners collectively raise their prices because they all feel the pressure equally. There is also the assumption that buyers don't fight the price hike because it corresponds to a known event.
That being said, like all thoughts market related there's any number of reasons this all goes sideways.

The security model of IOTA is based on the idea that the largest number of nodes dictate what is the real chain. Meaning anyone controlling enough IP addresses can spoof their own chain.

OP there's no real better information than this. Buy a hardware wallet and practice with a small amount for a week or so. Send between wallets, recover from seed etc. Once you feel good about handling that with $10 move onto larger amounts. I'm assuming given your questions that you don't have a lot of background in digital cryptography. (Nothing wrong with that.) In that case I recommend people buy two wallets so they can continue to experiment before making large transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:56:49
Yes. You're right ofc. The problem was that prior to bitcoin there was no way to transact value across the internet without the help of a private company which makes things... murky.
Fortunately that's no longer an issue.

Imagine you've met a friend in person and gave them a sheet of paper with a bunch of holes in it. A few weeks later you mail them a letter. The letter is fairly innocuous. Hello, hope you're doing well. All that.
When they lay the sheet over letter there is a letter visible through each hole in the sheet. They spell out the phrase "buy bitcoin".
You can use the same technique with digital files and hide information in an image.

Seems like two modes of thought here.
Some people have already benefitted from bitcoin so it's a bit easier for them to operate a node at a "loss" because they're still well in the black.
Others are interested in long term profitability. Sounds like for now you'd be operating at a minor loss.

Buy $10 of Bitcoin at $10k. (For easy calculation) - No taxes.
Bitcoin price goes to $20k. Now you have $20 in Bitcoin. - Not a taxable event.
Use $10 of Bitcoin to buy Ethereum. - Taxable event. You owe the fed/state government 30% in taxes on the gains. You bought the $10 for $5 so you owe ($10 - $5) x .3 = $1.50
Under the new law the purchase of Ethereum wouldn't be considered a taxable event. You're still responsible for the taxes on the gains if you sell for fiat or goods.
Although some are saying the bill also provides exceptions for small purchases. This explanation is concentrated on the "like-kind" exchanges between different Cryptos.

I mean, shouldn't we be asking the question? When women entered the work force a lot of them were basically hookers. No judgment against those women at all.

It doesn't have much to do with intelligence. I'd wager even a person with under average intelligence can understand digital cryptography enough to use it safely and be aware of it's vulnerabilities. That being said, there's a lot of misinformation around it simply because most people don't understand it. Fortunately I see the rise in Cryptocurrencies having the added benefit of separating fact (as demonstrated by not losing ones coins) and fiction (where erroneous beliefs result in your money being stolen).
