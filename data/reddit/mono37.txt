Any advice on anything I should change in my video submission would be greatly appreciated! Assuming we are allowed to do that before the deadline???
Thanks guys..

the one with the original steve jobs audio??
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:47:11
I made this effort this evening! Let me know what you guys think! It probably won't win, but I hope maybe that if we all make an effort it might draw attention to this! Cheers guys..

Think Different Think Bitcoin: Apple and the Bitcoin Blues
I made this video (and song) because of the recent news that Apple decided to remove the last remaining Bitcoin wallet which was available on its store. Surely this would go against Steve Jobs' motto , which was always to think different?
Bitcoin is the future

Here is the youtube version of the bitcoin/apple vid I made earlier :)
Cheers 
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:34:44
Which one would that be? .. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:47:47
I gave up on this competition hours ago..
Shame on whoever is manipulating votes or whatever they are doing.. but ..
I made my vid because I wanted to say something to Apple about Bitcoin I enjoyed making it anyhow and the competition doesn't matter now... all the vids deserved recognition..
who cares :)
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:50:47
well done to the winner :)
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:11:10
So sorry to hear so many people lost so much bitcoins on MtGox. I made this video and song about it. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:43:01
Any chance of a 1st , 2nd and 3rd prize competition ? :) 
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:26:06
hey, yeah I understand, I will enter the last one I posted if that's ok? 
Sorry, probably just got a bit ahead of myself.
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:22:14
Check out my tunes here!
Bitcoins accepted..
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:49:01
I noticed a lot of similar names indeed, mine was first to be posted in the beginning, as far as I am aware..
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:51:28
Thanks, I thought the volume was ok, took it from the original video, it was the first to be submitted.. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:13:51
In what way? I am new to Reddit! Just figuring it out as I go along!
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:54:10
thats cool!
Well, I'll decide before the deadline then, thanks for creating this, its great to get into making creative ways to highlight bitcoin!
Thanks again..
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:41:27
I hope that the competition is fair in the end.. fairly new to reddit , not sure how it all works to be honest... 
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:21:23

@_date: 2014-03-04 23:26:14

Suicide is always terrible , no matter what the circumstances are.. RIP. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:57:08
This competition can't be fair, sorry I bothered now, half of the entries are variations on my original idea, which was the first one entered and posted... anyhow, good luck all :) 
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:42:40

I just kinda threw it together and recorded it with my guitar and mic..
glad you like it.. very kind!
thanks again..
