This Coinbase stuff is making me Crazy. If the bubble bursts it would be nearly impossible to Cash out. Now it's total Chaos already

there a several issues with SEPA Withdrawals from the 12th of dec. 
We are discussing legal action against you right now, around 30 people are waiting for withdraws longer than 18 days. Please LOOK into it, I wrote several support tickets, you always say that some expert will look into it, then nothing happens. People are loosing trust, and rightly so.
my most recent ticket: Case 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:21:29
Yeah and sadly Coinbase only reacts to bad PR. I have the feeling if he did not have the sucess with his thread Coinbase would have ignored him 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:49:59
hehe nice idea, could you post links to the most funny discussions? Sorry I'm lazy :-)
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:56:05
12th dec and nothing received, look here
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:07:16
Yeah, but no reason to delete the thread which had many complaints about other issues with Coinbase.
There are many people who are waiting for SEPA withdrawals (mostly the timeframe around the 12th of dec). Like this:

Thank you! I didn't realize that it was so easy and that even transactions from segwit to non-segwit count as segwit, so there's NO reason not to upgrade.
Super cool, thanks!

Here you will see this:
There is "pending".

no, he used Mario Paint.

I blame the bad state of transaction"times" in April-May, they were terrible, but I feel around these times the doomsday sayers were the loudest. I really hope the coming "storm" will be forgotten at the end of the year.

and it's totally wrong right now, 360 satoshis/byte is way too much. I just paid 40 s/byte und in went through in 5 minutes
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:00:17
atm there are not really much transaction, it should go through. I guess it's already.
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:23:41
is there a possibility to see the formula / steps to calculate the fee by hand or do I have to analyze the code and extact my own "introductions". 
Is there some page with the workflow/documentation of the algorithm? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:04:06
can I use this algorithm right now?
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:18:14
You want help, ok...
Why don't you put the screenshots upsidedown? or in different colour schemes so you can't read them?
Should the people who are willing to help you write the fucking transaction hash down themselves? post the URLs to the blockchain.info.
my god....you make it the most complicated to help you...at least show a little effort yourself.
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:06:44
and not really that great
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:24:44
Yeah, fees are "important" a buddy of mine didn't know about fees, used an old multibit client and transferred his whole wallet with like 40 satoshi/bit in mid-Mai, of course, he was paranoid about loose the coins etc. just because of some cents and not know what a fee was :-)
right now it's pretty chill and low cost fees go through
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:29:35
How does the waiter know that you paid? I'm new to bitcoin, but I thought it takes a while till a transaction is "valid", because the bitclient has to download the blockchain with the transaction.
