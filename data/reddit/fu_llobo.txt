OP does no need any advice, he needs affirmation so he can continue gambling away the future of his family. This is a sad story of bitcoin, OP has deep mental issues, most likely psychological illness and in deep denial, I like the part where he says 55k is like "nothing". 
OP needs a referral to a shrink and be locked out of the account and denied any access. I feel horrible for his parent and his siblings. OP, you are a classic POS. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:30:36
wut? Let's see...right now bitcoinity shows Mt.Gox 2 m in trading, stamp 750 k, bitfinex 400 k, and btc-e around 800 k
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:21:33
but Mt.Gox is the largest BTC exchange, no? It cannot even compare with btc-e based on volume and number of btc traded. How can you exclude largest exchange (whatever lousy or not ""normal") it is?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:01:45
ideological reasons? That is why btc is fucked. I'd stick with dogecoin, silly little thing that is very serious and potent on inside. Plus, does not take itself too seriously, does not cost a fortune and free of ideology bs. You know, like a real viable crypto should be. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:09:01
It is all sweet and all, but the OP is connected to Satoshi Dice, so his crocodile tears are not 100% genuine, since drop in price will be his worst nightmare, hence uplifting propaganda posts. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:37:29
true, true. I am actually offended someone has **a nerve** to say 55k is not "important". Everyone ITT who says hold or otherwise encourages this behavior, is worse than the scummiest drug dealer. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:44:11
The specific reason is that traders are a curse for everything. They fucked up current economy and now they will fuck up bitcoin too. Maybe they have not figured it out yet, but they will because they area fucking parasites and leeches and always have more resources to fuck up the average Joe. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:08:58
this is like new level of crazies: 


@_date: 2013-04-03 20:16:33
imbecile. You deserve to lose it all, idiot. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:50:16
why bother with them? Maybe they try out small accounts first, and then clear up the bigger ones at once, like it was done with someone with a cold wallet. This is shady as $%^&amp;, screw them. If I was a thief like that, I would not steal one by one, but amass all info and hit big accounts all at once. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:33:36
true, can't argue with that. But just imagine what fair cryptocurrency could do for the world? The currency where no matter how hard fat banker tries he cannot accumulate it like he can now. It is like we will push one giant reset and everyone starts anew. This would be so glorious. And the world could be like, "why do you whine bankers?" You still have your vaults filled with gold, but the world moved on to money 2.0.

@_date: 2013-04-18 14:04:08
fiat is regulated, bitcoin is not. All the microtrades, creating the "wall" to keep the price up, etc are the things that are possible with bitcoin but not fiat. I have the article somewhere how they create these fake "walls" in mt.gox, too lazy to search for it now. The point is, bitcoin is more easily manipulated, even by exchanges if they want to. Decentralized exchange might help, but I do not hold my breath for one. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:28:39
This is very **bizarre**. I did not click on any links, nothing. And it looks like automatic thing, because the moment I changed my password, I cannot even log in again. Good I have no money in there, but this is very bad. How do they do that? I have avast and checked my comp, all clear.

something is up there, someone just reported in a chat bitcoins stolen, although they just got his password, stole coins and he was able to log in and see his account empty. In my case they changed password, like how did they do that?? Should I worry about them having access to my comp now too?

just told this to my aunt Sally who invested in BTC amidst the hype, here is her reply: "huh? Speak English please, dear"
**Note:** folks like you are a **disgrace** for the entire bitcoin community. Always fucking blame the victim, always. So you really think (like honestly) that 2FA and NoScript cannot get worked around? How exactly OP's BTC got stolen? Why exactly idiotic Mt.Gox can't do something so simple as IP check? 
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:35:58
right....you are another dick. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:30:21
I disagree. People who promote it to pay for goods/services are part of ecosystems, these are just fucking leeches trying to create yet another fucked up wall street. They hoard bitcoins by selling/buying indefinitely instead of promoting true transactions.

it is funny how the same bitcoin means different things for different people. I hold my bitcoins because the system gives hope to a small fish and has a potential to fuck up banks and corporations. You are a libertarian who sees it as a way to fuck with government. Other scum down the thread are greedy sick fucks who see bitcoin as a quick mean to get rich without any work. Very funny...

@_date: 2013-04-12 12:37:39
no we did not need them, they are scum and they can kill bitcoin. Their run for the hills is delicious. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:11:14
lol, are you from Earth? Or some other planet? When and where did you see richfags giving a shit about infrastructure and common good, let alone poor? "Power corrupts and the absolute power corrupts absolutely" Richfags think poor are poor because they are lazy losers. 
(btw as a sidenote, 3D printers are VERY BAD. The plastic pollution they will create will be like nothing we have seen before now when every faggot can print crap, toss it away, print again, etc.) 
Only ppl like me or OP can pull this, but we are poorfags and will always be. Because richfags are all sociopaths and in fact this is one characteristic that allows them to be rich. When I see suffering I give out all I have, and since suffering is everywhere one cannot accumulate any wealth. You either care or you do not. See my previous comment, I suggested one faggot here to give 1500 "he does not need" to charity, shitstorm ensued. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:06:35
referring, but no one buys shit. 
the greedy will manipulate bitcoin till the end of times,  just because they can. 
people will hoard the majority of coins, spending only tiny fraction, if at all.
I am amazed how you refuse to see that bitcoin became some sort of twisted investment vehicle.

you could think it over, put some fool proof mechanisms, such as random fluctuations in difficulty, or something else that will give grandma Sally with here Jally and fat Swiss banker with 1000 Jallies equal chance of getting a block. Maybe the system can adjust and get more difficult if it detects massive centralized mining, I dunno, someone can mull it over. The point is to give everyone a fair chance regardless of what starting capital a person has. Only under these conditions Bitcoin will fulfill its true potential. Now it is nothing but a sexy toy for fucking bankers and day traders. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:22:33
pleaseeeee. It has been like this for how long now? Ancient Rome also had inequality and crime. Yet richfags still could not wrap their heads around it and they never will. They will get more security, build more gated communities, fuck, they will fly to Mars and settle there if needed. They physically CANNOT give or care, don't you understand? Their frame of mind has always been and will always be me, me, me. Build bigger fences, stronger security, etc.

I wonder if "Prisoner's Dilemma" game about altruism, trust vs egoism and greed can be factored in in some way into all that. Because in this game you can easily tease out who is altruist and who is selfish. Maybe in the future it can be used to train AI how to detect and mitigate greed in the system. Wouldn't it be sweet? 
We should all think about it long and hard, because bitcoin shows us the reality. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:36:15

how about we stop being apologetic and blaming the victim (and the victim should stop being apologetic as well) and use this situation as a teachable moment to discuss:
* vulnerabilities of BTC when it comes to average users with no extensive technical knowldege
* the fact that as BTC costs more, hacking becomes more lucrative and hence more sophisticated
* warning newbies and anyone really that they should not spend one cent of fiat unless they clearly understand how BTC works, how to store it and all risks associated with it. 
* upvote OP post for visibility for other naive newbies??

you should not blame yourself and should get mad at Mt.Gox for allowing shit like that happen. It could have happened at any second, you could have decided to move it, but then went to take a piss and puff, it is all gone. 10 BTC is a lot on dough in my world and as the value grows I bet the attack will get more frequent. What bothers me is that we cannot even understand how it was done and obviously no one in the community is interested in figuring it out either. Everyone is like "ups, your bad and your fault" and move on on pitching BTC to another potential victims who are like 10 times more clueless that you or I ever were. The mentality here is to always blame the victim, and it is troubling and upsetting given how impossible it is to get stolen BTC back. 
**Note:** even fucking paypal we all hate here, gets suspicious when someone from different IP accesses account, let alone tries to move 10K, but I guess it is too much to ask from Mt.Gox, right? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:52:53

@_date: 2013-04-18 13:55:00


This is only true when you have bitcoin alone, but when you have bitcoin and fiat existing together, then fiat is getting spent, bitcoin is turned into some sort of storage of value. I, for the record, think that no-growth economic model is our only future if we want to survive as species, because constant growth based on ole' good GDP model is not sustainable. But as long as fiat and bitcoin exist together, nothing will change. 
This again brings us to a vicious cycle, no widespread adoption, hoarding, while fiat is alive and well and used to buy whatever anyone wants. Frankly at this point a person should really use bitcoin to buy illegal stuff from silk road, for everything else fiat works just fine.

Satoshi should have included a pure chance in his code, a lottery of sorts. This is the only way to make biotcoin fair. The lottery where everyone will have a fair chance to mine a block. Without it, the same fat cats will usurp everything once again and in this case we do not need another "gold"

me neither, I just registered, forgot about it for a day, then tried to login several times and finally saw few other ppl on chat complaining about it, including one who was robbed of all his coins as someone did a transfer from his btc-e account. Shady as hell, better safe than sorry. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:12:21
but do you think this requires extremely advanced AI? Human greed is very simple, algorithmically speaking, it maximizes self-profit at any cost. So if something can be done to detect the tendency and combat it, that is the only thing needed. 
Yes, AI run economy that has only public good and compassion goal is the thing our world desperately needs right now. In fact it could be the only thing that could save us and prevent economic and environmental disaster. This is why I am so sad to see what is happening with bitcoin now.

yes they will. And then they will be making robotic bees to "pollinate" trees made of steel.

I find it kind of funny, sad and profound that even the best human invention is always fucked in the ass by a small group of affluent psychopaths. It is like the entire human history is plagued by them.

it appears to be a new thing, for accounts registered within 3 days or so. But you have been warned. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:43:05
who is securing network? Someone who will buy the biggest batch of most powerful ASIC BFL miners? 
I really do not see any point in bitcoin at this moment. Did Satoshi really went to all that pain to give frat boyz, bankers and day traders a new toy? I am having a hard time believing in it. 
Did not he know that humans are greedy? Could not he foreseen what will become of bitcoin? 
I do not think you need to specifically redistribute wealth, the system based on chance and the system that can work around human greed will suffice. Like once greed is detected some leverage is applied. Bitcoin is as much about human psychology as it is about programming, cryptography, etc.

yeah, what you do not realize is that majority of ppl (including 2/3 in r/bitcoins) are selfish and greedy bastards who only care for themselves. That is why bitcoin will eventually fail like everything else hairless monkeys aka humans ever did. The greed and selfishness will always fuck up any good intention. Human nature, ya know.

@_date: 2013-11-30 01:38:58
you need to cut this crap. NO ONE is spending their bitcoins with any merchants. There are shitloads of them accepting BTC, no one pays with BTC. Fucking joke these posts are, nothing else. 
BTC merchant that sells shitload of stuff for fiat, accepts BTC and had 0 customers paying with BTC. 
EDIT: yes, thats right, downvote to hell a merchant that says it as it is. Talking about bias and hiding the truth...

I am disgusted with ppl like you. The report was out that Puerto Rico frogs are disappearing at alarming rate. With this money you could have secured a habitat for these species and helped them to survive. This is just one example of what you could have done. Instead you sit here with your money and your fucking greed and throw it away on shit. I hope you fucking lose everything, go broke and live homeless on the streets cause you need the lesson. Ppl like you are the reason there is no money for conservation and the reason why our world goes down.
Fuck you, from the bottom of my heart. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:43:57
thats because they are in cahoots with big boys who do not want to see bitcoin going to 10 USD.

@_date: 2013-04-03 14:02:59
how fucking touching. Too bad it means shit as everybody sit on their bitcoins and you cannot pry it out of their dead cold fingers. Speculators will kill butcoin. It will crash like there is no tomorrow and the confidence in it and other cryptocurrency will be lost forever. This bubble will kill bitcoin and all of you fuckers are resposible.

yeah, look how well it worked so far. Mt.Gox s worth a billion now, facebook brothers got shitload, there is no such thing as "free associations" even mining pools are fighting like mad dogs. 
block mining should have been a lottery, period. You can have difficulty (it in fact could also fluctuate by chance) and everything like it is now, but the ultimate determinant should be a chance that cannot be bought or altered. I hope some future Satoshi reads this. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:37:49
you are the reason for everything wrong in this world. Fuck you. Hope all of you, fuckers, lose everything and will go homeless. You need a lesson, scum. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:42:19
I think the lag and shut down come from the fact that they are tying to manipulate the price. This is a second time it happens when bitcoin dives down. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:33:18
please note how your post gets barely upvoted on r/bitcoin. There is a clear suppression of information going on here as cases like yours are either downvoted or not upvoted so they quickly disappear. You should not blame yourself and should demand your money from Mt.Gox. You should also talk about it to anyone who listens because as BTC gets more expensive, hacking attacks get more sophisticated. Many folks get into BTC even without your or mine level of knowledge. We have to warn them. Finally, I really, really sorry for what happen, and please use it to warn others who will be robbed in days to come. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:51:31
OP, are you selling baby organs or something? Geez...
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:18:03
I really would **love** to know what Satoshi thought about that, if at all. Maybe he/she/them was/is a talented cryptographer but a lousy scholar of human nature. Sure somebody that smart could have envisioned what we see now to at least some degree. 
It would be awesome if he would post somewhere like, "yeah....human nature....the weakest side of bitcoin "
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:14:49
and yet, without exchanges bitcoin is kinda worthless, don't you agree? No easy way to transfer to fiat and back, unless you wanna hang out on localbitcoins foreva and keep synchronizing bitcoin client for days. By the way, you do realize that exchange theft can happen at any second as long as you have something there? It is not like you need to keep BTC there for months to get robbed. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:49:22
got banned in for posting it ;)
we do not even hear all sad stories as they are getting suppressed, very obvious actually. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 13:47:51
I think Satoshi had a bet with someone. The bet was as follows:
**The Unknown Stranger**: Humans are basically good, they just do not have a proper framework to show it. They can live sustainably and in balance with each other and the environment.
**Satoshi:** No, humans are fucked up and I can show it to you. I will give them the entirely new system of exchange that will have a *potential* to become this new framework. I bet they will fuck it up very quickly, because of people like digitalh3rmit and human greed. Wanna bet? The bet is one satoshi. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:05:27
does not matter how big the crash is, the point is it will be fluctuating forever and will be used as a vehicle to store value, not the mean of exchange like the real currency.
