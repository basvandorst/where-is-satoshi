Required, they can't put the match into anything else!

I know someone that works for Wells Fargo and 100% of their 401k matching is in the form of company stock.  Hedging into crypto if only a few % of savings isn't a terrible idea

Now that would be a traders wet dream :)

Like the pizza guy your transaction was but a brick in the road to where crypto has come today.  Too bad the usecase from actual usage &amp; adoption had to change to store of value when blockstream hamstrung BTC with them tiny blocks

Half the goal is to get you on the phone or into the local branch so they can "get you into something with a bit higher rate of return, oh risks?  don't worry about risk focus on that interest rate"

More like visionary

Well that is a real ad spend to push the store of value narrative if I ever saw one.  
Targeting the right market segment though I think

Not sure it's about forcing them to learn as much as it's convinving them why to buy
just have to get the bulb to flick on for them
