Hi Bryan,
How about we keep this very simple.  Is it possible for A) My Ethereum wallet to reflect the correct amount of funds.    B)  Fix issue i made sending BCH to BTC.  C) Provide refund.  Thoughts?

Update as of 7/1.  No one has reached out back to me.  Also, ethereum that is sent to my wallet has not arrived and it has been over 24 hours almost.  bryan, given your busy schedule, i am asking for a refund at time of when services were rendered.  a binary yes or no please.   furthermore, I need to understand if you will fix the underlying issue with funds not reaching my wallet.  its one thing for the wallet to have issues, but not giving me with the capability to access my own funds is concerning.

"One item that I would like to address publicly is that Mr. Developer is actually Mrs. Senior Compliance Specialist.  There are multiple checks and balances in place to ensure the safety of customer funds with daily reconciliation and settlement flows across all partners.  We take this very seriously and I can assure that your comments regarding how credits and debits are performed are incorrect, false, and without basis."   - Bryan I have my doubts about that, so for now my stance will have to remain that they are incorrect, false and without basis unless proven otherwise.  Look forward to discussing with you further

This was escalated after 5+ days of 0 accountability from [Spend.com]( support.   Again, I am more than happy to discuss further and would gladly post the end result publicly for the community as well.  I believed in [Spend.com]( , and still want to as it has great potential.
