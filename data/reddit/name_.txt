There is a divergence right now between investors and people who see bitcoin as a paradigm shift. All the speculation that has been occurring from the huge value increases in bitcoin brings in new buyers (like yourself) who do not necessarily see the intrinsic value of bitcoin as a form of currency. These price increases fuel hoarding- which leads to your questioning of why anyone would spend bitcoin. 
I asked the same not too long ago- the best answer I have is to decide for yourself what you see bitcoin as: a commodity or a currency? If the later, then find vendors who accept bitcoin, and when you want to buy something, whatever bitcoin you spend, simultaneously buy that amount back, thus keeping your investment in bitcoin level with the market rate, while at the same time allowing you to use bitcoins as a currency.

I think this excerpt is fundamentally at odds with what bitcoin is. This dude, Wiedemer, is talking about a traditional form of currency structure but at a global scale. And for what he is talking about, centralization is key. He's implicitly referring to neo-liberal, "new world order," structures, but with the adoption of technological advances that are *similar* to bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is inherently different than what Wiedemer is discussing precisely because it is a decentralized form of currency, completely independent of governments (for now at least).

This is interesting for a con-perspective: [
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:41:07
I think it depends how you want to get your money. Most exchanges offer bank transfers but if you use something like MtGox, you get a lot of other options (dwolla, okpay, coupons, etc.). Scam-wise, I don't know, I guess you need to be careful if you're selling locally. 
A lot of people recommend using other exchanges besides MtGox because it's so centralized and it will take you a while to get verified for certain things. But they're probably the most legitimate in terms of volume. I thought this was a helpful thread: [ 
The bias? I think it stems from the strong belief many hold that bitcoin can be successful not just from investment profits and trading, but also as a fiat alternative. It's easy to get annoyed at the idea of cashing out when there are so many "get-rich-quick" people dropping in and out of the subreddit looking for advice but with no interest in the philosophy behind bitcoin. 
Anyways, congratulations on the sound early adoption and the huge fiat money you're about to get (I presume you have several coins). Good luck! 
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:34:07

So now we're getting somewhere. I'll agree with you about the creation date and, to an extent, authenticity. U/Frozenlock below points an example of this already being done (albeit facetiously). That's a good example. Someone was moving into an apartment but found physical damage to the property apparently after a contract was signed but before the move in. So the person moving in took a picture of the damage and used the process you described to mark the creation date- showing the damage was done before he moved in. That's useful. And inevitably might end up in court (unfortunately, even though the point is to avoid legal crap). 
I think authenticity only works when two people or more attest to the thing as well. This might work with something like a contract if you could show both signor and signee are attached to the document that you hash. If it's only one, then yea, much harder to show authenticity.
If you could automate this process or make it formulaic, then it could have useful applications, but they would need to be narrowed down.   
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:37:56


You wouldn't. Putting your savings or a huge portion of your assets into bitcoins would foolish at this point. But investing some portion of your disposable income and using bitcoins as an alternative currency would probably be beneficial to both you and the overall adoption of bitcoin.

I think a few bitcoins just to have laying around is reasonable if you're just looking for a "fun" investment.
To answer some of your questions about why it's more popular now- it's been steadily gaining traction, and recent developments of more merchants offering services for bitcoins, along with uncertainty in traditional currency fueled by crises in Europe, plus easy and streamlined services (like MtGox) have helped more people see the potential in bitcoin. 
If you want to get some bitcoins quickly without waiting for MtGox to verify you, I'd suggest bitfloor if you're in the US. If not, there are similar services or you can buy locally from someone.

I don't think you should be baffled, but I do think it's awesome to see someone spreading their wealth so freely... Imagine if you were just having a milkshake at the park, and someone walked up and just gave you a bunch of cash. Like $4,000. That would be amazing!!!
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:52:43
This is an odd hypothetical. So what are the odds of someone actually robbing you in your home at knife point for bitcoins? If that happened, you'll lose whatever valuable stuff you have around anyways. And if you have serious amounts of bitcoin, why not invest in some home security? And if you really wanted to go extreme, just store the passphrase in a security deposit box in the bank... if you can trust a bank more than criminals, that is.

Haha, oh man, I was just thinking about spice from Dune this morning... too weird to come on this subreddit and find this post... Only, I was thinking more about spice in relation to similar mind-altering things that you can buy with bitcoins, not the bitcoins themselves. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:25:35
You demand a justification for something that is clearly already profitable (at least for now)? Buy some bitcoins, let them sit, if the price goes up, sell them. That's a profit. 
But you should try to learn for yourself why bitcoin is more useful than just a means to earn a quick buck rather than seeking self-affirmation and self-reinforcement for your doubts. 
Anyways, you don't need to know anything about coding to use bitcoin. If you want to mine for bitcoin, that's a different story, but you don't need to know coding for that anyways. And don't expect much money from mining either.

Bitcoin is becoming more and more associated with legitimate uses, but you're right, it is often associated with silkroad. If more people adopt and spend at legitimate places, that association will weaken. 
And I think you're right about using bitcoin for charity purposes, but many charities might be skeptical. Especially since there is so much volatility. But, money is money, so if we could get a fundraiser going for something, e.g. human trafficking, then yea, that would get people's attention.

Who? Coinbase? It takes about a week. Most places take about a week for direct deposit verification. If you mean bitfloor, I think right now they are only accepting direct deposits from capital one 360 accounts- which they conveniently give a link to sign up for... So take that as you will. The fastest route is definitely cash deposit or buying bitcoins locally. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:26:35
Bitfloor is very easy (as noted below) and nearly instantaneous- just drop off cash, and you can buy within an hour or less. Localbitcoins.com is a good option too. Higher rates though and you need to be careful to avoid scams.

Well consider that most people don't even know what you're talking about. I read your post, and as a non-techie-like-person, I just assumed something was wrong with the silkroad site. 
It's incumbent upon people, including you, to exercise good faith and good will in making such posts, and you basically typified the "boy who cried wolf" scenario making it more difficult for legitimate security breaches to be upvoted in the future. While it's entertaining to you, and apparently you think instructive, I'd caution against this type of false posting.

If you do buy bitcoin, diversify for sure. But be careful and know what you're getting into- bitcoin is extremely volatile, way more than any currency right now, so it's probably not "safe" in the way you're talking about.

I'm going to give you some writing advice. Not to be a dick, but because I think you need it to get your ideas out there more effectively.
First off, with any long post on reddit, try to include a small summary at the end called a "tl;dr," which means "too long, didn't read." I read what you wrote, but most people wont. Second, get to the point way sooner. You could have simply wrote: "I would like to see is Bitcoin and green energy development work together." That would have been enough. 
But rather you wrote the first paragraph as follows: (1) The future; (2) I like the future; (3) Technology; (4) Increase of technology; (5) Bitcoin has potential... What are you trying to say? 
Even when you get to the second paragraph, sort of your point, you say very little: (1) The environment may not survive; (2) we may not survive; (3) we can't work together; (4) something about our actions, greed, capitalism. 
And then Bill Gates. And a video. This video might have been the impetus for your writing. But it serves little value here. You could have made a really effective, to the point post, with really the last few sentences: 


**Tl;dr I think bitcoin can help the future of green technology, how can we encourage investment in this field?**
Anyways, not trying to be douche, but you have a good idea and could be more effective if you're straight forward and to the point.

Is this real? 
Coinbase has been struggling and consistently provided a troubled service. There are many supporters and advocates of coinbase, but I doubt people will be willing to support a policy that requires a purchase ordered (subject to a five day waiting period) that charges the market rate *five days* later. Especially since the price of bitcoins changes dramatically every few days. 
Moreover, this is a legally dubious move on coinbase's part. I'll have to re-read their TOS, but they've been slowly exposing themselves to all sorts of legal challenges. Whether those challenges are valid, I cannot say. But I do know they're there.

It's not only the queue, as you put it, that bothers people. 
Albeit their service is good, and arguably that speaks for itself because they have so many customers, they do have some problems.
Many people have had delays with funds and problems with customer service, but personally, I never have. 
I think, in reality, the biggest concern is about a need for decentralization, especially since mtgox essentially controls the market right now. 
Their fees are not exorbitant, but they can be pricey depending on who you are. 
It's completely centered in Tokyo which has some issues for bank transfers, fees, and currency exchange, but that's a minor point. 
And yea, daily ddos, lag, delays in transfers, highlights the danger of centralizing. 
Also, for me, I've found that transferring out my bitcoins, even with a fee, takes longer than other exchanges for some reason...

Also, reddit in itself is cultish- so if you're put-off by bitcoin tipping, I'm wondering why you're even on reddit in the first place. 
 
Anyways, the main point is that it's the internet... not "real life" as you put it. Hard to compare the two as such.

I don't know what you mean, but probably not many people- that's the point, it's a stable currency and you don't really need to worry about it. 
Bitcoins are consistently going up rapidly and in a parabolic way. That's actually really dangerous in terms of investment because it could signify a bubble. 
I share your enthusiasm about bitcoin's growth, but throw some skepticism and caution your way. The roof could come crashing down anytime.

As others have already pointed out, there's a serious likelihood that your friend cannot legally do this. Landlord/tenant law for all states in the US is very specific, and security deposits have to be handled a certain way. Using the security deposit to buy bitcoins is probably not legal- seriously.

Bitfloor or bitinstant. Coinbase has been struggling lately to keep their orders filled on time, they take over a week to deliver, and there's no guarantee you'll actually be able to buy bitcoins once your bank account is verified (which takes an additional week). Bitfloor is very fast, but the rates are a bit higher. You can drop cash off at a Bank of America or set up a bank account for direct deposit.

It's cool, I see what you're saying. And oddly, unfortunately for your comparison, I do have to think about euro-dollar conversions pretty often. But that's not the point. 
Here's the major difference in your analogy: there's no major value fluctuations occurring every few hours/days with major currencies. Look at how much BTC increased in value since January. Since February. Since yesterday... Those are really significant gains. So when, and if, BTC becomes stable and price values are relatively set, then yea, your analogy holds water. But until then... in my opinion, $ to be made by holding and not spending.

Well, look, not to nit pick, but it was [speculation]( But the main point here was to narrow down the claim based on the available information. 
The only info available at that time was that (1) there was a big transfer of BTC; (2) Instawallet is tagged on the cold wallet; and (3) there was a security breach at Instawallet. 
So again, incomplete evidence makes it speculation. Spreading rumors about something like a multi-million dollar steal without more information is not really helpful. 
And as it turns out, instawallet did control the other address... So yea.   
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:50:03
You should scale that language back. While that's necessarily a part of bitcoin, but not the purpose per se. Banks, loans, interests, etc. serve a function in society, albeit larger corporate interests and the like have eschewed the functionality of those things. 
Presentation-wise, maybe work on your scripting and your audio. Get a decent microphone and run a filter or two. Also, you sound conversational but I lose interest with too many umms and pauses, so rehearse your dialogue and work on your oratory basics. Other than that, good job setting out some basics- definitely useful!

@_date: 2013-03-27 03:03:48
So hold on. Volatility basically refers to the uncertainty of changes in value for something. So here's where you need to be really careful and think really seriously about what you're doing: bitcoins have a significant risk of changing in value very quickly and substantively. So if someone gave you 73BTC right now, that might not equal $6000usd in one hour/one day, etc. It might equal more, but it very well could be less. Bitcoin could drop in value to $50usd per 1 bitcoin by tomorrow- that would be a loss of $2,190USD. That's volatility.   
So when you say "lock in conversion rates," you mean at the time of sale? So if you had 73BTC and sold them to bitpay at $80usd/1btc, that rate would be set, is what you're saying?
If you set up an account on MtGox or some other exchange and have the bitcoins transferred to you quickly, then yes, you could probably sell relatively quickly. That doesn't fully manage volatility because the price could still drop in that time. But assuming you're talking about a really quick transaction process- i.e. someone transfers you 73BTC, you immediately put those 73BTC on the market, and someone immediately buys those 73BTC- then yes, the risk of loss is lowered against the volatility issue. 
I still really caution against this since debt is involved, but I guess risk and profit are always going to incentivize in these kinds of situations.  
[edit: example of volatility, really need to make that clear.]
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:00:51
I see what you're saying, but I'm going to make a few criticisms. Legally, that kind of notarization wouldn't have any value. If I had my contract notarized this way and someone challenged it in court, it would have no legal effect. And just because it's funny, I don't think you meant to say a ransom note is a dated legal document. 
This is really just more of an authentication of first inception- or better, first publishing. It's not so much notarization, which is the legal recognition/attestation/certification of something by a third-party, as it is proof of creation. It's probably more analogous to a patent. I'm the first person to put this document/thing out there in the system with this form of authentication (SHA-256 hash). But that doesn't mean someone else wasn't the first creator.

No. You ask if a largely digital currency (apart from some other physical coins and the like- which even then, are digitally bound) can be used for *all* of humanity's financial happenings? 
It's doubtful bitcoin would be useful for the huge proportion of the world's population who have no access to a computer, internet, or other technological niceties we take for granted. 
If and when a bitcoin could be bartered with physically and completely offline, it may be more likely that it could be serve more and more people. But even then, and my strongest point, the nature of commerce is not necessarily bound to currency alone. 
For now, as much as I like bitcoins, it's still a niche currency, and a plaything in comparison to world currencies.

I think alot of the initial criticism with bitcoin tips related to how much the verifications cluttered-up a thread. It was a new thing, people were eager to tip, and they wanted to show that they had done so... 
Now after some time and experience, things have mellowed out. Most people who actually tip are aware of the cluttering issue and that it doesn't make sense to verify the tip after one person has already done so. So one person tips, verifies, and other people can follow and tip as well, but not verify- does that make sense?
I think the verification feature is useful and informative, so I don't agree with you about disabling it. And that's mainly because I don't think it will be an issue anymore with people posting too many verifies and messing up a thread. But in the event that cluttering-up was happening, yea, by all means reevaluate the verification feature.

Just don't feel too bad about yourself as a human being. As a trader, you made a decision presumably based on your emotions and what you thought was right, and you learned a really hard lesson. Bitcoins are extremely volatile- dropping nearly twenty dollars is not normal, and lot's of people reacted, so you're not alone. But keep things in perspective. You're still a human with life and blood, I guess friends and family, maybe even good health if you're lucky. Bitcoins, trading, fiat, dollars and the like are just a sideshow in comparison to getting to live in this world. Sorry if that's too cheesy or metaphysical. To be blunt, I'd say get yourself some sex- that's always good to remember what life is about. [edit: also, 15% was $10k? You seem to have some cash, so you got that going for you too...]

I'd argue there's never really a "right time" to buy in for the first time. I speculated a lot back in October and especially November of 2012. I eventually bought in mid-December, but looking back now I wish I had just bought in during October. The price may go down, or it may stay the same, or it may keep rising. You can't really know for sure. I'd say if you're seriously contemplating it and have extra cash that you can invest (not money you can't afford to lose), then go ahead and buy now. If you're really concerned about price fluctuations, then allocate a portion for now and some for later. And if you have the time, watch the rates and buy in during a drop. Other than that- just go for it!

@_date: 2013-03-27 20:44:34
I think most people are talking about potential future value drops. And you should also note that while there are only a few examples of really big drops in value, bitcoin value regularly fluctuates by several dollars every few hours. Contrast that with a "stable" currency like Dollars or Euros, and you can see why bitcoin is reffered to as volatile.

I'd suggest you buy now if you have money that you can afford to lose should the price go down. The price may just keep going up- at least some of us hope. But it may go down. It's impossible to say, so there is no "magic moment" to buy. The only thing you maybe could do is watch the price like a hawk and wait for a dip in the price. Other than that, just go for it.

I skimmed through this and it's the same thing everyone's saying about bubbles and speculation. But it doesn't matter if you compare bitcoin to dotcom, tulips, oil, or whatever. The differences are myriad and there is always room for differentiating the situations- and room for analogizing. 
What is clear, is that bitcoin is undergoing wild speculation and the dramatic (manic) price rises are indicative of a bubble. 
Ardent supporters will tell you bitcoin is valued accurately right now and will keep rising. Fine. 
But I think if you did a poll of all the people who bought in from $100 to now (currently $222), I'm pretty sure a huge proportion are just people trying to make a quick buck. 
If and when a big drop comes, shit is going to hit the fan in terms of sell-offs... that is, if MtGox can keep up and doesn't shut down (purposefully or not).  
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:43:20
There's a couple of threads already addressing this- if you do a search with some key terms, you should be able to find them. 
Anyways, The general idea is sound, but there are some speed bumps. How will you convert the bitcoins to Euros? Will you have a bank account you set up in some country in Europe? Or will you sell them to someone locally on localbitcoins.com? Both may involve time and extra costs, and with localbitcoins, maybe higher rates that negate the whole process of avoiding USD-&gt;EUR. 
Those are the main two ways I know of right now unless you have a contact in Europe with a bank account and willing to work with you. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:35:12
These are points that have been made before. I agree with each to an extent, but note that this bitcoin thing is still in its infancy. Anyways...


So that is true, but will get better as the market evolves. Comparatively, it's not much different than other types of money. I deposited a check to my bank account over a week ago, and it still hasn't cleared. Talk about a PITA. 


This is true but depends. Adding the fee helps, but yea, it still may take some time. To that end, again, consider other money. The only truly instantaneous transactions we have today are done by cash. That's it. Credit is just that- credit. It takes a billing cycle to actually be confirmed or bumped. Checks? Please... Debit cards are good, but still are a semi-form of credit. Each is backed, however, by a large institution that serves as a form of "insurance" against fraudulent and unbacked transactions. That doesn't exist yet with bitcoin, but could. In a way, bitcoin is pretty fast in comparison to other money (except cash) because you get the *real* non-debted money, without third-party interference, once it arrives in your account. To speed it up, yea, we could use a third-party holding service that "credits" the amount instantly and waits on the actual transaction time... 
What else?


Who says you have to download it? It's wise and makes sense right now in terms of security. But again, infancy. These are the early days, and hopefully things will get better in terms of infrastructure and security as more players emerge and the market adapts. 
Just my thoughts and some counter points.

Personally, I did not like using btc-e as an exchange. Here's why it wasn't good for me: 
* Higher fees - prices even look lower on this exchange, but it's only because of the higher fees that are taken into account. 
* Low security 
* Chat box is ridiculous, unprofessional, and cannot be disabled 
* Difficult UI
* Reports of accounts being blocked, disabled, or otherwise cut off from users, and btc disappearing... 
* Not clear if it's a money laundering scheme (that's hugely rumor-driven, but hey, with 50% of exchanges shutting down, some because they were used for nefarious purposes, those kinds of rumors exist for a reason) 
* Dubious legal status. 
* And where is btc-e based? Russia? Good luck filing a law suit or doing anything if you lose your $4k 
There are better exchanges out there that are more secure, more professional, and more transparent. Use those instead...

Anyways, I just think it's better to wait for an update from Instawallet (and to keep your bitcoin secure as always) before making claims of a multi-million dollar heist.

Let's break this down a bit... Steve is already in debt, so dealing with bitcoin (an extremely volatile and high risk asset) is really risky. 
So Steve is being offered $6,000 in bitcoins? Bitcoins just hit $80 per 1 bitcoin. So $6,000USD, at the going rate is roughly 73BTC. 
There are many places where bitcoin can be sold at the market rate, but I'm not too familiar with bitpay personally. If Steve is dealing with 73BTC, then selling at a bigger exchange like MtGox might be a good option. 
Overall, Steve needs to realize that bitcoin value can rise and fall dramatically and very quickly. If Steve is already in debt, he should probably seek fiat currency (dollars) because they will ultimately help with the debt issue immediately. Unless the offer of bitcoins is substantially higher, I'd suggest dollars. The time it will take to set up an account and convert the bitcoins might be too much risk for someone already bearing financial burdens. 
I'm not sure why Steve's iphone is an issue, but generally it's better to use a computer for large transactions like this.

Consider me an avid tipper from here on out. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:21:18
I'm not sure about the details, but assuming something like this did happen, you should consider how much money you're dealing with, how much you may have lost, whether you have any kind of documented record for the unauthorized transactions, and whether MtGox is willing to address what happened. 
Is it possible you had an open sell-order? Check your transaction history, etc.
I would think you should consider legal representation if you're talking about a lot of money and if MtGox is denying your claim. However, because you said "the usal .6%," it appears you're dealing with less than 100BTC, so maybe just try to work this out on your own.

Again, probably because a lot of people don't know what a "public IP leak" means... and were relying on you. You've made a point, yea, but in a pretty baseless fashion. I think what you did was wrong, but I also think it's clear you'll feel justified no matter what anyone says. [edit: also, you even lack merit with this post- after looking back at the original post, it's clear many people called you out... So you just have personality problems it seems.]

I'm not sure why you're getting all these weird responses. It's a straight forward idea- bypassing third-party conversion vendors, e.g. banks and currency traders at airports, by converting btc to whatever local currency of the country you're in. The hitch is converting from BTC to EUR. How will you accomplish that? Well, as u/whosethere pointed out, you can sell them locally. The problem is that there may be no one in the city you're in, or the vendor might charge a high rate and service fee. That might not actually save you any cost than if you had simply converted the USD. The other route? Getting a local bank account. That's not so easy unfortunately. You can of course, but it will be restricted if you're not a citizen, and the process is usually lengthy. The best option will probably be finding someone who will buy your BTC in the currency you want and try to get a fair rate. Maybe you can find a friend in Europe who will take on the risk of buying your btc and giving you euros? Right now, there's just not a lot of options other than selling locally.  
@_date: 2013-03-21 02:55:01
Fair enough. Unfortunately it's not so easy for me (yet) to get bitcoins that quickly. Each time I spend, right now, I incur a loss...
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:26:08
Look, first off, the fact that you recognize there may be an issue with money laundering and you're actively seeking advice, suggests that you probably already know something is up. 
Second, seek professional advice from an accountant and tax specialist. I'm not saying reddit isn't a good place to get general ideas, but relying on the people here for anything involving money, taxes or legality is a bad move. Find a professional. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:12:12
I've been thinking about this too, and right now the best option (as it's already been pointed out) is probably selling your BTC locally to someone in the country you're in. Bear in mind, exchange rates can be fair, so if you're going to travel or be in Europe for some time, you might be wise to just find a good currency vendor- they do exist. If you use a debit card/ATM you can also get the current exchange rate plus whatever fee your bank charges (and you can get banks that charge little to no fees). 
If you're looking to turn a profit, then yea, selling locally is probably your only option short of getting a bank account in Europe... which is not so easy. But there is risk and hassle involved, and you might have to rely on a vendor who is charging a higher rate or tacks on fees. 
I'd say, if you're going to do this, don't put all of your travel money in BTC. Take a portion you can afford to lose and still comfortably be in Europe, and put *that* into BTC. Then get in touch well beforehand with some trusted vendors in the country/city you're visiting and have a trade already setup for when you arrive.  
Good luck!  
[edit: just to really emphasize, you have to assume any money you put into BTC now could be completely valueless by the summer- be careful!]

It's cool, I just air on the side of significant loss versus total loss. I hope bitcoin will be widespread too, but right now, at this early stage, to put one's entire savings in it I believe is unwise.

The reason I won't use this app, as with almost all windows phone apps, is that it requires access to way more features than its intended purposes. Why does this app need access to all these features:
owner identity
video and still capture
media playback
data services
push notification service
movement and directional sensor
