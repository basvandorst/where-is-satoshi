Where can I get this open bazaar ready version? Went to archlinux.org to find but am a Linux n00b. I am working on learning it more now

I'm not sure. Mine was pretty quick. After signing up I had coins in my account within 20 mins
@_date: 2014-09-20 23:25:56
I came to that same conclusion when thinking it out. It sort of depends on the rate of brand new users I would think and what factors create interest in it and when.

After watching the actual episode this screen grab seems much more appropriate. Seems like a really interesting show. Wish I knew what he was saying

I can usually sell my bitcoin for paypal funds pretty quickly on localbitcoin. I have their debit card so it's been helpful in a pinch but if you don't have that card maybe you are with someone who had an account and can give you cash. Idk what you need the cash for but you can maybe even extend into buying giftcards for popular stores to cover your expenses in some ways? Hope something comes through for you, I've never had access to an atm to be able to see if you can sell. That would be genius and If it doesn't exist yet, it should.

You might have trouble proving payment to ebay if he doesn't send camera. If ebay comes to support this it would be awesome

My thoughts exactly
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:10:26
Theres no reason to go to that site except to look at ads.. Where is the value in marketing to ad buyers?
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:15:29
Got back in. My phone messed up. Huge relief
@_date: 2014-09-19 04:11:08
Can someone translate?

Do you take paypal?
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:55:29
Couldnt u just sell like an ebook with just the code for a new wallet u create for them, a throw away with the funds on it? Maybe thats too much trouble? I see people sell ebooks all the time with paypal

Do the kickstarter sites offer returns in currency? I agree they should accept BTC but last I seen they usually offer a copy of the product and other bonuses like limited edition merchandice and name included in credits etc.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:12:28
I appreciate the honesty! So what is driving your sales? reddit?
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:26:12
Why would I go reading other peoples comments
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:32:11
Im a web designer but I wouldnt know where to begin for a project of that size. Its just waiting to happen. Maybe a listing directory showing products that offer discounts for BTC
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:16:16
I would be interested in seein this list
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:33:37
What do you do if someone buys it with a stolen card?
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:09:08
Returns based on sales profit that is
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:15:25
Right you are. They are basically shipping discounts cost the same to ship 2 as it does one and 4 for as much as it does 3. Figured more options was better but now Im thinking simple is better
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:42:58
I would have withdrawn my money and taken it somewhere else. Looks like we need a list of bitcoin approved banks now...
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:33:46
Also a site like fiverr for services
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:51:20
The 6 Hours was trial and error of betting .00001btc and losing it most of the time. Except for one lucky streak that topped out at .001 before I chickened out and cashed it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:26:12
On the left hand side there is a button that says "FREE BTC" when you hover over it. Bottom of the list. Enter captcha and bam
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:58:28
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:32:23
I was hoping it would be more like they couldn't do anything about the "bonus" I offer to my "bitcoin guide". I imagine others already sell pdf ebooks and do not offer refunds.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:12:39
Awesome Idea. I have terraria, what improvements are you making? I find it limited in ways
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:47:58
With primedice. They give you a free .00001 BTC to gamble with. Then just hope you can steadily and luckily raise it. Did this Over and over until it climbed to .001 where I decided to cash out.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:01:15
I love the site. I seen your ad on facebook and instantly wanted to ask if you had seen any success with fb ads. Any sales? I'm a bitcoin store owner as well and looking into next stage of promotion with paid advertising. Has it been worth it (profitable) with beef jerky?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:34:24
I see, you stand to make much less and lose a lot more for a higher chance so it about evens out? Any tips, new to this.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:13:54
Haha thanks. Took off the auto correct on my phone so im making plenty of errors
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:50:56
Now I've seen everything
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:33:10
Is cryptobay.com taken haha good idea. Maybe include other cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:30:13
Dammit, if I had the funds to buy enough BTC I would do this myself. I can code and design a site to buy BTC books with paypal I just wouldnt know how to get enough BTC to take care of the potential demand. How did you fund your service? Looking for any help from experienced designer and marketer?
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:06:49
Guys... He's obviously a scammer. Send the money to me 
I'll make sure it gets where it needs to go ;)
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:55:08
Where can we find one of these gambling sites?
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:09:06
I hope my sarcasm translated
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:28:31
I'm hoping this happens to me lol. Just put an order in when the price was at $700+ but it's only .05btc so probably gonna have to eat the loss
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:17:12
Good point. Any ideas to be sure im not a scammer?
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:57:42
Thanks man, I appreciate the help. I will see if my selling platform can allow bitcoin only discounts. The color and fragrance forms are messed up. It appears to capture that data but does not send it to me in any order details. Currently looking for a new solution to that. For now I have to contact the buyer to manually get that info. Mystery candles will be coming soon, i love that idea.
