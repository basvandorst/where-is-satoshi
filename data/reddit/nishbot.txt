The TA folks in here: BTC charts are resembling a descending triangle or the beginning of a cup and handle?
@_date: 2018-09-10 00:23:36
But you agree it’s a bubble

Who’s still HODLing?
@_date: 2018-09-08 23:51:39
Bitcoin won’t be worth anything in 5 years. I’m surprised it’s worth anything now. There are zero use cases for it that supersede cash.
@_date: 2018-09-09 23:56:04
PayPal already does this for free

@_date: 2018-09-09 16:38:18
So what if the currency got tied back to gold, would that be enough to make you switch back from bitcoin?

the y-axis scales incorrectly. the trend line isnt accurate.
@_date: 2018-08-10 10:17:51
A lot of that is false. We’re in the longest sustained period of peace in history. A flexible monetary policy has allowed us to sustain economic fluctuations, and thus prevent wars. There’s a reason we moved away from the gold standard. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:31:07
You’re wrong. Market value dictates everything. It could cost you a billion to mine a bitcoin. If no one wants it, it’s zero.

@_date: 2018-08-30 18:02:39
I never thought bitcoin or any crypto was a good investment vehicle. At all. Bitcoin has no inherent value, and the underlying technology, the blockchain, is replicable to infinity, making cryptocurrency replicable to infinity (a la altcoins). The "scarcity" of bitcoin is an illusion. Once BTC becomes unmineable, miners will switch to a new coin.
And unlike stock, which is based on the book value and earnings of a company, bitcoin is only based on what someone else is willing to pay for it. It's like baseball trading cards. Bitcoin is a network of virtual trading cards. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:27:24
What you all fail to understand is that the value of bitcoin is predicated on only one thing: what someone else is willing to pay for it. There is no earnings or revenue or value building behind it. Just simply what someone else is willing to pay for it. Similar to a baseball trading card. You all have $6300 baseball trading cards. 
Now the technology powering it, the block chain, that is revolutionary, and if you all had focused on making blockchain a technology that is vital to daily life, ironically, bitcoin would be worth millions.
But instead, you crypto-traders are hoping someone will buy your bitcoin for more than you paid for it.
Hate me. Downvote me. You know I’m right.
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:21:49
But let’s be honest, no one really on this sub is talking about blockchain technology. Everyone is here to discuss bitcoin as an investment vehicle. And bitcoin as an investment vehicle is doing poorly. And he’s also right about bearish sentiment getting  dowvoted bc everyone’s afraid of negative sentiment building on bitcoin which would drive prices lower.
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:40:40
Absolutely. We should all trust the reporting from cyrptoanalytica.co
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:37:15
Bitcoin will never rise back because crypto currency is replicable until infinity via new alt coins. There will never be a shortage of crypto. Not trying to spread FUD but I’m genuinely surprised BTC hasn’t been replaced by another altcoin yet as the supreme crypto currency.
I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that BTC was created by a nameless faceless person, while other altcoins have been created by someone tangible, so everyone thinks that person has something to gain at the expense of other as. That will always be in BTCs favor. 
Idk, I’m thinking out loud here.
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:39:42
No it’s not. No one is paying for anything in BTC bc everyone is afraid the price will go up tomorrow.

That's a good thought experiment. What if some user offered to buy your bitcoin off the exchanges, and would venmo you $20,000 per coin? Would you do it then?

BUT WHEN MOON?!? WHEN LAMBO?? 
@_date: 2018-10-09 11:22:13
The ledger is what, 185GB now? This can’t go on forever. Eventually, Bitcoin will break. And because there’s a definitive unspecified end date to bitcoin, it’s no longer worthy of an investment.
Sorry folks. I know some of you bought at the peak. It’s a tough pill to swallow, but cut your losses while you can, before it gets worse.
EDIT: changed 600GB to 185GB. Regardless, the point is the ledger will become too large to handle.
@_date: 2018-10-27 12:55:07
When moon? When Lambo?
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:12:41
Guilty. I'm upset I didn't get into bitcoin in 2010 when I first heard about it, trading at 26 bitcoin per dollar. Still stings me to this day.

A redeemable receipt? That would put trust in a single entity until the transaction cleared, opposite of what bitcoin is all about.
@_date: 2018-10-10 05:56:00
But there are fees for BTC transactions as well. So that cancels that out.
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:13:37
The point of bitcoin was to do away with fiat currency, yet all of you value bitcoin relative to the very fiat currency you wish to destroy. 
The fact is, you can’t live without the United States Dollar.
Long live The Federal Reserve!

Why would tightening liquidity of the US dollar have an effect on bitcoin? Isn't the idea of bitcoin to be disconnected from the federal reserve note?

He may not know it to be true, but those are fair assumptions. And like everyone, you are free to speculate on the price. No need to get upset about it.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:39:54
Overpriced. $0. Because a bitcoin is literally just a bunch of people saying “Ok, you have a bitcoin.” Nothing tangible.

This discussion is pretty healthy for reddit. Just saying.
@_date: 2018-10-19 01:31:00
Word of advice to everyone trying to make money on crypto: In the past year, you could have invested in the traditional stock market and made significantly more money.
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:15:25
So let me ask you, if you were to buy BTC from this, do you have to wait around for 10 min until the transaction cleared 
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:16:14
So you're saying bitcoin will "moon" one day, but then come right back down?
@_date: 2018-10-25 13:57:19
He is comparing YOY. It’s down 2.4% on the year.
@_date: 2018-10-27 12:49:03

If you read the discussion thread, ppl want bitcoin to be an asset, not a currency. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 08:39:01
Hate to break it down to you, but rising interest rates = strengthening dollar. Interest rates are expected to rise for the foreseeable future, making any "store of value" (i.e. gold, crypto, etc) not worthy of purchase. If you're really looking for the moment when bitcoin will truly rise, wait until the next recession and the Fed cutting interest rates to near zero, weakening the dollar. Then you'll see institutional investment into "stores of value."
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:37:55
How do you know the ATM will "assure" the cash sale? What if it just takes the bitcoin and never gives you cash back?
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:11:09
Regardless, the point is, it will grow into infinity.
Oh, and:

@_date: 2018-06-24 06:31:38
People don't understand that Bitcoin will NEVER rebound. Why? It's simple supply and demand. The supply of cryptocurrency is virtually infinite. Yes, I know BTC is artificially limited, but people can jump into the next crypto, and the next, and the next, and the next, for infinity, bc coins can be created out of thin air. More importantly, crypto isn't an investment. It doesn't produce anything, doesn't create anything. It's only value lies in that there is a massive decentralized network mining and maintaining the BTC network.
But what will happen when BTC is no longer mineable? Miners wanna mine. They spent ungodly sums of money on mining rigs and they want to mine. So they'll jump into the next crypto, starting a cascading wave of people jumping to that network to maintain. And once that's done, they'll jump into the next one, and the next one, into infinity. 
The only thing that will save BTC is one thing that early adopters of BTC have been harking about: getting BTC to be used in daily commerce. Bc once BTC is the norm for transactions, miners and maintainers will be motivated to stay and support the network rather than jump ship. Millions of transactions equals commission for everyone.
But that won't happen, bc crypto fans are only in it for one thing, to make money, ironically American money, the very thing BTC is supposed to supersede. 
BTC investors have two choices:
1. Dump your BTC while you can
2. Convince every local business and retailer you know to accept BTC as payment.
That's all you can do.
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:33:49
Yea but someone is selling. That’s why it’s down.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:17:50

Tether is a scam? But I thought crypto was supposed to be hackproof/decentralized/blahblah. So what happened here? 
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:42:53
so? then move onto an alt coin.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:25:59
I have a Bitcoin I’ll sell to you for $100,000. No? Then what makes you think anyone else would? Exactly. The price will never reach $100,000. The market dictates price. The market will never pay $100k for a bitcoin. And the 20k bubble was a result of market manipulation. That’s been proven. The only reason it’s still at $6k is because of hodlers hanging on in delusional hope that it will bounce back.
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:55:15
No, they won't. They already have the people they wanted holding the bag holding the bag. There is no reason for them to come into BTC of all places and rescue those bag holders.

Do it. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:21:47
I don't doubt more money will flow into crypto. It just won't be BTC. BTC is done. The people with that kind of money are planning the next bubble with a different crypto. And they'll keep doing it with a new crypto over and over and over.

If one person can manipulate the price of bitcoin on a subreddit, people should be rethinking the asset as a whole.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:54:58
I think it’s good BTC is coming down. I think 1btc should be worth 1usd, that way it makes sense to use as a currency and trades like a dollar, which was really the whole point of this thing. Bitcoin will not go up if there’s no use case.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:26:02
I've been saying this over and over. For BTC to be successful, it has to have adoption. Don't worry about the price, worry about implementation, and the price will follow.
@_date: 2018-11-11 11:48:31

Why is that incorrect? If it fell 80% already, what’s stopping it from falling 80% again? It’s a legit possibility. Tell me why that won’t happen. Is there something in the code that prevents that from happening? Answer: no there’s not. So yeah, dropping 80% again is not impossible. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:04:10

How can a decentralized currency be banned? Isn’t that the whole point of crypto? Outside of govt interference?

Is bitcoin going up or down from here? Asking for a friend.

The fact that BTC value is only based on what some other schmuk is willing to pay for it should tell you everything.

Found the pharmacist!
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:22:54
I know, right? Isn't the whole point of crypto to have a currency that doesn't rely on a central issuing authority? The very value of bitcoin is based on USD. And now to buy anything, there has to be two additional conversion processes (into btc and back into fiat), both which require transaction fees.
So if you ask me, I see zero point to cryptocurrency unless you are seeking to purchase things without being traced, which in that case, I don't know what to tell you.

Ha, I lost a little bit on IQIYI, the Netflix of China.

@_date: 2017-10-14 02:19:54
Lol you're right, I was. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:54:44
No it won't. There'll be another fork, and then another. And then some new crypto will come out and make BTC look like yesterday. Meanwhile, the only real value of BTC (outside of a few places that accept Bitcoin for goods) is being able to trade it for an American dollar, which is hysterical because BTC was based on doing away with fiat currency.
You can downvote me all you like, but secretly deep down, you know this is the truth.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:03:54
By that logic, I guess the entire Bitcoin community is retarded?

IF a few ppl on Reddit can convince some folks to sell enough Bitcoin, which has a market of nearly $100B, to move the price down this much, then maybe the problem arent trolls, but rather Bitcoin not being able to justify its value.

Now I ask again, when moon?

What’s the current price of BTC?
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:52:52
Lot of talk about institutional money. Do you find it ironic that for BTC to thrive, it must rely on fiat currency, the very thing it was designed to replace? 
@_date: 2018-12-03 07:57:28
But 1 million though!

@_date: 2018-12-10 09:24:59
$3400 right now. It is going higher or lower? Also, when mining ends, won’t miners just jump to an altcoin so that they could make more money?
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:45:20
They still get transaction fees,  but there needs to be enough transactions for it to be worth it.
Except one problem, too many transactions and the ledger grows beyond reasonable and is way too slow, and only ppl with enough disk space can maintain the network. 
It’s a double edged sword. Ppl say LN will save the day. But they’ve been saying that forever.

Stock market and BTC price action are correlated. Which must mean price movements are mostly influenced by HFT and algos. Which means, institutional money is already here.
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:14:48
But bitcoin isn’t scarce. It’s scarce in the way you think it (ie. 21 million), but new altcoins can be created instantly. Bitcoin as a crypto doesn’t offer any advantage over the next crypto except the name.

I disagree. I think a lot of people have been right predicting BTC would drop from 10 to 8 to 6 to 5 to 4, me included. I remember when it was at 6, and this thread was full of people predicting one way or another. The bears used common sense to predict a downward trend, the bulls used hysteria to predict an upward trend. The bears were right.
