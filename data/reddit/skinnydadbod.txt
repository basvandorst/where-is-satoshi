The world economy is 77 Trillion,  bitcoin market cap is what 40 billion, be generous and say 400 billion for all cryptic,  that's .5% of the money supply .. Maybe we will see some actions when it gets to 5%.. 
As far as what type of actions well if govts passed regulations against them what would most real people with real assets and pension plans and houses etc do? 
They wouldn't attack, well any more then they probably are now... It's not the bitcoin supply in danger it's purely money in and money out... 
Also,  Russia, China whoever else, all govts around the world would jointly support this measure, an underground money system impacts their taxes and thats what they are all in business for..

I'd rather help to bring you guys back to earth.  
So many merchants get killed 2% off for credit card purchases, business and contracts depend on shitty banks with expensive bonds and for transfer payments...   Bitcoin or w/e crypto has the chance to go mainstream, but in a year or two the alt-media will be gone declared fake and the bad press from msm will make further growth a big problem..

Like I said I would be 100% on board if I knew this was already safe from elites ownage...  But given this is probably the biggest threat to the elites ownage and the fact that the price is not steady,  it's too risky...  The bankers don't give a shit if people are buying weed from the darkweb but if this spreads in commercial, or business to business,  or real estate they will clamp down..

1) I choose bitcoin but I mean in general.
2) which one major country will by in against the USA/banker colition,  it will be none
3) I agree that it's awesome in theory, and this just reinforces that they will go with their A game to squash this when it gets to a number that they already have planned I am sure.
