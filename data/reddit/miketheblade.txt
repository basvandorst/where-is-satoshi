I am fucking sick of trying to make money off of bitcoin. I just want it to fucking work already. I honestly seems like 5-10 years away from making an impact in peoples lives. By then I think it wont matter. I really can't tell the future but the longer times goes on the less and less I worry about money or bitcoin and the more I just want to go off grid when this shit storm hits the fan

lol seriously. Nothing new has been invented. Its arbitrary news to me.
@_date: 2015-08-25 05:50:13
Nope. It will be in double digits soon enough then I will buy.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:15:38
I sold at 550 knowing it will drop. I am still holding out. Why does bitcoin deserve to be above 200? It literally has no more function 6 months ago than it does now. Nothing has changed for the user problem of insecure storage without being a nerd. Unless they fix that problem I am not buying back in. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 02:58:03
Yeah yeah yeah more bullshit hype to keep the price up.

I would love to hear an explanation here. How will bitcoin save poverty? Its just a currency replacement. Poor people will still have no money (bitcoins). Simply swapping from dollars to bitcoins is perpetuating the current economical system. Bitcoin in itself is worthless 1's and 0's like dollars. But the problem is that its entire value is predicated on the current fiat currencies. So what really happens when bitcoin is the main currency? No one can print money/bitcoins. How will that change the destroyed economy? simply shutting off the printing press does not make peoples wages go up or stop capitalism from destroying everything.

I own 7 and if you think you're going to get rich off of bitcoin you're in for some long term disappointment. Money will be worth less and less in the next 10-30 years. Over inflated market systems are ending. The idea that bitcoin will blow through the roof is silly. We live in a dying economy and bitcoin will not save it. There are way too many other things to worry about than getting bitcoins when you're in poverty.

Bitcoin has enough people involved already and its completely unstable in many ways besides price. Being your own bank has people dependent on their computers for safety. Its just not a good idea.

You bag holders are fucking sad.

Lol this made me laugh so hard

Bitcoin gives you the right to smoke weed in the USA without paying the state to smoke a plant? but I thought it gave me freedom. You're sentence makes no sense. How does a digital currency give you freedom?
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:22:22
I have 7 coins, I am still buying. I do not think I will get rich at all. I am a realist in this sense
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:21:34
The world wont adopt a digital currency that still has many problems. If anything a country should create its own coin and distribute the coins evenly through out its people. Bitcoin is already been manipulated by millionaires.

If McDonalds is still going strong in 10 years we are fucked

The big players were suppose to stop it from hitting below 600,550,520,500,450 etc. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:22:06
Right? I've been in bitcoin for 3 years. I just feel like unless they fix the problem of storing your money on your completely volatile personal computer. No one will give a shit. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:16:23
DAMN SOMEONE SHOW ME HOW TO MINE THIS BITCOIN SHITTTTTT!!!!
@_date: 2015-07-17 04:26:01
I dont think anyone is censoring bitcoin. I think it gets more news than needed. Its consistently being hyped every price jump, its in fact really annoying. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:18:04
It can and the tech maybe will do so. But this also means it can render money itself obsolete. Which would mean storing bitcoins is great and all, but if capitalism ends (which its happening). The whole market system will have to go and eventually we will be in a society without money. I would love that. But to think you have a couple of bitcoins and you're going to be a millionaire is ridiculous  
@_date: 2015-07-11 19:29:18
You can make a ton of money if you sell at the peak of the next boom. But to say "you're sitting comfy in 10 years" is completely asinine. In a country where personal responsibility is not needed to financial storage. I just do not see how you expect people to act as their own banks to support such a boom in the price. On top of many other factors. Bitcoin is old. Something new will take blockchain and redefine it by the time you all think you're gonna get rich.

I keep hearing bitcoin is growing but It feels like while it is growing, more and more people are also leaving it due to getting burned. I have a couple of friend who some made 10 grand plus off of bitcoin who sold it all and absolutely do not care about it anymore because nothing is happening for mainstream adoption. I feel the same way. I just do not see how you can rely on a personal computer for financial store.
@_date: 2015-07-19 08:24:32
I will not mention bitcoin to anyone unless its relevant to the conversation. It's the same as trying to convert someone to Mormonism, you cant do it just let it go. Honestly normal people should not even get involved in bitcoin unless they want to get burned. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:20:52
So all those people faked it? Doubt it.
@_date: 2015-09-07 19:26:59
So glad I got out when it was 400+
