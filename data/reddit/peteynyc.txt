Got it to work. Can’t find nothing with wallet :/ noticed the oldest files are 2014. I may have restored around then from a virus :( I’ll keep checking 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:50:23
Won’t this increase the price? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:37:01
Do I need a hard drive to usb? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:44:17
I have a desktop. But if no OS is on, how Can I look for files without a HDD to usb?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:31:24
Okay, clearly there is no OS. How do I go about it? Do I install normal from a dvd or USB? Will that erase any information stored on the computer if I do? Any help is appreciated and if I do have and find bitcoin on here, I will be paying people who help!
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:33:19
How do I create this on a usb? I have a few sitting around. Never got into Linux 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:54:55
I connected it. But nothing is popping up. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:33:34
In 2-4 years you’ll look back and think why... the 1000-2000$ rent will be equal to 100k.. maybe more, maybe less but you get the point.

Shows bobs and vageen first den I tell u ok?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:14:32
All 21 million would’ve been sold already? If it wasn’t possible to sell
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:04:58
Send me one, then send them offline. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:35:17
Correct 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:19:12
Same. It happens sometimes. Wait a few minutes. Close the app, then reopen it and you should be back in. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:38
Future contracts. They’re getting ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:07:08
How do these work?
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:27:11
Wanna send me 0.14 bitcoin? I have 0.86 and really want a full bitcoin ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:04:14
500 btc hold, cough, but sure carry on. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:11:05
This! Exactly what I was thinking. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:19:36
I’ll do it but I’ll Charge you a 20$ fee. ����‍♂️ 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:50:39
Don’t worry. Bitcoin will hit 1 million by 2020. So he won’t have too. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:20:33
Buy ripple. It’ll be worth it. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:31:19
There what I did. A wire transfer back in may, and saved a good amount of fees 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:01
WALL STREET IS HAVING FUN
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:20:57
I can’t sell mine either. I tried selling it to see but I can’t atm
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:26:00
It’s deleted. I took a screenshot though. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:38:38
Opinion based my guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:20
Very true. Thanks for this. I’ll hodl. Nothing to lose lol 
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:48:03
Vape liquid. And what documents? 
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:49:05
���� I fixed it after this was taken, I should’ve uploaded the one. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:46
WALL STREET 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:52:44
How much do you make for the 8 hours?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:18:55
What do you mean being traded next month?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:37:42
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:05:11
You are locked in at the price you purchased it at. Verify your ID with Coinbase with a webcam or uploading it, and you’ll be grand!
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:24:40
Let’s say you have a hardware wallet or paper wallet, how do you cash out if you ever reach your moon? Just curious. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:18:30
6 months it’ll be 300-500$ increments. Just watch. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:41:44
I’d say so. Maybe someone can find it on the blockchain. Must’ve been massive. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:27:55
That’s what I’m in it for! Pay off a house in 5-10 years,  maybe more. But that is my moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:44:26
I sold 43 bitcoins at $4300 around early 2013 I believe. Bought them for 6-9$ each. This was before the crash I believe. I was young and didn’t look at it as investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:15:05
Put them in the bitcoin Vault on Coinbase 97% of it is stored off the server in offline safety deposit boxes. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:46:54
In the year 2140 the last bitcoin is estimated to be sold with the price increases. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:52:09
Alerts in the app. And you put the prices you want for alerts. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:04:05
You’ll be waiting a while. It dipped from 10,876 to 10,037. Invest now! Never wait. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:09:28
Then the middle 2013. I believe around late summer, early fall time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:13:58
Even if you use Coinbase no name is ever revealed, unless investigated further by the authorities. I don’t know why you would care if someone sees your name if you’re not scamming them.. but what do I know?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:02:26
What do you Recommend 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:56:24
I use Coinbase personally. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:38:26
That’ll probably be 25-40k 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:57:00
Yea I never was good with math :p
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:44:55
When you invested at 19$ a bitcoin,  you get happy seeing it go up. Just because YOU don’t want alerts for that, I do. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:03:31
English? Por forvor? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:08:23
Leave litecoin alone!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:23:25
Verify your identity and you won’t have anything to worry about? I’ve never had a problem with Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:13:30
Yes. You’re under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do will be used against you in the court of law, you have the right to an attorney, if you can’t afford one, one will be appointed to you. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:18:39
Remindme 6 months 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:41
Use GDAX wire transfer 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:21:17
Possibly. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:26:12
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:26:01
Join question, what does hodl mean ?
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:19:19
The family's lol. I just use it. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:42:06
Sorry I already think of that older Asian guy from California with the same name as satoshi and I will believe it’s him forever. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:36:33
What does hodling mean 
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:51:26
Just use a virtual machine 
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:07:49
 Thought you only pay tax with 20k a year or 200 transactions with coinbase?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:17:38
what did your post say, it says removed. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:31:37
Are you on coinbase or another? I haven't received anything. :( 
or if you're lying, please tell me. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:42:16
If the address is up and running to retrieve bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:02:25
I purchased it through bitcoin.com but gave my coinbase address, it says 24 hours, but maybe longer since alot of people are now buying. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:36:21
Wouldn't be shocked, he was sure that bitcoin will reach $500 one day. He probably is filthy rich. If he sees this, ples contact me, and share your wealth. &lt;3
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:30:40
Very true! thank you! I bought it at $2400ish, so i should see a few bucks more ;D
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:15:35
how long did simplex take to process your payment? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:34:13


it says nothing found?? but im using the wallet address coinbase gave me! Shouldn't it work?? I bought a good amount of coins, and im still waiting for them. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:04:28
SAME HERE! I'm thinking of calling my bank and asking them if they can cancel it since it's still in pending. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:16:47
did they ever reply? i bought 1000$ worth, and paid 75$ in fees plus trhe 1000$, would i have any more fees? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:55:16
where did you purchase it from? And have you received it yet? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:59:17
Any update? It's been 3-4 days now without a response!! I bought $1010 worth and want it now at the dip! But they won't reply 
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:13:36
Cool will do this tomorrow! When I purchase the bitcoins is it locked in at the price of time? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:58:14
Nope! Still nothing! not even a response back!!!
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:12:34
I just got a email, my thing was cancelled because the recent drop in bitcoin, which I respect because I bought in at $2500 now it's $2200 I'm going to just find a bank transfer site, and use that so it's fast and convenient. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:52:54
I don't know. I tried contacting them but no reply. I'm verified. My drivers license, phone, email, etc. 250$ limit and 150$ for card. It sucks because it's so low now 
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:14:26
how long did simplex take to process it for you? I;m waiting almost 2 days now with nothing. i bought 1000$ worth. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:56:07
how did you check? if you don't mind me asking? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:27:20
Yeah i never received anything besides the me being verified email. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:30:30

@_date: 2017-05-26 15:43:41

@_date: 2017-05-25 23:56:26
