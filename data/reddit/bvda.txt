I have had some of my portfolio stored with Coinbase. Despite all the critique they get here on Reddit, I have only had a good experience doing business with Coinbase.
But that does not change what I wrote earlier: The only thing you own is an IOU from Coinbase for whatever amount of BTC you have brought.
The questions you should ask yourself are: 
"Do I trust Coinbase with my money?" — If the answer is yes, then there is no problem. 
"Do I know what happens if Coinbase get hacked" — If your are not US-based, there are other rules that apply ( 
"Am I willing to accept the loss if Coinbase looses all its assets" — If the answer is no. Get it out now.
That being said, my personal opinion is that Coinbase is one of the most trustworthy exchanges right now. 
But please, please, do note that this is my PERSONAL opinion. When you are investing your hard-earned money, you should really, really do you own research and make your decision based on what YOU believe in :)

Remember to transfer it to a wallet you have one hundred percent control over. You only own crypto if you have the private key, and if it stored on a exchange, that is not the case.

I'm all good, because I only invested fiat that I can afford to lose :)
