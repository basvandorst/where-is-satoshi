im not wrong, if you could predict the price accurately you would be infinitely rich not spewing bullshit on reddit.

actual lol, as soon as you sell over a million HMRC or the IRS will assign an individual tax officer to help work through the implications of what your doing and obviously you would be able to afford proper legal representation - which you would have sought out beforehand. There is nothing inherently illegal in trading coins, anyone with any experience or money would seek proper legal advice, pay tax, and make infinite money if as you claim, they could see the future. Which you clearly cant. Because if you had infinite money from being prescient you wouldn't be here spewing hateful bullshit on reddit, would you?
quit your nonsense fool.

clearly a lie. If anyone knows what the price will do in the future they wouldn't be posting on reddit, theyd be spending their billions in monte carlo or milan.
you are claiming you knew the price would go from 20k to 4k and you did NOT sell then in order to re-acquire 5x as much, either you are a liar or stupid, but most likely, you are both.

yeah, he chooses not to make infinite money and instead posts idiocy on reddit, im calling bullshit.

we sold a few in december at 20k.. which was dumb luck, then we bought them all back, over the following few months with enough change for a few little luxuries, couple of holidays, car, new hand made four poster bed and so on.
Just waiting for 40k now   :)

that is one of the joys of btc.
it keeps massively outperforming the doubters and holders expectations, and yes, there are dips and corrections. Is it more volatile and unstable than stocks and shares, yes, but that again is part of the fun.
@_date: 2019-01-02 08:33:16
the same as it was when it was 20 cents, but with bigger stakes.
@_date: 2019-01-02 07:29:01
not really, its near certain it will get to 100k then a million - one day- maybe not soon, but one day.
just keep acquiring btc and one day you will be rich, its simple.

i put agricultural because there is no option for retired.
