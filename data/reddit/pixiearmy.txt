"All in at $9200. Holy shit - I will never get a chance like this again!"

Meh - that's not going away for a long time. 99% of the shit people do is based on fiat. Nobodies wrapping their head around what .004535353252 BTC actually means. Maybe when millions of people start using crypto to pay rent, bills and groceries we'll see a change.

There's a difference between the nuanced explanation you gave, and the statements of Buffet regarding Bitcoin and crypto.
You're putting words in his mouth. He has said absolutely nothing inciteful on the subject of blockchain or crypto at all.
In the end, if you're looking to invest in disruptive, risky, innovative, future tech, etc...i.e. industries that could collapse over night or become the Amazon's of the future...the last person you're going to look for advice on those industries is Warren Buffet.
Buffet is a great resource if you want stable, established, sustainable companies to invest your money, and have a fairly amazing guarantee of returns over 40 years. There's nothing wrong with that - it's the smart / safe way to invest. But I'm sure very few people throwing money into Bitcoin are doing it because it's safe. The same way people who threw money into Apple in the 90s, or Amazon in 2004, or Netflix in 2009 did so because it was safe. You are betting on an unknown future, not on present day bankable assets.

Meh, it could collapse to $0.99 for a couple years, as long as it rockets back up in time to save his jiblets.

Stock price is irrelevant. It's only a reflection of supply and marketcap. Nobody would think it was crazy if we were talking hundreds of millions of coins and $9.00 vs. $7.50.

$1 million by 2025 would require plenty of demand lol. You're talking 11000% increase in 7 years. 2040 would be just fine as well.

Not invested in IBM I see.

So does this basically eliminate the need for stuff like Civic, Selfkey, TheKey, etc.? Or would separate projects still be necessary on ERC20?

Not if you have a horse named Bitcoin Price.

Clearly that's not the case. The video shows otherwise.

Sell 10 and throw it into $AMZN. In 10 years you'll be able to retire either way. I'm fully expecting to be living under slave owner King Bezos, while running my underground resistance with crypto.
