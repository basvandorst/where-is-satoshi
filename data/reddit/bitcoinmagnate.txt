Overlooking, for the time being, that he isn't gonna be in power 'coz he doesn't wanna, did he ever say that he wanted to stop it? If you asked me about your odds of walking out of Fort Knox with pockets full of gold, and I said "slim to none, you'll get stopped," would this imply to you that I'll be the one doing the stopping, or even that I care about such shenanigans?

My guess:
Half will tell you they'd rather x10 price. The other half is gonna lie.

If I need to dump, convincing you ("others") to buy is the only way. If I convince you to dump? Instead of my ~~mark~~ customer, you become my competitor. Vying for the same (although now smaller by one -- you) pool of ~~suckers~~ customers. 
That's a check in the "loss" column. And my gain, if I speak the truth? Your internet love, Anon; possibly an upvote.

Which ruling? I think the guy neither knows much or cares about Bitcoin. His position is simply ["Meh, if it gets big enough to be a nuisance, governments will stop it"](

Dunno. Causation is hard to confirm. Could be coincidence. *The most amazing combinations can result if you shuffle the deck enough* :)

What, other than a possible misdemeanor bench warrant, should the guy be arrested for? From skimming the article, OP won some civil settlement because no-show, what else? AFAIK, they can't arrest a guy for being a douche. The guy knows how to pick his marks - crypto geeks/Libertarians/Free State Movement.  Issues with authority; won't run to the law for help.

Austin's total population is less than a million people. Having lived there, can tell you it's not NYC, nearly everyone drives/has a car. And yet ... one out of 100 Austin residents worked as a driver for Uber or Lyft?!

The drop was on high volume, most of the volume being China (BFX happened to be doing some maintenance &amp; was down). Do you think Chinese whales are all zerohedge fans?

He merely pointed out that “You’re wasting your time (with Bitcoin)! Virtual currency, where it’s called a bitcoin vs. a U.S. dollar, that’s going to be stopped. No government will ever support a virtual currency that goes around borders and doesn’t have the same controls. It’s not going to happen.”
But I can see how you might be a bit unnerved by Dimon becoming the Secretary of the Treasury. Hopefully his lack of interest in becoming one is of some comfort. 
Chin up, Champ. Bitcoin is unstoppable!
Edit: or maybe not. Who knows, perhaps your nail-biting is justified.

Careful with advice from internet friends, Day trading tends to be a competitive (not cooperative) sport.

Nice. Though I didn't mean "down from when spottedmarley bought his first coin. What I meant was "down from right before the news hit." 
Any ideas?

It's good that more than half of the hashpower will be in strong and capable hands; exactly what Satoshi had envisioned.

True, a CC is basically a free, 0% loan. That lets you charge back if [or, rather, "when"] someone mails you a brick instead of what you paid for. And also offers you some perks, like cash back. So literally pays you to use it.
No comparison.

Never gamble with your rent money. Or, as they say here, "Never invest more than you can afford to lose."

So at least 5 million Bitcoin ATMs in India alone. Or roughly 100 ATMs per bitcoin user.

Thanks for your insightful and well-reasoned contribution, friend! Without you, r/bitcoin just wouldn't be what it is. I appreciate you; your opinion is important to me. Have an upvote.

Depends on what you mean by "native currency." If "something you can pay all your debts, like taxes, court settlements and parking tickets," then yes it does.

Don't know about Iceland, but here in US, people already can pay for their stuff in Bitcoin. If Bitcoin was to be made legal tender, people could be *forced* to pay for some of their stuff (taxes, tort settlements, parking tickets) in Bitcoin.

No. SegWit still makes Lightning possible.
