@_date: 2017-08-25 19:47:26
Same fee for $5
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:30:27
How funny we were talking about that on this Reddit post 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:50:08
Yea you still would have to pay the same fee to buy a $5 coffee but bitcoin cash has lower fees and faster transaction speed it's a better route 
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:02:41
But no global warming XD
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:11:10
Yea sorry but could you dumb it down a bit cuz do you mean change the miner or the wallet 
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:58:45
This is the reason for global warming.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:09:53
Just look at your fees are you blind also I thought bitcoin was a way to have a decentralized currency not a way to make money it seems like that's all you guys care about is the price going up and you don't even care about what it actually is 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:02:08
P2p transaction, fast, cheap. I'm not seeing it
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:06:00
And you know someone just told me that I'm not an expert because my account is 5 weeks old so why dose that give you the right?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:16:28
Bitcoin cash is not bcash. Bcash is a different coin
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:52:23

@_date: 2017-11-17 04:05:07

So your saying the government is taxing crypto but it only makes btc fees high
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:47:03
Yes there is but are they credible sources I mean this is the Internet and one thing that I have seen fist hand is high fee how can you explain that
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:53:38
Yes you do have the brand name but bitcoin cash is what bitcoin was originally made to be 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:13:33

@_date: 2017-11-17 04:21:49

@_date: 2017-11-17 03:54:33
