Well, I have to say, if governments solution to the bitcoin is to print more money and further inflate the dollar... then a bitcoin will be worth billions. Quickly.

I was actually hoping to see mid 80's again.. Guess I'll just wait 4 hours till the next shake of confidence.

Thank you for your help! Quick question, how do I hind my bank's IBAN or SWIFT /BIC code? And how do I know which to look for?
@_date: 2013-05-08 05:24:53
Sounds awesome! Please, do keep us in the loop.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:13:12
I just found it funny that he thinks there could be a way to actually tax bitcoins.
Edit: Good or bad, you can't really tax bitcoins, only once they get traded and the fiat funds are withdrawn from the exchange (or wallet).
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:48:39
Thanks for the BTC man! I'll have to get used to the unique UI, but it seems interesting so far.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:50:52
Just curious, which way did you get started in BTC? Early developing days for free, mining, or some time after the first crash to ride the wave? Some other way?
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:48:32
"Since you cannot purchase most things with bitcoin... *yet*."
There ya go, ftfy.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:55:47
Meh, just trying to be helpful.. There alot of first-time people around, as you say, and I'm sure they could use all the help they could get.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:03:28
Oh, yeah, totally. A big 'if' indeed. I don't expect it to, but obviously after the last couple weeks, the unpredictability has been crazy! But like I said, Bitcoin is a HUGE thing. Not only the several millions tied into it, the several merchant dedicated to it, and the massive media attention, but it's also just pivotal in revolutionizing the way we look at currency as a whole. 
But it *could* all come crumbling down... Who knows.
@_date: 2013-04-26 12:18:26
Plus the currency you are dealing in is deflating all along, so the short term profits are growing in of themselves long term.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:08:03
Wow man, that's awesome. I forgot about my coins and when I checked I had about 1.5 and I was still pretty pleased. I can only imagine how you must've felt.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:53:26
Oh, I'm not worried, I'm excited!
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:27:06
And just about every other exchange... (all though Campbx has come back recently)
Question; why does Campbx consistently sell higher than everyone else?
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:31:58
if i am U.S. based, what do I actually need to initiate the withdrawal to my popular U.S. commercial bank? There are a lot of option on the Gox withdrawal page and not a lot of explanation.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:22:21
Stake bought. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:00:15
Good point. But I do think that the equivalent value of 1 million USD would still have alot one value, just not as much as today. Probably something on the order of hundreds of thousands. (still nothing to sneeze at.)
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:08:29
You could ask the same about the USD.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:42:23
What about them did you not like?
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:00:12
Well, think of it this way, if it becomes as big as we are all expecting, and you have all of these competing forces, it will be at a time where a large portion of all fiat currency is being moved into cryptocurrency. So it would not be much different than the currencies of small but steadily growing nations.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:39:38
Well, shit.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I hope, at least, his wife will be able to access the accounts. It would be a shame for things to turn around and his family not be able to earn anything back.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:27:33
People seem to think you can invent a whole brand new currency over night and the next day it will be the new Euro or Dollar or Yen.
Yes, Bitcoin is a couple years old. But I repeat. Bitcoin is only a couple years old. It is in it's infancy. It's growing, and fats, but there is still a while to go before it is truly a mainstream currency. But it does NOT mean that it is not a legit currency because it is experiencing growing pains and speed bumps. Every currency has to start somewhere. And Bitcoin is still an infant. Give it some time to grow.

If anyone is interested, I made an 'unofficial' investment in  It was a small one, just to test the waters, but I've already gotten a return from it.. It's more a matter of whether it gets popular like satoshi dice.
And I have just gotten my AM shares, so I'll have to wait to see the dividends. But hey, that's the fun part, waiting...
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:04:57
Ha, this is just so awesome. I love this community.

This sounds amazing! If one were inclined to contribute in some way, where would one seek to do so?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:20:43
I'd love to hear some insight on this as well; I could really see it going either way.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:15:07
I was thinking, more along the lines of... $ (or BTC)... And such
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:40:21
Do you guys have your orders in already, or are you gonna wait till the last second?
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:02:11
If I'm reading into it correctly... it's almost like a universal, cross-platform cloud OS that has customizable sharing capabilities.

I, too, am a proud owner of .00302512BTC thanks to the bitcointip bot! We've all got to start somewhere right?

To answer your last question; absolutely no one.
There is simply no historical data from which to make predictions.
The only thing you can do if you want to speculate is to try to base things off of real world events. That is the only knowable variable in the current scenario. 
So people were/are saying monday, because with the banks being closed (weekend) people who having been waiting in ques to get verified now have to wait even longer to put money into the trades... so, there is going to be a huge buy in at that point (theoretically) that coupled with the shakiness as of late, a lot of people are going to be hesitant to make the big moves until they know what things are starting to look like Monday.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:01:50
Awesome response. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:47:53
Sadly, I think not.
@_date: 2013-05-02 08:35:03
We wouldn't be trading an earth currency with an alien species, we'd be trading resources like carbon rich minerals and precious gems. (I'm sure everyone likes/ can find a use for shiny things)
Not to mention, it is alway possible that we will out grow the notion of currency entirely by then. Indeed, it may even be necessary.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:02:05
I keep hearing about these theoretical eventual BTC prices, ranging from 6000 to 1,000,000. Where does the vast difference between these values come from, and I know they are theoretical, but is there anyway to guess at the most likely range? (assuming it doesn't go to $0)
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:06:52
*If* it dies, this is probably the most like likely scenario. Any crashes, or rallies for that matter, are likely to be short-term events returning to a more long-term baseline up/down trend whether it's up or down--given the volume and dispersal of BTC currently.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:08:55

DDoS is not a "hack" in the sense that there's not (necessarily) a breach of security. A DDoS can be triggered by a lot of heavy traffic, or also a network of computers being purposefully directed at the site for the same effect. It's more of an external roadblock than an internal attack.
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:03:46
I very highly doubt we've seen a even a portion of the eventual market volume. And with more volume (being deflationary and all..) high prices. The higher the prices, and the higher the liquidity, the more stable it will end up being.

What time is this, CST?
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:18:16
If you go to bitfund, there are several smaller miner-coops and it doesn't seem like a bad way to go.. You can see what hardware they are using and a very clear "contract" of what is expected and how profits are distributed. Dividends are the way to go.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:06:46
Omg, that was awesome. The power of the internet never ceases.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:54:41
Fyi, it's 1 hour and 10 minutes to go.

Actually, that's a good question.
@_date: 2013-05-09 00:26:21
That's a pretty good tip, actually.

"How do we tax it?"
