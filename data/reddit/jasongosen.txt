I hope they don't burn the coins like freakin' Wired did. &gt;:|

I think this is important. If buying Bitcoin was instantaneous with a credit card, PayPal or cash, then the April bubble would have been vastly larger.
Edit: I don't know how to quote people.

I've been searching for something like this. Thank you. It looks like they don't charge ridiculously high fees either.

1. Buy offline paper wallet generator from trusted vendor.
2. Generate paper wallets.
3. Smash paper wallet generator to pieces.
4. Sleep easy with peace of mind.
5. Profit???

Should the average person with a small amount of BTC on their phone be concerned about this? Is this really that easy to exploit on a mass scale before it's patched by the devs?
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:43:14
Wired, suck my baaalls. You're not getting any clicks from this bitcoiner.

I think the little "Pay with Bitcoin" button is going to be a permanent fixture for future Humble Bundles. They must have had a good turnout for the "Humble Bitcoin Bundle".

Do we know what happened to all the BTC that was stored on SR? Did DPR send it back to custies, or destroy it? Or did the feds get all the coins?

This is actually not a big deal at all. Android has app-private storage that protects an apps files from being messed with by other apps or the operating system. There are a few cases, however, when this is a big deal.
1. You've rooted your Android device and the protected app storage is no longer secure.
2. You're running an old version of Android and you've downloaded some malware that can break into app-private storage.
While the post dose raise a valid concern it is not a red alert. Don't put more coins in your phone than you're willing to lose. And as OP said, be safe.

Esperanto is an international auxiliary language. It's not meant to give you "linguistic advantages" over your native tongue. It enables communication among people of different cultures with a language that doesn't have a cultural bias.

I always considered these to be novelty wallets, not secure wallets. I still use them, but only for cold storage. I would never try and pay someone with one.

I don't think all of the hate should be directed at Bob. He may in fact not be the one who made this decision. A better action would be to email one of the editors at Wired.
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:07:56
That's reassuring, but is there a ceiling or upper limit on how long it will take?

Mostly I'm just sitting on them. After that I'm using them to give value back to people who produce original content that I enjoy. I love the fact that I'm giving directly to the content creator and giving jack shit to PayPal, Visa, etc.

Yes, but It looks like your question goes a bit deeper. You're asking if Canadians can use Coinbase with fiat. Nope.
Have you tried cavirtex.com? They work with a couple major banks in Canada to accept cash deposits. Maybe there's a branch in your town where you can make a deposit.
@_date: 2013-10-05 07:49:20
By all means do so!

You'll have to delete it yourself. C:\Users\YourFace\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin
The folder might be hidden on your system, but your using Bitcoin so I'm assuming you know your shit.

It's really easy to buy Bitcoins in Canada thanks to CaVirtEx. I can get them same-day for cash.
If you're in a major city you could search craigslist.

It would be a good idea to have at least 2GB of ram. The current size of the block chain is ~8GB and this will grow at an increasing rate in the future, but for now the storage on your MacBook is ample. After the initial download the network usage is minimal when receiving and relaying to other nodes.
It should run just fine. :)
