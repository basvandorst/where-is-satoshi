This isn't exact by any means, but check out this chart overlay I made of btc price over the # of transactions. Look at that divergence in price...

I used Expedia today and paid with bitcoin. Standard deals worked no problem using the bitcoin tab on the checkout page but their "Expedia Unpublished Rate Hotel" does NOT work with bitcoin at this time (for me anyways).
This is where you book the hotel without knowing the hotel name. I would have liked to do that - it would have saved me almost $50. Oh well - I left feedback letting them know.

quote from article, "the bill may likely fall short due to lack of support and Stockman's pending exit from Congress..."
It absolutely won't pass. People barely showed up for net neutrality. The only chance it has is if people were to really get behind it in mass and let their elected officials know...and even then it's a long shot.

Wow...it's not "you're" it's "Your". Talk about irony. Anyways, I think most would agree it's good to diversify.

I really like the idea but honestly the site needs some work. First off the .net domain name isn't a good one. BitcoinBF.com is available. Much better and easier to remember. 
The logo, the color scheme, the header all need a total revamp.
I think the main problem is that you are expecting merchants to list their own deals and submit their own web banners. You may get 1 or 2 small bitcoin sites, but I'd be very surprised if you get anymore. 
What you should consider instead is doing all the btc discount deal hunting yourself and then posting the deals you find, at no charge to anyone obviously. Posting relevant, quality and unique content on your site and the traffic will come to you - if you keep up on it and work it. Forget the any type of google adsense or monetizing the site at the start. Build the site and maybe next year or the year after you can charge for premium placements and do affiliate and adwords.
For example if you know that both Dell and Overstock are having black Friday bitcoin deals, post whatever info you can find regarding their deals now; include links and discussion opportunities. Keep it updated as more details come in. It'd be nice to have a list of all BF btc deals in one place, and even better if it was 365 days a year of bitcoin deals. Websites like fatwallet and slickdeals have grown for a reason.

I play csgo sometimes, what "skin" is worth upwards of $300? I just gave away multiple crates I never use to an online steam friend of mine.

Looks like they are mostly commenting about Kiosks. 
Notice how WU is constantly calling bitcoin "currency" in the pages of their comments....everything is "currency this, and virtual currency that", like bitcoin and money are the same, and that's it, when it's just one aspect of bitcoin. When was bitcoin defined as currency anyways?

The actual layout and structure looks fine and the page is responsive but it's just that huge logo or whatever at the top that is immediately followed by a huge AD, and then the huge logo again at the top of the blog post. Just terrible...

There is what they call a 'chargeback ratio' of usually 1%...if your business gets 2 credit card chargebacks per 100 transactions your account is subject to review, higher rates, &amp; your money being held in escrow (up to $10k) for up to 6 months...or until your chargeback ratio falls back below 1%.
Another positive for BTC is that it's accessible. A small business owner with less than ideal credit may have a hard time even securing a merchant account. If they do get an account, their rates will be higher.

Where does Andreas stand on the current debates? Has he voiced his opinion on what he thinks should be done? With all the mis-info and claims flying back and forth, I'd trust whatever he recommends. The dude is like batman...incorruptible.
