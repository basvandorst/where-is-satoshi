Coinbase still cannot verify my payment method and Gemini has still not verified my account. This problem is not unique to me because I’ve had 2 friends try the same thing and could not add funds. I don’t know what to do.

It really sucks because I’ve been trying to buy bitcoin since it was at 10K and I can’t even make an account

19 year old college student. I've been observing BTC prices since it hit 10K with intent to invest about $1,000. Currently in the process of creating an account and transferring funds. Do I buy immediately when the funds become available or do I wait for a dip? I know there is no right answer to this, just looking for opinions.

What is the most trusted bitcoin buying site that isn't coinbase/gdax?

Why do you bitcoiners get so defensive when anyone questions anything involved in bitcoin? Everyone on here preaches to only use coinbase/gdax and those are not working for me. This is happening to a lot of people. I’ve been using way more complex services to buy stocks for years. Coinbase is a simple service that isn’t reliable right now. That shouldn’t be so hard to grasp.

it has been so unreliable for me. It wont even send my phone a registration code. I don't know what to do.

Santander. It’s a northeast American bank. Both of my friends also use that bank so maybe it could be that. Thanks for the help.

I’ve tried both. With my credit card I put the 2 withdrawals in and they said they are incorrect even though they are clearly correct. When I use my bank account I put in my login info and security questions answers and they say they cannot connect even though I know they’re right. The same thing happened to 2 of my friends.
