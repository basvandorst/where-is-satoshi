In at 5k out at 15k couldn't be happier. Best of luck to everyone holding btc but bitcoin cash and the other altcoins need to stop the in fighting and work to get cryptocurrencies accepted as an actual form of payment not just a store of value for longterm success.

Dont worry soon you will be rich... or homeless.

What exactly backs bitcoin? What intrinsic value does it have?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:07:04
So the gold coins the US Gov mints that you can turn right around and sell above the value of gold... those just dont exist?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:21:06
The thing is that the prices of the goods you buy with US Dollars went down as well. If bitcoin drops rent doesnt drop with it. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:57:46
What real usable value does it have other than that? No where useful accepts it and it has crazy high transaction fees and times right now so even if accepted it is useless as a currency for now. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:04:22
No one is paying $200 to buy $2000 worth of gold... not to mention it is only 2oz. APMEX will ship 50 grams of gold (about $2,200) for free. Whoever is paying 10% to ship gold is dumber that people who view bitcoin as an investment rather than a speculation.

1. Slow transaction time
2. High transaction cost
3. Governments will hate it and legislate it (too easy to pay for illegal goods and move large sums of money without being tracked) 
4. No one useful accepts it (a currency needs to be able to buy things, until I can pay rent and buy food with it is not a currency)
5. General public knows nothing about it. (Ask a normy what the difference is between bitcoin core and bitcoin cash... then throw in some alt coins just for fun)
6. To easy to compete (anyone can make a new crypto that is slightly better, faster, cheaper, etc.) It is very hard to compete with tho barriers to entry. If you can't make your product different then you have to compete on cost leadership and price wars arent fun for anyone. 
7. Way to volatile. Everyone wants in when its up 5k in a month but now that its down 7k from its high people have a bad taste in their mouth. No one knows what it is worth. A bunch of people "hodling" propping up its price from falling further is not how I want my money to be stored. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:09:57
 one is paying $200 for a shipment of gold.
I have seen this argument before. APMEX will ship you gold for free. I did have to spend HUNDREDS transferring and selling my bitcoin. 
Where are people getting the idea it costs a bunch of money to ship gold?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:05:08
US Gov still mints gold coins that have very high value. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:13:06
 guy is an idiot. People with privileged information fucking over people who dont have it because the price was gonna change anyways is ok? So if a CEO dumps all of his stock at a high price the week before bad news comes out and the price drops that is ok? That is stealing from everyone who bought those shares. PERIOD!

How would you apply sales tax to something like drugs? Not to mention people would go around normal sales methods just to avoid sales tax. With a car you have to register it with the gov. What about a TV, food, etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:06:22
 forget to pay taxes on the growth. Don't want to be thrown in jail or have your house taken by the IRS.

No one is really getting rich off bit coins tho. even if you bought $1000 worth when it was trading at $6 you still only have $1,000,000. Not a bad chunk of change but a long ways from rich. If you pay taxes on your gains you have much less than that. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:06:45
150,000 is rich?
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:31:03
thats awesome. nice
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:10:27
has anyone actually gotten rich with bitcoins? I mean who has turned a small amount of money into say 10 to 15 million?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:36:46
Billions of dollars come from taxes other than payroll. If corporations paid in bitcoin they could pay much less to get the worker the same $$$ so they would be incentivized not to use standard payroll. Not to mention illegal things like the drug trade, hiding and transferring assets tax free, etc. 
I see your point but I don't agree with the logic. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:59:25
what was your transaction cost?
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:06:10
There were literally thousands of companies that went out of business. To compare bitcoin to one company who is very good at what it does is silly. Amazon gained value because it produces profits. It has a product. Bitcoin produces nothing. It has no product. The only thing driving its value up right now is itself. The fact that it is trendy and has been rising lately. It needs a purpose if it is to succeed. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:42:25
LOL tons of people did stop using bit torrent. Furthermore, if the government said no one could accept bitcoin for purchases, no one could possess bit coin (that would be hard to prove), no one could sell bitcoin in the US (block coinbase, etc), no one could invest in bitcoin, and so on it would cripple it. 
Most people dealing with bitcoin now don't even realize how to properly hide it and would not risk their freedom just to have something that is very hard to spend. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:08:36
A digital currency that is probably working its way into a giant bubble. One whose demand is simply driven by its price going up quickly which is driven by its demand. 
Or ownership in a company that produces actual products and services. Ownership in a company that engages in millions of profitable transactions every day. 
Yeah, I'll take the bubble. Until it pops at least. 
 I love that hours after saying this btc lost $600 lol. People we all love bitcoin but it is not an investment. If you want it to do well in the long run request that everywhere you do business start accepting it every time you pay. If you can pay in bitcoin always pay in bitcoin. Until then it is just a bunch of speculation driving the currently most popular digital currency.

Your friend said Netflix, Google , and Amazon had no product (he sounds sharp)? Well if your friend was wrong then I must be wrong now!!!
Now that we have that retarded logic out of the way explain to me why bitcoin has been going up so much? Tell me what the value of bitcoin will be in a week, month, and year. Explain why it just dipped back to $5500ish. Tell me what value it has? Prove to me that there is something other than speculation driving its price up. And also, if you believe in it so much you must have sold everything you own to purchase as much of it as possible right? If you think it is some magical money maker you would be retarded not to sell everything you own and buy in. 
It can't be used many places and has high transaction fees which puts it at a huge disadvantage to normal forms of payment. One place it excels is for illegal activity. Moving large amounts of money without the government knowing it and moving large amounts of money without it being taxed. As soon as that becomes common it will be made illegal. No one will be allowed to accept it. Exchanges will be banned from doing business. Possession will be criminalized. 
I do believe it will go up some but if you think it will magically make everyone millionaires you are retarded. Its only value now is its trendy and people hear about people making money with it so they buy in as well. Sounds a lot like a ponzi scheme in that respect. So where is the value? Where do the profits come from? Is it ads from searches like google, or streaming video services like netflix, or being the largest online retailer in the world like amazon? 
 does it do to generate all of this value?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:37:45
Exactly. Any drug dealer in the US not using bitcoin is a moron. Once it picks up they will come down hard on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:12:54
When has the US been like Venezuela? Great depression was 1000x better lol
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:32:37
That video is making some pretty bad assumptions. I agree with the idea but the guy forgets we have a say. We vote on what the taxes are. We have the option to leave the country if we don't like the taxes. It is not simply the government stealing without us having a say. 
Furthermore taxes are needed. Roads, police, military... I don't want that to be run by a bunch of small groups who arent working together. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:55:34
LOL so you cant answer any of those questions? Im just asking for some hard evidence is all. I know what google, amazon and netflix makes and how they make money. The fact that your friend was wrong does not mean I am. I will ask again. 
1) Explain to me why bitcoin has been going up so much? 
2) Tell me what the value of bitcoin will be in a week, month, and year. 
4) Explain why it just dipped back to $5500ish then back up to $8000+. 
5) Tell me what value it has? 
6) Prove to me that there is something other than speculation driving its price up. 
7) Have you invested every penny you have in the magic coin? If not why? Don't you think the magic coin will only go up?
8) Where is the value?
9) Where do the profits come from?
 can answer these questions as they relate to the companies you mentions. Why can't you answer them for the magic coin?

Started buying from 5 up thrrough 9.5. Got out at 15. I am laughing and I guess I am a "panic seller". I am def laughing more than the people who did the same thing but held instead of "panic sold" lol

Back to? When was it 20k?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:41:47
Im confused... its down 12k from like 2 months ago. I couldnt be happier I sold at 14. Def glad I didnt hold
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:29:49
You guys do realize the US government will never allow a currency like this to prosper. Right now they are deciding wether to tank it or tax it. If you think the US government is gonna miss out on profits of anything you are sadly mistaken. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:47:38
Its not just creating money out of thin air. It is effectively taxing everyone who has money by slightly devaluing it. 
(demand for money stays same + supply of money goes up = price of money goes down) 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:52:59
Wrong. The game never ends, only the players. You can leave you resources to who you want to dominate the game. That is how you win. Continued domination of other players who are not allowed to quit playing. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:37:06
I agree 100%. Anyone who calls it investing is special. It is speculation at best. It may do well it may not but there is no underlying production that is creating wealth and value like a stock or other actual investment asset. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:55:31
 bitcoin is not investing lol. It is speculation at best.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:16:14
don't make sweeping statements about groups of people. thats the same as racism. you wouldn't like it if i said you and all other poor people are lazy leaches would you?
jeeze, poor people are such dicks. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:48:31
1 in a million chance of having anything taken. Only gets taken if it is suspected that it was involved in a crime. All you have to do to get it back is prove that it was not involved in a crime. I can prove every dollar I have was not and never has been involved in a crime. I assume you can too. Its really not hard unless... you know... it was involved in a crime.
Please give me some examples where people who were doing nothing wrong had assets taken from them and not returned so we can fight it together. 
Poor people have no money to seize so there is little incentive to go after them. The evil wealthy /s have plenty to afford lawyers and sue and get it back and then some. I really don't understand the problem here. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:18:26
Right? If you earn a bunch of money on an investment just pay the taxes on it. Like you would expect anyone else to do. You will be fine. 
You can carry 10 million in cash if you want legally just let them know. No problem. 
Now if you use bitcoin for illegal reasons you are gonna have a bad day.
