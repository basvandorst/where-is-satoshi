The trolling is simply a symptom of the lack of a central authority figure that would make the necessary decisions. The decentralized nature of bitcoin has created an environment where a straightforward problem with a few options has turned into a charade with months of squabbling and absolutely no consensus because the stakeholders are all self-interested rather than bitcoin-future-interested.
If this was a company that was experiencing issues with its service due to poor scaling, they would have weighed the options, and internally chosen one that suits their service best going forward. Visa would not let months go by as their transactions took hours to process without making a decision on how it should be fixed.
Even public, open source projects need someone in charge. Linux would not have been where it is now if there was no Torvalds who would make the difficult decisions about what the future of Linux should be when there was more than one way to go forward. 
You're watching what happens to a large project when there's no one at the helm steering the ship. Humans figured out long ago that for any complex system of work, you need someone in charge making decisions (even if not everyone agrees with them) or else disagreements will cause the work to stall.

But you can't get your way in that situation - they say how it will be, and you either deal with it or shut up and make your own.

The problem is that you can double-spend $500 worth of groceries, while it's really hard to stuff $500 worth of groceries in your pants. 
It's fairly straightforward to change your appearance too. At some point it's going to be unfeasible for cashiers to check each person at the check out against dozens of known double-spenders. You're going to get a lot of false positives and a lot of wrongly-accused, pissed off, legitimate customers.
Let's say myself, my two brothers, and my wife are an unscrupulous bunch. That means each one of us can double-spend each grocery store in the area. The stores will be out huge amounts of money.

Maybe my mind is "backwards" or something, but it's much easier for me to do mental multiplication on integers than it is on decimals. Doubly so for division.
For this reason, it is much easier for me to figure out how much DOGE I'll need if something is $5 and $1 = 1315 DOGE rather than figuring out how much BTC I'll need if $1 = 0.00956BTC. I think people are more comfortable working with integers rather than decimals.

What tax-related data will the fancy service provide that the blockchain can't?

It's good that you linked to github, because it's the most transparent part of your operation here. Taking a look, it basically consists of wangbus, akinsey, taesup, and unenglishable contributing to it. Four people, each making 25K A MONTH for simple JavaScript work. That works out to a 300,000 annual developer salary for each of them. Yet 300K developers are so, *so* rare because you have to be exceptionally good to command that kind of pay.

I'm just curious as to how "no regulators, no secrets, and no market manipulators" could possibly be achievable, sustainable and fair to everyone
With no regulators, how will insider trading be controlled? Let's say a new innovative company is crowdfunded. Everyone's excited, and its price is skyrocketing. All it needs to be viable is to acquire some resourceA. But alas, it does not acquire resourceA. The CEO gets the news and passes them on to the employees, who all bail on the stock before the news hits the market. Everyone on the inside gets a lifeboat, and all the hapless bitcoiners are fucked. But with no regulators, everyone on the inside walks away scott-free.

So you'd be defending scam artists because at least their scams are creative?

Oh, I didn't know about this. On what factor does the rate of introduction depend on? Is it like a mathematical function that depends on the current total number of DOGE out?
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:53:09
Exactly. People who want to use BTC to actually buy stuff with it, want to see its price stable, regardless of what that price point is. If it's not stable the only utility you can get from it is gambling with it on the exchanges.

The closer analogy would be that while performing brake service, they discovered that they screwed something up, then tried to cover it up and lied to you saying it was already like that when they got it, then when you pointed out that it was obviously not they said, "okay sorry, we'll fix our mistake". Is that a mechanic you'd go back to?

Because when the value of BTC is unstable, consumers either acquire too little BTC (highly undesired as then you cannot complete the transaction) or too much BTC (still unwanted because they tied up more of their resources in BTC than they needed to) to make the transaction. 
The common rhetoric is to "hold more", but no consumer is going to want to hold more of something that's steadily lost 67% of its value over the past 6 months. And spikes with corrections aren't much better. If people put $10 into a box for bying things online, they don't want to find out that maybe it'll be only $5 in a week, or $15, or anywhere in between.

If a company's kneejerk reaction to a mistake is to lie and cover it up, that's probably not a company you want to fully trust.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:33:04
Still screws the consumers though
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:50:27
It won't get widely accepted if its value keeps going all over the place. Regrdless of its other benefits. No one will want to use BTC for financial transactions if when they buy X amount of BTC one day, they can't be confident that it will still be worth that much tomorrow.

This has nothing to do with bitcoin.

"In country X there are no murder laws whatsoever, so if someone murders you they are guaranteed to go free."
"Yeah well in the USA murderers sometimes go free, so the whole system is fundamentally broken."
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:52:28
Yes, it's a hyperbole to illustrate the point.

Ah, so the only business in which it's possible run on bitcoin is a business dealing with bitcoin itself. No fuckin shit.

At a time when the whole country is unstable and no one knows what's going to be happening next month. "Sure I'll convert my savings that I desperately need every cent of into a currency I can't readily use to buy groceries."
Sometimes I think people in this subreddit are smoking bitcoin-crack.
