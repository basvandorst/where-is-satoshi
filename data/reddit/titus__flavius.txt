The dollar was defined by the law back then, and it was based on the Spanish silver dollar. It defined as 371 grains of silver, which is a specific weight. You know them today as silver dollars. Based on today's prices that would be like between 50-75 thousand of our current dollars.

Your fees are about 50 cents (25 cents for each trade) and your marginal win on the trade is only about 22 cents. That's a 28 cent cumulative loss.

Great post. Peter is correct that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. He's just wrong that Gold isn't. All money systems are technically Ponzi schemes. It's just that these Ponzi scheme money systems are more efficient than barter so we use them anyways. Every money system will eventually be replaced by a better money system, no matter whether that takes a year or millennia, which makes it collapse and completes the Ponzi cycle. Bitcoin is just the newest Ponzi that is the most efficient money system at the moment and going forward.

Technical analysis has its plus and minuses...but anyone using TA on a linear chart for BTC is by definition an idiot.

Arbitrage. When one price changes in one place you can make a small marginal amount by buying at one price and selling at a higher price on a different exchange or in a different pairing.

Print Tether and buy BTC?

Ha. Ok. Thanks.

@_date: 2019-07-08 20:11:13
Ok, but to maintain the "dollar peg" or whatever they have going, they must be either injecting dollars or depreciating the "true" value of Tether and lying about the reserves. Am I right in that assumption? Which do you think it is?
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:09:02
I think it goes to the core of the crypto unknown. If BTC can be passed by an alt, then digital scarcity going forward is WAY more scary since the dominate crypto can just change with the whim of the crowd.
I think that it's unlikely that BTC will ever get passed since the code can be updated with any new innovation from the alt world. But, if it could or did get passed, then the whole thing is in trouble, and I think many BTC'ers understand this subconsciously which causes the hate on alts.

You assume I haven't? Telling me to read something doesn't refute anything I said. If you know what money is and I don't you should be able to explain what I'm wrong about.

It definitely seems like there is some fuckery going on there. I'm just not convinced yet that it's driving up the price or manipulating the btc market.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:16:23
"Tethers then enter the market via trade on exchanges (bitfinex, etc), where they are used to buy btc and inflate the value." - Ok, but it's here that someone has to be on the other side of that trade. The party trading the BTC gets the new Tether. So where is all this Tether ending up? 
If you are saying the Exchange is doing it, are they just trading BTC for Tether to themselves to drive up the ticks? 
If that was the case, then you could just arbitrage that exchange with other exchanges all day long bc their trades would always be above market.
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:23:41
I said "technically" they are Ponzi schemes because they rely on new entrants into the system to maintain the price. In function and practice they aren't Ponzies because there is no fraud involved and no central actor.
This is from the link you provided "Ponzi schemes rely on a constant flow of new investments to continue to provide returns to older investors." That is true of Bitcoin and Gold. Now in reality you could find a equilibrium but on a long enough timeline all money systems are unsustainable bubbles or Ponzies.

His gold company uses BitPay, so they only take dollars through that service. But anyways, Peter will deny BTC's value to the grave. Even if it becomes the world's reserve currency he will be predicting its ultimate collapse. He truly believes BTC is just digital fiat.
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:11:21
Yep. Maybe a smart contract coin and a privacy coin, but that's about it. I think almost all the alts will die.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:34:04
I've heard so much about this Tether manipulation. My question is where are all these Tethers ending up? Someone has to be on the other side of those trades.
I'm not saying you're wrong, it's certainly possible given what I know about Tether. I just want to know where all this Tether is going.

Ask her this simple question..."If Bitcoin is a threat to banks and they could kill it....what are they waiting for? It's been 10 years."
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:07:08
What am I wrong about?
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:23:40
The thing is...Peter is right about Bitcoin. He's just wrong about Gold and all other money systems. All money systems are technically Ponzi schemes in the sense that they require faith in the system for it keep going. If the faith in the system is lost, the value plummets. But there is a good reason we use these Ponzi scheme systems to facilitate trade, namely they are more efficient than barter. Bitcoin is just the most efficient Ponzi system going forward in the digital age, which is where his opinion is wrong. He thinks Gold is somehow exempt from this principle because it has "inherent value". Nothing has inherent value, ALL value is subjective including Gold's.

Ok, I get your point. But he never moved one coin. Not when it was a penny not when it was $1. Never. How could he have that kind of foresight?
@_date: 2016-01-10 19:04:49
Only thing that makes sense to me is that he died. I don't know of a person on this planet that could sit on hundreds of millions of dollars for that long. Only a dead man or a government that doesn't care about the money could sit on it that long.
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:54:04
I have a hard time believing that the guy who invented the system just loses private keys. Also, I don't have any facts to back this up, but I remember other people tracing his mining signatures all the way to the end and "he" never spent one coin.
@_date: 2016-01-10 22:00:22
But the coins we know are his have to, by necessity of numbers, outweigh the coins that he may have mined after that by at least 100 to 1, and it could be an even bigger ratio. No one sits on all those coins, no one.
@_date: 2016-01-10 21:57:04
I've never lost a private key, and I'm just a bum. Anyone can make mistakes, true, but the inventor of Bitcoin does not make THAT mistake. He doesn't lose thousands of keys to millions of coins. No way.
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:55:53
I grant that some people, though very few, don't care about money for themselves. However, those people usually do care about helping others. 500 million goes along way to help others.
For Satoshi, whoever it is, would have to be in the most extreme minority on earth just to sit on that kind of money.
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:57:58
Only a group of that nature could sit on that kind of money. Though even that is a tough one, becuase look what happened when the FBI got involved in the Mt. Gox shit. They stole tons of coins. Even the NSA or the CIA would have a hard time keeping their own from stealing.
I think this lends credence to the idea that whoever Satoshi was, he died shortly after we last heard from him or her.
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:59:35
There is a possibility that the CIA or the NSA were looking ahead to the future in the case of a Dollar collapse. If the Dollar collapsed and Bitcoin became the new world currency, they would be sitting on half the supply already.
@_date: 2016-01-10 19:44:07
Only thing that makes sense to me is Satoshi died. I don't know of a person on this planet that could sit on hundreds of millions of dollars for that long. Only a dead man or **a government** that doesn't care about the money could sit on it that long.

What's the seed?
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:45:01
It's the mechanism that controls the supply of new Bitcoins, making them harder to discover as the hash rate increases. Bitcoin is designed to act like the Gold market (pre-asteroid mining) where each ounce is harder to find than the last. The halvenings makes the supply of Bitcoin and asymptotic line approaching 21 million.
