Is it possible you just made this up so somebody will send you free coins?

Do I look like I’m kidding?

Mmhmm. Im so insecure I need to convince people that one of my kind made something to keep my head up.

You should sell all your crypto before its too late.

They made a pill to treat this condition. Costs 1000 btc for a week supply.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:41:26
Like I said, just listen to them and stay away from btc. Nobody is going to convince you otherwise.
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:01:46
Isn’t this the inverse etf?
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:33:56
Yes, listen to main stream media authors. Stay away from btc.

What difference does it make? Did you need a reason to feel superior and better than everyone else? I don’t even know why someone had the need to post something like this.

@_date: 2017-12-10 17:59:01
Assuming btc gets adopted globally.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:57:28
the price will have to keep increasing. There are more people being born than there are people dying. The new generation will inherit btc from previous hodler provided they havent spent it all. Knowing how people want to leave wealth behind for their children, the new generation will start off with btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:29:35
If it says pending then its pending. He did you mix pending with complete? Seriously?

Its funny because almost every single person who signed that bill have a concealed offshore account. Investigate them for terrorism.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:09:04
Jeebus. All I am saying is what if bitcoin becomes accepted globally as a reserve currency. I am not saying it will happen. But lets day in a parrarel universe bitcoin IS the reserve currency, would that universe have a pension/ss problem? I am not saying taht it will, I am asking would something like bitcoin solve ss/pension problem. Again, I am not saying that it will, I am just asking if it would if Jesus came back from the dead and made it the reserve currency. For fuck sake, why is that so hard to understand?
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:54:47
Damn, for once I like Jihan Wu. His response to this banker is hilarious.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:17:05
You from that bch fork then?
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:15:06
It has to. 99% of the world may have already adopted it but what remain constant is more people being born than those that are through retiring and is about to go six feet under. I guess at most you can have 40-45% who already have btc and 50-55% who will need btc. Unless they implement some serious population control, btc will have to keep rising in demand. 
We are afraid of overpopulation but we still havent colonized Mars yet. Personally, I feel we need more people if we are going to colonize other planets, and we have to be able to colonize other planets if we are to survive as a specie. Thats why I like btc, you can do interplanetary transactions.
The way I was thinking was instead of companies paying their employee pensions when they retire, they can just give their employees btc ( small amount until they retire) from day one as future pension payments. So you have like a collective pension pool backed by those companies because they will keep buying btc. This helps because instead of just one particular employer paying for one individual employees pension, now you have all people splitting the pension cost. And, since btc is appreciating in value, their burden will not increase. The stress is divided among all like tax but everybody can benefit from it.

Lol bcash shill.

Remove the bitcoin app. Go to ledger wallet site and reinstall the app. Itll show up then.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:23:10
You transfer to a wallet by sending your coins to a wallet you control.
For small amount &lt;10,000, it is easier than buying.
Really? Bitcoins are easily hacked they say? Ask them to source their claim. I dont remember an instance where bitcoin itself was hacked. Exchanges and people get hacked, not bitcoin. Its like saying the dollar is easily hacked when banks get hacked.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:00:10
That is a big assumption but if true, would it not solve the ss/pension issue?
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:19:30
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:43:40
Growing demand coupled with limited supply. I dont see why the world would reject the idea of a secure deflationary asset that promises a comfortable old age for all. 
I would buy into it. Some may be concern with the supply but remember it can be divided to the eighth decimal. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:23:09
Goddamn the motherfuckers who is manipulating my market. Goddamn them!! Especially if they’re bankers. Curse tgeir souls!!!

It might get confirmed or sent back to you in 72 hours. 
Some say two weeks but that is in wxtreme cases.
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:35:41
No, because that is not manipulation. That is just buying. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:51:00
You havent done any research if you think you can mine with a gpu and profit. 
Go ahead and try it. You’ll have to learn hard way. Just google/youtube mining software. 
I dont understand how people just jump to the mining conclusion.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:30:58
If the address is generated by your ledger wallet then it should still go to your wallet. That address is part of your wallet even if you generated a new one.
