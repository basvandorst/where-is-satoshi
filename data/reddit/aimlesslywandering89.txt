I did get in a bad accident and in 2017 I was home 24/7 and didn’t leave my room. Couldn’t watch tv or the news. I’m just now starting to get back my old self and pick up where I left off.

@_date: 2019-07-01 20:07:11
I’m not into computers you fucking dweeb. I know I can hook it up with hdmi. I don’t like computers like you because I don’t sit behind them all day. I honestly don’t know many people that could do this. You fucking dweebs aren’t as common as you think.
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:34:01
Yeah it’s a better preventive than treatment.
@_date: 2019-07-01 06:16:32
Into bitcoin? Bro I was into lifting weights and finding somewhere to buy steroids. All of the websites either take bitcoin or money order. I don’t know dick about computers.
@_date: 2019-07-01 01:25:46

Bad accident. I’ve been in bed for 3 years basically. Money was the last thing I was worried about.

How are you guys going to find me?
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:23:29
Forgot the password. It has a finger print reader that’s not working too. Bullshit
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:14:30
I’ll buy your mom when my computer is fixed.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:30:29
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:41:28
Yeah like a few months ago when someone said they were worth 4200 a coin. I thought about it every once in awhile but my life has been really eventfully sad since then. I had other things I was thinking about, like my health and my family. I also figured they would just keep getting more valuable.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:37:58
How lol? Dude do you realize how many people bought coins and lost the info some how? If you bought stretchy shit online like Russian pharmaceuticals or steroids you bought bitcoins in 2011.
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:46:02
Lol no
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:39:54
Your reading comprehension sucks lol. Grammar isn’t your strong suit either. I had a lot going on in 2017. I was really really sick and didn’t get out of bed for 6 months basically.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:43:52
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:51:29
100 bitcoins weren’t worth shit back then dude. I didn’t know about this highest fomo ever in 2017. You assume people know everything about bitcoin. Some people haven’t even ever heard of them.
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:09:23
300/275/350....I’m not really that strong....but I’m 6’4 and have long as limbs and have a knee issue. I’m natural though...I never did gear just bought them. Realized I wasn’t ready
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:11:37
Lol dude you’re an idiot. I’ve bought hundreds of bitcoins to buy shit that wouldn’t take credit cards.
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:13:38
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:05:09
Thanks man finally a solid answer and not people saying I’m lying.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:28:51
Leaping maybe but the story isn’t BS. I bought them not knowing what tf they were. I was buying steroids online and the company said they only took bitcoin and money order. I decided to get the juicy somewhere else and left the coins on there and forgot about them. Then my dog broke the laptop by knocking it off my bed. Lot of other people out there like me dude
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:42:19
Yeah man well I was trying to buy Russian pharmaceuticals and didn’t end up getting them. Back then I think they even gave you 5 coins just for buying a couple. I don’t know much about computers because it’s not my type of thing. Doesn’t make me an idiot.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:33:31
Why in the hell would I delete my reddit? It’s not tied to anything
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:09:45
Well I wasn’t sure about the other stuff involved like getting coins back that are 8 years old. I wasn’t sufe how hard it would be to cash them in.
