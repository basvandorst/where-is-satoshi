Mining is never done.   It's necessary for transactions to occur.
The issue is what happens when processing transactions is no longer profitable.

It does harm freedom of speech when enough of the medium is controlled to make certain types of speech difficult or impossible.
You seem to be observing that it's legal for Visa, et al, to control how people exercise their right to speak and think that simply because it's legal that it's not harmful.

It's only when you wish to engage in commerce as something other than a human that the government, by virtue of permitting you to act in the market as a legal fiction, is involved.


I think we agree there. 
@_date: 2011-10-24 22:34:29
Of course.   Why bother abridging the freedom of speech when you can just create some other organization to do it for you and claim "Oh, they are prohibited from abridging the freedom of speech because they aren't the government!"

This has nothing to do with bitcoin.   Bitcoin worked fine.

TXNs reference whatever BLK the source address is in, not the latest BLK.
The latest BLK is unlikely due to the way confirmation, priority, and fees are calculated.
@_date: 2011-10-24 21:06:57
Of course not.   You may operate under the guidance and protection of property rights and personal liability.   This will naturally limit the reach and influence of your organization.
If you choose to avail yourself of the various legal options offered by the government, however, additional responsibilities come with the additional privileges of being a legal fiction.
@_date: 2011-05-26 02:21:19
It will be a problem at the first BLK reward discontinuity at 210000 blocks.   Unless the __use__ of bitcoin really takes off so nominal TXN fees make the BLK bounty insignificant, that 25BTC cut is going to make mining suddenly unprofitable for a lot of people.
Once the mining population crashes, block discovery slows to a crawl until diff can adjust down to catch up.  Which mean TXN confirmation slows to a crawl.   Which means user populations crash, too, as the currency becomes unusable.   
BLK 210000 should be along in 2012.  You have until then to fix it.

Private exchange of goods between individuals for consideration would be an option to you for financial exchange.   


Oh, indeed.   Without the State creating these large corporations, these large corporations can't do evil shit because they don't exist.
@_date: 2011-10-24 13:49:00
See?   Who needs governments to limit freedom of speech when you can use your corporations to do it?

The determination of the canonical blockchain doesn't work like that.
_Every time_ the client recieves a legit TXN it would recheck the "invalid" BLKs as that's what the TXNs reference.   Eventually the "invalid" BLKs catch up to the distorted time of the victim and become valid (though orphaned) BLKs.
Unless the computational capacity of the attacker exceeds the network eventually the legit chain grows longer than the malicious chain and the ephemeral TXNs of the malicious chain are invalidated as double-spends.
It is a _very_ limited attack.

Be interesting to set up a sidechain with tokens signed as MtGox USD, and then find way to use scripting to make paired transactions.
Then there's no need for an exchange website other than as the issuing authority for trading scrip.

Yet _another_ argument for getting the economics out of the protocol.
@_date: 2011-05-25 22:11:39
At the START of the attack, yes.   Eventually the victim's clock will catch up to the timestamps on the blocks and stop rejecting them.
Unless the attacker has more computational power than the network, eventually the legit chain grows longer than the malicious chain.

It's possible to prune empty tx from old blocks leaving nothing but the previous block hash, the nonce, and the merkle root.   According to the paper this is about 80 bytes.
It's also not necessary to download anything other than these 80b headers and the merkle branches relevant to the tx you're trying to verify.   This means you could get up and running after obtaining only a handful of MBs of data from the network.   
This is not implemented in the current client, though.
@_date: 2011-06-14 00:51:56
With a sufficiently friendly interface and the correct marketing, anyone could use a p2p cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is not that currency, but some other one using the same basic technology probably will be.
@_date: 2011-06-14 01:03:09
That's only assuming the old/empty tx are pruned from the tree.
That's not currently implemented.
@_date: 2011-05-25 23:58:44
It will check those blocks whenever it receives a TXN associated with that blocks.   Since the legit TXNs will continue to reference the legit blockchain, the blocks will be continuously referenced and rechecked.
EVENTUALLY the legit chain (even not counting the BLKs from the future) is longer than the malicious one and the attack collapses unless the attacker has more computational resources than the honest network.
@_date: 2011-06-14 01:05:34
Tx are hashed in a merkle tree... so if you can verify via the chain that an address has no coins in it and thus will never be legitimately called again, you can prune it from the block without affecting the proof-of-work.
This is not currently implemented.

I can't tell if you've had an epiphany or are still disagreeing with me.

What the hell is the OutPoint pointing out?
@_date: 2011-05-25 20:15:40
It doesn't work long term unless the attackers can keep the "future" block chain longer than the network's.
The network would continue adding orphan blocks to the legit blockchain.   Once these orphan blocks caught up with the "future" blocks the canonical chain would shift back to the legit chain.  It is not a persistent attack without the usual requirement of exceeding the computational power of the honest network.
Since you are unlikely to be able to maintain the attack for the number of confirmations required to vest bitcoins from BLK awards, you are also still limited only to the malicious double-spending of _your own_ bitcoins. 
That said the temporary attack is pretty simple and this could cause a crisis of faith in any currency based on the blockchain, and so should be patched.
