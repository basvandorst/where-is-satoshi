6 weeks? Oh the account, how rude. I now myself personally have had skin in the game since around since 2013, though not under our newly created handle for the shop. Cheers though @_date: 2018-05-27 03:37:20
We're just waiting either proper integration or a private app to use with our Platform. Was hoping it be sooner, but can't wait.

Would it be wrong if we sent them a shirt from hipptee.com that just said "suck it, with love, from r/bitcoin".

Why not support it's development while being an "early merchant adopter", really... why not be a little reckless. :)

Did not even notice, thanks dude. I use SVG's from a crypto font pack, and my guess, is, late night, and didn't notice. Though Will fix that up for sure. Cheers

I'll make sure to pass this feedback along to the Globee team.

We dont accept CC's at our shop and this is one reason. Though in past work experience in ecommerce, even with documentation I've seen just the opposite happy more often than not...though to be fair, ya never do hear good news.
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:38:34
it's fixed :)

May I ask where you are shipping too? I show no abandoned checkouts matching this amount, not saying you're not being honest. Just that most if not all regions have a much more economical shipping option than you're stating($example: $5 from North Carolina to Australia in 1-3 days. To that as well use the discount code , if you really want :) "Ride The Lightning" maybe an extra 15% will help ya out buddy.
The $50 limit imposed by Globee is also only temporary and will be moving to $100 as well.

Were a small start up shop selling crypto and semi related shirts and merch. We currently have a small selection, though growing and will be offering stickers and hats in the coming weeks. We are using coinpayments for our gateway, least until BTCPay integrates with Shopify, then hello Lightning payments, although we'll likely keep it as a payment option. We keep all our profits in crypto and are two long time hodlers, we hope you'll support our shop. Feel free to use the coupon code bcash for 10% off all sales this easter ;). Cheers!
