Both of these addresses contain 0.1mBTC sent from the same address, but no outgoing transactions. I seriously doubt somebody actually has the private keys for both of these. I know I don't have a powerful hashing machine here (MacBook Pro w/ ~500 Kkey/s), but the generation of one such address would take me around 1.2*10^32 years. Ho-lee-fuk

Same goes for an iPhone. It might require jailbreaking, but then how many android users install apps from places other than the Google (or Amazon) app store or root their phones? Jailbreaking really doesn't count as a barrier. 
And also this is no argument for being open source, which neither iOS or android really are (anymore).

Basically. If everything is working like it should your computer is getting it's share of work from the pool. You should see your hashrate displayed in your mining software as well as in your dashboard on the website.

The general idea of this is great and kudos to you for the idea and implementation. And just playing around with this feels extremely clean and nice, I definitely like it.
The critique however is valid, so thanks for accepting it and seeing possibilities of changing this. You seem like a great guy.

It does, but this is a quicker and simpler way. And people have been having issues with funds on imported paper wallets being sweeped into watch-only addresses on blockchain.info. For that reason alone I'm not putting any watch-only addresses in my blockchain wallet that I don't own.

Just to add on top of this: I've made multiple purchases on VirWox and sometimes they hold up later purchases as well. But you're still right.
For me it's not much of an issue either as they hold up the btc withdrawal, not the sll/btc purchase, so you already have the btc bought at the price you wanted.

@_date: 2013-12-10 19:04:12


Awesome stuff!


This however doesn't quite satisfy me for now. Changes like this will have to be made for pretty much ever, something smarter has to be done here to let miners adjust this themselves. And yes, I know this is vague and I don't have a clue...
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:06:35
I was also going to suggest VirWox when all else fails, I used them before being verified by the bigger exchanges and everything went smooth. Of course some money was lost due to fees (PayPal at the time and VirWox themselves), but I bought at ~200 USD, so that doesn't make a difference now. 
The only *issue* was that they took 48h for the first BTC withdrawal, but the second one was instant.
And of course it seems wrong buying Linden Dollars at first, but it was the quickest way into BTC for me. Took 5 minutes until I had the BTC credited to my account after signing up.
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:00:27


how so?
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:53:53
Actually, until the transaction is confirmed nothing much has been done by the miners (besides trying to mine the block of course), up to here it's just propagated through most of the network nodes as an unconfirmed transaction waiting to be confirmed.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:41:41
Can confirm, print out, folded it up like a letter for the creases, scanned back in, worked like a charm.

Yes, after signing up with the bot (check you get a wallet address that you can deposit funds to. Also check the redeem karma option for a little bonus from the bot you can throw around.

I can't really believe that Apple specifically banned bitcoin related stuff, the problem usually lies with some other software restrictions.

Ah ok, my mistake. Forgot about the five copies..
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:30:08
Because the new addresses are random and not generated from a seed, a new backup has to be created each time you add a new address, otherwise the new one won't be recoverable. Using a seed to create addresses always creates the same addresses, therefore you backup the seed once and you never lose the ability of regenerating the exact same keypairs.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:59:14
And although I haven't personally used it, it's supposed to be clipped in functionality and it's a web wallet. Something offline would be nicer. I'm thinking Android's Schildbach.

The problem here is that BitPay isn't something I feel great about using in Germany. They're not acting under local jurisdiction, not even European jurisdiction and we'd have to accept terms of use like

With BTC it's not like you have a huge donation button linking to PayPal anywhere. A small address at the bottom is more than fine. And with people throwing mBTC around like this, it's not a bad idea to ask those that use and (hopefully) like your service.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:03:15
same for me... that's interesting, how can that happen?
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:49:51
It takes 48 hours for the first time for pretty much everybody, it's not your Laos IP. Subsequent purchases should go through within seconds/minutes. A btc withdrawal a few weeks later for me also took 48 hours to withdraw, just as a heads up. It seems to be rather sporadic, but it works.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:14:43
I agree that it would be best to contact BitPay support about this, but you can also always use blockchain.info to see if a payment went through. They also offer a great API. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:30:16


As much as I'd love the hell out of this, I believe you can probably expect Apple to be working on their own payment system that has nothing to do with Bitcoin, but is their own thing completely setting them apart and deemed to be accepted only because of the sheer number of iOS users.

AFAIK this is dependent on the miner/transaction fee. Miners get to choose which unconfirmed transaction they pull into the next block which makes it just logical to take those that bring you the biggest profit. The amount of BTC in the transaction itself shouldn't make much of a difference I believe.

Chances are slimmer, but it's still possible. Not the person with the most hashing power mines every block, they just do so statistically.


It takes the same unpredictable amount of time to mine every block, regardless of whether you include transactions or not. And doing this removes any transaction fees as well that the miner would receive.
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:55:04
So if I tip someone, they don't care about it and it eventually falls back to me, it'll have a double transaction fee taken out of it?
Not that I have a problem with this, I'd just like to clarify.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:18:28
Mining bitcoins is no longer really worth it if you're not ready to spend a few thousand dollars investing into the necessary hardware. To get a feel for it however you might be interested into checking out litecoin mining, with a reasonably powerful PC and a decent mining pool you might actually be able to look at some profits.
