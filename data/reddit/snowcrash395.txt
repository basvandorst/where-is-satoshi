I'm elderly and opinionated, myself, but there's no excuse for the type of rudeness your grandmother displayed. She could have expressed her concerns about your investment without getting angry at you. You probably don't care whether you get one, or not, but she owes you an apology.

Thanks. Coinbase released my BTC and ETH after exactly 72 hours. I'm glad I initiated the withdrawal 4-1/2 days early or I wouldn't have gotten the BTC into my private wallet before the hard fork.

Yea, I am right. They were, after all, my transactions and the same happened to a lot of other people. Coinbase arbitrarily held the BTC and ETH withdrawals for exactly 72 hours. Good news is they released my BTC and ETH late on July 31st.

Less competition for BCC blocks would make it easier to mine than BTC and, possibly, more profitable than you think. So I wouldn't count out the idea that there could be a significant interest in mining BCC.

69 hours for me, so far. Still waiting.

I've used Coinbase to my advantage since it first opened for business. It fit the bill for some of what I wanted to do with Bitcoin. I've been mostly satisfied. Even so, Coinbase management should, by now, understand that keeping your customers in the loop with meaningful updates goes a long way toward building goodwill and trust in a company. I'll keep my account open for awhile, but I'm moving on and probably won't be doing much, if any, business with them anymore.

Not all the CONbase delays are because of traffic. They put me on an intentional 72 hour "verification" hold Thursday night. For both my BTC and ETH withdrawal requests. I've been with Coinbase since they started. I have the Google 2FA they recommended and a copy of my license is on file there. There is no way that they don't know who I am. It's only a small amount of BTC that I'm trying to withdraw. Very unethical of CONbase.

I withdrew the bulk of my BTC from Coinbase several weeks ago. Delays and outages are to be expected at Coinbase, but it wouldn't have killed them to inform their customers of the 72 delay when they knew about it. You may not respect Coinbase customers who want to move their crypto to private wallets, but Coinbase should.

I withdrew most of my Bitcoin from Coinbase a couple of months ago. I'm glad I did. They're never going to see it again. However, I left a small amount, well under 4 BTC, there until last night. When I requested the withdrawal, I got a message saying, "Withdrawal delayed for further processing. It's going to be delayed for 72 hours while we verify its authenticity. If you have any questions please visit our Support Center." I also requested to move my ETH to my paper wallet. I got the same message. They offered to accelerate the withdrawal if I'd send them a photo of my drivers license, but, for me, it's not a big deal to wait, but I can see why it could be for a lot of other people. I know Coinbase has  regulators and the IRS breathing down its neck, but it  really should keep the customers better updated.

Coinbase says if you want to access your coins on the UAHF blockchain you should withdraw your BTC from Coinbase by July 31st. What they don't tell you here is that you only have until 8pm PST tonight - July 28 - at the latest to be able to withdraw your BTC and put it in a private wallet or a BCC supporting exchange. The reason for this is that Coinbase is holding your withdrawals for 72 hours prior to releasing them to an outside wallet. I wonder why they don't tell you that in the FAQ they released yesterday. They must have known they were going to impose a delay on withdrawals, but you don't find out until you log in to the site to get your coins.

Roger Ver is a really good diplomat for Bitcoin, too. He's done a lot to promote it.

I'm not asking them to help people with the split, but Coinbase shouldn't hinder their customers who are trying to get their BTC out during the next 3-1/2 days, either. They've imposed a 72 hour delay on all coin withdrawals from Coinbase, including ETH and LTC.
