I am working at a coffee shop tonight. I decided to stop looking at BTC, kick ass on my other stuff, and just have a good time. So far, I have gotten two numbers from attractive women. It's not too late yet, and me and the one that is still here and I may still grab drink in a few hours.

Israel has a big and active coin community. I know some of them, including some very talented miners.
There are some Jordanians, and there was a bit of interest in Syria before shit went full crazy. I have contacted some people in Saudi and Qatar with serious interest, and also know/consult some developers who are programming Arabic language bitcoin stuff. 
Iran has potential. The problem is no one wants their currency. Everyone who can is trading it out for dollars, Euros, pretty much whatever they can get their hands on. Of course, one of the appeals of bitcoin is that they eventually could get cash if desired. They also have a very monitored internet. So it is a potentially good market, just be prepared to meet Persian businessmen smuggling dollars/Euros/etc into Dubai and then figure out a way to deal with that cash there.

I laughed.
Why not?
The historical/cultural Jewish interest in finance is one reason that Tel Aviv has such a hot bit coin meetup.

Hey me and you should talk! Want to get even more illegal? I'm US based, but I am working with some BTC promotion in Israel.

Pretty much you need a reasonable way for people to change it for cash in a timely fashion.
This is where expenses come in. I would love to do this in Latin America. But... I would also have to employ people to sit on piles of cash that they would trade in for coins. People sitting on piles of accessible cash in Latin America need a lot of armed guards.
Ultimately, you will need to convince merchants and/or banks. Not really a way around that.
