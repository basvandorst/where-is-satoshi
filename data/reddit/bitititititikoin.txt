Is it safer than trezor ?

I'm looking to invest in a crypto but I don't understand if bitcoin solved the scaling issue or not. Otherwise I read that ETHC was designed for scale and is already quite big. 
Very confused, I just want to buy something and keep it for 10 years.

Everytime you fail the pin you have to wait and then the time gets x2 everytime. So you can't bruce force it, it would take centuries even with the best computer in the world.
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:05:53
That's why I like tracking BTC in € still hasn't reached the 4k€ cap
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:13:19
So i don't get it, is trezor still safe? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:16:44
Oh ok thats fine then, only invest in crypto if you are ready to never see your money again.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:08:04
The problem is that in the sub we have some toxic holders that don't care about bitcoin or others they just want to get rich and since they bought bitcoins they keep telling everyone to HODL and to BUY no matter what's happening. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:58:08
That's what you don't understand, even if google doesnt get hacked your computer or your password or even the packets transmitted threw wifi or even your OS or device ecc... might get hacked one day
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:01:39
That's not very smart man... if you care a about your future invest in a couple of diversified funds with dividends and some without, then with the extra extra buy some crypto for fun if you want, thats what I did, but don't risk your money for something this volatile... but then its your money you do what you want.

Exactly if your money is in (depending on where you're from) 50% USA 20%EU 20%Asia 10%Emerging economies. And then in that you have diversified in Health,Tech,Energy,Service ecc... and buy historical companies and at the head of the fund you have some people that update the fund when nee companies become interesting with entire teams of mathematician  ecc... and also having multiple funds from multiple big financial companies and use a couple of banks (for example in my country if a bank goes under they can only repay cash maximum 100k€ to customers(not talking about investments)) So I use 3 banks just in case and big banks. Its very unlikely that you'll lose on the long run, of course nothing is ever certain, but by being smart you put the odds against you.

If you diversify in a couple of funds and in blue chip its very unlikely, and even if one goes down it doesn't affect too much. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:40:12
That would only happen if the entire USA collapsed with Europe and Cina.

On the long run you never lose in the stock market if you diversify, at least thats how its been so far in history. But comparing the stock market to bitcoin is really off... maybe if you compare one very volatile stock with bitcoin ok...
Just check the S&amp;P500 graph and see how meaningless the 2008 crash looks compared to the overall growth.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:37:47
I actually did 30% in 2years investing in several funds so im happy with that. I buy some crypto for fun with a small part of my dividends. Thats just my investing strategy at the moment, to each his own. But i sleep better at night knowing that my investments are more or less safe.

Yes but its not gonna happen. If it happens you'll lose everything too, people will sell their crypto to buy food too.

The bitcoin dinausores are having a conflict on how to solve the scaling issue, and they came up with two different ways both are hating each others on which one is better. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:43:55
Then you can transfer the bitcoins to your other wallets easily ?
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:08:12
Which exchange ?
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:16:06
If history repeats itself this looks exactly like the 2013 hyped followed by a 4 month crash until the currency reached a plateau. But since there has been a lot of new things happening in the bitcoin world it hard to predict if this one will be different.

On the site they say that validation will take 2-4 weeks due to unusual high demand and they are hiring more people too.  Its been one week for me but already tired of the waiting.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:07:19
Seems its stabilized so far... 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:55:16
In the meantime Still waiting for my account verification...
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:47:19
Could be 1$ as well, hope not.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:57:41
Yes its becoming a trolling page for those that didnt buy.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:32:01
Because you shouldn't listen to holders begging everyone to keep buying while they just watch the charts go up. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:56:31
Oh okay so I'm not gonna  buy bitcoins anytime soon either... 
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:37:25
I'm gonna be able to purchase some crypto in august at best apparently...  
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:23:12
I guess OP is a holder, if you are looking to invest for the first time I'd say buy over 6 months or wait but DO NOT buy in big quantities now.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:18:28
I didnt understand anything, I need to do something with my trezor?
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:09:37
Sell sell
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:49:20
Meanwhile you are still waiting for tier 2 on kraken to put any funds... 
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:17:18
What tier?
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:53:01
Don't worry its just 2million$
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:38:44
Well the US started with a Genocide so I wouldn't be surprised. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:09:06
I mean now its s bubble, people are buying because everyone is buying basically, we need some big bad news on bitcoin to calm the frenzy and have a more stable price, this is insane.
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:35:56
I wonder if they will accept my residency document, they ask for a document not older than 3months old but the only thing I have is a official document from the city that I got 4months ago stating that I'm resident here and it says that the document is valid 6months.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:06:23
Exactly people were buying because of the good stuff in the news so then others bought as well, now everyone is buying because everyone is buying because they are scared to get on too late, it doesn't look good to me, I wanted to invest but this is insane. Maybe I will regret not buying now. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:59:02
Same here just ordered my trezor and waiting for kraken verification and waiting for my yubikey too. Then it will take 1-5 days to receive the transfer... Hopefully it will crash back to 2k$ before I get all in place. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:11:28
Lets stay realistic haha
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:57:42
By the time the new accounts get verified...
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:43:25
Its been 10 days still waiting for tier 1... applied for 1,2,3.
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:50:07
Well yubikey is for the Exchange and once i transfer ln the wallet i use trezor. Is it weird?
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:32:47
It will go down to oblivion this time !!
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:21:19
Which crypto is very close to taking over exactly ?
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:20:17
I remember two years ago I tried to buy some bitcoins, So I looked online downloaded coinbase and tried to send funds with credit card but I couldn't because it wasn't American, then I didn't trust them enough for a bank transfer. So I looked if I could buy with PayPal somewhere and there was a way with virwox and buying 2nd life currency with paypal to then buy bitcoins with that currency, I make an account and all but then the transaction is cancelled because my paypal account wasn't verified so I looked into it and then just gave up too complicated....
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:13:47
Ok but my question was if this economic pattern is known to be linked to bubbles or other. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:58:16
So they don't want you to send them money but instead they want you to create a new wallet put the money in and then give them the wallet key?
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:03:40
Haha its been 10 days still waiting for tier 1
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:14:19
A scary bubble for recent investors. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:59:46
When do you think the fork will start to panic investors? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 09:10:07
Just got verified for tier 1

When prices go up this quickly and everyone is bragging on how much money they made, usually they end up in tears. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:40:20
The bubble is for real start selling and buy when its stable again. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:10:06
I am in EU and they took 10days for tier one, now its been almost 3weeks of waiting for tier 2, I sent 2 support tickets. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:12:40
They are rumors that people holding big chunks of bitcoins are able to manipulate the market.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:38:30
Definitely a bubble, people are going crazy right now, it could go down to 1000$ and stay there for a year who knows... or maybe will just keep going up. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:51:11
Yeah well I didnt have much money anyways so I dont feel so bad i would have bought like 2bitcoins at most
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:07:22
Yep its a bubble
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:40:11
Keep selling I say
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:19:51
And still waiting the 2-4 weeks verification from kraken... kill me now
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:10:33
So because of this its NOT a bubble you say?
