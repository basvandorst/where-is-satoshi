Have any wallets been able to implement replay protection yet?

Where do you think the value of BTC is in 10-15 years. I have a pension that kicks in 21yrs from now, but would love to retire early and live off BTC for a few years.

Came here looking for this answer. I have coin in my Trezor in the non legacy wallet (starts with 3) from well before the fork and coin that was transferred over on Tuesday. Does it matter with regard to the coins splitting? I'm long term hodl, but want to sell the b2x when the time is right. Will all my coin count toward the split?

There are quite a few books that will let you deposit and withdraw via Bitcoin. True story: that's how I got into Bitcoin as the other options involved high fees or foreign checks that take weeks to cash, not to mention numerous days to process the payout.  Now I deposit via CC and cash out via BTC (no fees and roughly 12hr processing time).  
Only problem?  I just HODL my coin and never convert it back to Fiat.

Had an ACH xfer clear on Tuesday. Transferred it to gdax and put some limit buys in at 5650, 5600, 5550, and the rest at 5500.  I'm in it for the Long haul and hodling until retirement. I turn 40 next year and planned to retire at age 55-60, maybe at age 50 if BTC allows me to.

A wallet on my Trezor starts with a 3, was generated 2-3 weeks ago.

I tried to link my checking as well and they locked me out.  If you cancel the verification for that method, you should at least get back to accessing your coin.

Thank you. I have been trying to read and absorb as much as possible. Just started buying Bitcoin and ethereum and want to protect my coin.  I will be setting up a node using 15.1 over the weekend as well to help the cause.

It's hard to say really.  5 BTC? 10?  Who knows.  It all depends what the price of Bitcoin is in 11 years. My plan between now and then is to buy on the dips and hodl like crazy while wifey and I get debt free (student loans and mortgage).   There was a post about collecting 21 BTC and becoming a 1/1,000,000-aire. Not a bad goal to have but doubt I'll get there as I won't ever sell, just buy and hodl.

New around here but just moved all my coin to a Trezor. What happens with the fork? Does it start Nov 1 or at a random date around week 1 Nov?
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:37:36
Saw the price dip today and bought a bit more!!

Not anymore.  Made enough for a down payment on a house in the early 2000's selling options on dot coms.  Got away from it.  Have made contributions to a 403b, but stopped upon learning of btc.  Trying to figure a way to get that $$ out... But not in any hurry. I have a good pension and if nothing else should be enough to retire on.

Research it. I accidentally deleted a partion on my htpc last month.. no crypto was on my drives but years of photos and docs.  I was able to boot to a usb stick and regenerate the partition.  You should be able to do the same.

Newbie here. I've finally bought some BTC and Ethereum. All my coin is off the exchange and onto my Trezor. Is there a chance at getting free 2x due to simply owning BTC?  My only interest in 2x is potential free BTC by selling/trading it to someone.  Otherwise I don't plan to buy anything else.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:42:50
Makes sense to me.  
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:36:57
I transferred a chunk of cash to Coinbase. They said it would be available in 7 days, it took 6.  The money was actually debited from my account after 2 days.  Used that money to buy more coin during the dip on Tuesday on gdax and is now safely on my Trezor hodling.

Apologies as I'm still learning.  I'm in the process of installing Linux and running full node. Will be moving to a paper wallet sooner than later. But no problem with storing coin in this wallet and the upcoming fork?
