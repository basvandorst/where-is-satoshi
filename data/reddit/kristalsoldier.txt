In the context of Nakamoto's original paper, yes BTC was (and remains) a transactional entity.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:48:25
Nice way to put it. Additionally, one could say BTC is transactional, ETH is infrastructural, and XMR is about security.

Sorry to butt in here, but I may soon turn to you for some guidance. I just ordered the Nano S from the OEM and it should be arriving shortly. I have read some horror stories of folks just "losing" their assets! A little disconcerting!!

Yes, I was just larking. But I do appreciate gestures like these which seem to be relatively common in the crypto world (not saying there aren't any bad apples, but still).

Yeah it is quite expensive to enter into bitcoins now. Though this fractional buying give you a toehold.
Edit: For example, if I owned .011457 bitcoins...I mean how would that work in, say, a year from now assuming the growth rate of the last year (2017)? Though yes, every single bit (literally and metaphorically) does matter and does count.
Edit2: From the little I have read and seen in the charts and on a couple of exchanges, leads me to believe (and I stand to be corrected) that at these levels, bitcoin's gains will be most noticeable in percentage gain terms. I mean this from the pov of a new micro investor who, perhaps, can't afford to invest more than a few thousand dollars (max).

Will do. Thanks again. Btw, do you know anything about BTCExchange? I believe they tied up with Ripple but again their site seems only partially functional. 
One other thing. I notice that Coinbase has an Indian site but aside from signing up, you can't do nothing on it.

But what exactly are the financial outfits wanting in on exactly?
In the first instance, these financial institutions are protecting the nation-state's interests and it is probably not in the interest of the state to lose control over the purse strings.
Secondly, what the financial instruments would be interested in would be the underlying tech. And, understandably so because of the in built efficiency and cost savings. So, they will be very interested in seeing how to incorporate the technology and many already are.
But that still leaves the problem of the token itself...be it BTC, XRP, LTC etc. Why should financial institutions be concerned about the token?
From the little that I have read, I am coming around to the point of view that cryptocurrencies in general are their own principle threat. They are a threat to themselves because of what they represent.
What do they represent? A neutral, efficient counter-measure to the decentralized financial network that is currently in use and which is controlled through financial instruments by the nation-state.
As I understand it (unless I am seriously misreading the background stuff that I am reading, in which case, I would be totally wrong), what is at stake is this: how do we move value from one location to another? Do we continue with the decentralized network that we currently have or do we move towards a distributed network (the latter being not only more efficient but also more egalitarian)?
This is nothing less than a direct threat to the purse strings of the nation-state, which it will never allow to happen.
Either they will regulate the heck out of it, or they will ban it.

Ok. I am very new to cryptocurrencies, thus the question:
Are there any credible accounts that I can read (or perhaps even watch) about the history of crypto currencies and of Bitcoin in particular. Yes, while I am interested in the underlying tech history and evolution, I am more interested in learning how is it that cryptos came to assume such value (I understand value here as the exchange rate pegged to Fiat currency).
Secondly, I understand that the fintech sector had many sophistication tools by which to read and analyse companies and their stock offerings. But all these tools, however speculative they may br, in their modeling, must be somehow grounded to some reality (tangible convertible into fungible reality). But can such tools be applied to cryptos? I am asking because what is the reality of cryptos? Is it only the block chain technology? Is it some application (like XRP/ ETH etc.) that improves efficiency while reducing costs? 
I would really appreciate some suggestions/ insights/ observations etc. Thanks in advance!

Hey I tried this site last night. I could sign up an account on the site but Coinsecure does not YET allow for trading/ buying bitcoins. I'll check right now and update via an edit. This is odd.

Well, yes being concerned about the summit is indeed a good call. Very likely, the powers won't make any grandstanding announcements, but on the conclusion of the summit it is possible that a rash of central regulators and banks will start issuing local directives and policies regarding cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:17:29
That's very interesting. So, if I am understanding you correctly, what you are saying is that if crypto-tech suffers or experiences a performative contradiction, then that is what will fracture the value proposition that cryptos appear to offer both in terms of profits and in terms of real world benefits.
But crypto-tech thus far seems robust so that's there. But the thing that puzzles me is one line you mentioned:


This is what I am also trying to understand. What or where does the value of a crypto reside? Is crypto a medium only which is value neutral? How come people "value" cryptos so much to "invest" in it with the hope of extracting cash/ money profits from it (which they many seem to have done already). So is this not like the tokens we get at casinos?
Sorry for these noob questions!!
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:41:55


Thanks for the write up! Wise words! I share your sentiments.
The question I had is about your pov re ETH. This is very interesting. Could you elaborate a bit on this please? Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:11:17
Yes true. But I wonder. How will you be able to encourage someone new who is enthusiastic about the core philosophy but for who the price of entry is relatively speaking high.
Sure this person may be able to invest $500. But that would be about it since, as we all agree, for "marginals" investing is only advisable if they can truly afford to lose what they invest.
So the question arises: Why is this person going to put in the fiat now to participate in this movement? If one, but only one of a number of the aims, as you have mentioned, is wealth, then for this newcomer with half a grand, wealth ain't really working out within the short to medium term. I mean does it really make sense for him to exchange is 500 bucks for bitcoin (or altcoins) rather than perhaps in a minimal interest bearing instrument that allows for a rapid realization of the exchange value of the 500 bucks? This person could, theoretically, earn 1000% on his 500 bucks, but by equal measure he could be down too.
Or, should this person consider his or her 500 bucks as a material, but token, investment to the core philosophy? And if yes, then how does this person participate and contribute to the economy that the bitcoin is expected to sustain?
And then there is the question of holding the coin itself. Is this really helping the cause? As I see it, it is raising - exponentially - the cost of entry. It's back to that cycle isn't it - A small number of folk "HODLing" huge numbers of coin, which is no different from what's happening with fiat anyways.
I really wonder sometimes. Would the really large and old-time "HODLers" - say those who hold over 5000 bitcoins and who acquired their stash before 2014 be willing to give away 10% of their holdings (bitcoins only and 1 bitcoin per person) to random folk (cannot be family or friends or colleagues) they meet in their everyday life with the strict provision that whoever received said coin in turn has to give away 10% of the coin they receive (thank God for satoshis!).
Now that would be a test!!
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:52:03
Thanks! Very interesting read.
I agree about the decentralization focus. "Power to the edge", I call it.
But, there are a few points that I think need to also be mentioned.
Firstly, the Westphalian state has three basic instruments: the juridical, the military, and the fiscal. These constitute the sinews of state power. And, the state will not give it's ability to control any one of them up.
Secondly, Bitcoin (the concept not the coin) constitutes a direct challenge to the authority of the State by attempting to make it's fiscal instrument irrelevant. How? Not by replacing fiat, but by presenting a completely different model of circulation (of value/ money). 
Thirdly, what is on offer, however, is not an ideology. Or at least the offer is not presented in ideological terms. Rather, it is presented in technological terms (the blockchain tech). This is a problem for the State. Why? Because States (generally) know how to handle subversive ideologies. But the State cannot deny or avoid tech innovation because it knows that such denials or avoidances can quickly spin out of control.
Fourthly, so the State has to make a choice. It has to (and it can't avoid it) choose what to do: Crush the innovation by brute force thereby stiffling tech innovation OR find some way to regulate it, which is the same thing as infecting a decentralized model with the virus of centralization.
In my opinion, this is where we stand today. Already we see many governments playing with the tech and not all the applications are in finance. I think the next 2 years will be critical for the Bitcoin idea.
Also, I think governments who do not have a problem with the Bitcoin concept will push to ensure that it (bitcoins) become a "store of value" than an instrument of circulation. Why? Much easier to "govern" the former than the latter.

I agree. It ain't happening. At least it ain't happening any time soon.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:02:56
Can you please explain that last bit? So, if I sell some of my bitcoins for, say, ETH (let's say to rebalance my crypto portfolio) and don't convert to fiat currency at any point before or after the exchange, how will the tax be determined?
Let's also assume that the bitcoins that I am now exchanging for ETH was bought with money on which tax has been paid. So that's all in the clear.
Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:22:49
Thanks! Yes! It's working! One thing I noticed, the BTC volume is only 66.16 as of 1152 hrs IST. Isn't that too low?
Edit: But it does seem to be a good place to buy though. Lower average costs as far as I can see.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:13:36
Yeah and that's in part because so many of us are rather ignorant of history in general, and of the history of money, in particular.

Not sure if it is a question of "permissions". Rather, I think it's just a matter of keeping each other updated. Sometimes it's a good thing to float an idea past a trusted other and get their point of view etc etc.

Well, Mr. Krugman, in brief then, cryptocurrencies solve the problem of “control”, which is an excessively unhealthy preoccupation of the State, and that of “trust”, which the State has little of. These are two major problems that “we, the governed,” face, and increasingly so within the modern form of the Surveillance State.

Yes, of course. An overwhelming number of folks know little to nothing about cryptos. Often it is even unfair to expect them to know, particularly the technology side of things. Plus, there is always the biasness in favour of "the known" and the fear of the "known unknowns" and of course the "unknown unknowns" ��

Well, one does not have to look far to understand why banks are wary of cryptos. Banks (private or public or Central) are proxies for the State. By that I mean, they are instruments thru which the State exercises it's authority and control in financial and economic matters. There are other instruments too like the military etc but that's not relevant here.
So, the basic point is since finance and economics is one of the 3 critical arms of the State (the other two being the ability to wage war and to create laws), the State will be very afraid of letting go of it's control mechanisms. Thus the negative attitude towards cryptos. In effect, the State wants to control (1) how value circulates (so, money circulation) and (2) how value is construed and conferred (thus the insistence on "Fiat").
