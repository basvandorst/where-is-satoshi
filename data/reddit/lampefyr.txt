This makes my eyes burn a little.

This makes sense. I have around 20k debt in $$.. Seems about the same amount I lost in BTC at mtgox.

Looks pretty good. Pc version? please ;-)
@_date: 2014-03-13 10:00:33
TI feel like this doesn't matter. Cause the $$ was not existing anyway.

I think your css/page might need some looking at?

It appears like this when I open it! :-) I use Windows 7 with Chrome.

I would enjoy this so much!!

Where does it actually say that it's only MtGox who is affected? The way I see it (correct me if wrong) all exchanges could potentially have the problem in question.

this would be enough reasoning for me to close all my accounts there. My money is not their business.
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:35:51
My coins didn't disappear either. I had them safely in my wallet. So ur argument is completely irrelevant.

I don't see how that's abusive at all.. I don't see why it should be banned here tbh.

This has got to be the best news i've read all day!
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:25:08
Yep! Seems solved to me! Good luck with your site!
@_date: 2014-01-05 14:59:08
You're the boss!

Too bad the danish retailer didn't do this too!
