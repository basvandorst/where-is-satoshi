Sorry about that but i am trying to reach more indians before we start the spreading phase.
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:01:14
Actually most people in India don't show interest in Bitcoin...so it will be quite hard to gather some Indians first. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:29:39
Join CryptoIndia then i need some people to work on @_date: 2015-01-15 12:22:31
My goal was to gather some indians in a whatsapp group and then open a reddit page for it. But because people asked for it we now have page and IRC channel  So the whatsapp group is just for people who want to join it.
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:32:38
You can say both.
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:16:19
I made the above statement because i already tried making a Crypto club in college but i failed. Then i tried to give free btc but no one came forward. But still i am trying.
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:46:37
Thanks for your positiveness :)
Ok so the project is meant to gather Indians and then educate them about what Crypto is and how they can use it. After we are assure that we have many Indians around we will start spreading crypto by posting crypto posters in colleges, streets, local transport vehicles .. and organizing contest in colleges in which the winner will get prize money in crypto.

- Tipping (Dogecoin) !tip &lt;tag&gt; 1 : tips 1 doge. !tip &lt;tag&gt; 1rs : tips 1 INR worth of doge. !tip &lt;tag&gt; tea : tips cost of tea in doge.
- Refill/Topup your mobile. (Tipbot dogecoin balance --&gt; Bitcoin --&gt; Bitrefill.com) [In action](
- Trade on coinsecure.in (Indian Bitcoin Exchange) (Testnet for now)
