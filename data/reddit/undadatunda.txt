i suggest  the ocean is so very very important,and obviously the fish cant defend themselves,there is pirates,underfunded governments,capitalistic corporate fisher groups,and nobody is policing except seasheppherd here is the bitcoin donation link ))

its logical to think that governments are the best hackers in the world

i think the game needs to be more interesting or players just wont stay,that game u show would be great as a proof of workability,but i cant imagine players staying very long
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:12:32
 this game would work well with lightning i think,its free open source real time strategy builder game with up to 8 players per game could work great for players to pool into matches and winner(s) take all
check it out i think its a diamond in the rough and maybe not too hard to integrate lightning,if i remember right i think it say somewhere anyone is allowed to modify the game and build on it
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:54:25
dude, check it out you can search your area for what people are selling for cryptocurrencies...its really cool...in my area there is even some car dealerships that take cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:06:59
stickied comment on how to solve stuck transaction problems...many people are facing this problem right now at this moment
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:14:12
hey,so my transaction got dropped today or last night...so it takes 2 weeks on coinomi wallet for stuck transaction to get dropped...i feel wiser now  haha ))
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:53:33
just hodl until they get this fixed
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:29:32
i didnt think they could ban a wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:35:44
i have learned that once it is sent...thats it man,you at the mercy of the system...but you are not alone an your coins are not lost just stuck
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:39:15
yes,i was thinking this too..there may be companies that bunch up businesses
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:18:06
do you coinbase users have your bitcoinGold yet?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:43
you are also holding bitcoin gold...and more coins to come will end up on your 'old' wallet ))
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:22:37
it takes 2 weeks for a transaction to get dropped if it dont get picked up,if the mem pool gets too large about 300k transactions lower fee transactions will get dropped early from what i have learned
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:15:36
maybe the price went down after it started?
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:13:06
yes check if you can...i just thought i remember i always see the lowest price at 0.06 but idk for sure
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:29:05
this is very forward thinking...glad to see a forward thinking bitcoiner give this experiment some inertia..obviously there gonna be alot of people without good paying jobs very soon
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:21:36
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:42:45
many forks to come=free money if you hold bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:28:10
likely to be split between 2 parties i would guess for the final transaction onto the bitcoin blockchain...so ya a person would be inclined to only open channels with parties they will stay with for some time i would guess
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:41:14
yes,iknow that i was doin transactions b4 all this congestion an i was paying amount to wait bout 4-8 hrs..so ya the wave hit me while i got cheap transaction out
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:57
you act like there no problem...you are out of touch

bitcoin has the power and inertia to adopt any tech the other coins show
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:06
ya...you never would have thought about it without me!!  lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:10:27
ahhh good info
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:14
bitcoin fees and stuck transactions was my guess
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:19:51
hodl=free money from future bitcoin forks...or free coins if you want to keep them
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:24:33
if/when you close the channel you get your coins back i think
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:51:40
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:01:30
its the principles of bitcoin that are the important part
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:01:53
there still gonna be ALOT of on chain transactions man...but probably all the coins will even out in what they pay to miners or stakers over time
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:53:24
hopefully the cost will go down cuz the onchain transactions will go down
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:37:19
bitcoin is the most diversified coin(9 years of bitcoins spreading around the world)...so you will have to hold bitcoin if you want any of the future forks
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:56:19
we understand ))
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:22:17
ok thanks,ya im trying to find some story of anyone having used some paid exccelerator with success
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:40:31
ahh ok so its unlikely he ever had anything to do with the start price if what you sayin is right by the times ..haha was interesting thought for few mins there ))
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:13:07
  ---they accept bitcoin for long time as donations it proves they on our side and they show video proof of their actions to protect the ocean...these guys have NO FEAR ...and thanks OP for being so generous with all these donations you doing ))

it says satoshis coins on the new chain will be disributed evenly among all bitcoin holders...BUT it also say the supply will be 21 mil coins..but in wording it almost sounds like they gonnabe pre-mined up to 21 mil ..gah  idk  haha
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:58:03
litecoin is not as diversified or de-central as bitcoin...i would guess some giant whales hold most of litecoin unfortunatly
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:37:23
this is going to be a hot topic here real soon...many are in the same boat as you man
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:08:30
2 weeks for a transaction to get dropped if it doesnt get picked up
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:24:33
from what i been figuring out is it not gonna work unless we can get bitmain or some other giant to include the transaction
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:35:00
good question
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:08:57
dont spend it,or you will have nothing left after paying the fees for any transfer
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:32:13
im trying to get over the stuck transaction learning curve and what to do about it,i been waiting 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:01:23
it will be where your bitcoin was just before aug1st
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:47:18
the first few through the hole get shot
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:06:05
after 2 weeks the transactions get dropped or if the mem pool fill to about over 300k back log low fees transactions get dropped early
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:02:30
im not sure the transaction EVER gets dropped...i been looking for evidence of when they get dropped and have found nothing
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:23:35
bitcoin gives away free coins of any who try to ursurp it...its still strong
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:33:35
people want to play the game an try to make money...the altcoins will be here forever or long time i guess just for that fact
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:04:21
there is an army growing of stuck transactions...and no one has a solution for the mass amounts of stuck transactions
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:33:19

@_date: 2017-12-20 05:06:02
yes i have tried that by doing another transaction with my wallet i paid a high fee and that went through...but my other is still stuck
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:11:09
and if you make a mistake in your transaction cost,you could be stuck for up to or beyond 2 weeks...is what im finding out (

pioneers lost in the beautiful forest
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:59

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:11:16
go independant,the miners are moving around so much right now...you might get super lucky...also i can imagine a good business opportunity right now mining stuck transactions...ya man do that!
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:41:09
the oceans are dying,being wiped out by mankind....name some other organization thats 'actually' doing something? i watched all the seashepherd videos and they are awesome!...it takes an incredible human beings to go up and stand against the world or countries
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:56:33
sell the forked coins...all the while more people in the world want to get in on the action...maybe the best forked coins will be used for some thoings so they will always try to have some va;lue
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:43:26
hmmm 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:21:44
this is very nice that some person would do this amazing giving )) i wish him/her a merry future ))
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:45:15
14 days it should drop
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:30:48
interesting,i wonder why they would decided on 0.07? do you know if satoshi was active at the time bitcoin first went onto a exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:49:15
bitcoin network is super slow right now...but atm usually have a phone# on them and you got a receipt of your purchase
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:00
if you figure it out let me know...i been waiting 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:52:10
bitcoin is like the template an more importantly is widely distributed ,because nowdays some new coin can come on the market...but it likely to not be distributed very well...some multi-millionaire could buy half the coins under 1000 address...then game on for them ...ugg
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:56:36
ya it feels kinda weird with out any news from the devs lately
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:11:59
no, i didnt do anything like that...im going to look into it tomor though...thanks for the suggestion ))
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:08:42
there dont seem to be any accelerator service,that means he is either left to beg or wait or wait
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:56:57
1 world 1 currency 1 people...thats what i like about it...but it not perfect yet...but its a strong seed i think it will grow
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:16
if you cant figure out the math,about $20 should make it work
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:01:01
i been waiting 2 weeks for a stuck transaction i didnt pay enough for (
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:23:37
wallets b4 aug 1st
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:31:49
yes,good point,it should depend on the nodes i guess more so than the wallet..interesting
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:43:41
NOBODY knows how long stuck transactions stay stuck....i been waiting 2 weeks on a stuck transaction now
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:02:06
they have a different address so it shouldnt effect anything..adding value to the ecosystem,forcing perfection
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:38
if someone has been waiting 2 weeks for a transaction to get 1 confirmation...maybe just maybe some miner is taking pity and realize stuck transactions make bad rep for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:09:28
in the not too distant future you will be able to open a channel with your favorite coffee place,buy when ever you want instantly and settle on the blockchain whenever you want...so ya maybe you will settle on the blockchain once a month or year 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:58
bitcoin gold
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:26:42
yep,demand has outpaced bitcoins democratic choice to go the lightning route for scaling...everyone waiting on lightning now
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:13:30
you need 1000 dash to control a node,thats not very decentralized an fair
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:13:53
yes,this ones a bit of a .lottery,i thought maybe you know of some paid service that guarranteed to work
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:06
yes,you can sweep your bcash paper wallet with coinomi wallet...the problem is you should move your bitcoin to a new paper wallet at the same time...an right now its super expensive to move bitcoin...p.s dont forget you will also have bitcoingold on that wallet also and it too can be swept with coinomi wallet
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:40:00
he has a show every few days on rt news 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:13:57
bitcoin forks=money and you dont have to be a trader
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:33:53
i think you would make a website where people would go and input their stuck transactions
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:32:51
takes 2 weeks to get dropped if it dont get picked up,or if the mem pool hit over 300k then i hear it will drop the low fees transactions early
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:40
yes,i just read about the timing.im focus on that for awhile...but im not sure my minimum is even enough,i guess i got to figure that out first
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:00:14
i been waiting 2 weeks an mine still stuck...an i have not learned anywhere exactly how long stuck transaction go for...unfortunatly im starting to think they dont get unstuck because its recorded on the blockchain as a pending transaction...but man there just not much info on it
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:34
later Bcash will force everyone to pay more per transaction is my guess...they will have all the miner power to force it 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:38:47
ya,somehow there got to be money in those stuck transactions and how to smoothly get them dealt with...its lookin like there gonna be stuck transaction from now till the end of time  haha
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:18:47
are you saying i have to convince bitmain in china to look after the poor lol..actually what im noticing is there needs to be a service to fix stuck transaction...eventually everyones gonna get one
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:40:09
take a holiday an go to a bitcoin friendly country to buy
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:49:24
i just looked at my wallet ,it says 'status,waiting for transaction confirmation'...i been waiting 2 weeks---how long until it gets dropped?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:57:57
yes,and i would guess yes...but idk how to do it...but you doin the right thing an i hope you can educate others later ))
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:14:06
at least they will have their own unique wallet address,im happy to see
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:34
its gonna cost us all money,gonna build bad rep for bitcoin...im now seeing a problem where giant miners or pools that are the only ones that can possibly fix stuck transactions dont see the implications of bad rep from stuck transactions..its over 200k back log...the miners are feasting as expected but the army of negative press is coming...im not a programmer i cant build a website an connect up with those major miners to solve people mistakes of not paying enough
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:21:23
yes,your question just made me wonder if someone would do this,and still make profit?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:25
ya whatever there mr.helpful lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:18:21
i think it average about 7 or so transactions per second right now,but things being built to speed it all up
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:45:35
i know hey....and NONE of them know how long a stuck transaction stays stuck...but i know it stays stuck at least 2 weeks cuz thats how long i been waiting so far............
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:26:12
reddcoin is interesting
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:31:54

go to a bitcoin atm...its instant
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:03:16
man i hope they do get unstuck...can you explain the child pays for parent thing so i could try it step by step...thatd be awsome thanks
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:18:32
i wonder what it was listed at when it first went onto the first exchange
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:02:21
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:18:08
yep...i could even imagine people opening a channel with their credit card company and forcing credit cards to streamline their fees if they want to stay in business
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:09:46
paper wallet
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:17:39
it looks like an improved edition
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:56:49
probably..some sort of deleting tail of the not needed
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:12:28
ya we all learnin,good news i just read is if transactions get backlogged over 300k then the low fee ones get dropped...so maybe you get dropped earlier   idk
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:27
reddcoin is an excellant proof of stake coin...its cheap an fast an the coin is old
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:03:21
you want to hold bitcoin if you want any the future forks...there a few coming soon..an others dont say when they fork,they just do it,such as bitcoinGold did
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:57:32
obviously most countries in the world cant pay their debt...this trajectory says most likely the world is due for a currency change
@_date: 2018-08-25 19:41:04
probably reddcoin was originally created for reddit...5 yrs ago...although its not pegged to bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-04 23:26:52

and another one joins the wave
@_date: 2018-08-04 23:15:19
it always bottoms out where the hodl soldiers are
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:24:17
'everyone' can get access to shapeshift or coinswitch...it makes no sense to try to get some funding together without first making them access available to everyone...unless of course there some backroom deals going on!
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:24:35
...and then shortly after someone made this video )) 
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:40:05
this is good because banks are making it hard to cash out or into bitcoin lately...so something like this will sidestep the banks
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:53:33
and where does forbes get all its experience from about crypto to make its stories or stats? that you so willingly trust
@_date: 2018-08-04 23:11:40
that water is better because it has the bitcoin symbol on it
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:30:50
t.v wow! thats so old style...lol  one way street
@_date: 2018-05-15 00:18:15
the future generations have to pay this back...very unethical to indebt future generations
does it look to anyone like they built public free to use hospitals with that missing trillions?
@_date: 2018-05-26 04:04:29
good thing you not a judge then...because it seems you missed the message 
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:59:04
actually i think gamers will be earning bitcoin 'ingame' and having a great time at the same time ))
remember the old WoW days? bitcoin was very useful as a medium of exchange for items ingame
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:09:55
bitcoin changes economics by allowing everyone to be a part of it and borderless...so ya old brains dont adjust to this too easily,and especially if they already very well off from the old limiting system that they know very well
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:41:35
your prediction has a very good chance to be right
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:24:30
yes,well said! i thought i was alone in this style of thinking that govs can print as much fiat as they want in the false name of national security to try to get as much bitcoin as they can for future manipulation...the people will never know of this endeavor it will just go into the 'missing' money category (unless of course maybe some good soul will leak this highly likely truth to the public) ....and then humanity can proceed onwards...with frictionless money we can build the worlds societies very fast!
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:03:03
what bugs me is someone cant say anything in this sub without referencing some link for backup...just look at this sub its all just links to multitudes of places...like a great big echo chamber...everyone walks in with their link..."hey look at how great my link is" lol
but anyways just creating a bit of awareness of how i see some things round here
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:53:57
imagine if every time someone says something they have to back it up with some link...and what about the link?,who has the links to backup that link...and so on...and so on...
this jus leads to great manipulation of the cows...everytime you seperate farther from the intent of the message then there less and less that will dig for the truth...for example say the OP did post links...how many do you think will dig right down for the bottom truth? and i mean go from 1 link...then need to see the link to backup that  link and so on until they actually see the original maker of the stat...and then of course,how do you trust the maker of the stat
i prefer it if someone just talks logical common sense with no links
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:13:57
i get averages an trajectories by skim reading news and stats...i dont rely on just 1 news story or 1 set of stats,because they all tend to be a bit different...i rarely click on links in articles i prefer to judge the OP by their common sense talk,and all i do is add it into my averages...i never take anything as definate...but i can imagine there probably are people that are suckers for links and believe they are true...simply because they made by some official looking .com etc site
but anyways there is more an more coming into crypto as the OP message was meant to relay...but he got down voted harshly for not providing links
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:08:55
probably alot of company reps whispering in each others ears lol...certainly many potential business deals of possibilities
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:43:20
bitcoin will adjust and make the necessary changes...it always has in the past and i expect will continue to do so...forever.
your coins are safe unless you somehow connect with the attacker in a big way...its the 'centralized' exchanges that are most vulnerable

i think they are in already...probably the reason for the spike in dec....now they own enough coins to manipulate,hence why buffet said last yr "we will tame bitcoin" not long b4 the spike
solution: announce a hardfork that says all wallets connected to exchanges within timeframe of say 3 months will be spread evenly among coins not connected to exchanges...this will create a giant hodl and also force usage outside of exchanges if so inclined ...any joe could make this hardfork
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:19:39
we can only get averages or trajectories on stories or stats unless we do the research ourselves then make our own concluding presumptions
but this is mob mentality that the OP got down voted so much for not providing links...almost like drug addicts that didnt get their link...as if a link somehow makes it true

utube videos of andreas antonopolous he explains everything very well

people really should be going to more bitcoin meetups...great place to learn firsthand and make friends
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:10:08
lol they downvote you for not providing a slew of links...i guess without links the cows aint happy...imagine if your stats are off by a bit...omg you must be evil and trying to make bitcoin adoption look good!
meanwhile all these drooling traders here are are down voting good things or not participating in building bitcoin...dreaming about buying back at rock bottom...but i guess they training themselves up to be gamblers not builders
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:44:57

basically your saying 'NO' exchanges are allowed to say they dont agree with a coin and wont support it and post that on reddit
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:44:07
it says in the article: "ethereum-style smart contracts"
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:39:18
from what i remember him saying somewhere is he uses bitcoin whenever he can..so hes a step beyond hodler,hes a true user
i highly doubt he sold it for fiat lol,maybe little bits when he not no other choice

thank you )) you show great teamwork of what humans can do to help 'everything'
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:55:46
have you ever heard of "from the ground up"? it means someone started with almost nothing and built something
we need as many exchanges as we can get...so why kick on the little guy for standing up for what they believe in ...do you really think bcash being in bed with a giant miner company is the way for crypto to go?
@_date: 2018-05-26 04:25:59
right i see now what u seein an made your judgement call on...u think the good guys have never thought about making a coin or knowing the process
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:31:38
what if the price was driven up by the same people that knew futures were going to come into play?
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:57:29
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:07:12
it would be helpful if people made more how-to videos...then post them here in this subreddit for awareness
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:25:28
if there is big trader groups that work together and have lots of cash and bitcoins...all they got to do is bet it will go down,then sell back and forth to each other driving the price down...then collect from the bet,buy more bitcoins(at cheaper price)...then repeat months later,and as they accumulate more coins and cash its gets easier and easier for them
very few seem to understand how these futures actually work? WHY they are even part of the ecosystem? and is it possible for larger holders to manipulate prices in any market?
....maybe someone can educate us all

i read conbase trading volumes are estimated down 50% from last yr..i also read conbase is raising trading fees to make up for it by charging the poor more(33% more!) and the rich less
maybe people dont want to be tracked by conbase for everything they do with their crypto...not to mention all the other tricks they have played  seems they not got the true bitcoiner blood

toilet paper is one of the sanctioned items US dont want the Venz to have lol its hard to believe

i like this idea..im curious could this token be tweaked so that other projects could use it,for example some other project that wants decentralized governance?
if there was many projects using this token maybe it could be even better for bisq and the whole ecosystem

@_date: 2019-03-12 10:12:10
the world has known venz has the most oil for loong time...go back farther in history an you will see there been many attempts by US to install a puppet their and steal the oil

i think the longer you have an account the more you can trade

i doubt there any safe place on earth for the rich to hide from the masses...the history books will always show who made the problems
@_date: 2019-03-16 10:32:53
well i would guess that most that left will come back after the dust settles and remember that bitcoin had value in times of crisis
i think they estimate about 2 mil have left out of pop of 32 mil...but if visa and master shut them out...surely more will leave...but also would think it would spur bitcoin holders that stay to source their own electricity and net connections etc...which is good it just make bitcoin eco system more stronger and could be demo for many more around the world
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:10:14
actually i think the future will be a bit of everything...so when people use words like 'communism' to imply in a broad stroke to me it say they are brainwashed to use that word as scare tactic as you did because you provided nothing but that 1 scary word
but as you can see from that link i provided communism is embedded right into capitalistic corporations...but maybe worse because it an entity with no heart,soul,arms,legs or feelings with more rights an much harder to stop than a human
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:35:29
you have a better idea? im curious to hear it as population grows and jobs disappear 
here my idea we make a bitcoin sidechain with 'timed' money only good for say 3 months and can only be spent on certain things such as essential payments,food,healthcare etc ...this could keep the economy rolling and the poor still have income to survive...but it just a wild idea would need lots more thought
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:25:51
i doubt everyone is minimum wage
@_date: 2019-03-09 07:18:29
the world would be boring if we did everything just for ourselves...so it more likely they are doing it for everyone..and bitcoin got natural incentive so it means anyone can join the team and reap the rewards of doing something good,compared to some few that do bad generally just for themselves
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:18:02
since when has a society ever stayed 'static'  we are always evolving 
if you have a dishwasher in your house...it means you have less work to do
if you have a robot in your ware house it means you dont need to hire humans
on and on...

well my far prediction is we will all be playing really awesome computer games to simulate a fun economy in any type fantasy rtealm can imagine and there be potential to get rich
the reason for this is it hard to imagine something that can replace manual labour of any kind...we cant all be business owners or artists...but far prediction...

hey im curious,do you think the recent blackouts will spur more Venz to become energy,internet independent? such as with setting up solar setups and satellite internet?

did you watch this one? 
according to what you saying the system works perfect lol
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:23:34
the people there will be thinking to build these type of things for sure now
satellite internet is easy to set up,and same with solar systems...also there is cheap relay dishes that can shoot internet for many kms line of sight
@_date: 2019-03-18 23:31:33
maybe not be good plan to become reliant on oil...that could get shut down in any country
even if the batteries are crap or undersized you can still have power during the day with solar )) 
sat internet can be a bit pricey to setup and dont allow much bandwidth...but if you team up with some friends and just use it for low bandwidth stuff such as bitcoin or text/email type stuff...it too could be really cheap...mostly it the video that eats up the monthly gigs
also you can shoot the internet line of sight away from the main receiving dish to other houses with a simple 2 way mini dish setup
@_date: 2019-03-15 00:18:31
i would never invest in something i dont understand...so in short that means 'time' to learn about every stock out there may want to invest in or pay someone else to invest for me(trust) which in turn decreases any 'potential' profit because of fees lol
bitcoin much,much easier...and a nice sunny unpolluted piece of land ))
@_date: 2019-03-21 06:19:12
1 the venz currency is run through exchanges to pay the worldly bills
2 there is sanctions on everything in case you not notice
3 i agree they should not rely on oil...but a country is a big ship to steer it takes time...even in canada here if u read the above link the forests will be wiped out by the time society will stop using it for toilet paper
also you say venz gov stole the money...so where is it now...who has it?
i dont think you understand big economic powerhouses in the world and how they can plan to dismantle another country through 'time'...in this case they indebted venz,then opec dropped world oil so venz cant pay their debts...why else would soudi pump so much oil and world price go way down....it cuz it was planned to get control of the worlds biggest supply of oil for themaselves,basically steal it through many chess moves from the people of venz
dont think this is too complicated to do....they were doing even much more complicated stuff 70 yrs ago...so think of all the tricks that can be played today
tell me MR.venz dude on reddit...where did guido go to school and what did he study? an im not talkin elementary...im talkin what was he trained for? do you know?
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:13:56
ubi would not be a topic cept for the fact its tech removing humans from the equation and making business/corp owners more profitable 
look at amazon that leader is most richest in world now...and how many human jobs were removed?
so going with your 1 business on earth formula imagine if amazon was 'only' business in the world and it 'all' run by robots etc...how would the people have any money to buy anything?

@_date: 2019-03-14 20:25:43
well if govs start using bitcoin at some time in the future then how we going to keep them accountable? or for that matter how will it be possible to keep any public power or large corp etc accountable...or as you say in the title how would it be possible to know current supply of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-09 07:24:11
are they open on sat or sun...or past 5 pm?
@_date: 2019-03-11 05:54:30
not cool to open links like that if you have no idea where they go

i think i read its mostly restored now
@_date: 2019-03-09 07:38:04
it shouldnt be that hard,have the lawyers or notary be the holder of the bitcoin until the papers are signed and bitcoin confirmed..i would guess all could be done in lawyers office in an hour or 2
you may want to use a lawyer or notary that knows how to properly handle bitcoin and both parties agree on him/her
@_date: 2019-03-19 01:07:28
there probably thousands of generators there...and ven has the largest supply of oil in the world
@_date: 2019-03-17 08:19:44
lol sounds like you want jeff bezos to own the world
did i not already explain to you communism is embedded right into capitalistic corporations
here let me copy/paste the words in that link for you as it seems you didnt read it
"Welcome to Capitalistic Corporate Communism
We are now in control of your life, the water you drink, the food you eat, the air you breathe, your health, your wealth, your job, you no longer control your life.  We do! The Corporations.  We own you and your family.  We own the Senate, the Congress the Supreme Court.  America is no longer the country of government by the people, for the people.  You serve the Corporation.  We, at our will, can and do send your daughters and sons to fight wars and die for us.  You will conform to our rules and our regulations subject to change at our will.  So get use to it."
cant you see you been tricked...so why not slap a tax on them and give back to the people...or would you rather wait for chaos?
it the communist corps that are your enemies not me
@_date: 2019-03-16 22:27:57
business wants people to 'have' money because then they spend...if the people have no money to spend the system falls apart no matter what country
the idea for ubi is for the money to be circular and sweep the poor back into the economy from how i understand it...watch that joe rogan vid,they explain it well in detail
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:24:44
i think you mean only the nato countries cant trade with venz?

ya good point it take lots water and 'chems' to make tp,also tp uses up lots of trees 
@_date: 2019-03-09 08:09:57
ya if there 2 parties each with their own lawyers then a multisig wallet could be used by the lawyers to hold the bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-21 01:42:10
you should read into the situation some more layers than your current msm outlook
its true venz was relying on oil to much to support the country,so when oil crashed from soudis pumping to max and force the world price(oil cartel biz) down it hit venz the hardest and that in turn made it so venz cant pay their world bills so they print to pay the bills and that is what cuased the inflation...then US slapps sanctions on them including toilet paper or 'anything' from nato countries 'accept' some american 'oil' business can still do biz their it seems(WOW) google it man...dont just listen to msm like a zombie
@_date: 2019-03-17 03:12:13
how about the green parties of the world?...bitcoin is worldly and so are the greens

he the one that built the exchange then sold it indebted of 80k bitcoins...then that exchange get hacked many times...then he builds ripple/xrp next...poof! free coins for the maker...then he goes and builds stellar next,more poof! and free coins for the maker lol
@_date: 2019-03-11 05:47:11
an interesting stat is 70-80% of bitcoin were already in the ecosystem before that last spike so i think your comment only applies to people that bought at the peak
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:11:32
obviously you the one who not informed or even read the comments here to learn how this guy proposes the UBI system to work...watch the joe rogan vid with him in...then come back and say something educational on why you think it wont work
your words mean nothing

@_date: 2017-08-11 22:54:58
egypt is not part of nato,so it cant be shut down by usa,also low verification requirements,so exchanges like this will likely be where the poor people can trade bitcoin and have a chance in this new crypto world

price being held down is good for adoption as more can get in while price down...its the amateur traders that are most likely to lose out if the worlds best traders are indeed suppressing price in order to accumulate more and more
im guessing at some point they will jack the price to shake weak hands at say 20k or something and again accumulate more and more
if some powerhouse trader group can manipulate prices because they hold very large amount of bitcoins...they can forever up and down the price to shake weak hands...they can do this with any coin...but eventually they will be discovered of who they are and those coins they hold confiscated or frozen for price manipulation and off to jail...'if' this is happening all the evidence is there today,just no one can figure it out......yet.

after you have some bitcoin,you can use shapeshift to trade to other coins...no sign up or anything needed...and yes it possible to do all your trading with just a 'hot' wallet and paper wallets...thats what feels safe to me...its a little slower but get to learn the proper paths i think

bitcoin is not safe if it continue go this direction of ending up inside just a few big buildings scattered around the world...any organized power could 'black opt' to those place an shut it all down...and this is the direction big blocks will take us if it happens too quick...bitcoin mining needs to be as accessible to the masses as possible...at all times, in order to spread to as many places as possible around the world...thats safety!

ok how about: if the purpose of a water dam is to generate electricity to the grid limited by 'x', then the purpose of ever expanding solar panels 'added' to the grid would be the (lightning network) and the dam being the (bitcoin block) ----hehe maybe these words could be simplified or changed to better achieve the same result for the reader to understand

who would stay on a sinking ship? i would work for bitcoin over fiat because its value is increasing,i would prefer to save bitcoin for retirement over fiat because the fiat system is broken and cannot guarantee a safe retirement.....also in 'theory' the entire world could function on 1 bitcoin..or 21 million bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:57:56
there gonna be 10s of thousands or millions of these sidechannels(think businesses/stores/employment) all competing to get on bitcoin blockchain...and yes it would probably circulate among the population how often each lightning channel verifies with the bitcoin blockchain..leading to a new style of reputation possibly along with online up to the minute proof to keep customers happy

@_date: 2017-08-02 07:13:34
yep that describes the block well ))  ...need some way to describe the potentially millions of sidechannels(lightning network) that will add to the ability of the dam as more water starts to flow through,and at the same time not change the dam itself as it is today

do you want some central authority to restrict bitcoin use to an age limit?bitcoin is about you being responsible for 'your own' bitcoins,or do you always want to have some entity hold your hand?...there was some post here not long ago about some family paying their kids allowance in bitcoin,to me that seems like a good way to intro the young into the crypto world...but ya you will soon discover 'age' wont restrict you...that is if you decide to be independant 'and' responsible
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:47:42
i think the solar panels can still be used in this analogy,because basically its impossible for water to run over this dam,the water supply and dam size are written in stone---the grid will be the transactions/electricity/customers...the solar panels 'are' separate,but will contribute to the transactions/electricity/customers 'ability' of the dam  ---- i think if we used the water flow..then we would have to include rain as customers/transaction or something like that,and exclude the electrical part,but then we would have to use bigger turbines or something for the lightning terminology part,but i think the solar panels describe many small or large sidechannels/businesses better ...but i suppose it could be written with rain and turbines style too

one point i see you guys miss in this discussion is that everytime the block size increases it means less people can help secure the bitcoin network and that means less decentralization which brings bitcoin closer to being controlled by the unconscionable corporations....and if that ever happens bitcoin(the peoples coin) will die...i certainly wouldnt support a corporate controlled coin...i think vast majority of people would move to some other 'free' coin

we will have choice,and there will be competition among the side channels...i can imagine paying for groceries on a side channel because it will be fast...all in all it i think will make it hard for miners to over charge in fees...yet at same time lightning allows more transactions to happen in bitcoin world so that should keep the miners happy and in line...although micro payments of say 10 cents may not be efficient for the consumer,so for that instance we can atomic swap to a coin that works for micro transactions...thats how i see it anyways ))

dude,supporting giant exchanges is a centralized idea and makes bitcoin weaker...supporting btm's,local bitcoins or de-centralized exchanges...that is how to make bitcoin stronger...you should know that...so what if the price a bit higher,thats how we grow the economy
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:30:07
well,when you realize countries are equipped for cyber warfare and its governments that make the best hacker tools...if your id is connected to your coins 'theoretically' once that centralized link is broken(hack coinbase or your wallet maker for example),whoever breaks it can see everything you do and have done with your coins...and likely if it got broken that info would spread throughout the world available to anyone
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:46:18
maybe in theory the side channels could become decentralized too...but idk for sure
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:09:38
are all those addresses 'under' a single address?---  ---also is it 'impossible' no virus will 'ever' be able to encrypt your wallet hence locking you out of 'all' your funds? seeings how everytime you connect it to the internet it puts 'eveything' at a 'potential' risk

you have to have almost 200k(1000 dash) to run a dash node and have any say in its governance...with the bitcoin lightning network all they are is offchain settlement layers(basically gathering say 1k or 1 million transactions bundling them up into 1 transaction and putting them back onto the bitcoin network for a small fee...from how i imagine it working
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:53:52
in a 'governance of volunteers' anybody can be removed,or allowed in,dependant on what the many eyes of society deems appropriate...the voluntary leaders we have today have been approved by the vast majority of people...i think bitcoin is showing us the benefits of voluntary government...its a great demonstration,and learning experience for todays people

@_date: 2018-06-06 18:04:22
buddy,dont keep the extra bitcoin...it will just create a blowback that will be passed onto other customers or add weight towards companies not using bitcoin
maybe what you should do is explain to them what happened...but drag them through the mud just like they did to you when they sent your bitcoin to coinbase(wrong way to do business!)
so take that bitcoin and store it on a seperate wallet...then demand they send you their KYC/AML proof before you release it back to them
you can help the system by demonstrating where the problems are...done right maybe this could work out good for everyone,just stick to logic and common sense
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:33:10

i dont see any incentive for them to break computer random programs for gambling industry or even most things can think of these programs normally used for
but bitcoin,maybe they will have some incentive to try break for that...right now they all cushy with their free unlimited fiat...seems history say they always take action on threats or challenges

i think the second layer stuff is exciting and interesting,so much can be imagined and that means soo much room for everyone and their ideas without putting everyone at risk compared to the other chains that do too much on their main chain and potentially put everyone at risk
@_date: 2019-08-27 02:43:24
it scares me that soo many are piling into the same few ships that become honeypot targets
i also read computers cant do true random,its a program
i dont mean to scare people but i think it very important we keep everything about bitcoin decentralized as much as possible 
the top comment says how do you send from a paper wallet? so ya thats an issue needs to be solved is how to do that total safe
rolling dice any joe can do that to make a paper wallet and its free...but yet theres no tutorials
i think we need to keep both going hardware and paper
$80 for a hardware wallet is a rippoff and then you got to keep updating it...and then it gets outdated and you need a new one...all these steps you put your coins at risk more and more over time
i notice exchange are slowly being turned into the bankers hands...thats power man,what else can they point their guns at?
a choice of 1 is not good...i dont want hardware wallets to be what broke bitcoin...so telling people to use only hardware wallets because think they dumb and better to trust a corporation over learning how to do something properly is not cool in my books
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:21:05
id also add bitcoin is the coin that is spread around the world the most so that gives it best stability....new coins are mostly owned by whales an can be sure they will jump ship at any time which could lead to price crashes

i would like for someone to add in a dice box to bitcoin core for true random...maybe this could lead to all wallets having this option and removing that weak spot of Pseudorandom 
@_date: 2019-08-31 19:37:28
there is a reason for everything,i would suggest be friendly and work with the coinomi guys to figure it out and report back to let everyone know
i never have trusted the update processes of many these things,weak spots i think,so maybe way around that is complete wipe of your phone and then re-install with updated 'new' wallet of the same service or whatever you choose
i dont think it good idea to keep a whole bunch of history on any wallet anyways...but if it connected to your ip maybe the history tags along with it idk maybe someone can tell us about that part?
@_date: 2019-08-27 03:41:25
great point left and right is soo old fashioned and most modern people now have both left and right ideas
@_date: 2019-08-30 07:10:24
normally would think many eyes are better than just a few...there is a saying that goes along with bitcoin "dont trust,verify" so how can the many eyes verify what the few eyes have built to know if its safe?
bitcoin itself is open source and thats what makes it soo tuff and able to evolve from the minds of very many,but lets hope those few minds can keep up with the evolution created and pushed along from the minds of very many

What is NYA 2X?  ----copy/paste----
A select group of corporations and miners decided to inflate the Bitcoin block size to twice the size of SegWit blocks (that is, up to almost 8 MB) 3 months after SegWit activates as an experimental change to the digital currency known as Bitcoin. Regardless of whether big blocks will centralize mining and make it expensive for users to operate nodes, the NYA parties want the decentralized Bitcoin network to follow their hard fork. This project is a version of the NYA 2X hard fork with some safety benefits.
Like the other NYA 2X projects, this one is neither affiliated with nor endorsed by the Bitcoin Core team ( that has been witing and improving the stable version of Bitcoin in use today.
For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the Bitcoin Core software, see  or read the original whitepaper.

last fall,winter the old powers bought up lots of bitcoin and other crypto...they want to rule this new tech world
today they can manipulate the prices by buying and selling back an forth to each other without losing much bitcoin if any...maybe accumulating more...but i dont think they can keep this up forever,for the simple reason how can anything be made any better than bitcoin or/and a few the other cryptos?...as long the people dont fall victim to buying into government or corporate made coins...logically i would think adoption will continue and demand for the best and freest coins will be positive
but it dont help that the mods here block a lot of free speech and ideas...i made a post yesterday about how the green parties of the world are global  just the same as bitcoin and cryptos are global and both have a lot of commonalities...but the topic was blocked and deleted...truly we need politicians on our side and the green parties of the world are also a lot of the younger folk that embrace new ideas...could be a good combination...its a political force that is just waiting on the sidelines for the people to give them power
@_date: 2019-10-03 17:45:47
bitcoin is very useful,very secure and supply becoming more and more rare...and its worldly with no head that can be chopped...its just a waiting and building game in my opinion before it becomes the dominate currency worldwide

is it good if you only have 3 political parties to choose from? is it good if everyone stores their bitcoin  on pepsi or coca-cola. no and in this case just imagine the honeypot target being set up or in the political case its basically yo-yo choice for the people
i see no incentive for bitcoin developers to make something free to cold storage bitcoin like they did in the old days before the scum of the earth arrived
id like to see someone write a tutorial on how to use dice to make paper wallets...thats decentralized and free gives access to the poor,sooo many trusting those corporations,something real bad could happen so need to prevent that from being possible
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:50:04
paper wallets are only meant to be used 'once' and for sure they need to be created with something that never ever touches the internet
cant someone figure out how to use dice to make these wallets?
trusting a cheap phone made in china dont seem like a good idea to me,unless it a small amount in there for temporary 'hot' wallet
but anyways i just commented to hopefully stimulate someone good out there to think of ideas because i dont trust corporations their entire nature is greed and it possible they could be the undoing of bitcoin i see it as a weak spot there already too many people trusting these honeypot corporations
@_date: 2019-10-02 03:38:47
did u read this,there some good points in there 
from the article---The only questions that matter:
1.what gives you the right to mint a new currency and to have disproportionate influence over its fate?
2.why are you choosing to reject all of the alternatives and proposing to replace them with your own?
3.from where do you derive your authority?
4.how are you enshrining fairness and equality of opportunity in the distribution of this new money?
5.how will you ensure that the system is free from corruption when even the U.S. Federal Reserve is vulnerable to political capture?
bitcoin can answer these questions,now take your fav  altcoin or anything created in the future and see if they can answer these questions
---theres many reasons most people in the world are working on bitcoin and they have to do with morality and there no head that can be chopped,unlike the altcoins

i think they are just trying to protect themselves from the american legal system...we may see more of this type of wording implemented across all exchanges soon
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:17:52
what about all the poor people in the world,they cant pay those greedy prices from the unconscionable corporations for a hardware wallet
those hardware wallets are stressful tools,and then you got to keep updating them,more stress more risk
hopefully someone can figure out something for the poor uneducated of the world because thats the masses hint hint is it not possible for someones to rework paper wallets and make them better? right now the opposite is happening people are getting corralled into another pepsi coca-cola type of world
bitcoin really needs to serve the poor...if not highly likely something else will pop up to serve them...it has to be free and open source
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:20:51
thank you for doing this )),i think its really important as i have read computers cant do true random 
im wondering theoretically  could all wallets have this service inbuilt so its easier? such as the big names and core wallet and even paper wallets although im imagining paper wallets would just use the dice and paper thats it?
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:38:08
you say the government is mining bitcoin? i havnt heard of any other government mining bitcoin in the whole world
thats good news man,i think most bitcoiners wish their own government would also mine bitcoin...do you see what this could lead too? ))
soon venz may have the most bitcoin for a gov....and the most oil in the whole world lol

when this happens you dont sell bitcoin,you spendit on daily life stuff and also earn it from work etc
@_date: 2019-10-02 03:46:28
you forget about a limited supply and world demand for something so useful and secure
if it keeps going up like it does everyone going to want to get  some(fiat inflation goes down,limited bitcoin goes up),and that in itself makes it more and more legit,and also more and more have incentive to build things for bitcoin

@_date: 2019-02-10 00:10:29
would they not earn less money if they stayed with larger blocks? and would not lightning builders go for smaller blocks because then more people would use lightning and also what they build? all the while making bitcoin more decentralized in case some nation state decide to attack bitcoin
maybe this is what we should be thinking/preparing for is nation state powers ability to attack bitcoin covert proxy style...its not a far step from modern warfare

it sounded to me that he is involved in so many parts of bitcoin that the only thing he can see now is the ecosystem....if you ignore his tone but just hear his words i think he might be important for the merging process that is coming up next,sounds like he got an army of lawyers and much experience
i dont think its fair either that mark karples could become a billionaire if all the angles are not watched...those coins should go back to the customers(much better for the ecosystem)...but still there going to be many unclaimed coins possibly with the owners having nothing more than a account password to claim them...so likely there going to be a windfall for someone
@_date: 2019-02-08 07:16:39
i like it...i didnt think lightning will ever be the only layer on bitcoin...so that position is good and if there other layers in the future they could put their logo in same sort of spot..for example say there a layer on bitcoin meant for mars colony they could put 'M' or something in the same spot and people would use that for transacting with or on mars,but maybe that not a good example,but something like that
@_date: 2019-02-11 23:04:01
just a thought but how about some program that can spam small payments fast...so say you want to buy something for $500 all you would have to do is spam out 100 $5 dollar payments...lightning is fast right?
other thing i was thinking is maybe people could just buy lightning bitcoin directly from others and then just hold them in lightning fashion for as long as they want...all you would need is some company set up to bring large amounts at a time into lightning world and then disperse them to buyers
but just some ideas,food for thought

ya for sure...and im thinking that countries,large corps or anything that deals in huge amounts of money or savings and early bitcoin adopters ;) will be the ones that use the base layer because it will take thought,patience,planning and money to make transactions on the base layer
...another thought is i dont thinking lightning will be the only layer...maybe it be possible some country may make their own layer and do some conversion where they turn the fiat of that country into venezuela bitcoins for example...but the trick here is that the first countries to do this will be getting the best prices,because they will have to buy bitcoin first...so i guess they would have to add up the balance of all the peoples savings.find the ratio...buy as much bitcoin as they can...then disperse back to citizens at same ratio in bitcoin Venz on their own layer
lol going wild on the thoughts...but never know hey
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:28:31
why not they buy 10-20 USD of lightning bitcoin?...that be way cheaper for them and stay in lightning bitcoin forever if you poor
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:25:35
even when lightning takes off bigtime there will always be lots of on chain transactions because every company in the world that use bitcoin will still have to settle on the main chain occasionally 
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:26:17
e) it cost me money,time and energy and i dont see what i get in return
this could be a reason too because usually people need incentive of some sort...maybe someone can dream up a way to have incentive to run a full node
in the realm of 'possibility' some link with lightning where a full node runner along with lightning gives ability to do more than just either alone? or maybe even create a new layer above bitcoin that links to full nodes and has a special use case?  idk just some ideas

its easy to aim a gun at 1 target,but try aiming a gun at 1 million targets
this is what blockchain does is it turns 1 target into 1 million targets,figuratively speaking
how to cram a infinite amount of data onto a simple blockchain such as bitcoin? well that is being worked on,and it looks like its going to be possible using layers and sidechain type concepts
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:44:04
bitcoin 'itself' dont care about politics...its just math...a tool for us to use
POW pushes for clean energy...these still the early days,but one can envision all the waste heat being used and bitcoin being powered fully by renewables such as solar...and the reason for this is cheap or free energy means profit for the miners
and speaking about the mining machines themselves i guess it only a matter of time before they are reused to solve other of humanities problems...such as maybe someday finding a weird way to use those machines to crunch DNA or other extremes with numbers

so how can a person make a bitcoin mmo game with an internal currency of bitcoin token where players cant do trades out side the system and avoid rake or funnel going to devs to build the game if no tokens can ever be made on bitcoin?
if we cant make tokens from a bitcoin scan or whatever you call it like a hardfork so everyone get same amount of tokens as they have in their bitcoin balance...to me this seems like a huge loss to what bitcoin could do
i made a post about it while back but it got deleted  its just an idea i was 'trying' to get opinions about

well according to logic the only things that should inflate in price should be the finite things in the world such as real estate or precious metals etc(until we start to mine in space)
everything else 'should' be going down because of technology(but it goes up because of fiat constant creation)...for example why is bread going up in price?it should be going down because technology makes it ever cheaper to produce
the thing about bitcoin is it dont inflate in supply...so that will make it the best form of wealth storage...maybe even better than real estate(because real estate price can fluctuate depending on location and environment uncertainties) 
@_date: 2019-02-11 19:14:08
bitcoin forces miners to find or 'create' cheap energy...thats a good thing and its not limited to any particular country

both ripple and stellar got a shit ton of coins still to dump into the market($ for someone)...how are these coins created?were they dispersed fairly.no whale owned and will be for many yrs,but those whales wont 51% their own cash cow lol coins meant for coattail riders that dont care if the world goes to hell

heat is only wasteful if you cant imagine some use for it..i know the tech isnt all up there yet...but an easy one to think of is heating for northern climates...and in the summer the heat could be trapped in water for example and then released during the winter
i dont know what the maximum temperature of those miners are...but that would be the theoretical temp that could be harnessed under ideal conditions...idk but if there was demand maybe miners could be tweaked to create even more extreme heat outputs
would someone build something to charge their batteries on electric cars from waste heat of bitcoin miners...probably
i think there is certain types of gases that can boil easily to turn turbines and they need very little temp difference(all enclosed system)...for example you can generate electricity just from the temp difference of the ocean depths to heights difference
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:35:16
majority of public should be using above layers is good for bitcoin do you think? it would reduce strain on mainchain and builders would build more on layers above bitcoin thus reducing overall risk and making for more happy people in bitcoin world im curious of your opinion of that?
also on chain transaction cost would go up a bit with smaller blocksize is good for the future of bitcoin because miners are the essence of bitcoin and need to be looked after,what is your opinion on that?

could make a sidechain,pegged to bitcoin with time limited money,so for example the money is only good for 90 days or something and can only be spent on certain items such as rent,mortgage,food etc...that would stimulate the economy because everyone on the program would be forced to spend it

@_date: 2019-02-26 21:20:41
i think there is a solution,and that is to hodl and keep your bitcoin off of centralized exchanges...you can still use bitcoin in the ecosystem,but if you a trader eventually they will get your bitcoins
if vast majority of people dont use centralized exchanges...and 'big money' supresses the prices through manipulation...its actually good for the ecosystem because more and more can get in at cheap prices
but eventually because bitcoin is finite the price is likely to explode when 'big money' realizes the people are getting good deals on a finite resource...at that point they will spin it so bitcoin price is extreme,thus giving themselves again another opportunity to grab more of that finite resource because many weak hands will sell their precious bitcoin,but be stuck with inflated fiat going down as bitcoin goes sky high lol
once bitcoin goes over 100k or so...everyone in the world going to take the time to learn about it and come to the same conclusions todays bitcoiners realize
bitcoin is a steep learning curve for most people...i think that is the only hinderance,but over some time everyone will be educated

bitcoin dont care about politics thankfully ))
but for politics over there i have done research a bit about it...and now my conclusion is both leaders need to step aside and let some new government have a chance
the reason i say this is guido was trained by the americans to take over that country you can wiki him and see where he went to school and what he studied
maduro has no chance to stand up to all the united nations against him now that want venz oil and push for corporate ruled governments
so my conclusion is ven will be at conflict for looong time if either has power
i always tell people to vote green now because it the only united worldly political power
@_date: 2019-02-22 06:57:24
actually i think inflation will drive the realized fiat compared price of bitcoin to extreme heights because there only so much bitcoin,but yet the printing machine of fiat has to work harder and harder every yr to maintain order so inflation in itself will drive price higher each yr without even including demand,and we know supply of bitcoin gets cut in half every 210,000 blocks

has bitcoin felt the power of the dino system...not yet
will the dino system just lay down and hand over power to computer code and math...not likely..but maybe if enough people can learn how it can be good for the world without getting broken
bitcoin is strong...but maybe its better if its even stronger...i think this is the whole point of the discussion

percentage wise it still sounds weaker than bitcoin for the simple fact millions of brains work on bitcoin,compared to some corporate database that may only have 1-100 or so brains working on it..not to mention secretly built databases would be much more vulnerable to inside jobs/frauds/hacks etc

i dont think you know the whole story...everyone used quad up until the banks froze their money....but then the courts ordered the money back to them...but then the banks all in unity in canada wouldnt cash the checks the courts ordered payed to quad
people didnt realize this bank thing was going on only that quad had won the court case so they had coins in there waiting for some cash outs...but then the ceo died in india with all control went with him and they shut the exchange down without any warning...so even people that had coin sitting in their account no one knows whats happening now as all the legal people working on it say not much but they pushing for bankruptcy after only few months of looking for the lost coins which some may be on other exchanges it rumored
now its the old financial elite that are running exchanges in canada proxy style i suspect in some cases...so i cant help but get this feeling the idea of a community run exchange has scared them to speed up the process of bankruptcy to quash the idea....along with all the troll work being done on r/quadrigacx right now

its not good for the eco system as many of these 115,000 will lose faith in the tech
for example they are reading your words right now...and you saying eff them they dumb

heat is actually a battery...we just dont have the tech yet to use it in most cases...but highly likely bitcoin will force this tech to evolve faster

@_date: 2019-04-11 09:09:09
sure ok
something else to think bout too isi guess in the future there will be many that can make free electricity...so after the machines are paid off,then really there no point to ever turn them off
even today there people out there that make their own electricity,such as micro hydro,some gas companies are starting to use flared gas which is normally 100% waste but now they turn that into bitcoin...also if people get grid connect solar and say they make double in the day what they use for miners during 24hrs then it balances out and basically you mine fro free...i think this style of mining will grow lots and there is lots time to evolve into it
but just some thoughts

i dont think your understanding the bigger picture of what this could lead too...this could be a thin edge of a wedge to make great exchanges because when you have thousands involved with incentive to build the best and incorporate the latest tech and new ideas

well this is what experience is all about so an exchange run by users that have already gained experience is much better than those that have not would you not think
i guess you did not even read the proposal because if you did you would see that this would be a completely new exchange avoiding all the problems from before as best can be done from knowledge of today...but then because you have all these owners they for sure will want to adopt all the best tech
exchanges are not going to go away so i think it would be good to have a democratically run one with many eyes and ideas

i think the mob part would just be shareholders but professionals would run the exchange..but being that its shareholders that own the company i would guess there would be  some democratic decision making for the important bigger things

nobody can just 'print' bitcoin so that means to gather capital for war would be much harder and that capital would run out much quicker...and especially if most people on earth are 'good' and dont like wars

well a ceo dying is unexpected,besides this is a first so i think its hard to blame the users

small blocks keep everyones bitcoin safe,small blocks create incentive to build things like lightning,small blocks are more efficient and allow more people to run nodes which keep bitcoin decentralized and allow democracy to work 
ive come to understand its a simple mainchain that guards everything the best as it has the lowest possible attack surfaces all the complicated stuff should be done on above layers as then it dont put 'everyones' bitcoins at risk
but im no expert i just say dont rush it,people are coming up with ideas to make bitcoin more efficient all the time but because bitcoin is the most secure and decentralized coin out there it takes time for them to implement new ideas cuz there so much $ at stake rushing into things would be foolish
hey man someone may even invent something such as a new code or something where blocks can even be reduced in size and that be even better for bitcoin democracy

 and  and vancouver island is green party 
bitcoin is worldly and so is global greens ))
i see a potential here for a worldly political party to adopt bitcoin
i guess not so much a question but just letting you guys know of this potential which could be huge so maybe an idea would be to spend some time to educate and inform those green leaders in victoria,i think they are open minded people as greens are more scientists rather than politicians

bitcoin has natural incentive built into it...governments are just 'reactionary' forces so if the people have an incentive to find cheap energy thats a good thing
for example its possible to link up all the worlds energy grids and make it so that 'everyone' can have 24/7 solar power...now could you imagine solar rooftops and bitcoin baseboard miners heating the houses and storing the heat for later use
also as the article says bitcoin encourages people to buy 'quality' rather than 'cheap' because bitcoin so rare and valuable people will first 'think' before they spend so its a good thing and that is where the real 'green' part of bitcoin comes in i think
bitcoin can also be mined in space wow hey and thats super efficient up there
everything is planning man...even if you walk to the fridge its a plan ;)

utube is a good example of how people can make an income,with bitcoin people dont need to go through middlemen to donate to their favorite tube...same could be said with music and others things...in the computer world bitcoin is the goto for bounties for improving things also building a reputation is a good way to land a good job in the computer world...but without bitcoin as the inspiration to create and improve,much of this would not happen...yes its a dance right now with the old dino system and the new way....hey you want to talk about how the governments of today are borrowing money today from their/our unborn grandchildren? ;)

you must be missing something...but anyways because you sent in bitcoin to that machine and if it took it there will be record of it you can use as proof because it came from your wallet and went to their machine

theres no money or incentive in christmas lights,thats why it took decades to make christmas lights more efficient...bitcoin and its mining rigs meanwhile are moving at maybe 1000x times the speed of christmas lights because there is incentive to improve and become super efficient

@_date: 2018-03-29 13:28:20
ok i got an idea...but its gonna take some imagination...the blockchain is a open book right? ok so all we have to do is define who all those futures cartel type people are and then peg their wallets to be removed on a upcoming hardfork...and those bitcoins in those wallet will be distributed evenly among all wallets that have no connection to bitcoin futures or cartel suspects...this would be so awesome...we could get our money back,plus some extras i would guess cuz these cartels are for sure printing fake money to do their nasty deeds...and guess what this would also leave an everlasting impression that the futures trick aint gonna work on a open blockchain...what do you guys think? can bitcoin strike back? come on guys lets spew some ideas out here on how to fight back!

bitcoin can be private if you want it to be(use your imagination)bitcoin creates jobs because it opens the doors to a multitude of ideas that 'anyone' can partake in,bitcoin gives you your rights back if you have the power over your own money
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:50:11
ideally if you had someone pro do it on 'your' laptop(install the software or whatever) with you sitting right there until its done...then it impossible for them to copy anything away from you...and if unsuccessful you could take it all to someone else and try again...or worst case you still keep hold of everything and then wait for future tech to come to solve it

well if your name is attached for example buying a car...of course thats all out in the open,as it has to be...but if you wanted to buy a doobie you could just swap some bitcoin to monero or something like that lol or have some low value paperwallets for hand to hand lol idk...the doors are 'not' open to 'anyone' to partake in some business venture with fiat...as for rights just look at what you can and 'cannot' donate to or buy without having to go through or be approved by some middleman

what do people here think about moving the decimal point to the right 4 places? there would then be a max of 210 billion bitcoins,would this then not make it better for adoption because of the psychological barrier of people not ever being able to afford even just 1 bitcoin?

i did see 1 protester with a bitcoin logo on his vest
the language barrier maybe make it harder for the english to communicate that bitcoin is a powerful peaceful option for protesting?

bitcoin has the same rules for anyone anywhere
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:35:49
actually i really think it would be a good move..it solves that psychological problem of people not being able to afford even 1 bitcoin ever...also its better than having to always type in 0.000blahblahblah another psychological benefit...and even another psychological benefit is it would be easier to part with some of our bitcoins...and whenever we part with some of our bitcoins it means more people in the bitcoin world,and that is great for the whole ecosystem ))
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:31:31
this is why we need to keep bitcoin and crypto above board...its ridiculous that its so much harder to make a account at 'such'n'such' exchange than it is to make a bank account...too many hoops to jump through and people will find other avenues and then those avenues will become more and more popular...i dont think its cool that exchanges are demanding people send their id over the internet,especially pictures of themselves holding up their id(trouble down the road)...if the banks and exchanges were working together people could just walk into their bank and say please connect my account to 'such'n'such' exchange then its all done and verified...this is what seems logical to me and best chance at keeping a orderly society
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:53:45

wow thats amazing,but it makes sense..my parents said they bought a  new car about 30 yrs or so ago an it cost them 10k..last yr they bought new car and it cost them 40k,almost same style of car but it is more comfortable but burns same amount of gas which also has gone up
ok so if purchasing power of fiat is going down by 10% per yr,and bitcoin value lets say go up by 10% per yr...does that not mean that every yr bitcoin has 20% more purchasing power compared to fiat?
now 20% x 10 yrs is plus 200% on top of what the OP prediction chart is...so that means 3mil per bitcoin with inflation added in roughly regarding purchasing power

its the abnormal websites that got me into bitcoin...are you looking for approval by CNN or something?
@_date: 2019-01-09 11:48:40
it would seem to me that as bitcoin merges into the existing societies 'all' governments will have to adapt because 'any' centralized entity is at risk because of emerging technology capable of tremendous power aimed at a single centralized entity...we see this almost daily now where centralized entities get hacked and public info goes into the wrong hands
i think there is ways to collect taxes though if this is your concern...such as the common funnel points in society like land ownership,airplane rides,insurance,healthcare etc etc
as for trrorist financing that everyones seems afraid of...i agree with andreas antonopolous that the vast amount of people in the world will always do good and so trrosists will always be severely outnumbered and out teched and so making bad wishes severely handicapped

watch this documentary  you will see most the governments that were toppled by u.s in south america then installed new leaders schooled at George Washington University,and guess what Juan Guaidó is also schooled there
so it looks like the pattern is repeating again...but we just a bunch of observers and the truth is not known till after

simple,just move the decimal point to the right about 5 spots...bam! its all solved...now we got 210 billion bitcoins out there,more than enough for everyone today...but yet the entire system still has the same value upon the change...but probably more likely to be adopted

you could make a bitcoin paper wallet  but research how to make paper wallets properly
they super easy to make once you get setup
@_date: 2018-11-18 11:13:59
some machines you can cash out if they got the cash inside them...i could see this being useful for travelers or ya even lots of things,fees should be lower though 1-3% just a program running it,not much manual labour

i guess this would not take too many people to have huge effect given the nature of banks in todays form
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:21:07
it must be segwit and batching allowing it to spike way up...super cool though, i wonder how high this could go? maybe bitcoin is already sort of faster than visa if giant batches grow...2k tps is big...but what if all the large companies in the world used batching...that would be huge numbers theoretically

ya some government buying digital gold would be crazy hey...but we do know they got educated by the best and they did buy $100 dollars worth 4 yrs ago...but even more crazy will be what government will be the 'last' to buy some digital gold

how often do people talk about attack surfaces of a coin? almost never...but its very important to know about would you not agree? especially to newcomers

bitcoin is worldly...we should get used to and accept more people speaking where english is not their first language..so i give him more credit for taking on this extra challenge of communicating to most of us that only know english

and if you dont store more than say 1k in each address...its waste of time...but besides  even that if some quantum computer can make calculation to break a bitcoin address in "short" amount of time...basically we are talking to god,because can you imagine all the useful calculations that can be done that will just blow everyones mind and provide answers to things like immortality...exact amounts of "everything" on the planet etc.etc
i love tech so i hope for quantum computers...and if they break bitcoin address...well i guess we will just roll it back and re-design bitcoin...because bitcoin is adaptable 
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:20:08
theres more combinations in a bitcoin wallet than stars in the universe...now spread your bitcoin over 10 wallets or 100 wallets...thats like spreading your bitcoin over 100 universes

more time to think and donate and volunteer
when the machines take over everyones job and everyone has no job...you got any great ideas to solve that?
money should be circular...hard to imagine but it almost seems like bitcoin and its amazing abilities could solve this...for example how could anyone live off of just being a hoarder of a finite currency...they need to eat etc
lol this could be a huge debate..but we have to remember the info of the old failed ways is there for everyone to see
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:31:56
i dont think it matters how much coins is in a game...it just the value of stuff in the game would fluctuate is all
so ya some rich arabian kid could enter the game with his many game coins...but if he not good player he gonna lose them all...i think this is better actually because if he go back out an buy some more game coins he will drive price of all coins up...no pay-to-win here ))

well how can you create an ecosystem in a game world for example with bitcoin...everyone would just do all their trades outside the game and skip the devs and then there no money for development of the game or whatever you building

environmental decay and world unification may become big over the next 10 yrs...a single world medium of exchange may be very useful
i just read today antarctica is now melting at 6 times faster than in 1980's
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:47:54
bitcoin been around for 10 yrs because its safest and all open source..its a people made coin..and the 1st ...hard to beat that
complicated coins are much less secure...bitcoin is building all that complicated stuff as layers so as to keep the main chain secure and decentralized as possible
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:03:05
so lets wright an all mighty decentralized computer program that can look after future generations
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:10:39
this is what i like about bitcoin is it stands for the little guy..lots of confusion out there..but whenever someone ask a question like what i just did...someone comes up with a logical answer..and thats a sharp sword
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:59:07
ok good to know...so basically that means anyone who pulls a bitcoin fork and sells it on verified exchange will be automatically connected to their bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:05:53
nobody even knows how much gold there is in the world...hard to make calculations or predictions based on that
but if some government has say 10,000 bitcoin...they know where they stand

when has this experiment ever been conducted before in the past that you can make such a critical judgement over?
@_date: 2019-01-16 17:32:58
you use a 'hot' wallet to 'sweep' from paper(cold) wallets...but i think ill delete my advice about paper wallets cuz i dont want people getting confused about how to use paper wallets properly...probably like they say its best to get a hardware wallet...and likely in the future everything will get much easier as the tech develops 
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:13:45
forking the chain...but ya good question who would mine it...could the ingame wallets somehow act as nodes? that would be decentralized
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:44:54
does this mean competition is extreme to create bitcoins even when price go down?

so you thinking we should just keep inflating in a finite world? there is a thing called inertia..all i here from you is full steam ahead...surely that will lead to social and environmental crash
i dont think you have good ability to dream what crypto can do,such as timed money or purpose only money
get back to work,you can think more bout this on your next break ;)
@_date: 2019-01-18 23:41:40
i suggest dont put more than say about $100 on each paper wallet...safer i think if you spread over more wallets...remember always sweep 100% off each paper wallet when you bring them to a hot wallet

what MMO has a working crypto economy..and no thanks with the ICO thing either...those things are owned by whales,and will be for long time...bitcoin is already well spread around...cant beat that
i was thinking straight bitcoin as ingame currency...but then it would be easy to skip the devs of the game..so cant have that or no one will build the game...with a fork could make the coins only usable in the game
but idk for sure maybe someone else got other ideas to make it all work fair and still have a game that is always being built
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:48:52
yes no one want some crazy in the future coming after them because the exchange where they verified got hacked and all info of coin connection suddenly out there...yes people need ways to protect themselves...no rich person with fiat in bank today goes round with sign on them saying how much they worth

1.   not an industry leader but a political force already setup and gaining everyday
2. AML/KYC remove it or tweak it to prevent the largest underground movement the world is likely to ever see...if its true that cryptocurrencies cant be stopped then why chase the worlds populations into privacy coins...the outcome of that is surely to lead to more chaos than if todays current enforcement is able to monitor the population that stays above board,this seems logical to me...just imagine if some countries start to use privacy coins,thats all it gonna take for everyone to switch to privacy coins and thens theres no hope to monitor anything...but maybe this is inevitable anyways...but i would like to see a melding transition rather than a crash towards chaotic new systems...i believe vast majority of the people on earth are good and can help to self police/regulate

@_date: 2017-09-05 11:00:39
a benefit of bitcoin spread across many paper wallets is you can test a small amount out when doing such new things...for sure your bch is somewhere...'if' you ever had it ...step 1 confirm to yourself that you know that you had it

as andreas antonopolous says with bitcoin all risk is 'compartmentalized' so that means a attacker would have to make millions of separate attacks to effect millions
...but after the attacker makes 1 attack they will have sounded an alarm...that alarm gets louder and louder with each attack
i suggest dont store large wealth in 1 address...highly unlikely any attacker will go after some wallet with only $100 in it
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:32:32

maybe this is what someone with a good job or money in the bank would say...but your right this not what bitcoin is about
bitcoin is about peaceful change for the better...not burning up the streets...but still the option of bitcoin should be presented to the protesters as a peaceful option

@_date: 2019-01-07 22:16:49
you mean in game traditional currency such as most games have and call it gold or something similiar?...well because bitcoin already spread around and have huge crowd...plus it decentralized so no cheating...also can buy,sell trade them for bitcoin and then into fiat
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:12:36
but hey dude...some one can always poof up a few billion game coins on ethereum and start selling them...u like that idea better?

what i mean is can i put 500 in saftey deposit box at bank and 1k at my parents and 600 at home and 2k burried in ground etc?
is the multisig all tied to 1 passphrase?
this is what i was joking about...but ya for sure i can see multisig useful..but is it decentralized like what im jus try to explain?
'cash' itself is decentralized,because you can place it in many seperate places...same wit paper wallets
but anyways we could probably go on and on about this and that...more choice is better right?
@_date: 2019-01-14 14:45:06
this is how i see it working out...bitcoin creates incentive to chase cheap electricity,with rewards down to the democratic individual
solar power will be the cheapest energy out there=win
POW mining machines will eventually lvl off,opening up options to use them for creating heat for baseboard heaters etc,etc
heat is a battery in its essence and humanity always looking for more ways to store energy
solar city is a good thing..bitcoin as a  WORLDLY medium of exchange will dissolve borders and allow the electrical grid to span the planet thus making solar power 24/7
maybe satoshi is a super intelligent alien,so lets not toss away this gift

one currency may be smiled upon,while others may not be...but that is all up to the individual to decide
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:09:08
this is the blockchain...we need block analysis type people and exchange owners to gather the proof and fight this through legal means and raise awareness....for sure that would be a killer blow to the cartel and a good deed for the people of earth....and another thing to note is,what are the people that are selling today going to do with their money? they could easily just put it into some other altcoin...then what? is the cartel gonna just chase after everyones money and eventually just buy up all the crypto worldwide? because the only way to kill a particular crypto is they have to hold it and remove the vast majority of a coin into their control for future manipulation...if i am understanding all this right?

yes the price of houses and swords etc would fluctuate around wildly...i think that would be cool...imagine a trader on auction house could have lots of fun buying and selling...also grinders could hoard and sell at profitable times
this would not be the normal game we all used to playing...there would be many more dynamics
the game could work on 1 coin or 1 million coins it just a matter of fractions but everything would balance...and if you cant buy a sword...that sounds like a great challenge

i would like to add a 51% attack would not kill bitcoin...but it could likely kill a centralized exchange because it the only place to gather back the cost of the attack or make profit
the more people that decentralize the amount of wealth in a single wallet...the better 
also it totally possible to roll back...if the damage was huge i think people would vote for this...and then everything back to normal with lessons learned and new measures put in place
but this just is my opinion on the 51% attack talks

im talkin cheap cold storage spread over many locations
$80 is too much for many..using laptop for cold storage same thing maybe more $
paper wallets can be given away easily without passing a burdon onto others or even having to access your whole stash to give
but making them has to be done properly which is a good learning experience and almost free...im not against hardware an software an all that...but cant help get this feeling people are being forced over to pepsi and coca-cola name brands type thing...and if they go down man...that gonna hurt bitcoin ecosystem bad
paper wallets...sure maybe a few eff ups here an there...but not likely to cripple bitcoin like if everyone got their coin in pepsi and coca-cola

these still the early days man
we got solar power an it free...solar city makes total sense,bitcoin can dissolve borders and help to create grid around planet thus making solar power 24/7...miner tech will level off and 'possibly' be used for things such as baseboard heaters in homes thus making 'more' from heat and heat is good when we can control it...in its essence heat is a battery
anonymity can be done at the user end..and it will happen cuz it dont matter what or who invents a digital currency...it just not cool for everyone to know everyone elses wealth
taxation could still work if captured at the common funnel points in society,such as healthcare,plane rides,insurance,land ownership etc etc
work? robots be doin that soon man..an that leaves lot of room an brains for creativity,team work,volunteering etc

Coinbase was founded in June 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam.[6][7] Blockchain.info co-founder Ben Reeves was part of the original founding team but later parted ways with Armstrong due to a difference in how the Coinbase wallet should operate.[8] The remaining founding team enrolled in the Summer 2012 Y Combinator startup incubator program. In October 2012, the company launched the services to buy and sell bitcoin through bank transfers.[9] In May 2013, the company received a US$5 million Series A investment led by Fred Wilson from the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures.[10] In December 2013, the company received a US$25 million investment, from the venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures (USV), and Ribbit Capital.[11]
In 2014, the company grew to one million users, acquired the blockchain explorer service Blockr and the web bookmarking company Kippt, secured insurance covering the value of bitcoin stored on their servers, and launched the vault system for secure bitcoin storage.[12][13][14] Throughout 2014, the company also formed partnerships with Overstock, Dell, Expedia, Dish Network, and Time Inc. allowing those firms to accept bitcoin payments.[15][16][17][18][19] The company also added bitcoin payment processing capabilities to the traditional payment companies Stripe, Braintree, and PayPal.[20]
In January 2015, the company received a US$75 million investment, led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the New York Stock Exchange, USAA, and several banks.[21] Later in January, the company launched a U.S.-based bitcoin exchange for professional traders called Coinbase Exchange.[22] Coinbase began to offer services in Canada in 2015, but in July 2016, Coinbase announced it would halt services in August after the closure of their Canadian online payments service provider Vogogo.[23]
In May 2016, the company rebranded the Coinbase Exchange, changing the name to Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX)[24] and offering Ether, the value token of Ethereum, for trade to professionals,[25] and in July 2016, they added retail support for Ether.[26]
In January and then March 2017, Coinbase obtained the BitLicense and licensed to trade in Ethereum and Litecoin from the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS).[27][28] In November 2017, Coinbase was ordered by the US Internal Revenue Service to report any users who had at least $20,000 in transactions in a year.[29]
On February 23, 2018, Coinbase told approximately 13,000 affected customers that the company would be providing their taxpayer ID, name, birth date, address, and historical transaction records from 2013-2015 to the IRS within 21 days.[30]
On April 5, 2018, Coinbase announced that it has formed an early stage venture fund, Coinbase Ventures, focused on investment into blockchain and cryptocurrency related companies.[31][32]
On May 16, 2018, Coinbase Ventures announced its first investment in Compound Labs,[33] a start-up building Ethereum smart contracts similar to money markets.
In August 2018, Amazon cloud executive Tim Wagner joined Coinbase as vice president of engineering.[34]
In January 2019 Coinbase stopped all trading on Ethereum Classic due to suspicion on attack on the network.[35]

logic is much more important than sources(we all know sources can be manipulated on the inernet,unless your the guy out there taking the measurements)...the logic to me tells me bitcoin is driving demand for cleaner cheaper energy through its competition(everyone wants to be the guy that can fill a field full of solar powered miners) and also creating incredible tech...also we could say bitcoin has spawned all of these altcoins and will in time choose the best tech to adopt from them.....i keep thinking of these old mining rigs being put to good use such as somehow being able to scan peoples dna in search of diseases/faults as a fringe benefit to society...these are the early days,so many variables to consider

ok ill try...currently people on eth can just simply poof up as many tokens as they like then sell them all with little effort and a bit of slick words
now imagine if that same person hard forked from bitcoin so that all bitcoin holders have corresponding amount,then turn those hardforked coins into a bitcoin sidechain that somehow is pegged to bitcoin for securities sake but not value...now that person has an idea obviously such as a game or something but he/she has to have an income...so they would have to 'rake' such as a casino does...or 'funnel' such as an exchange does...i have heard this type of thing can be done,but its hard as i dont think it been done yet
anyways the whole point of this is who would do such a thing without a dang good plan,commitment or idea...no scammer gonna go through all this hassle cuz they get nothing...but the true person could still make millions...win/win for society i think

the more i think about it,the more voluntary taxation seems to be the only way of the future...if all the money goes into crypto..who gonna pay for enforcement of taxation?...but for sure most people will pay taxes on the things they believe in such as healthcare,...but ya im drawing a blank on how this is all gonna work without the world going into some chaos for a period...but ya this is the dragon...that is coming
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:44:42
i think we have discovered bitcoins weakness...or maybe its a strength(because there will be soo many bitcoin backup systems eventually...idk) ...its a capitalistic world...so i always wonder why?,and who is going to benefit? ...in all this chaos i cant help but wonder if it the  3rd party wallet developers that will somehow benefit because many individuals surely will lose some coins innocently if they not fluent and aware of these splits(are those coins lost forever?,or can they be claimed by the 3rd party wallet makers in the future?..idk)...anyways nice to hear a comment here from a big player in this new technology
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:30:51
bitcoin spread over many paper wallets that way all your bitcoins will never be exposed the internet at the same time...also some low value paper wallets are good for testing new services

because im drinking some vodka right now...i decided to find a authentic way to drink it...i discovered this    from a hollowed out pickle...unfortunatly i dont have any whole pickles so im sipping pickle juice after lol ...i will try from a hollowed out pickle soon )) edit: i just thought of something ...hollowed out pickle hodlers...sell em for bitcoin edit 2: but ya i guess you could just set the pickles in your shot glass...that would work...dang always thinkin of that multi,mega bitcoin idea
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:43:18
yep,thats a fairly good intro,but the way i did it was bought a cheap second hand laptop,formatted and installed linux on it from disc so it never go online,then i bought a dumb printer(no wifi,just very basic printer about $30) then i used  because it also has the ability to make paper wallets for many different coins an is open source,yep then i go to bitcoin atm and put in cash and send direct to paper wallets(i dont put it all on just 1 wallet,i spread over many paper wallets for extra security,plus then you never expose all your bitcoins to the net at same time)start out with just a few wallets with say $20 on each then check them on the blockchain to see it for yourself,then when you confident you can put say 100-500 on each wallet or so,whatever you like,have fun,its easy after you learn it
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:44:23
asteroid,nuclear warfare,disease epidemic,volcanic eruption,global warming leading to mass starvation and breakdown of current systems...these are a few of the things that can happen,and likely 'will' happen at anytime

there is alot of money involved,so that is why companies start exchanges...there is likely to be many more in the future

im more concerned about the survival of earth,our democratic unconscionable capitalistic system has wiped out over 50% of all nature on the planet in the last 40 yrs...on a cosmic scale this is faster than lightning to our eyes...a single leader can be replaced quickly and easily as history shows...but a false democratic capitalistic unconscionable system is sure to doom us all

@_date: 2018-11-20 07:53:00
how does change address come into use with paper wallets? everyone knows to just use paper wallets once...this is the idea 'diversify' so cold can never be destroyed by hot
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:02:25
linux yes, works over tor,bitcoin core wallet used over tor is 100% yours,no 3rd parties,cold storage spread over many paper wallets with a few low value ones for testing new systems
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:33:06
also domino effect...but ya big trader groups could have started this
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:39:22

dude,think about it,bitcoin price is down and say they bought bitcoin last week...they are at a loss right now.but of course they have to have bitcoin to sell because they have an atm..i bought all my bitcoin from an atm,and im happy,mind you it was many months ago and price is way up now...but also my bitcoins are (john doe)bitcoins,and not (your name)bitcoins
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:59:17

read my other comments i been talkin with these other guys below my original comment above...but ya its alot to take in if you new...but the essence of it is storing your bitcoin on coinbase is like letting someone else look after your money

im not sending all my info to a centralized exchange thats sure to be hacked in the future,or who knows where all my info gonna eventually end up,including a picture of me standing there holding a picture of my id up...id rather pay the extra fees to a local guy,there about now 20+ bitcoin atm's in my city an the fees are going down due to competition i think

hi luke,do you guys take regular snapshots of the blockchain? ...i got a feeling at some point in the future we may have to go back in time to rid bitcoin of the bitcoin futures trading thing if it does prove to be a weapon meant to destroy or control such as what this article is suggesting  stranger things have happened,good to have backup plans...and hopefully somebody or group is looking into this...cause for concern regarding the ability for bitcoin to remain free...i can imagine them easily doing this on a privacy coin...but with bitcoin if we can see what outfits are connected to futures trading...maybe bitcoin does have a hammer over their heads...but im not sure how all that works unfortunatly

yep,thats a fairly good intro,but the way i did it was bought a cheap second hand laptop,formatted and installed linux on it from disc so it never go online,then i bought a dumb printer(no wifi,just very basic printer about $30) then i used  because it also has the ability to make paper wallets for many different coins an is open source,yep then i go to bitcoin atm and put in cash and send direct to paper wallets(i dont put it all on just 1 wallet,i spread over many paper wallets for extra security,plus then you never expose all your bitcoins to the net at same time)start out with just a few wallets with say $20 on each then check them on the blockchain to see it for yourself,then when you confident you can put say 100-500 on each wallet or so,whatever you like,have fun,its easy after you learn it

btm's that dont ask for id are more popular for sure,also place your btm in a semi-private part of the store.you get to negotiate the price you pay to the store for having it there,if someone makes a large deposit you have remote monitor capabilities so to know if you feel like unloading it or loading more cash into it,some owners pay their machines off in 1-2 yrs,others in 1 month depend on market and location and your advertising skills,for instance my city the chinese were buying bitcoin like crazy...all btm's could not stock enough bitcoin here at 1 time,surcharge went up to nearly 20% to cover volitility,but now it back to about 8%
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:20:48
what concerns me,is if america shuts the doors on a large percentage of the population that doesnt have id all they will be doing is providing fuel for a giant underground economy and in turn this creates division internally...and division is not the way to world unity..and all the fun things for mankind that can come after...well our words are etched in stone by making comments here on reddit and the people of the future will be able to look back and see who was right or wrong

Do you think the Segwit2x hard fork agreement is good for bitcoin?
      Yes – I believe increasing the block size is needed after the introduction of SegWit  
      No – I believe SegWit is sufficient for short-term scaling
      Undecided – I do not feel strongly or negative about the proposal

you can trade with paper wallets...its just not as fast...you just send coins around with shapeshift or similiar,always using paper wallets for storage,and something like jaxx as a 'hot'wallet(only used for transfering-not storing) ...tether could be a big game changer in this aspect as for the fiat style storage ability

is this why no one has ever written a tutorial on how to make a paper wallet completely offline using dice only is because you actually need a computer for the 'algorithm' you mention that connects the private and public key together?
and if so would it be 'possible' do you think for someone to just download this 'algorithm' from a reputable source such as bitcoin.org if ever someone was to make that available and then it would just be a matter of rolling dice and input that into the safe 'algorithm' to receive the other other end private or public however that works? and then boom a totally safe wallet has been made for free
like seriously how can the Venz for example safely store their bitcoin if they only make less than $5 per month and all the people on reddit are telling them they need to spend $100+ for a hardware wallet

you will need to swipe your paper wallet into a 'hot' wallet,then from the hot wallet you can send it wherever you want,then when finished send the change from the 'hot' wallet back to a new paper wallet...jaxx works good for a 'hot' wallet as they dont store 'any' info or ask for 'any' sign up hassles ..p.s 'hot' wallet means you dont use it to store your coins in...just use it for doing transfers

actually coinbase is a weak spot for bitcoin in regards to security and the 'potential' for bad press for bitcoin,they are centralized and vulnerable to hacks,glitches,bans or freezes...the best thing coinbase could do is somehow decentralize themselves...but then again they are owned by bankers so who knows what their 'real' agenda is

the OP is going from paper to hardware,so maybe it also worth considering to go back to paper(with some) but instead use 'many' paper wallets (paper wallets have little cost)

bitcoin was probably a gift from some alien species,given to us so the world will unite and not destroy all the innocent life on the planet   many great futurists are thinking the reason we may not be seeing any signs of intelligent life out there is because most civilizations destroy themselves first...look at earth...we have destroyed 50% of all nature on the planet in the last 40 yrs!!!!!  -

coinbase is owned by the banks--- history, copy/paste from wiki: ----Coinbase was founded in June 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam.[5][12] It enrolled in the Summer 2012 Y Combinator startup incubator program. In October 2012, the company launched the services to buy and sell bitcoin through bank transfers.[13]
In May 2013, the company received a US$5 million Series A investment led by Fred Wilson from the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures.[14] In December 2013, the company received a US$25 million investment, from the venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital.[15]
In 2014, the company grew to one million users, acquired the blockchain explorer service Blockr and the web bookmarking company Kippt, secured insurance covering the value of bitcoin stored on their servers, and launched the vault system for secure bitcoin storage.[16][17][18] Throughout 2014, the company also formed partnerships with Overstock, Dell, Expedia, Dish Network, Time Inc., and Wikipedia to power accepting bitcoin payments.[19][20][21][22][23] The company also added bitcoin payment processing capabilities to the traditional payment companies Stripe, Braintree, and PayPal.[24]
In January 2015, the company received a US$75 million investment, led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the New York Stock Exchange, USAA, and several banks, "apparently the first time any traditional financial institutions have taken direct stakes in a bitcoin enterprise".[25] Later in January, the company launched a U.S.-based bitcoin exchange for professional traders called Coinbase Exchange.[26]
In May 2015 there was controversy around reports on Reddit that Coinbase had asked a user to describe how they were spending their bitcoin; the Daily Dot reported on the matter, and received a statement from Coindesk stating: "We don’t comment on specific cases, however, Coinbase is required to monitor activity on its platform in accordance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other regulation governing all Money Service Businesses.”; the Daily Dot noted that Coindesk is obligated to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, which prevents money laundering, in order to operate as an exchange.[27]
Coinbase began to offer services in Canada in 2015, but in July 2016, Coinbase announced it would halt services in August after the closure of their Canadian online payments service provider Vogogo.[28]
On 29 March 2016, Coinbase was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 2 in the list of 100 Most Influential Blockchain Organisations.[29][30]
In May 2016, the company rebranded the Coinbase Exchange, changing the name to the Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX)[31] and offering Ether, the value token of Ethereum, for trade on its professional trading exchange service.[32] In July 2016, they extended the support to their "Coinbase" retail exchange by adding Ether as only the second digital currency offered to retail customers.[33]
On 17 January 2017, Coinbase obtained the Bitlicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services, which authorizes the company continuing virtual currency business operations in New York.[34]
On March 2017, Coinbase received from the New York Department of Financial Services the approval to offer trading of Ethereum and Litecoin currencies in New York.[35]

something dont seem right about this story
just about every wallet has a QR generator in it,so if 4 out of 5 are scams then there would be thousands of people talking about this...but yet never heard nothing until this story pops up
i dont know who would send to an address without comparing some random spots of the numbers and i never seen any mistakes yet
sure the possibility is there if you dont compare some of the numbers before hitting send or if you send to a QR code that dont show any numbers just the QR
someone should investigate whoever made this story,it seems like a clickbait fear story loaded with adds

actually usa is desperate to export their dollar...its the only way they can make room to print more money at home,without causing runaway inflation...there is so much us dollar out there they sometimes give it away to the strangest things...they are in a tuff situation...if they cant print money the interest on the debt would cripple the government(idk exactly,maybe they pay about 1 billion per day or more just on the interest to pay the debt,printed money borrowed from future generations)...if they cant print money,how can they fund their giant war machine?)...and the other scary part is if parts of the world ever decide to send american dollars back to usa,i.e america becomes an exporter rather than an importer...there would be soo much money in usa...the american dollar becomes worth less and less)...even if some other fiat currency becomes the world leader...it would equal the same eventual result...its a self destructive system,designed to make a 'few' rich and powerful along its path

32: you missed this one   basically the question is asked "are bitcoin futures a weapon meant to tame or destroy?" here is my radical idea...we do a hardfork back to the days before bitcoin futures was introduced....or we hard fork right today,take all those bitcoin futures wallets and divide them among all the remaining wallets! ...its an open blockchain right...maybe this could be done...even if it is an altcoin,it could be a great experiment.

ok imagine this scenario: 
the financial elite with their infinite fiat bought and bought bitcoin driving the price to 20k all the while knowing they would soon be introducing bitcoin futures,once they had enough manipulative power in bitcoin they started selling back and forth to each other driving the price down while at the same time investing in bitcoin futures(downside) this way they are holding their bitcoin AND pulling money from the outside world of those that believe in bitcoin...what would be their next step? ..i would guess a gradual bad feeling pushed throughout the media about bitcoin and crypto currencies while they figure how to do the killing blow of a worldwide ban...but guess what the cats out of the bag! we now know all bitcoin has to do is a hardfork to stop this takeover destroy attempt...and guess what else? the hodlers are going to be happier than heck because we gonna all get those bitcoins the financial elite are hoarding!! snapshot!! this would be impossible to stop on a privacy coin,but this also shows the power of an open blockchain can also have power over those that rule today be them good or bad and at some point in the future hold them accountable...and possibly the good get rewarded.

coinbase would know if you could get a straight answer from them before you get old,check the faq in coinbase to start...the other way to do it would be to send to a hot wallet such as jaxx...and then send to your destination...but it will cost you 1 more miner fee,so you will have to add in the approx miner fee when send to jaxx so you still have enough to send final payment and then not have change left in jaxx hot wallet...unless you plan to use the jaxx wallet other times then it np to leave a little in there for next time you use it

america was transporting weapons in passenger ships,germans warned not to do that in american newspapers,so it is suspect america sacrificed its own people to join the war...remember germany didnt want to get in the war either even b4 this but it all started from its allies at the time...ww2 after effects of ww1 of people being born upon war and power which of course had to be put down...but remember japs were in surrender mode and those bombs didnt have to be dropped....too much typing to talk bout korea up to afghan and beyond..but i think i have showed the trajectory of america trying to force its will upon the world...america military bases all over the world is so it can continue its rule with the prize being russia (and many other slave states) as it has 30% of worlds natural resources and lives within its means(doesnt borrow from future generations)...what im trying to say is war/force of will breeds more war..you can imagine that even in a small room of people...it wont stop until everyone agrees on peace and acceptance of others...many people are holding grenades now in this small room .....and the indebted ...children/grandchildren... will suffer IF peace is reached...high price to pay when there can be only 1 sensible outcome

ya i notice that too...i think the first page where you mouse around is meant for single use and it also prints instructions etc,the paper wallet tab is more meant for if you want to print many wallets and clicking the generate button randomizes you a new wallet internally rather than with the mouse as a start to the randomness...i generate 3-7 wallets then print 1,generate 1-5 more then print 1 sorta thing to add extra randomness jus in case something was wrong then unknowns would have to theoretically break every wallet just in order to get the ones that i actually print...maybe this will help you feel better ))

best cold storage is paper wallets or offline hardware wallets.selling your coins has some risk knowing there is big powerful entities playing the game now that can spin on a dime,for example say price starts to go up and very few are willing to sell coins expecting it to go to 3-5k or something,also exchanges are making it harder for regular people to be able to fully rely on them.if you believe in the bitcoin core team follow their advice on what you as a miner can do...these are just my suggestions for you ))

the bug only applies to those that let others remote access your computer,or if you leave coins in the wallet and someone got into your wallet while it still connected to your same ip...jaxx is meant to be used as a hot wallet...just delete the jaxx wallet after everytime you use it,it makes for good habit that way cuz you leave no evidence on your comp,then jus download a fresh version when you need to use it

my theory on why they gonna clamp down an regulate in usa.---america needs to keep the us dollar going out of the country,if the us dollar ever comes back into usa at great quantity it will create hyper-inflation,and america wont be able to print more money without also increasing hyper-inflation-----hence regulation on cryptos will keep america dollars going out of the country---not good for the people,but good for the government and the fiat printing machine,all in order to continue producing weapons to scare the world with their push button warfare tactic..i could go on and on..sry for jarbled theory haha

well i guess im just gonna conclude that big trader groups are again trying to shake coins out of weak hands,and also encourage more folks to join into the crypto world..and the reason for their attempt to swing all the coins at same time is because it somehow keeps most of the control in their hands..haha ))

maybe click 'paper wallet'...not 'single wallet'
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:45:20
this is why you test it out with small amounts first...but yes contact the owner,you should have a receipt of proof from the machine...i usually put about $100 per paper wallet,and 1 time i did a few buys and the last one did not go through...so i phoned the owner,told him the transaction numbers from the receipt,and he told me what happened is the wallet that the bitcoin atm uses ran out of bitcoin...so what he did is send the bitcoin to my wallet when he got some more bitcoins...he was cool about it all..it worked out...but ya if you gonna do some big purchases,you should phone the owner first to find out if they have enough bitcoin...maybe this will help you

yes,and notice how some the ones pumping this story are 0 day redditors
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:38:31
big money has no problem dealing with exchanges because they are super organized with their paperwork...as for the regular guy that makes a mistake on his/her application...that can cause lots of problems for them and possibly be cast into the bin of less priority...regular people really should use other entry/exit points such as bitcoin atms,localbitcoins bisq(formally bitsquare) etc etc...and that also helps the industry thats meant for regular people
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:10:23
for many its the only way to buy bitcoin,the high fees are to cover their a$$e$ in the event of sharp price drops(as most owners pre-buy their coins making them instantly accessable)...the good thing is it encourages more people to get into the btm business which equals more access to the day to day user and eventually fees will come down as more atms spring up creating competition among btm owners...also if you do it right you get the very powerful anonymity purchase(i.e direct to paper,no phone)
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:29:43

but whatever if your malicious it likely to come back on you at some point in life...or after

a wallet is simply a potential place to store and access your funds,a paper wallet is truly offline in the simplest fashion,only you and the random wallet generator are the only 2 possible connections to this creation,hardware wallets and online wallets increase the possible connections to the creation of the wallet.some simple hardware wallets may be just as safe in the creation of the wallet,but the difference being when connecting back to access your funds with a hardware wallet you potentially expose all of your wealth as compared to paper wallets.others can correct me here as i dont use any hardware wallets so i dont know about the latest and best of them.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:55:52

well i strongly believe teamwork is the powerhouse of the world..people say war creates iphones and satellites,but i see those words as a trick'.look at fraternities going all the way back to the middle ages a brotherhood that goes to extreme lengths to keep the brotherhood together throughout their lives...now imagine if you part of that brotherhood you would know that creating divisiveness is how to overcome your obstacles and you can sit back with your team and just naturally all your obstacles will be weak compared to your team
the bcash thing was something that just simply had to happen a real live experiment undertaken by a small group...but we know now bitcoin is near impossible to kill even if somehow shut down for years it would be picked back up because the blueprint is everywhere saying exactly who owns what...it could be easily rebuilt...and people would do it because its their value
we could almost be thankful bcash wasnt built by the current powerhouse team...this is what bitcoin faces is an ancient team...and im not even saying they bad,it is natural thing come upon the earth..but it seems now that bitcoin is here everyone gonna have to play by the same rules
hate takes energy and many waste it until they expire...
i would like to see all the coins work together and use bitcoin as the anchor...actually i think this is inevitable,but sooner is better and safer for everyone because the tricks..so many followers round here with venom dripping out their mouths is just not cool...especially for newcomers to see

also we cant forget some entities can access infinite amounts of money under some gauze...and keep it secret,other than the effects

go for a model that doesnt ask for id,also set it up in a safe enviroment,but in a semi private part of the shop or whatever so a person can feel comfortable using it especially if they bring in lots of cash )), its helpful to have a little table beside the btm,maybe also look into if the model has the ability to upgrade so someday maybe be able to buy litecoin with it

shapeshift.io is definatly bitcoin related,or do i need to repost with some 'bitcoin' word in the title in order to discuss bitcoin related subjects
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:59:04
bitcoin easier,just go to a btm put in 50 get the printed receit,take that receit and trade it 
or if you alrdy got bitcoins could shapeshift style x amount onto a paper wallet then trade it
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:09:20
print some paper wallets at home on safe computer then go to atm and buy a small amount on a few paper wallets try it out see what u think learn the steps

the fringe benefits i can imagine would be cheaper solar panels for everyone,electrical independance,more secure electrical grid and the big obvious one 'clean energy')).other more secondary benefits the miners could utilize would be selling heat or just using it themselves

i dont know how important this is,but i was thinking maybe it be a good idea these guys that introduce the new code on aug 1st ish have security and cameras during that critical time...idk just for safety...as seems like a critical time,an maybe a potential weak spot...just a thought
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:05:13
ya that feels right ))
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:30:55
hmmm...so bitcoin would then be the most useful thing for all these other coins because it the only way those coins can turn themselves into fiat value...ok we getting somewhere,but it also i would think make bitcoin even more useful because it the doorway for all the other coins...is this not a very positive aspect for bitcoin?

all the wallets would be safe because they are all seperate protected by extreme randomness,maybe possibly the network would stop until the problem is fixed
