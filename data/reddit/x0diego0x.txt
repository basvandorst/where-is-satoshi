I've seen this movie before.

No. Unless something changes on the encryption method. But we're still some years away from functional quantum computers cracking codes.

Woah. It sounds great. It would be great to have one here in Chile. I even would do it, if I had the money to make a startup :(

Keep saying that to yourself. I want to change the world as much as  you do, but I won't become a martyr. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 17:10:46
Figuratively speaking.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:16:36
Yea. Right now I'm using bitcoin as a long term saving tool. I'm too optimistic though, I hope I'm right. I know you too. ;)
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:25:49
Can this be a thing, please?
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:14:01
You don-t want precedents for centralization.
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:04:31
Gotta wait for decentralised VPN services. Would that be be even possible?
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:22:20
Faster transactions that will compromise one of the main features of BTC, which is decentralization.

He already wrote a letter.
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:20:04
Come on man, I didin't know that reference, but it sure sounded like a joke.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:43:36
Sorry, too much exitement.
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:51:32
fuck fuck fuck fuck

Can I travel to Venezuela and live like a king forever with 50k USD?
@_date: 2016-11-08 08:39:41
If it is bad for traditional finances, then it's good for BTC.
Trump will bring volatility to the markets, Hillary will make them grow. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:41:51
Does this uses blockchain technology?
@_date: 2016-11-10 05:52:51
Using bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:38:14
How about services? Electricity, water, internet and all those nice things? 
@_date: 2016-11-08 03:51:42

That poll is stupid. Only the first 250 will vote for 0,01 to them and obviously the rest will vote for the other alternative.
@_date: 2016-11-10 05:54:12
That's still a lot of money though. Good for you!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:37:58
It won't stabilize bc there isn't a central bank. Stable currencies need external intervention to be so. Waving currencies on the other hand, are the future. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 11:35:19
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:34:58
No. They stabilize it with an unsustainable method that eventually pops somewhere in the economy.

I live in Chile. A country that's slowly but surely going left. 
For the people that doesn't know, we had something called the "chilean miracle". It consisted of a series of policies, during Pinochet's dictatorship, made to activate the economy. It worked, our coutry went full neo-liberalist, we had more consumption, access to credit, we even joint the OECD. All green economy indicators, we even had it easy during the 2008 crisis. 
Well, as I said at the beginning our goverment is going hard to the left, and the ugly populist left. People strikes, citizen groups organize and demand for better conditions, and the goverment says yes to almost all of them. This is going full retarded, imho. The populist policies that they are taking are irresponsible and unsustainable. 
The question is: Is this the perfect scenario for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to arise?
@_date: 2015-07-12 08:47:00
Good enough to understand the route that the goverment is taking. Good enough to understand that inflation is coming.
 I'm all ears, maybe you can add something up to this incomplete, but useful summary.
@_date: 2016-09-14 05:45:34
Well said.
@_date: 2016-09-14 05:44:46
I think this man diserves it.
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:48:41
Yea, I'd take my money out of the exchanges to my personal wallet.
@_date: 2015-10-20 18:31:53
More of this coming in the next years. In small margin businesses they can't afford to not use a technology that allows you to cut spending.
@_date: 2015-10-23 03:09:27
Any guide for fools on how to start an profitable exchange?
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:34:25
Omg, this is genius. Please deliver OP.
